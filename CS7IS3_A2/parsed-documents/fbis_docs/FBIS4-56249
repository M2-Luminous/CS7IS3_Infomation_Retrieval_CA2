The MBL belongs to the governing coalition. It was represented at Government House today by Deputies Max Fernandez and Juan del Granado. Del Granado explained why the MBL had come to Government House to speak to the president of the Republic. First he mentioned the MBL's support for the executive branch. [Begin Del Granado recording] We came to say three things which, I believe, were welcomed by the constitutional president. First, we expressed the MBL's support for the president and the government in view of this very difficult moment; second, we voiced our deep concern over this obvious difficulty in solving a conflict that affects and concerns everyone of us; and third, we expressed the MBL's belief that the government must adopt a more flexible stance so that, stemming from the president's social awareness, we may find a solution for Bolivia. [end recording] The Solidarity Civic Union, headed by Max Fernandez, which is another Nationalist Revolutionary Movement government partner, voiced its concern through Deputy Jaime Ponce over the social crisis the country is enduring. [Begin Ponce recording] I have repeatedly said it is regrettable that this problem cannot be solved due to the lack of clear dialogue between the two parties. I believe dialogue is feasible when the two parties -- the government and the social sectors -- are willing to negotiate. Violence leads nowhere. I am very worried about the way in which the Bolivian democratic stabilization process is developing. Every Bolivian citizen will be affected if democracy is destabilized because we would return to the dictatorships or tyrannies that ruled in the past. I do not want to return to the past. This is why we are upholding an open dialogue and want the government to explore the possibilities, within the framework of the national budget, of solving the workers salary problem.
