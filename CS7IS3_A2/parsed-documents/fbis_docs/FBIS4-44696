That is the reason why, in 1989, a start was made on the so-called Sciamachy project. Sciamachy stands for "Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Cartography." The project includes the development and construction of an instrument which can measure very precisely the ozone and other trace gases in the atmosphere. If everything goes according to plan, the Sciamachy instrument will be placed on ESA's (European Space Agency) ENVISAT-1 satellite. The satellite, equipped with Sciamachy, must be launched in 1998. Satellites Satellites play an essential role in research into the atmosphere. Measurements carried out in space are very attractive because they make it possible to study the atmosphere at random places above the surface of the earth. Moreover, space platforms provide the possibility to carry out simultaneous measurements with instruments that complement each other. Results obtained via these measurements can then be compared more easily with each other, and the findings are more reliable. Because even the smallest trace particles influence the atmosphere, researchers need to demand high standards for the measuring sensitivity of their instruments. Advantages The problem, for instance, with measuring the local ozone layer is that local concentrations of ozone not only undergo many daily changes but also seasonal changes. The concentration also varies according to the latitude. The determination of annual trends therefore requires both long-term and accurate measurement, which is where the great advantages of using Sciamachy come into play. Sciamachy can perform continuous measurements for many years. In addition, a particular point is that this instrument can carry out measurements of unprecedented exactitude. Sciamachy will be able to measure the precise composition of the atmosphere to a very high degree of accuracy, both vertically (looking down perpendicularly) and horizontally (looking along the atmosphere). Expectations are high: observations carried out with Sciamachy will play a very important role in the understanding of the chemical composition of the atmosphere and of its eventual changes. Together Observation of the earth is very costly. The Sciamachy project is a joint project between the Netherlands and Germany and costs some 170 million Dutch guilders [G]. The Netherlands' share of this is G75 million. In constructing this instrument, Germany and the Netherlands are in fact contributing in kind to the ESA [European Space Agency] earth observation program. The Ministry of Education and Science is paying G34 million, that of Economic Affairs G22 million, while the Ministry of Housing, Planning and Environment is paying G19 million. It is the first time that the last-mentioned ministry has been involved in a large earth observation project, because environmental and climate research will both benefit from Sciamachy. Netherlands management for the project rests with the Netherlands Institute for Aircraft Development and Space Travel (NIVR), while their German counterpart is DARA (the German Agency for Space Exploration Matters). At the end of March 1994 the two countries will sign a memorandum of understanding, to emphasize once again their positive collaboration on the project.
