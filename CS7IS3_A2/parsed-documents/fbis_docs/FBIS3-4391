At the meeting, CPPCC members talked freely and suggested ways and means for making the province strong. Provincial Leaders Cheng Weigao, Ye Liansong, Li Bingliang, and Guo Hongqi conscientiously heard the CPPCC members' opinions at the meeting. Present at the meeting were Li Wenshan, chairman of the provincial party committee; Zhang Runshen, Wang Shusen, Huang Feng, Zhao Huichen, Ma Xinyun, Yu Zhenzhong, Chen Hui, and Zhao Yan, vice chairmen of the provincial CPPCC committee; Li Wenzao, secretary general of the provincial CPPCC committee; and Wang Jian, Yuan Qinghe, and Zhang Xu, principal responsible persons of the provincial democratic parties and mass organizations. CPPCC members Yu Zhenzhong, Gao Daoshen, Tian Zhijie, Li Debao, Zhang Jiashu, Chen Hui, Zhang Mugang, Wei Hua, and Zhang Xu made speeches in succession. Their subjects were related to industrial and agricultural production, education, improvement of administrative honesty, and development of private and individual sectors of the economy. They affirmatively made opinions and suggestions on setting up the modern enterprise system, urgently cultivating modern entrepreneurs, further intensifying the dynamics of halting the deficits of money-losing industrial enterprises, processing of farm and sideline products, promoting "high-yield, high-efficiency, and good-quality" agriculture, not being an educationally weak province at the time of building an economically powerful province, strengthening the improvement of administrative honesty, and deeply and constantly waging the struggle against corruption. Cheng Weigao maintained that the CPPCC members made good and accurate criticisms, analyses, and suggestions and also expressed his views on each and every member's speech. He agreed to the members' viewpoints and maintained that we still have to rely on outstanding entrepreneurs in order to develop good products and achieve technological transformation. With good entrepreneurs, enterprises will be able to make faster development and their staff and workers' living standards and benefits will be greatly improved. He pointed out: An entrepreneur who is not competent for his job at one plant must not be transferred to another. A plant director must not act as a secretary when he fails to act well as a plant director. From now on, in line with the regulations as stipulated in the law governing companies, companies should set up boards of directors and invite, through a selective process, plant directors and managers. Those who are responsible for enterprises' bankruptcy will lose the qualifications for being invited as enterprise leaders for several years. The situation of not awarding those with contributions to enlivening enterprises and assuming no responsibility for the poor management of enterprises must be changed. The departments concerned should positively cultivate entrepreneurs when entrepreneurs should upgrade their abilities and quality in the course of competition. Cheng Weigao also said: The enterprises' complete and partial suspension of operation due to losses affects economic development and social stability. There are many factors for enterprise losses. Thus, the governments at various levels should go deep to the grass roots to conduct investigation and study among enterprises one after another to seek ways and make countermeasures. In regard to a CPPCC member's opinions on developing high- efficiency agriculture, Cheng Weigao said: An important factor for increasing agriculture's economic results and peasants' income is to achieve intensive processing of farm and sideline products. The peasants cannot become fairly well-off if they only develop grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops. By developing grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, they can only become sufficient in food and clothes. So, it is necessary to develop intense processing of forest fruits, melons, vegetables, livestock products, aquatic products, and farm and sideline products. The key to developing processing of farm and sideline products is to develop markets, to link international markets with domestic ones, and to take markets as a lead to promote the development of processing and cropping industries. In line with a CPPCC member's opinion on accelerating technological transformation among large and medium-sized chemical industrial enterprises, Cheng Weigao said: Chemical industry, as a pillar industry and a key trade of our province, has brought our province's advantages into play and helped promote the readjustment of the province's industrial structure. However, chemical fertilizers account for a larger proportion in the province's chemical industrial trade when the chemical industrial raw materials and fine chemical industry account for an excessively small proportion. This is a problem. Our province has no large-scale petrochemical industrial enterprises but only a few salt chemical industrial enterprises. We have not yet made a start or a breakthrough in developing the coal chemical industry. The chemical industrial trade has to launch several big battles and firmly develop key capital construction and technological transformation projects. Chemical fertilizer enterprises should also develop "chemical-based fertilizers and combine fertilizers with chemicals." Cheng Weigao paid attention to a CPPCC member's opinion on attaching importance to education in the course of building an economically powerful province, and also stressed the necessity to increase input in education and to conduct educational reform. In regard to the issue of opposing corruption and advocating administrative honesty, Cheng Weigao said: Last year, we conscientiously attended to the work in this regard and made appropriate achievements. This year, we should make unswerving efforts to attend to it in a better and firmer manner. In regard to the issue of opening to the outside world, Cheng Weigao stressed: Hebei should fully use the advantages of Beijing and Tianjin to develop the export-oriented economy. The key to developing the export-oriented economy is to create a good investment environment, particularly an intangible environment, for foreign traders. It is necessary to stress reputation and efficiency, to offer good service, and to upgrade the quality of the Chinese cooperation partners. Cheng Weigao readily agreed to the suggestion on accelerating the development of private and individual sectors of the economy. He said: Government departments equally treat state-owned, collective, individual, and private enterprises according to the market economy's requirements. The CPPCC members have conscientiously played the functions for political consultation and democratic supervision and provided many affirmative opinions and suggestions for the party and the government. On behalf of the provincial party committee and government, I express heartfelt thanks to them. Governor Ye Liansong conscientiously heard the CPPCC members' speeches, made written instructions on each and every member's opinions and suggestions, and transmitted the instructions to relevant departments and leaders for conscious study and implementation. Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Gao Daoshen's opinion on halting the deficits of industrial enterprise read: From the beginning of the year, the provincial, city, prefectural, and county committees for foreign economic relations and trade (economic commissions) and the departments in charge of enterprise work should strengthen the dynamics of halting deficits and work out different deficit-halting measures for different enterprises. The provincial government may organize personnel of the committees for foreign economic relations and trade, industrial departments and bureaus, and industrial and economic federations; and sent them deep to Handan, Xingtai, and the cities, prefectures, and enterprises with prominent problems to conduct on-the-spot investigation and study and to solve the problems on the spot. Ye Liansong's written instructions on CPPCC Member Zhang Mugang's opinions, made on behalf of the provincial Chinese peasants and workers democratic party, on strengthening the improvement of administrative honesty and deeply and constantly waging the struggle against corruption read: CPPCC member Zhang Mugang's speech is very good. We should unswervingly grasp the improvement of administrative honesty and the struggle against corruption. I will ask Comrade Youhui to transmit this to the supervisory department for conscientious study and realistic implementation. Wang Manqiu, vice chairman of the provincial CPPCC committee, chaired today's meeting.
