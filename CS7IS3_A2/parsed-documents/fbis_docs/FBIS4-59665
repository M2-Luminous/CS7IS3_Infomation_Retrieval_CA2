The source also denied that any units of the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization or any of their men had surrendered as claimed by self-deluded military sources in Sanaa. The responsible source at the Ministry of Defense said the forces of unity, democracy, and modernization were fighting heroic defensive battles in the direction of the Karish-al-Rahidah area. They were registering immortal results and achieving sweeping victories about which we need not boast as is done by the news media of the criminal gang of al-Ahmar. It concerns us to confirm, however, to our Yemeni people and Arab and international public that we are fighting a battle to defend our people's dignity and hordes and their right to a free and decent life. Our forces are resisting with rare courage and bravery beyond description the barbaric hordes pushed by the al-Ahmar gang into the option of: the enemy is before you and the sea is behind you. We have only one option: a free and decent life. Victory is our ally and God is great.
