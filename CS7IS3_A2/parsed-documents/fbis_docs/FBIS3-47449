Spero, U.S. under secretary of state for economic and agricultural affairs, speaking on the Japan-U.S. framework trade talks, said: "There are priority areas such as government procurement, automobiles, and auto parts. After enactment of the political reform bills, we would like the Japanese Government to shift its attention and work on these priorities." She made the request during a meeting with Yukio Hatoyama, deputy chief cabinet secretary, at the prime minister's official residence on the same day. In response, Hatoyama, while maintaining that setting numerical targets is unacceptable, said: "I feel that it is possible for Japan and the United States to hold talks to work out something that is acceptable to both sides."
