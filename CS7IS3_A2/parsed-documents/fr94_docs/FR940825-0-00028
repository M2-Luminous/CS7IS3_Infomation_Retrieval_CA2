FR940825-0-00028 FR940825-0-00005 Farmers Home Administration 7 CFR Part 1924 RIN 0575_AB27 Planning and Performing Construction and Other Development AGENCY: Farmers Home Administration, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) amends its regulations to comply with the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Public Law 102&hyph;486. This Act requires that thermal standards for new construction of Single Family Housing (SFH) (other than manufactured homes) subject to mortgages insured, guaranteed, or made by the Secretary of Agriculture under Title V of the Housing Act of 1949 meet or exceed the requirements of the Council of American Building Officials (CABO) Model Energy Code, 1992 (MEC&hyph;92). Therefore, for new construction of SFH (other than manufactured homes) FmHA adopts the thermal requirements contained in the 1992 edition of the MEC. The CABO/MEC&hyph;92 requirements are comparable to the FmHA thermal requirements for new SFH construction. FmHA is not changing its requirements for Multi-family Housing (MFH) programs. FmHA field offices were notified of the changes required by this Act prior to October 22, 1993. Temporary changes were issued to all FmHA field offices on December 7, 1993 and April 28, 1994 implementing this change. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective October 22, 1993.
