It has also presented a scenario whereby they no longer need to be new pawns of the great power's chess board. Even this, there is no need then for the United States, the only remaining superpower in the world, to have a physical presence here. No doubt U.S. security is necessary in Asia-Pacific, but America can play this role in other ways. As Defense Minister Datuk Sri Mohamed Najib pointed out, it could, for instance, take the form of technology transfer. It could also include defense information and access to state-of-the-art training. This, for instance, could help Malaysia in its effort to modernize its defense capabilities. The U.S. currently does not have a permanent military base in Southeast Asia. Some argue that with its drawdown of the U.S. forces and the breakup of the former USSR, there will be new powers which fill the void. It would appear in the international media that China is to be made up as the new future threat to regional security. This perception is inaccurate, for China is now concentrating more on developing its much neglected economy. To China, its economic prosperity, which is partly tied to the region, is in itself a high spirit for the country. It is also currently involved in various dialogues, whether bilateral or multi-lateral, in the region. This is a good reflection of China's desire to be engaged in the continuous process of achieving regional peace and prosperity. The South China Sea has often been described as the region's future flash point. Rather than adhering to the old mentality, the time has come to look to the area as an opportunity for cooperation, not confrontation. Most Asia-Pacific countries have no desire to stir the hornet's nest, but rather like to cooperate with each other. Therefore, the old Cold War mindset that the U.S. must have a permanent base here is no longer valid. In contrast, U.S. presence should be based on gaining access to facilities in the region based on the principle of mutual benefit. There is no doubt that Asia-Pacific is one the fastest growing economic regions in the world. The stake for the maintenance of peace and regional stability is, therefore, economic prosperity. It is indeed a high stake for all the countries. As such, efforts must be geared towards ensuring the region remains prosperous so that peace would prevail. No doubt there are some security problems in the region. This is why as much as economic cooperation is important, it is equally important to establish political ties. Only when a relationship is based on a comprehensive foundation will it be solid and able to flourish. This is what Asia-Pacific should strive for. Member countries have the capacity to turn conflicts and confrontations into peace and cooperation. It should no longer be influenced by outside powers. It is about time the region charts its own destiny.
