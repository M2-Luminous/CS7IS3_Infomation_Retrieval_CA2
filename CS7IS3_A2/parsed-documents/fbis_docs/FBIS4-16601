Inese Birznietse, the Saeima human rights commission chairperson, explained that the amendments passed in accordance with the rules provided for by Article 81... apply to persons who arrived in Latvia illegally, and have been passed with an eye to improving the procedure for their expulsion from the country. The amendments to the law were fully agreed on with the CSCE mission but their final version have not been passed in Latvia, for which reason it has been impossible today to find out exactly what the expulsion procedure is and how one can appeal against it. Still, according to Birznietse, mass deportations are out of the question because the amendments also contain a reservation that they are not applicable to persons whose legal status in Latvia has not been determined and in whose regard legislation has so far not been brought into line.
