FR940825-1-00126 FR940825-1-00009 Currently, in order to be eligible to receive a grant under section 105, a recipient must meet the definition of an air pollution control agency specified in section 302(b) of the Act. This definition includes ``[a]n agency of an Indian tribe.'' See section 302(b)(5). Thus, section 302(b)(5) authorizes 105 grants to Tribes that have not established their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States. The Act expressly provides that until the promulgation of these regulations, EPA may continue to provide section 105 grants to eligible Tribes on this basis. See section 301(d)(5). EPA believes that section 301(d)(5) was intended to ensure that Tribes would be able to receive financial assistance while this regulation was being developed. The Agency does not believe that this provision, which on its face is designed to ensure Tribal access to funds, must be read to require that EPA cease awarding section 105 grants to Tribes not meeting the eligibility requirements after this regulation is issued. Consistent with this legal interpretation, this regulation provides two avenues for Tribes to obtain section 105 assistance. A Tribe that does not establish eligibility for treatment in the same manner as a state under section 301 but that is ``an agency of an Indian tribe,'' and therefore meets the definition of an ``air pollution control agency'' under section 302(b)(5), can obtain 105 funds, subject to the same limitations that apply to other 105 grant recipients. These limitations include the statutory requirement that the grant recipient contribute matching funds for 40% of the allowable project costs. Alternatively, Tribes that establish their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as States under section 301(d) may, like States, receive section 105 financial assistance. However, assistance to Tribes pursuant to 301(d) can be provided without being subject to every limitation that applies to such grants when made to States. Section 301(d)(4) expressly provides that, in cases where it is not appropriate to treat Tribes as identical to States, EPA ``may provide, by regulation, other means by which the [Agency] will directly administer such provisions so as to achieve the appropriate purpose.'' EPA believes that requiring the 40% match as a prerequisite for assistance under section 105 could impose an undue financial burden on Tribes; the Agency further believes it can best administer section 105 to achieve the purpose of maximizing tribal access to this assistance by providing relief from the cost share requirement. However, based on statutory language, this special relief will, as noted above, only be available for Tribes that have established their eligibility to be treated in the same manner as states and therefore are eligible for financial assistance pursuant to section 301(d). This proposal seeks comments on the appropriate level of Tribal cost share for a section 105 grant match, from a minimum of 5% to a maximum of 40%. This proposal also seeks comments on the establishment of a phase-in period for Tribes to meet whatever match is ultimately required for section 105 grants. A 40% match of air grant funds under section 105 is currently required from States. However, when these air grants were originally awarded some 25 years ago, a 25% State match was required. Given the lack of Tribal financial resources, there is concern that even this lower level of Tribal match may not be appropriate in many instances. In addition, the Agency believes it may be appropriate to allow a Tribe establishing eligibility to be treated in the same manner as a state to begin receiving 105 assistance with a lower match, which would gradually be phased upward until it reaches some appropriate level. During the development of the regulation, EPA discussed the option of developing a sliding scale, with differing levels of match based on tribal demonstrations of ability to pay. This option is not being proposed in this regulation, due to the Agency's concern that requiring some tribes to pay a higher match than others could create barriers to participation by those tribes, and that all tribes experience resource constraints. The Agency also recognizes that its approach should be consistent with President Clinton's April 29 Presidential Memorandum on ``Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments.'' 59 FR 22,951 (May 4, 1994). That Memorandum directs agencies to ``take appropriate steps to remove any procedural impediments to working directly and effectively with tribal governments on activities that affect the *␣*␣* governmental rights of the tribes.'' The Agency believes minimizing the burdens to participation by all tribes may be the approach most consistent with this directive. Although the Agency is not proposing a sliding scale, it requests comments on whether such an approach might be feasible and the criteria that could be used to determine the matching requirement for each grant recipient. The Agency solicits comments on: An appropriate initial match level equal to or exceeding five percent; the length appropriate for a phase-in period (if any) of the match; the rate at which the match would be phased upward; and an appropriate level for a permanent match requirement. The Clean Air Act also establishes one purpose for which Tribes may not be treated in the same manner as states. Under section 301(d)(1)(A) Tribes may not be treated in the same manner as States for purposes of section 105(b)(2) which ensures that each State applying for assistance have made available to it for application (but not necessarily for award) a minimum of one half of one percent of the total section 105 amount annually appropriated under the Act. 3. Tribal Agencies and Consortia Section 103 and 105 assistance is currently available to an individual Tribe because it constitutes an air pollution control agency under section 302(b)(5). The Agency also believes it may be appropriate to provide assistance to groups of tribes, typically tribes with air resources that are either contiguous or similar in their characteristics, when those tribes join into consortia for the purpose of applying for and managing the air quality financial assistance described above. A consortium is a partnership between two or more Indian tribal governments authorized by their governing bodies. Tribes can join into consortia in circumstances they find appropriate. The ``economies of scale'' made possible through Tribal consortia arrangements may allow for the assumption of air resource management responsibilities that may not otherwise be possible with small, single-Tribe environmental agencies. Consortia will have discretion in demonstrating how they will meet the matching funds requirement. Therefore, when a consortium reaches the point that it must provide matching funds to obtain grant funds, the consortium may combine its resources to meet the requirement in any manner it deems appropriate.
