After long reflection I decided to join on the difficult election campaign for the highest post -- that of president of Ukraine. I made this decision because I am deeply convinced that no one can stand aside when people are (?living in poverty). I believe that the people of Ukraine deserve a better fate and a better life than what we have today. For now, the whole people have been forced to pay a terrible price for the incompetence and short-sightedness, the lack of will and refusal to work of those who governed the state for four years [words indistinct], talk, make promises, and turn entirely different things into reality. It is much easier to lay the blame on four consecutive governments. Recently we have all witnessed the unprecedented propaganda campaign which has developed against me personally and against the political course for which I stand. These [word indistinct] are numerous accusations of antipatriotism, the desire to restore the Soviet Union, to give away Crimea and the Black Sea Fleet to Russia, anonymous falsehoods, plain lies, and an information blockade. Why has there been so much of this? I will reply. Those who do this are simply afraid, they are afraid that they will have to answer for betraying the hopes of the people, for the collapse of the economy, for helping corruption and criminal structures, for the unprecedented impoverishment of the people. So maybe it is time to think about it -- maybe the trouble is that the state does not have a master. A few words about the present economic situation, which has become catastrophic in the last half-year, when Ukraine's industry practically came to a stop. Adventurism in the economy undoubtedly (?governs) [word indistinct] now. [passage omitted] The country, according to all economic laws, is on the verge of a catastrophe, and the people (?are without means) of existence. Believe me, it is painful to watch, when crime prevails everywhere, while honest people are unable to survive or feed their children. I am certain that if the current economic and political course stays the same, even worse times and even greater ruin await Ukraine. I am convinced that order has to be brought to Ukraine, and that this can only be done when the individual and his rights are at the center of attention of all branches of power - legislative, executive, and judicial. All citizens (?of Ukraine have to feel) equal, irrespective of their nationality, religion, or position. I (?believe) and will endeavor for all to be equal in the eyes of the law, and for the law to be above all. I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I, Leonid Kuchma, am ready to assume all responsibility for the state of affairs in the country, without looking for someone else to take over the burden of problems. I am deeply convinced that Ukraine needs a new economic and political course. It will include a rejection of self-isolation, the restoration of all mutually advantageous economic, spiritual, and cultural links with the former republics of the Soviet Union, above all with Russia. In my opinion, Ukraine is not a cordon sanitaire between Europe and Russia. Ukraine is a [word indistinct] bridge between West and East. It is a country which should be open for cooperation [word indistinct]. Only then will new technologies and resources come here. Our state's future lies in using them. But now the economy is a hostage to unwise policies. My aim has always been and will be for the economy to be above everything else. Because I am convinced that Ukraine will become a real state only when the economy starts working, when production starts to increase, when we create a powerful economic system. All conditions for this exist here. How to do this? If I am elected president of Ukraine, I consider it necessary to restore, without interference by the state, the abruptly disrupted economic links, to create a single economic space with CIS countries on the model of the European Community or the American Free Trade Area. I consider it necessary to strive for Ukraine's full-fledged entry into the economic union and will speak in favor of all states signing a currency and customs agreement on equal terms. Customs-houses and borders should record and monitor the movement of goods and protect our domestic market, but ill-thought out and irrational customs duties need to be eliminated. Retail prices will immediately go down, which every citizen of Ukraine will notice. I think that in the economic sphere we need, above all, to conduct market reforms vigorously. Not reforms for the sake of reforms, but for the sake of the well-being of the people. Because otherwise they will be doomed to [word indistinct]. If I am elected president, the taxation system will be reviewed and liberalized. Income should not be taxed, only profits should be taxed, as is the practice worldwide. The fixed exchange rate between the karbovanets and the dollar will be urgently eliminated. It destroys all of our exports and makes production loss-making. Equal conditions for the existence of all forms of ownership will be ensured -- state, private, and collective ownership. The financial and banking spheres will be put in order. Permanent (?economic) regulations for the (?ruble zone) and Ukrainian enterprise will be created. In the area of state-building I am in favor of granting as many rights as possible to the regions in resolving economic and cultural problems. This in particular will reliably guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity and current borders. I will strive to grant official status to the Russian language in Ukraine, with Ukrainian retaining the status of state language. (?We) believe that the situation whereby Russian has the rights of a foreign language here is not only a mistake, but a dangerous mistake. I have never talked anywhere about restoring the Soviet Union, because a return to the past is impossible. But I will do everything so that Ukraine develops good-neighborly relations with all countries, especially with those with which we are linked by history, culture, and economy. I want to emphasize that the course toward mutually advantageous strategic partnership with Russia does not mean that we should have less friendly relations with the United States or France, say. I have never concealed that I am a supporter of Ukrainian statehood. (?But I have always) been and will continue to be a resolute opponent of developing statehood on the foundations of isolationism and anti-Russian sentiments. I want to speak separately about the problems of rural areas. [passage omitted] I regard as inadmissible [words indistinct] the forced (?division) of collective farms, for they are now our main source of food. I will have an attentive and careful attitude to property reforms concerning the land. I think that collective farms' land should not be sold, but should belong to those who cultivate it. But unproductive land, land under buildings and factories, dacha plots, should be sold freely. Otherwise private foreign capital will not come to us. In social policy my fundamental position is this: state education and health care should be free, because, tell me please, who here can pay for this now? A handful of people. The wages of doctors, teachers, servicemen, and the militia should ensure a dignified life for the individual, and not a half-starved existence. I do not want students and pensioners to be beggars in our country. But increasing wages to [word indistinct], grants and pensions, can be done only if production starts to work, and if there are radical changes in the structure of the budget. [passage omitted] My opponents shamelessly [words indistinct] special powers, but did not use them. But I only had the illusion of power, because real power means personnel, administrative structures, finances and law enforcement bodies. All of this was in the hands of the president and the Supreme Council. The government only had the right to issue decrees, which were coordinated with the president's team, the president personally, and with the Supreme Council. This was only the illusion of power, I repeat. My opponents maintain that I (?began) to campaign against the mafia, but I did not take the matter to its conclusion. But my government conducted hundreds of checks and inspections and handed over quite a few [word indistinct] to the procuracy and the law enforcement [words indistinct]. I want to assure you that if I am elected president, I will have sufficient powers and resoluteness to take what has been started to its conclusion. I am in general convinced that the new president should from the outset declare real war on corruption and crime. My opponents are trying to blame Kuchma for the price increases but I know that any respectable scientific [word indistinct] can confirm that those who were not able to or could not (?take) political decisions were to blame for the increases in prices. And (?I was virtually declared an enemy) for the attempt to conclude an economic union (?with Russia). But it was understandable to all that an economic union meant markets for our goods, stability of prices for energy-carriers, millions of permanent jobs for workers. I am convinced that time will (?change understanding) and many people will be ashamed of their actions. Today I want to implement these plans and ideas, which I was not allowed to implement in 1993. I want my children and grandchildren to live in a wealthy, democratic sovereign Ukraine within its current borders, so that (?it is) equally respected in Russia and America, for them to be proud of their state. I want our people to have a worthy life, for order to reign in the country, and for people to have faith in the future. I want a master to take charge in Ukraine who is responsible for everything. All together we have to bring Ukraine out of the crisis, work together and build, take care of the old and weak. To do this we need to search for unifying and integrating (?values), which will unite East and West, North and South. We have such human values. These are good, work, accord, order, and decency. Thank you.
