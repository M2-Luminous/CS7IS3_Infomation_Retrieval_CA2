Commenting on the statement of the U.S. ambassador at a Foreign Correspondents Club of Thailand dinner that the Thai Government still maintained ties with the Khmer Rouge, which continue to wage battles with the Cambodian Government, Foreign Minister Squadron Leader Prasong Sunsiri said he has already explained to the ambassador that the Thai Government only maintains diplomatic ties with Cambodia's legitimate government. The Thai Government has moreover complied with the UN resolution banning border trading with the Khmer Rouge. He said if there are any more comments to that effect, he will invite that person to check the situation at the place itself. However, he added, the Cambodian Government has not declared the Khmer Rouge faction as outlaws.
