FR941019-2-00206 FR941019-2-00114 (6) Participants may be appointed under a temporary or permanent employment mechanism, so long as their employment in a clinical research assignment has the potential to last a minimum of 2 years; (7) Individuals with existing service obligations to Federal, State, or other entities will not be considered for the Program unless and until the existing service obligation is discharged or deferred for the length of Program participation; (8) Applicants will not be excluded from consideration under the Program on the basis of age, race, culture, religion, gender, disability, or other non-merit factors. Selection Process Since program participation is contingent upon employment with the NIH, an individual who wishes to apply must obtain a written commitment from an Institute or Center (IC) Personnel Office of the NIH to be employed in a clinical research position. The Director, LRP, provides current deadlines, sources for assistance, and additional details regarding application procedures in an annual Applicant Information Bulletin. Individuals submit their applications to the Director, LRP, who forwards those qualified to the Clinical Research Loan Repayment Committee (CR&hyph;LRC). The CR&hyph;LRC reviews, ranks, and approves or disapproves Clinical Research LRP applications. The LRC membership is made up of NIH scientific staff who are nominated by the Deputy Director, Intramural Research, NIH, and appointed by the Director, NIH. The CR&hyph;LRC is co-chaired by the Associate Director for Clinical Research, NIH, and the Associate Director for Research on Minority Health, NIH. The CR&hyph;LRC reviews and selects applications for approval based upon the following: (1) The merit of the clinical research assignment; and (2) The credentials of both applicant and supervisor and other criteria the Secretary deems appropriate. Clinical research activities are the biomedical and behavioral studies of etiology, epidemiology, prevention, prevention strategies, diagnosis, or treatment of diseases, disorders or conditions, including but not limited to clinical trials. Funds for repayment will only be awarded to LRC-approved applications. Priority in funding will be given to qualified health professionals who are from disadvantaged backgrounds and who are underrepresented in biomedical/behavioral research including members from minority groups, disabled individuals, and women. Program Administration and Details Under the Clinical Research LRP, the NIH will repay a portion of the extant qualified educational loan debt incurred by health professionals to pay for their undergraduate, graduate, and/or health professional school educational expenses. Upon application, individuals must have total qualified educational debt which exceeds 20% of their anticipated annual NIH salary (``debt threshold'') on the date of program eligibility. Only qualified loan amounts in excess of 50 percent of the debt threshold will be considered for repayment (``repayable debt''). The repayable debt of qualified health professionals will be satisfied at the rate of one-half per year, subject to a statutory limit of $20,000 per year, for each year of obligated service. Obligated service requires selected individuals to serve at least 2 years as an NIH employee engaged in clinical research. Following conclusion of the initial two-year contract, participants may apply for renewal contracts to satisfy their remaining repayable debt. These continuation contracts may be submitted and approved on a year-to-year basis, subject to a finding by NIH that the applicant's clinical research accomplishments are acceptable. Funding of contracts is contingent upon appropriation and/or allocation of funds from the U.S. Congress and/or the NIH. In return for the repayment of their educational loans, participants must agree to (1) engage in clinical research as employees of the NIH for a minimum period of 2 years; (2) make payments to lenders on their own behalf for periods of Leave Without Pay (LWOP); (3) pay monetary damages as required for breach of contract; and (4) satisfy other terms and conditions of the Clinical Research LRP's contract and application procedures. Applicants must submit a signed contract, prepared by the NIH, agreeing to obligated service at the time they apply for consideration under the Clinical Research LRP. Substantial monetary penalties will be imposed for breach of contract. The NIH will repay lenders for the principal, interest, and related expenses (such as the required insurance premiums on the unpaid balances of some loans) of qualified Government (Federal, State, local) and commercial educational loans obtained by participants for the following:
