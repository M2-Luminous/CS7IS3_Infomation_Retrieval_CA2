FR941117-0-00214 FR941117-0-00014 Notwithstanding the shortened settlement period of T+3 and the possibility that an investor may receive the confirmation after payment has been made, the Commission believes that the confirmation will continue to serve important investor protection functions. T+3 Settlement's implementation merely may mean that the confirmation may take on a different role. Some firms may continue to use the confirmation as a customer invoice, while financing positions when customer payment is received after settlement date. For other firms, the confirmation may not continue to serve in all circumstances as an invoice of a transaction because ordinary confirmation delivery and transfer of customer funds and securities may not be feasible within a three-day settlement cycle. 28 Rather, the confirmation may serve primarily as written evidence of the contract between the customer and broker-dealer. 29 As a written record of the transaction, the confirmation will continue to provide investors the necessary information to assist them in evaluating the quality and accuracy of their trades while assisting them in correcting mistakes and verifying the terms of their transactions. Accordingly, while T+3 Settlement may affect the mechanics of settlement, it will not eliminate the confirmation's investor protection functions. 28 One commenter suggested that the Commission reevaluate the meaning of ``give or send'' under Rule 10b&hyph;10 in light of T+3 Settlement and current technology, such as electronic messaging, E-mail, direct computer links, telefax, and fax modems. See Letter from Sullivan & Cromwell, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 15, 1994). In the Proposing Release, the Commission recognized the use of a facsimile machine to send customer confirmations. See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12767 n.5. To the extent that a customer has a facsimile machine, a broker-dealer would fulfill its confirmation delivery obligation if it sent the confirmation via facsimile transmission. The staff also has allowed, under specified conditions, confirmations to be sent by other electronic means. See Letter regarding Thomson Financial Services, Inc . (Oct. 8, 1993). The Commission agrees that T+3 Settlement may encourage alternatives to the mail system for sending confirmations and that a flexible approach may be necessary to accommodate T+3 Settlement with existing technology. The Commission, however, believes that each approach should be viewed on a case-by-case basis, as has been previous practice, to ensure the safety and reliability of the confirmation transmission. 29 Under the current text of the Uniform Commercial Code, the confirmation serves as a written record of the transaction, thus satisfying the statute of frauds. Uniform Commercial Code Section 8&hyph;319 states that a ``contract for the sale of securities is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless *␣*␣* there is some writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker, sufficient to indicate that a contract has been made for sale of a stated quantity of described securities at a defined or stated price.'' A confirmation, bearing the broker-dealer's letterhead or some other identifying marking, generally fulfills that requirement. Revised Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, which was endorsed recently by both the American Law Institute and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, would omit current Section 8&hyph;319. Due to the prior difficulties in applying Section 8&hyph;319 to the sale of securities over the telephone and the more common use of electronic means for securities transactions, proposed Section 8&hyph;113 states that ``[a] contract or modification for the sale or purchase of a security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought, even if the contract or modification is not capable of performance within one year of its making.'' 2. Periodic Account Statement The Commission also requested comment on the feasibility of transferring information currently disclosed on the confirmation to a periodic account statement. 30 Many commenters addressing this issue opposed such a use of the periodic account statement and noted that it was not the appropriate document to convey particularized trade information. 31 Rather, as one commenter indicated, account statements are intended to summarize the activity and status of an account; they are not intended to convey information regarding the features and risks of each individual securities transaction. 32 Other commenters, however, noted that, as investors increasingly rely upon periodic account statements, the confirmation will diminish as a primary disclosure device. 33 At this time, the Commission has determined to retain the confirmation as the basic transaction disclosure document and use the account statement, the account opening document, or annual disclosure requirements as needed to supplement or summarize confirmation disclosures. 30 See Proposing Release, supra note 10, at 59 FR 12768. 31 See, e.g. , Letters from A. George Saks, Executive Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel, Smith Barney (Aug. 1, 1994); Barry H. Zucker, President & CEO, J.B. Hanauer & Co. (June 20, 1994); and Jon S. Corzine, Goldman, Sachs & Co. (June 15, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC. 32 See, e.g. , Letter from Donald E. Walter, Compliance Director/Principal, Edward D. Jones & Co., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (July 15, 1994). Another commenter noted that transferring confirmation information to an account statement may clutter the account statement and make it less readable. See Letter from Barry H. Zucker, President & CEO, J.B. Hanauer & Co., to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (June 20, 1994). 33 See, e.g. , Letters from Robert M. Sweeney, Vice President/Assistant Comptroller, Gibraltar Securities Co. (June 14, 1994); William J. Jester, Jr., Chemical Banking Corp. (June 14, 1994); and Kurt Halvorson, Vice President & Comptroller, AmeriTrade (May 27, 1994), to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC.
