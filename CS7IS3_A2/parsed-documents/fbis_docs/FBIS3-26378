She said: At this moment, we especially cherish the memory of the 10th Panchen Lama. He was a great patriot and a banner for our united front. Although it has been five years since his death, his patriotic spirit, as well as his spirit of working hard for the country and the people, always deserves to be emulated and always inspires us to move forward. We also miss our Tibetan compatriots who are living in exile abroad. We hope that the Dalai Lama will end his exile at an early date, return to the motherland, contribute to the motherland's unity, national unity, and economic development; and do useful work to promote the Tibetan people's prosperity and happiness.
