His hair is barely starting to grow back after chemotherapy for cancer left him bald. Despite his haste to get back to work, Nunez, who recently turned 55, thinks that no organization can depend on one person, on one boss, and he is ready to leave UNAG at the time of the 1996 elections. In his frank and down-to-earth language, he speaks of his fight against cancer, of his plans, and says what he thinks in this interview with EL SEMANARIO. [Medina] Have you had a hard time with your disease? [Nunez] My mother taught me a maxim that is a sort of credo for me. It goes like this: "If there is a cure for your problem, why complain? And if not, why cry?" This disease has not been easy. Cancer is like a curse in a person's life. Often, though, your recovery depends on the support you get from friends. I have had a great deal of support from really surprising sources, from political opponents. They have given me really incredible surprises. Local church groups to which I have belonged, in Waslala, San Juan del Rio Coco, la Guinea...many people have been praying for me. I was quite surprised when in a very poor area in Matagalpa, a really impoverished place, the people there unexpectedly paid to have a mass said for my health. Those things are really priceless. [Medina] Have you recovered now? [Nunez] I really should not be working. They recommended that I continue to rest, but the truth is that in Nicaragua's situation, with all our difficulties, we cannot just sit back. I have things to do, I have to have another operation, because I now have a hernia. After my surgery, I had chemotherapy. I have to go for treatment every three months to keep the disease from spreading. [Medina] What was the diagnosis? [Nunez] Cancer. They removed one organ. I also had another tumor, or rather I still have it, between the aorta and the lung. They did not remove that because it was too dangerous. Still, in my last checkup the diagnosis was negative. That gives me fairly good chances of being cured. But you know that this disease is tricky, you do not know where it will emerge, when it will pop back up again. In any event, it makes a person more aware that he is living, like a plant with a blight, with a disease that it is possible to fight and overcome, but it is also possible...that it will not be overcome. It makes a person live with more realism. [Medina] How did you spend those three months away from your job? [Nunez] First of all, I had to deal with the problem. I could not sit on the fence. I trusted my comrades on the board of directors to handle this work responsibly, and now I have the satisfaction of knowing that they did what should have been done. We are facing some problems in the ECODEPA [Let Us Save Democracy program], the nation's economic situation affects us all, and we believe that great experience has been gained through this. For an organization that depends on one leader is not an organization. Then you are creating a personalized power base, and that is not good. UNAG has the force of the forest, meaning that for every tree that falls, another is planted. It has the strength to move forward no matter whether one or two or three of its leaders have to leave for this or that reason. I myself am prepared to leave the organization in 1996, with the new election we are going to have in the Third Congress. UNAG must move forward because it is not the work of one person, but of thousands of campesinos, hundreds of leaders. [Medina] UNAG did very well in the last poll. To what do you attribute those results? [Nunez] We have defined a broad sector-oriented strategy. We bring together members of cooperatives, small, medium, and large producers. And we have depoliticized UNAG. We are also an organization that works to serve producers. We have projects in many places in Nicaragua, in poor areas.... We have a program called "From Campesino to Campesino" that involves technology transfer. In this program we teach campesinos to improve their production, how to best use their fertilizer, to produce their own seeds, and that has strengthened the campesino leadership of each region. We have the privilege or the pride of having representatives all over the country. UNAG is in Siuna, in Rio San Juan, in San Juan del Rio Coco, in Jalapa, it is in the most remote places in the interior. We have developed grass-roots leaders in these communities. For example, the chairman in each department is from that department; they are not imported, but really are people from the local communities. The board of directors is well balanced, because we have comrades who have come right from the proletariat, and we also have good representation in men like Juan Tijerino (livestock), Alvaro Fiallos (cotton), Juan Ramon Aragon (livestock), and others. That balance gives our organization a lot of credibility. We are an institution that works to serve producers. We are often concerned because there are producers who think we are a ministry and not a trade association that needs the work of these producers to sustain itself, to gain more strength in the national awareness of the campesino. [Medina] Perhaps that may be related to the state's withdrawal from many of its institutions in rural areas--bank branches, ENABAS [National Enterprise for Staple Foods], etc. [Nunez] Yes, that is true. We feel the peasants have been orphaned by state policies. I am referring to training, technical assistance, financing, developing new forms of production. For example, there is a big onion-exporting project that AID [Agency for International Development] is financing, and it has become a closed and favored group in the Sebaco Valley, where four or five producers are running it. The renovation of coffee production is often in the hands of favored groups. The economy in those sectors has not been democratized. Rural credit has practically been closed off. The eight private banks here say they finance 1 or 2 percent of the agricultural production in Nicaragua. That really makes no sense. The government says, "Let us get back to the fields," and we say: "Great, excellent, let us go to the fields." But we are not going back to the fields; the opposite is true. Today in rural areas you have kidnapping, violence, crime, and often the print media, radio, and television do not report its true magnitude. We believe that this year, 1994, we have to apply a lot of pressure, we have to persuade the government that if no strong move is made toward rural areas there may be serious problems here. [Medina] UNAG is a force in civil society. You have 120,000 members.... Have you used that power--maybe to apply pressure? [Nunez] We did not want to use it. We have used it to organize, to develop national awareness, to tell our members to support reconciliation and pacification, that they should support the coalition, that they need to support stability in rural areas and this transition from war to peace. If we went the other way and encouraged the campesinos to challenge IMF policies, there really would have been a serious crisis here. The government might not have been able to implement any policies. We know the strength we have. We can mobilize 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 campesinos. We are using this strength to create awareness on a national and international level, to support this great productive sector with over 60,000 small producers, including cooperative members. If some ministries continue to turn a deaf ear to appeals from this sector, we might be forced...not to abandon the peasants, but to take the lead in presenting their most heart-felt demands. [Medina] What ministries do you mean? [Nunez] We have tried to create some common ground with IRENA [Institute of Natural Resources] but it has been difficult, as they have a mindset that the state is the boss, and as the boss, the state is the one to implement reforestation policies, and we have opposed some of their projects. With the Ministry of Agriculture we have had some major differences. They have been reported in the newspapers, and we hope that in 1994 things may be better. For example, INTA [National Institute of Technology Transfer] is being announced with a lot of publicity hype. They will have 360 officials. We will see what these 360 bureaucrats will do to promote technology transfer for small growers of corn, beans, rice, etc. The Ministry of the Economy...well, they have practically barred their doors to us. We went to them to protest the problem of cattle on the hoof leaving the country. Often when these cattle are bought in Costa Rica the livestock's value is not declared. The state fails to collect those taxes. Along with cattle rustling, there is also an abuse of power. [Medina] But UNAG is both a union group and a business group. Isn't that contradictory? For example, when you criticize the export of cattle on the hoof, are you not acting more to protect the interests of CARNIC [Nicaraguan Meat Enterprise] slaughterhouses than the interests of livestock producers who get their best prices by selling outside the country? [Nunez] Not so. We have criticized this ever since the revolution. Furthermore, CARNIC is in itself not a UNAG member, but it is composed of a number of producers, cooperative members, small and midsized producers. We are never going to put economic interests ahead of our sector interests. Let me tell you something that is not well known in Nicaragua. In 1993 we financed over 10,000 producers of sesame, rice, coffee, and basic grains. We have loans to recover, perhaps more than the National Bank. We are really interested in getting these problems resolved. I do not think this is contradictory, for a group like ours has to have an alternative to offer producers. When we buy coffee, meat, or sesame, and at the same time we provide some products that are needed like agrichemicals and fertilizers, we are not acting like a private firm for our own personal profit, but rather as a complete enterprise that works with that producer to finance his harvest. Here is another example: last year we financed all the sesame grown on Ometepe Island. We left the island, and in Ometepe no one planted sesame because there was nobody to finance it. In Chinandega, 60,000 quintals of rice have just been harvested, the result of financing we gave those growers. In Matagalpa and Jinotega, large producers owe UNAG about $500,000 in financing that we lent them two years ago, which they have not yet been able to repay. We acted like a bank, in an act of solidarity, in order to alleviate the financing situation. [Medina] Where does that money come from? [Nunez] It comes from loans we get from private banks, from the National Bank, from projects to supply peasant stores. We are creating "rural savings and loan banks." We cannot sit back and do nothing. The campesinos are not organizing just for the fun of it, but for the options that you mention so that they can overcome their economic limitations. [Medina] People say Daniel Nunez could run as a candidate in the 1996 elections...because of your leadership and popularity. [Nunez] Many people want to be president of Nicaragua. I, Daniel Nunez, think that what we need to do is seek consensus and unity so we can change the methods and ways with which presidencies in this country have been conducted. We need to create a consensus among all the progressive, business, trade union, political, and even religious sectors in order to develop a new strategy that will allow us to work for Nicaragua, not for a specific political party, and also not for a specific person. Through all the conflicts we have experienced, there are men here who have emerged as leaders, who have set aside egotistical personal interests and are thinking about the nation. Others have clung to revanchism. As we have said since 1990, UNAG is going to support the most progressive sectors that pledge to the people that they will keep us from creating more financial monopolies, but instead will seek ways to develop small and midsized production. We are going to support whoever pledges to improve economic activity in rural areas, who fights to lower the unfair interest rates we pay to state banks. We do not want to continue a neoliberal policy that will do to us what is happening in Chiapas. The Chiapas situation is the product of imposing a policy that works only for the privileged sectors, while ignoring the people who are left outside. I personally am concerned that if this plan continues on its present course, we may have an eruption here that we will not be able to control. No, no, what I really want and my actions have demonstrated this when I have twice been a deputy to the National Assembly, and neither in 1984, nor now.... Why? Because I think the work Daniel Nunez does with the peasants, in direct contact with the grass roots, is more important than what I could do in the National Assembly. We do give guidelines to our UNAG comrades in the assembly. We want to make this clear, in 1996 we are going to play a major role in getting out the peasants' votes. We are going to use all the influence we have in this sector so that the peasants will not be left unprotected as they have been by this government. We Sandinists will have to make a great effort because we owe a debt to the people. The national leadership owes a debt to the people. The Nicaraguan people defended the revolution with their lives because they believed in it. I think that if the Sandinist Front, as our party, wants to repay this historic commitment we will have to be consistent and broadly based, and not continue fighting about presidential candidacies. We have to reach agreement to see what alliance we can form with progressive sectors. [Medina] So there is no possibility that the name of Daniel Nunez will appear on election ballots in 1996. [Nunez] Well, I have no such aspirations. To be president of a country a person needs resources. If Sandinism and we Sandinists cannot join together and unite our forces with the most progressive trade union and business groups, social and economic sectors, we will lose the opportunity to move Nicaragua forward. I do not think the old historic parallels of liberals and conservatives, which are worn out and practically meaningless to the people, can offer a solution for this change. I am a soldier, and I will always be wherever the party leaders want, so long as it is for my country. [Medina] When you say that UNAG will support the most progressive sector or party, do you mean that UNAG might not support the Sandinist Front in the next elections? [Nunez] If the Sandinist Front were to have the misfortune of becoming a divided party, how could we support a divided party? That is definitely not our aim. If UNAG has worked for anything, it is for the unity of the peasants. That unity we established with the national resistance was not easy for us, but we have demonstrated our unity. The first thing we Sandinists have to work for is the unity of Sandinism. If there is no unity in Sandinism, there will be no Sandinist victory in 1996, even though we are the most powerful force in the country. There are workers, campesinos, businessmen.... There are opportunists who have renounced Sandinism, who bad-mouth it now, after the people supported them. I say, if the Sandinist Front is divided, I will stay home. I will not support an election with a divided Sandinist Front, for that would be the worst tragedy that could happen to the Nicaraguan people.
