The 250-man "Evergreen" Unit will leave the African country aboard a chartered plane on March 17 and arrive in Seoul the following day, according to the ministry. The unit's equipment will arrive via ship and reach the port city of Pusan sometime next month. The Evergreen Unit marked South Korea's first participation ever in a U.N. Peacekeeping Operation (PKO). It was dispatched to the strife-torn nation last July for a one-year tour of duty, but the Seoul government decided on an early withdrawal, around April, after scores of Western nations announced their intention to pull out. South Korea pushed up the withdrawal date to next week after similar decisions were made by the United States and other nations.
