However, because nobody is being paid, work came to a standstill one month ago. The contracting firm KISKA is owed about 150 billion Turkish Lira [TL] [approximately $4.5 million]. We come and go with armored vehicles. The working area was raided three times, five vehicles were set on fire, three people were killed. Meanwhile, there is no money. Nobody knows how the payments will be made. There are 75 armed guards, two armored vehicles, and 50 soldiers. Also, State Water Works guards are on duty night and day." That is how an official of KISKA described the state of affairs at the Dicle dam, part of the GAP [Southeast Anatolia Project]. The same official pointed out that work has stopped at the Kralkizi and Batman dams as well. The stories about the gravity of the economic situation in the southeast are not restricted only to the shattering of the dreams about GAP. Rumors are spreading that the soldiers serving in the southeast have not been receiving their salaries for some time. Furthermore, it is being said that the state, including the army and the bureaucracy, owes billions of liras to the shopkeepers in the area. A few days ago, journalist Yalcin Dogan wrote in his column in MILLIYET: "We are collapsing together with our state and middle classes. We are going through the saddest, most critical period of the republican era. It is not a joke, we are collapsing." Turkey is going through a serious economic crisis that makes everyone feel we are collapsing. However, there is no agreement on the reasons for the crisis. Since 1990, Turkey has been increasingly sinking into a terrorism quagmire. Consequently, more and more are asking: "Maybe our economic problems are caused by terrorism?" This question can be answered only if we look at the costs of terrorism. Here is a list of the expenditures for fighting terrorism only in 1992: TL5 trillion to pay 44,372 village guards, TL30 trillion for security buildings, TL3.6 trillion in compensation to civil servants, TL6.5 trillion paid to military, judicial, and MIT [National Intelligence Agency] personnel, TL13 trillion for one operation in northern Iraq. These figures doubled in the two years since then. At the end of 1993, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said that the struggle being waged against the PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] in the southeast will cost TL400 trillion. During the past one year and a half, the number of village guards grew to 51,450 and their cost doubled to TL10 trillion. The cost of a policeman serving in the southeast is almost three times as high as his colleague in the west. A teacher who receives TL5 million in the west, receives double that amount in the southeast. Some 300,000 soldiers serve in the area. Every military personnel serving in the region receives TL4 million as "compensation for carrying weapons." So far, 400 helicopters have been bought to be used in the struggle against terrorism. Their cost is unbelievable: One Sikorsky costs $8.5 million, one Cobra $4 million and one SuperCobra $12 million. At an average of TL250 billion a piece, the total cost is TL100 trillion. The hourly flight cost of these helicopters is as follows: $2,049 for the Cobra, $8,460 for the Super Cobra, and $2,049 for the Sikorsky. Their average flight cost is more than TL180 million. If 50 helicopters fly two hours per day the cost is TL18 billion. If you add to that the cost of flight of warplanes, another TL18 billion, the bill comes to TL36 billion per day. The state expenditures for "fighting terrorism" are not restricted to that. For example, you must add to that the "Apo [PKK leader Ocalan's nom de guerre] compensation." In order to keep some 200,000 civil servants in the state of emergency region, the state pays them, under the State of Emergency Law, compensation termed by the public the "Apo compensation." The yearly total of this compensation is TL6 trillion. This is in addition to the cost of military, judicial, MIT, and other secret organization personnel who are excluded by Law 657. The latter figure is around TL10 trillion. Lately, many circles are expressing the same view, and loudly: "The war economy implemented by the government because of the struggle against the PKK in the southeast has gone bankrupt." The economic cost of this struggle was TL100 trillion in 1993 figures and will be TL400 trillion in 1994. This has upset all the balances. The first result of this is that the regional economy has become completely paralyzed. The shopkeepers have moved to the west, sales have come to a complete standstill, bank branches are closing one after the other, checks cannot be cashed, and premiums are almost nil. Also, the future is unknown for GAP -- a project which had formed the cornerstone of the state's long-term program for the region. Ahmet Ozer, the GAP Municipalities Union secretary general, describes the situation: "There is no substantial industry in the region. Whatever there is is either being sold and closed down. The region still needs state support. The state's policy of encouragement has gone completely bankrupt. As a result, there are many half-built installations or installations that have been completed but are closed due to a lack of funds. When industry and investments did not develop, dependent intermediate and side- industries also failed to develop, paralyzing the economy. Following the 5 April economic decisions, the sale of cars and electrical household appliances dropped steeply, and many shops had to close down. Another result of the 5 April decisions was that the GAP came to a standstill. There are several half-completed dam projects now, workers are being laid off, contractors and the state cannot pay their debts to the shopkeepers and others who are owed money. The GAP was the only means to eliminate the interregional imbalances, to keep the economy alive, and to create jobs. Therefore, it should have been kept out of the 5 April economic package. The most important of all is that nobody is doing anything about the security expenditures in the southeast, even though they play a major role in creating the reasons for the package in the first place." Our Neighbors Also Face Difficulties It is not only the region that is affected by the suspension of the GAP investments. The GAP includes several dam projects that were supposed to be used as trump cards in influencing and controlling the military, political, and strategic forces of our southern neighbors Syria and Iraq. The suspension of the investments made the water issue among Syria, Turkey, and Iraq uncertain as well. It is a known fact that various misunderstandings cropped up between Turkey and its two southern neighbors which use the waters of Firat and Dicle when Turkey began to build the dams. Especially Syria reacted strongly when less water began to flow in Firat with the development of the GAP. Syria took the problem to international organizations. In return, Turkey claimed that Syria was supporting the PKK and instigating the Kurds within the GAP in order to prevent the construction of the project. These developments strained the relations between the two countries which even resorted to taking military measures. In fact, the Turkish General Staff changed its former assessment and announced that the "threat" to Turkey comes from the "south." This meant that the military buildup would be in the southeast. It also meant that the GAP investments would be traded for military expenditures. The growing expectations that a "water war" will break out in the Middle East is laying a heavy load on the economies of the two countries. Observing these developments with concern, Turkey gave up the idea of reforming its big and lumbering army. It also suspended the GAP which it earlier considered as an economic guarantee. On the other hand, the weapons Turkey has been buying only from the United States and Germany since 1990 are enough to equip an army. UN figures show that the tanks and armored vehicles bought from these two countries in 1993 are equal to the number in the British Army. Most of these weapons are being deployed in the southeast. It is observed that great difficulties are being encountered in paying for these weapons especially after the 5 April economic package. "The Terrorist Increment" Nobody doubts that the picture at the end of 1994 will be very dark. The additional burden of the war in the southeast created a TL124 trillion deficit in the 1993 budget. Professor Dogu Ergil says the following about the real dimensions of this burden: "We can get a picture about the cost of terrorism by looking at the budget figures. In 1993, the consolidated budget revenues were set at TL344.4 trillion, and the expenditures at TL397 trillion. The TL53.3 trillion deficit was to be covered with internal and external loans. In the first seven months of the year, the government borrowed this amount. Now, it either had to print money, or it had to borrow some more. To meet the expenditures until the end of the year, another TL130 trillion was needed. That was the `terrorist increment.' "The cost of fighting terrorism is terrible. We lose cash and investments stop. When you fight terrorism hard, you stop big projects such as the GAP. The construction of the Batman and Dicle dams stopped. That is a terrible cost to pay. It is true, many PKK members are being killed in the southeast, but at a very great cost." It seems that the deficit is impossible to close regardless of all the saving policies implemented in other fields. No one knows what the deficit will be in 1994. We can say, however, that the economic crisis looms as an obstacle before a military solution.
