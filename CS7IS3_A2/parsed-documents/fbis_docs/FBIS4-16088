The statement reads: "The Popular Movement is indignant at the flagrant aggression launched by the U.S. military against fraternal Slavic Serbia under the UN banner. We lodge a resolute protest against this action, which threatens the entire world with catastrophe." The NDB demands a stop to "the destruction of the proud and fraternal-to-us Serbian people," as well as lifting of the economic blockade on the Socialist [as received] Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, which brings about "incalculable losses to Belarusian economy and trade." The NDB also demands that the Belarusian Government establish diplomatic relations with the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia, and that Belarusian representatives to the United Nations introduce a resolution banning the use of armed forces in crisis spots around the world.
