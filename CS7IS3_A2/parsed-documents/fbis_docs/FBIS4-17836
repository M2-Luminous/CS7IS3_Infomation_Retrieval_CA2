At a press conference devoted to problems related to forging a parliamentary faction of the Interregional Bloc for Reforms [MBR], he said he is ready to cooperate with all parties and movements, but only on issues of mutual interest. In this case, Leonid Kuchma noted, I do not rule out negotiations with Vyacheslav Chornovil. In the recent election, the former prime minister said, those who bet on Ukraine's self- isolation failed. Speaking on the country's economic situation, the MBR leader noted that the West is right in calling Ukraine Central European Columbia. Without privatization and the complete restructuring of the country's economy, Western capital will not come to us. The United States of America, Leonid Kuchma said, will not give Ukraine a penny until it makes sure that Ukrainian economy is stable and receives guarantees for the capital invested into it.
