The establishment of a Afrikaner homeland was inevitable and the Afrikaner nation would now use other methods to gain its freedom within an own state, AVF chairman and Conservative Party leader Dr Ferdi Hartzenberg said in a statement on Monday. The statement did not elaborate on the methods. Dr Hartzenberg said said Mr Mandela's standpoint made on SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] TV on Sunday was verified at a meeting on Monday afternoon between him and the ANC president. "Mr Mandela's viewpoint was that the Afrikaner should indeed be accommodated, but that the concept of a volkstaat would have to be discussed by all ANC structures, which was practically impossible before April 27." The AVF said Mr Mandela had undertaken to react to the AVF's demands after proper consultation with members of his organisation.
