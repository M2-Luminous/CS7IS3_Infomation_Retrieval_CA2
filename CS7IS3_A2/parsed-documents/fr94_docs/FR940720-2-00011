FR940720-2-00011 FR940720-2-00007 [C&hyph;475&hyph;815] Notice of Initiation of Countervailing Duty Investigation: Small Diameter Circular Seamless Carbon and Alloy Steel Standard, Line and Pressure Pipe From Italy AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 20, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Vincent Kane, Office of Countervailing Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3099, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;2815. Initiation The Petition On June 23, 1994, Gulf States Tubes, a division of Quanex Corporation, (hereinafter ``petitioner'') filed with the Department of Commerce (``the Department'') a countervailing duty petition on behalf of the United States industry producing small diameter circular seamless carbon and alloy steel standard, line and pressure pipe (hereinafter ``seamless pipe''). In accordance with section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), petitioner alleges that manufacturers, producers, or exporters of the subject merchandise in Italy receive countervailable subsidies. Injury Test Because Italy is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaning of section 701(b) of the Act, Title VII of the Act applies to this investigation. Accordingly, the U.S. International Trade Commission (``ITC'') must determine whether imports of the subject merchandise from Italy materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. Standing Petitioner has stated that it has standing to file the petition because it is an interested party as defined in sections 771(9)(C) and 771(9)(D) of the Act and that it has filed the petition on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the like product. If any interested party, as described in sections 771(9)(C), (D), (E), or (F), wishes to register support for, or opposition to, this petition, such party should file written notification with the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration, Room B&hyph;099, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20230. Scope of the Investigation For purposes of this investigation, seamless pipes are seamless carbon and alloy (other than stainless) steel pipes, of circular cross-section, not more than 114.3 mm (4.5 inches) in outside diameter, regardless of wall thickness, manufacturing process (hot-finished or cold-drawn), end finish (plain end, bevelled end, upset end, threaded, or threaded and coupled), or surface finish. These pipes are commonly known as standard pipe, line pipe or pressure pipe, depending upon the application. They may also be used in structural applications. The seamless pipes subject to this investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7304.10.10.20, 7304.10.50.20, 7304.31.60.50, 7304.39.00.16, 7304.39.00.20, 7304.39.00.24, 7304.39.00.28, 7304.39.00.32, 7304.51.50.05, 7304.51.50.60, 7304.59.60.00, 7304.59.80.10, 7304.59.80.15, 7304.59.80.20, and 7304.59.80.25 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (``HTSUS''). The following information further defines the scope of this investigation, which covers pipes meeting the physical parameters described above: Specifications, Characteristics and Uses: Seamless pressure pipes are intended for the conveyance of water, steam, petrochemicals, chemicals, oil products, natural gas and other liquids and gasses in industrial piping systems. They may carry these substances at elevated pressures and temperatures and may be subject to the application of external heat. Seamless carbon steel pressure pipe meeting the American Society for Testing and Materials (``ASTM'') standard A&hyph;106 may be used in temperatures of up to 1000 degrees fahrenheit, at various American Society of Mechanical Engineers (``ASME'') code stress levels. Alloy pipes made to ASTM standard A&hyph;335 must be used if temperatures and stress levels exceed those allowed for A&hyph;106 and the ASME codes. Seamless pressure pipes sold in the United States are commonly produced to the ASTM A&hyph;106 standard.
