[Manolic] I think the attempt to replace me, the way in which it was done, has created a certain repulsion and made the public condemn that procedure. I have respected the procedure to a "T." Amending the agenda during a session of the Chamber of Counties is in the hands of the president of the chamber. Therefore, he can, but does not have to, include an amendment in the agenda. Since, that day, the HDZ Club of Representatives did not manage to have the question of my replacement put on the agenda; they demanded that the session be interrupted until a Commission for Constitution and Standing Orders gives its interpretation of the Standing Orders. The chamber accepted to interrupt the session, and it cannot be continued, for the interruption lasted for more than eight days. We must convene a new session. This time-out has enabled me to buy time to create -- first of all in the Chamber of Counties and then also in the parliament -- a climate that will make it possible to decide about my replacement in a legal and legitimate manner. I hope that, when the time comes, deputies will be able to commit themselves on that issue more objectively, although they were pressured by the HDZ leadership. [Modric] When do you plan to convene the session of the Chamber of Counties, or will you convene it at all? HINA reports that yesterday you were formally requested to do so by representatives of the ruling party in the upper chamber of our parliament. [Manolic] Convening a new session of the Chamber of Counties is a matter that will be decided by its president. I will be governed primarily by political reasons in deciding to convene the session, and I will completely obey constitutional and legal regulations. My decision cannot be influenced by any kind of demands of a group of the HDZ representatives nor of the HDZ Club of Representatives. The attempt to eliminate me from the Croatian parliament has undoubtedly resulted in a parliamentary crisis, for a crisis in the Chamber of Counties can easily be transferred to the Chamber of Representatives. I think the only way out of this situation is to reach an agreement between factors that lead to the crisis or new elections. [Modric] What kind of agreement are you talking about? [Manolic] It can be reached only if all parliamentary political parties meet and try to find a solution together. If there is no agreement, then there will have to be new elections and, in accordance with the view of the electoral body, a new parliament must be constituted. [Modric] Will you persist in the founding of a new party anyway, the party of Croatian Independent Democrats, as announced? [Manolic] Yes. I think that problems and differences within the HDZ, especially that of its leadership, which had already surfaced during the HDZ Second General Assembly, have piled up to the extent that it is impossible to avoid the division. In the HDZ, it is no longer possible to have any kind of critical political activity regarding the politics of the president of the country and the ruling party. [Modric] Will Stipe Mesic be a member of the steering committee of your new party? Some newspapers say that Mesic, before the last session of the HDZ Club, spent two hours with President Tudjman and then swore unconditional allegiance to him. President Tudjman personally confirmed that Joza Boljkovac was on his side. [Manolic] You see, in the present circumstances, one wrongly assumes that this is about my or Mesic's conflict with the president of the country and of the HDZ, that this is a conflict between people. However, the matter at issue is condemning a trend in politics. Differentiation is, therefore, not done according to "who is for and who is against the president," but "who is for the president's politics and who is against it." Therefore, people are divided around politics, and that is important. Consequently, what you ask me is irrelevant: is Mesic with me or not, am I with him or not. The important thing is for people to commit themselves on the state politics. That is a process that will not happen overnight but will last until we emerge as a political party. [Modric] When is that going to happen? [Manolic] Very soon. There are some elements that make us hurry. On one hand, the public is very excited because of those developments; it demands solutions and requires prominent politicians to make concrete steps. [Modric] Some of your opponents claim you rushed making political assessments. President Tudjman also said you were not very dangerous, for if you leave the HDZ, only 1 percent of the membership will follow you. [Manolic] President Tudjman has proved many times what his political judgment is like. Wrong! Involving Croatia in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the isolation on the international plane, abandoning traditional allies in Europe, seeking some allegedly salutary solutions only through negotiations with Milosevic, and much more -- all that speaks of the value of President Tudjman's judgment and the statement you asked me about can be viewed in that light, too. The statement about 1 percent of my followers is nothing but pure consolation for him and his bureaucracy. [Modric] In the fierce media campaign on the occasion of the "Manolic case," some newspapers like VECERNJI LIST suggest that a group demanding the resignation of Minister Susak could be responsible for the tragic explosion in Sesvete [the suburbs of Zagreb]. Jure Radic, in DANAS, has asked an important question: What will happen if it is established that those who demand the replacement of the defense minister are responsible for the explosion? [Manolic] First of all, when I demanded that Susak resign, I had no criminal acts in mind, but Susak's political responsibility for the tragedy of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Croats. I thought that, especially in the aftermath of the Washington agreement, the minister was disqualified by his war-mongering moves and statements that stirred up hatred between the Croats and the Muslims, the statement he made in the parliament that "Herzegovina is a part of Croatia," and an attempt to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was actually reckoning without the host [the Bosnians]. Therefore, I claimed that Susak had to be held responsible for his political actions. Similar demands of the opposition, after the explosion in Duboki Jarak, rely on different arguments, although we must say that the opposition has also been critical toward the politics of Minister Susak in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The explosion in Sesvete, however, requires a different kind of responsibility of the said minister. As those storehouses are the property of the Defense Ministry, the minister, naturally, must bear the consequences. Not because we find him "guilty before putting him on trial," but in order to enable a comprehensive and objective investigation. It cannot be done if the most responsible people hold on to their functions and they themselves appoint the so-called investigation commissions, which are then suspected of working for their benefit. Since, while there were still fires burning in Sesvete, newspapers published that the tragedy in Duboki Jarak was an "accident," we can say that there are some who want to cover it all up, and we cannot allow that. As for the speculation of Mr. Radic and those like him, they are very tasteless. As the most responsible man in the party, right next to the president, Radic should know that he can discuss the explosion only after a thorough and objective investigation.
