FR941125-2-00038 FR941125-2-00029 In early September 1991, the City of Tallahassee indicated that it no longer wished to proceed with the proposed project. The City indicated its willingness to cooperate with the effort to relocate the project, and other potential hosts for the project were then considered. Subsequently, the Department agreed to reassign the project to York County Energy Partners, a subsidiary of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., of Allentown, Pennsylvania. The new sponsors proposed to relocate the project from Tallahassee, Florida, to an industrial site adjacent to the J.E. Baker Company quarry and brick manufacturing operations in West Manchester Township, York County, Pennsylvania, and to operate the project as a cogeneration facility. Steam produced by the project would have been purchased by the J.E. Baker Company and electricity would have been purchased by Metropolitan Edison Company. All other major aspects of the project would have remained essentially unchanged from the original project. During the summer of 1992, York County Energy Partners sought opportunities for air emissions reductions from existing companies in the vicinity of the proposed project as a means of acquiring air emissions offsets. Discussions with P.H. Glatfelter Company indicated that the desired level of air emissions reductions could be achieved by relocating the project to P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility in North Codorus Township, if the proposed York County Energy Partners project could provide sufficient steam to largely displace an existing P.H. Glatfelter Company coal-fired boiler. Additionally, it was determined that the co-location of the proposed cogeneration project with P.H. Glatfelter Company's paper mill facility would enable York County Energy Partners to treat and recycle wastewater from the mill for use as cooling water at the proposed cogeneration facility, thereby greatly reducing the amount of fresh water used. Accordingly, on February 1, 1993, York County Energy Partners and P.H. Glatfelter Company issued a joint statement that they were evaluating the feasibility of relocating the proposed York County Energy Partners project to the North Codorus Township site. The Department was requested to consider York County Energy Partners' proposed site change. The Department issued its approval of the proposed site change in a memorandum dated June 23, 1993. Environmental Impact Statement Preparation The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Department determined that providing cost-shared funding for the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project constitutes a major Federal action that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment. Therefore, the Department has prepared a Draft Statement to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, on the human and natural environment. A Notice of Intent (Notice) to prepare an environmental impact statement and hold public scoping meetings was published in the Federal Register on July 29, 1993 (58 FR 40631). The Notice invited oral and written comments and suggestions on the proposed scope of the environmental impact statement, including environmental issues and alternatives, and invited public participation in the National Environmental Policy Act process. Scoping meetings were held on August 19, 1993 and October 5, 1993 in North Codorus Township and York, Pennsylvania, respectively. Overall, the Department received 614 comments. As a result of the scoping process, the Department developed an Environmental Impact Statement Implementation Plan to define the scope and to provide further guidance for preparing the environmental impact statement. The Draft Statement provides an analysis of information prepared to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the proposed construction and operation of the York County Energy Partners Project at the proposed site. This Draft Statement also considers the proposed action, an alternate site, and the no-action alternative, which includes a scenario that reasonably could be expected to result as a consequence of the no-action alternative. Impacts to human health, atmospheric resources, surface water, groundwater, socioeconomic resources (including environmental justice), noise, and traffic from construction and operation of the proposed York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project have been analyzed. Impacts to biological resources, biodiversity, floodplains, and wetlands are also considered. Floodplains/Wetlands Notification Pursuant to Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management) and the Department's Procedures for Compliance with Floodplains/Wetlands Environmental Review Requirements (10 CFR 1022), notification is provided that portions of electric connections and pipeline corridors proposed as components of the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Project would be constructed and operated in the 100-year floodplain (as depicted on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Insurance Rate Map; Panel Number 422223 0005, 0010 and Panel Number 422227 0005, 0010). In addition, portions of ladder tracks and a rail spur associated with the proposed project would also be located within the 100-year floodplain. A total of approximately 1.1 acres would be expected to be utilized for placement of these ancillary facilities within the 100-year floodplain. Small areas of the Codorus Creek's 100-year floodplain would be unavoidably impacted by development to connect the proposed project with utility (electric) substation facilities. Approximately 14 to 22 power line utility poles (required to provide a connection between the York County Energy Partners Cogeneration Facility and Metropolitan-Edison's existing Bair Substation) would be located within the 100-year floodplain of Codorus Creek. This electric interconnect would intersect the floodplain on property controlled by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and property owned by P.H. Glatfelter Company. It is estimated that 4&hyph;8 utility poles would be located on land belonging to P.H. Glatfelter Company, and 10&hyph;14 utility poles would be located on land controlled by the Army Corps of Engineers. Placement of these utility poles would impact approximately 0.013 acres of the 100-year floodplain. Construction and operation of these electrical connections (and their rights-of way) would be conducted in accord with relevant regulatory requirements and in consultation with appropriate regulatory agencies.
