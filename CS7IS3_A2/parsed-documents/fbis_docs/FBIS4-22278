According to scanty information obtained by the REUTER news agency, the Russian-American joint enterprise Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy International has concluded large-scale agreements on commercial launches of communications satellites with the European radio and television company Societe Europeenne des Satellites and a certain American telecommunications firm. Representatives of the cofounding firms of the joint enterprise confirmed signing of the agreements at a press conference in San Francisco (held during the night hours of Wednesday-Thursday, according to Moscow time), but the terms of the agreements remain secret for the time being. According to the REUTER agency, the agreements specifically envisage several launches of the Proton launch vehicle (one launch of Proton usually costs a foreign client $40 million-$60 million). The first launch is scheduled to take place in 1995. Today it is definitively clear that no participant in the world market of commercial space launches can ignore Russia's presence in this market. The aerospace joint enterprise Lockheed-Khrunichev-Energy International, established last year, presently controls about a third of this market, whose capacity amounts to $1.5 billion-$1.8 billion. The statements of the founders made at the press conference in San Francisco stood out for their confident, optimistic tone and confirmed the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts who last spring assessed the potential income of Russian aerospace firms at half a billion dollars (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 7 April 1993). "This is truly an outstanding achievement," stated Albert Smith, vice president of the space systems division of the major American corporation Lockheed, referring to the activity of the aerospace joint enterprise. Mr. Smith had every justification to make such a statement. As of today, the joint enterprise has already concluded contracts amounting to $600 million for the launch of communications satellites. True, the shares of participation of Lockheed, the State Space Scientific Production Center imeni M.V. Khrunichev (SSSPC), and the Energiya Scientific Production Association in the joint venture are not being divulged, but in any event Russia will not be a loser. SSSPC president Anatoliy Kiselev called the joint enterprise an example of mutually advantageous Russian-American cooperation and emphasized: "We are talking about the cooperation of equal partners." This seizure of position on the world market is being secured for the partners primarily by the Proton launch vehicles, produced by the imeni Khrunichev plant. Mr. Kiselev reminded journalists that these rockets brought great benefits to the Soviet military-industrial complex in their time. Today SSSPC is using them to lift the commercial satellites of telecommunications and radio and television broadcasting companies into orbit. Specifically, Proton launch vehicles will be put into operation for the international project Iridium, valued at $4 billion, whose chief investor is the American telecommunications corporation Motorola. The Center imeni Khrunichev also has its own package of shares in this project. An additional stimulus to the development of SSSPC is the January decree (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY 13 January) of the Russian Government, affording the center unprecedented rights in the establishment of the Russian state space program and the right to conclude independent contracts on the use of the Proton launch vehicle to effect commercial launches of foreign satellites. Forcing out a number of competing Russian organizations (including Glavkosmos) as a result, the Center imeni Khrunichev now has a good opportunity to fight with its foreign competitors, the most famous of which are China's space department ("Long March" rockets) and the European consortium Ariane (Ariane-4 rockets). The Proton surpasses its competitors with respect to the "price/throw weight" criterion. In addition, one of the chief problems of Russian producers has begun to lose its topicality--the importing of Western high-technology satellites used to be restricted by COCOM [Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls] prohibitions. For Russian firms it is extremely important that protectionism be definitively relegated to the past and that the determination of launch quotas be "entrusted" to the free market.
