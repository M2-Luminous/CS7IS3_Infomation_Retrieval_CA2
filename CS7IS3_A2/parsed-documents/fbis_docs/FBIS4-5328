However, it has been reported that you cannot make this trip. Is this true? And what are your reasons for it? [Khieu Samphan] Thank you comrade representative of the Voice of the Great National Union Front of Cambodia radio. I, like all cadres and members of the Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK], am very happy at the news that the king has been successfully treated, that he has recovered, and that he will return to Phnom Penh on 8 April. I sent his majesty a message saying that I and a PDK delegation will join our nation and people in greeting him and the queen at Pochentong airport on his return. His majesty the king replied to me and allowed me and the PDK delegation to see him and the queen on 13 April 1994. However, on 5 April 1994, there was a message from the king to the head of his secretariat in Phnom Penh informing me that the two-headed government has refused to provide security and an escort to protect me. The king is clearly aware that in such a situation it will not be safe for me to see him in Phnom Penh on 13 April 1994. Therefore, he is pleased to let me see him and the queen in Beijing in June instead. This royal message clearly shows the heart of the king concerning my safety. In his role as the father of the nation and of national reconciliation, he has always considered the PDK as a nationalist force which has joined our nation and people to struggle to defend and safeguard the nation and the Cambodian race under the king's national reconciliation banner so that Cambodia is independent, peaceful, and neutral with its territorial integrity. I would like to take this opportunity to express once again my deepest gratitude to his majesty the king for his lofty initiative above. In sum, the king is pleased to let me see him on 13 April 1994. However, there has been opposition to the king's reception of me and on my call on him. This is the story and the reason for my failure to call on the king and the queen in Phnom Penh. This is trampling on the constitution and preventing the king from having any right or role. Any word or the slightest activity by the king along the line of national reconciliation has been opposed. By who? In form, it seems as though the two-headed government is opposed to my meeting with the king. However, the truth is that the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, namely the United States, France, and Australia, are against this. They are opposing the efforts of the king and of all nationalist forces on national reconciliation. They are only thinking about fueling the war of the communist Vietnamese. [Correspondent] So, it is no longer possible for you to go to Phnom Penh. This will be an obstacle to national reconciliation and to a solution for peace. What do you think should be done? [Khieu Samphan] To answer this question we should examine the reasons why the communist Vietnamese, their allies, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government are against my meeting the king on 13 April. This is because they are afraid of the national force and our people, in particular they are afraid of the force of the masses in Phnom Penh which has been growing in strength. Our nation and people oppose them and demand national reconciliation and an end to the communist Vietnamese aggressors' war. Our nation and people clearly see that the communist Vietnamese, their allies, and their lackeys are the ones fueling the war. Our nation and people clearly realize that their tragedy and suffering are due to the communist Vietnamese aggressors and their allies, the communist Vietnamese puppets, and the two-headed government who think only of the war, of continuing the fighting, and of levying taxes from the people and using this money to serve the war. What little money that has been begged from foreigners has also been thrown into the war. The communist Vietnamese have annexed Cambodian territory in the east at will and have brought nearly four million Vietnamese nationals into Cambodia at will. The two-headed government is indifferent to this. The economy has hit the bottom. Social problems are getting serious and are deteriorating and these people remain completely indifferent. They are implementing the strategy of the communist Vietnamese and their allies in using a military war to kill the people and the Democratic Kampuchean force. They think that if they can destroy Democratic Kampuchea, they will kill the king politically and other nationalist forces and that they will run Cambodia through their fascist and barbarous policy. As for the communist Vietnamese, they will annex Cambodia at will. They are thinking along this line and are implementing this policy. (Khieu Samphan continues] However, our entire nation and people, in the rural areas, in Phnom Penh, and abroad, are well aware of all this. They have cooperated and carried out activities everywhere through various forms to oppose all these warmongers. Look at how these people are being entangled with their policy to fuel the war! What have they solved through the military war so far? What is the situation on the Anlung Veng battlefield? The Pailin battlefield situation will be moving toward that of Anlung Veng; it is just a question of time. It is the same situation on other battlefields. Therefore, using a military war to destroy the national force and that of Democratic Kampuchea will not work. Thousands of social problems will get more serious. All this is a large chunk of rock hanging down from the two-headed government's neck. This rock is getting heavier and heavier. The government cannot get out of this. If it continues to fuel the war, it will certainly die. Why? This is because of the strength of the great national union force. Our entire nation and people are uniting around the king's national reconciliation policy. This is a mighty force. The communist Vietnamese, their Western allies, their puppets and lackeys, and the two-headed government certainly cannot win against this mighty force. This has been successively borne by history. This is the current situation. In sum, although they -- the communist Vietnamese, the Western allies, their puppets and lackeys, and the two-headed government -- strive to oppose the king, national reconciliation, peace, and to continue to fuel the war, they certainly cannot win against the force of the nation and the people who, in cooperation with the king, need to end the war and need peace and national reconciliation. The national reconciliation trend is very powerful; nothing can stop this.
