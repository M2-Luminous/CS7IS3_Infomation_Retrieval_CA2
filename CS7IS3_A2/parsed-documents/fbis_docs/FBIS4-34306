Returning from Colombia yesterday, the presidents said Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez said he would announce Spain's incorporation into the BCIE [Central American Economic Integration Bank] as a foreign country member in 30 days. In addition, the regional presidents secured Colombia's pledge to become a member and contribute $700 million, to be disbursed in two installments, one in 1994, the other next year. Argentina will also bolster the BCIE capital with $60 million, as will Venezuela, with a possible contribution of $122.5 million.

The presidents said Spain decided to disburse $100 million of a $500-million fund earmarked for Central America on the occasion of the fifth centennial commemoration last year. This disbursement will be used to reinforce a high voltage electric interconnection network between the regional countries. The Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] will support financing of the project with a $350-million loan. The presidents said Spain has put a $380-million fund at the disposal of Central America and other countries of the continent as a complement to the aid the IDB is offering to Latin America. The area presidents also spotlighted the unity that prevails among them.
