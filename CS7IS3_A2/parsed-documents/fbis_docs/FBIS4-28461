FBIS4-28461 "dreas112_q_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 AUSTRALASIA Australia Senator Suggests Bougainville Peace Possible Senator Suggests Bougainville Peace Possible BK0806121494 Melbourne Radio Australia in English 0630 GMT 8 Jun 94 BK0806121494 Melbourne Radio Australia English BFN [From the "International Report" program] [Text] An Australian parliamentary delegation believes a settlement of the five-year old Bougainville secessionist conflict may be reached in a matter of months. The five parliamentarians visited Bougainville in April and also held discussions with the Papua New Guinea [PNG] Government and Defense Forces. The report of the delegation's visit, which had been tabled today in Parliament, concludes that there can be no military solution to the conflict and recommends a timetable be set for a peaceful resolution. It also suggested the Australian military may have a role to play in rebuilding the island. Labor senator Stephen Loosley, who as head of the delegation last week handed the copy of the report to the PNG Government, outlined its conclusions to Lyndal Curtis in Canberra. [Begin recording] [Loosley] The peace process ought to work on the basis of the participants that are parties to the conflict talking directly within an agreed framework, with an agreed agenda with a person agreed by both sides as being suitable to chair the talks on the basis of a timeframe that is known to everyone, so that the focus is there and that people are conscious of their responsibilities. We have been heartened by the responses that has come from both PNG and from the Bougainville interim government. [Curtis] What about the concept of a South Pacific regional peacekeeping force raised by Sir Julian Chan? Is that a valid concept? [Loosley] Yes, is very valid. The notion of neighboring South Pacific countries playing a role is one that the delegation recogizes would have very positive consequences. On that basis, there is a specific recommendation that ought to be an option. Our view as a delegation was that Australia should work in concert with PNG to resolve the crisis. What we are saying is that a cease-fire having been implemented and effective border management having become the norm between Bougainville and the Solomons, then humanitarian assistance ought to be able to flow very freely across the island to the areas of greatest need. And in that respect, we have suggested that the island be opened up to a range of humanitarian organizations, nongovernment organizations, the churches to make certain that humanitarian assistance and support flows to areas of very real need. [Curtis] Is the will there in the PNG cabinet for, say, a regional peacekeeping force or for a wider peace process to work. [Loosley] My belief is very clearly that it is. Last week as a courtesy to the Government of Papua New Guinea, I took an advance copy of the report to Port Moresby for the foreign minister, Sir Julius Chan, and for Prime Minister Wingti, and the response was very positive in terms of people having had an opportunity to talk with me about our delegation's findings. And subsequent to that, of course, we have learned that there are ongoing discussions between the parties to the conflict which again is a very positive step, a major step forward. So, in terms of the resolve, I believe that within the Government of PNG the resolve exists. [Curtis] Does Australia have a role to play in the peace process, or is the fact that the BRA [Bouganiville Revolutionary Army] sees Australia as far too close to the PNG militarily rules us out? [Loosley] I think that is less true now than when it was a year or two ago. The delegation worked very hard at being as open- minded and evenhanded as we could, both in terms of the briefings that we undertook to have prior to our departure and the discussions that we had within PNG and subsequent to our return, and the letter that I have had from Mr. (Moses Seveni), who is the representative in Australia of the Bougainville interim government, has been very positive in terms of our delegation's visit. And my view is Australia therefore has a role to play in terms of supporting the peace process, in terms of logistical assistance, in terms of following through, once the peace process is hopefully proved successful, as I trust it will. And in that respect, we are talking very much in terms of rehabilitation and reconstruction. [Curtis] Is there any role to play in the military [word indistinct]? [Loosley] Our delegation is of the view that the Australian defense cooperation program could quite reasonably and realistically be extended to Bougainville in that type of effort -- road building, bridge building, the provision of infrastructure, health care, schools, things of that nature -- a very positive constribution at which our military have proved so able in terms of the defense cooperation program in West PNG and other parts of the country and of course, in other peacekeeping operations. [Curtis] Could that potentially mean Australian troops on the ground in Bougainville helping in rebuilding effort? [Loosley] I don't know that we would be looking to move in that direction quickly, if at all. I certainly think that there is a role for the defense cooperation program to be extended, though, in order to make sure that those skills are available to PNG to embark upon further rehabilitation and reconstruction. There will have to be a clear peace settlement in place and security very clearly defined and guaranteed before it would be a circumstance where that kind of intitiative could be taken. [Curtis] How about the question of human rights and claims of breaches of human rights during the conflict? [Loosley] Yes, we endeavored to address that very directly. We have urged the Government of PNG to look at the Amnesty International report on human rights abuses by both sides as a benchmark. We have been heartened by the announcement by Prime Minister Wingti of Human Rights Commission for PNG and also of a police complaints unit to be located on Buka Island. So the response to date has been positive. We are firmly of the view that there has to be a process of accountability. The delegation's view was that the rule of law must return to Bougainville in an evenhanded way and circumstances of human rights abuses be judged on the basis of evidence in a fair and reasonable way and those responsible be brought to justice and be made accountable. [Curtis] In your view and the committee's view, is it reasonable to expect that the conflict on Bougainville will be finally resolved in a matter of months? [Loosley] That would certainly be our hope. In terms of the time to make peace, I don't think there has been a better opportunity for negotiations and discussions and for peace settlement and reconciliation. [end recording]
