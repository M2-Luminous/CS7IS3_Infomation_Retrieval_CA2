Background On December 20, 1993, REA published an interim rule (58 FR 66250) to incorporate changes to telephone loan policies required by RELRA (107 Stat. 1356). RELRA amended several provisions of the Rural Electrification Act of 1936, as amended (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq .) (RE Act), and mandated a restructuring of the telephone loan program. REA received 81 comments regarding the interim rule. Overall, the greatest concern on the part of the responding organizations was 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B, the State Telecommunications Modernization Plan (modernization plan). Because of the overwhelming response regarding the modernization plan, related concerns and possible modifications will be resolved in a separate notification. This notice addresses comments on parts of the interim rule other than 7 CFR part 1751, subpart B. All comments were taken into consideration in preparing the final rule. Comments were received from the following:
