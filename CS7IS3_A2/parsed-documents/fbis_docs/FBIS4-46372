He said that the notion of forming an Islamic political party is good for presenting concepts from an Islamic perspective under the National Authority. But, he added, there are drawbacks, such as the need to obtain a permit from the Authority to set up such a party. This Authority has not been elected or established by the masses. Al-Yazuri continued by saying that he is inclined to form an opposition front that includes all factions opposed to the agreement because this front, unlike a party, would not need a permit from the Authority. According to al-Yazuri, the Authority established by the agreements signed in Oslo and Cairo has conceded many Palestinian rights and there is nothing positive about it other than the return of the Palestinian police and deportees. Al-Yazuri denied recent statements made by Major General Nasr Yusuf [commander of the Palestinian police] that the latter has contacted or met with Dr. al-Yazuri to discuss last week's incidents of kidnapping and killing agents. He stressed that he has no knowledge of such meetings or contacts, adding that this claim is baseless.
