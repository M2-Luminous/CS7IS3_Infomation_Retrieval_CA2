FBIS4-23517 "drafr110_d_94015" FBIS-AFR-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 SOUTHERN AFRICA Mozambique Cease-Fire Commission Meetings Postponed Cease-Fire Commission Meetings Postponed MB0806133894 Maputo MEDIAFAX in Portuguese 8 Jun 94 p 1 MB0806133894 Maputo MEDIAFAX Portuguese BFN [Text] Aldo Ajello has categorically denied allegations that the government has withdrawn from the CCF [Cease-Fire Commission]. In its edition yesterday under the title "Is Peace Already Burning?" IMPARCIAL, widely regarded as a mirror of Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance] positions, reported: "The government yesterday indefinitely suspended, without any explanation, its participation in the CCF, in the most serious incident between the former warring factions since the General Peace Accord was signed." "It is a lie," Ajello said, when we contacted him yesterday morning to learn whether the government had effectively withdrawn from the CCF. "What happened was this: The government has requested for the suspension of the meetings of all commissions scheduled for this week, due to meetings Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front] is holding at present. Nothing else." Ajello says that the government's request was made through Ambassador Francisco Madeira, diplomatic adviser to President Chissano. In a telephone interview, Madeira confirmed these reports to MEDIAFAX. "We only requested the postponement of planned meetings. We needed time to consider all issues so that we may hold productive meetings. We shall meet again on 10 June." The UN special representative confirmed that "the postponement is not for the whole week, just until the evening of 9 June. On 10 June there will be a tripartite meeting of the CCF which will be followed by the regular meeting on 13 June. The CSC [Supervision and Control Commission] will meet on 14 June." Ajello commented: "At present nothing is happening that should be described as alarming." We asked Francisco Madeira whether there was a serious obstacle within the government affecting the process of the demobilization of soldiers. "Not at all. We are still committed to this process. Ajello himself has already confirmed the list of 5,000 soldiers which we have confined, and within a few days the government will once again present the list of soldiers to be demobilized." Regarding the differences between the government and CCF Chairman Colonel Pier Segala, Ajello reiterated what he had already said: "The government has withdrawn the charges against Colonel Segala." In yesterday's edition of NOTICIAS, Lieutenant Colonel Osorio Mateus denied Ajello's allegations, saying the government maintained the charges against Segala. "Deputy Minister Tomas Salomao, the government's representative in the CSC, has twice agreed with my proposal for the government to withdraw the charges." "And it was on 17 May, not on 27 May," Ajello added, referring to the relevant date mentioned by Osorio Mateus. Madeira told MEDIAFAX that, "there has been a misunderstanding over the whole of this issue." "Within a few days everything will be clarified."
