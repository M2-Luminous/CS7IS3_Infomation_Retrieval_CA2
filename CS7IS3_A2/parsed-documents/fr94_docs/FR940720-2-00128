FR940720-2-00128 FR940720-2-00073 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION [Release No. 34&hyph;34371; File No. S7&hyph;24&hyph;89] Joint Industry Plan; Order Approving Amendment No. 1 to Reporting Plan for Nasdaq/National Market Securities Traded on an Exchange on an Unlisted or Listed Basis, Submitted by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the American, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges July 13, 1994. On July 12, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the American, Boston, Chicago, and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges (collectively, ``Participants'') 1 submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to a joint transaction reporting plan (``Plan'') for Nasdaq/National Market securities traded on an exchange on an unlisted or listed basis. 2 The Commission is approving the proposed amendment to the Plan and trading pursuant to the Plan on a temporary basis to expire on January 12, 1995. 1 The signatories to the Plan, i.e., the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''), and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex''), Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Chx'') (previously, the Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc.), Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Phlx''), and the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE''), are the ``Participants.'' The BSE, however, joined the Plan as a ``Limited Participant,'' and reports quotation information and transaction reports only in Nasdaq/National Market (previously referred to as ``Nasdaq/NMS'') securities listed on the BSE. 2 See letter from T. Grant Callery, Vice President, NASD, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, dated July 11, 1994 (``1994 Extension Request''). The 1994 Extension Request also requests the Commission to continue to provide exemptive relief, previously granted in connection with the Plan on a temporary basis, from Rules 11Ac1&hyph;2 and 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''). I. Introduction The Commission originally approved the Plan on June 26, 1990. 3 The Plan governs the collection, consolidation and dissemination of quotation and transaction information for Nasdaq/National Market securities listed on an exchange or traded on an exchange pursuant to a grant of unlisted trading privileges (``UTP''). 4 The Commission approved trading pursuant to the Plan on a one-year pilot basis, with the pilot period to commence when transaction reporting pursuant to the Plan commenced. Accordingly, the pilot period commenced on July 12, 1993, and was scheduled to expire on July 12, 1994. 5 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28146 (June 26, 1990), 55 FR 27917 (``1990 Plan Approval Order''). 4 Section 12(f)(2) of the Act permits the Commission to grant UTP to securities traded over-the-counter (``OTC/UTP''), but requires the Commission, prior to such grant, to consider: The public trading activity in such security, the character of such trading, the impact of such extension on the existing markets for such securities, and the desirability of removing impediments to and the progress that has been made toward the development of a national market system and [the Commission] shall not grant any such application if any rule of the national securities exchange making application under this subsection would unreasonably impair the ability of any dealer to solicit or effect transactions in such security for his own account, or would unreasonably restrict competition among dealers in such security or between such dealers acting in the capacity of market makers who are specialists and such dealers who are not specialists. For further background on the statutory history of OTC/UTP, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21498 (November 16, 1984), 49 FR 46156. 5 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Foley & Lardner, to Betsy Prout, Commission, dated May 9, 1994. As originally approved by the Commission, the Plan required the Participants to complete their negotiations regarding revenue sharing during the one-year pilot period. The Participants, however, have not yet come to an agreement concerning revenue sharing for transactions effected pursuant to the Plan. Proposed Amendment No. 1 to the Plan extends this negotiation period for an additional six months. In conjunction with the Plan, on a temporary basis also scheduled to expire on July 12, 1994, the Commission granted an exemption from Rule 11Ac1&hyph;2 under the Act regarding the calculated best bid and offer (``BBO''), and granted the BSE an exemption from the provision of Rule 11Aa3&hyph;1 under the Act that requires transaction reporting plans to include market identifiers for transaction reports and last sale data. At the request of the Participants, this order extends these exemptions through July 12, 1995, provided that the Plan continues in effect through that date pursuant to a Commission order. II. Background The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (``1975 Amendments'') directed the Commission to facilitate the development of a national market system for securities, consistent with certain objectives, including ``fair competition *␣*␣* between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets.'' The legislative history of the 1975 Amendments makes clear that many active OTC stocks were expected to be part of the national market system. The 1975 Amendments also authorized the Commission to grant OTC/UTP to exchanges if certain conditions were met. The Commission generally deferred granting exchanges OTC/UTP pending progress on the development of the national market system. In 1985, however, the Commission noted that since the enactment of the 1975 Amendments, important developments had occurred in the OTC market; these developments led the Commission to reconsider its position on OTC/UTP. 6 The Commission announced in its 1985 OTC/UTP Release its willingness to grant UTP to national securities exchanges in NMS Securities, 7 conditioned in part on the approval of a plan submitted by interested exchanges and the NASD to consolidate and disseminate exchange and OTC quotation data and transaction data in OTC securities upon which UTP is granted. 8 The exchanges and the NASD have been negotiating the terms of a plan, under the oversight of the Commission staff, since that time. 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22412 (September 16, 1985), 50 FR 38640 (``1985 OTC/UTP Release''). 7 Congress envisioned that National Market System Securities (``NMS Securities'') would include those equity securities whose characteristics of size, earnings history, breadth of ownership, and investor interest made them suitable for auction-market trading. See Senate Comm. on Banking, Housing & Urb. Affs., Report to Accompany S. 249: Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, S. Rep. No. 75, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 16 (1975). NMS Securities are designated pursuant to Rule 11Aa2&hyph;1, 17 CFR 240.11Ac1&hyph;2, adopted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 16590 (February 19, 1980), 45 FR 12391. 8 See 1985 OTC/UTP Release, supra note 6. In its 1985 OTC/UTP Release, the Commission also determined that although it was premature to require any specific type of market linkage prior to the initiation of trading, the exchanges must provide OTC market makers direct telephone access to the exchange specialist in UTP securities to facilitate intermarket trading in those securities. The Commission determined to grant OTC/UTP to an exchange only if the exchange provided Nasdaq market makers access to the exchange market in the subject securities to the same extent that Nasdaq market makers provide specialists access to the Nasdaq market maker trading facilities. In 1985, the Commission also stated that it expected Nasdaq market makers to provide exchange members with fair and efficient access to the OTC market, and that if the Commission became aware of any limitation on such access, it would take prompt remedial action. The Commission further noted that it did not believe that a more sophisticated intermarket linkage need be in place during the initial stages of trading OTC/UTP securities, but encouraged the NASD and the exchanges to forge their own initiatives in facilitating computerized intermarket trading linkages and adopting trade-through rules for these securities. The 1985 OTC/UTP Release also conditioned the grant of OTC/UTP on the exchanges not applying their off-board trading restrictions to those securities.
