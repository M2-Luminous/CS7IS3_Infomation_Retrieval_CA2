Honda already has plants in the United States and Canada, and will be the first Japanese motor vehicle maker with production centers in all three countries, coming under the cognizance of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) which went into effect in January 1994. In proceeding with its plant in Mexico, Honda was most concerned about the reaction from the United States and Canada. Although economic borders have been deemphasized by NAFTA, national boundaries still exist in a strict political sense. The events that transpired prior to the announcement of Honda's plans remind Japanese firms of these routine realities. The ceremony to sign the agreement for construction of the passenger car plant was held in the afternoon of 9 May (early morning on the 10th, Japan time) at the Mexican presidential office. Honda was represented at the ceremony by Vice President Hidemune Munekuni and Managing Director Takakazu Amemiya stationed in the United States as well as Deputy Secretary of Commerce and Industry Ugarte of Mexico. The press conference that was to be held by the Honda representatives after the ceremony was canceled because the latter had run behind schedule, but the Mexican side displayed a pervasive welcoming mood. According to the plans, Honda will build a passenger car plant adjacent to its motorcycle plant located on the outskirts of Guadalajara, the second-largest city in Mexico. The project is valued at $50 million and will commence in July of this year. Production of the midsized "Accords" will start in November 1995 at an annual production rate of 15,000 units a year, earmarked for sale in Mexico. In the future, production will be increased to 30,000 units a year to provide for exports to Central and South America. From the Mexican Government's perspective, Honda's plans will provide 500 jobs and a source for earning foreign currency. They will also have a major impact on the development of parts industries. It can be said that it is only logical that the government welcomes Honda's new plant. However, Honda itself was more concerned with the reaction from the United States and Canada. During the NAFTA debate of last fall, a heated exchange of views took place in the U.S. Congress. Congressmen opposed to NAFTA used Japan as the primary basis for their position, arguing, "NAFTA will benefit only Japanese businesses, which will take advantage of the low labor rates in their Mexican plants to wage an export offensive on the United States." In the end, NAFTA passed both houses of Congress with the majority in favor of the bill in both chambers. However, many congressmen who were opposed to NAFTA were perennially critical of Japanese cars and benefited from political support from the United Auto Workers (UAW). Honda's opening of an automobile plant in Mexico could influence U.S. congressional hardliners on Japan and have a subtle effect on the course of the Japan-U.S. trade talks. Honda had perceived the existence of the above-discussed atmosphere and has taken a cautionary stance from early on as reflected in Vice President Munekuni's statement, "Even if Honda decides to open an automotive plant in Mexico, it will have nothing to do with NAFTA." The recent announcement of the plant opening did not contain any reference to NAFTA. Additionally, the announcement included the statement, "There are no plans to export to the United States or Canada." This one statement runs the risk of limiting Honda in the future if the political or economic situation should undergo changes in the future. However, Honda felt it was necessary to send a message of its intentions to U.S. congressional and UAW sources even though it was aware of that risk. Potential problems also lurked in Canada. Honda's Plant No. 1 and Plant No. 2 in Ohio have a combined annual capacity of 500,000 vehicles, while its Canadian plant has a capacity of only 100,000 units, which is far from the break-even point of 200,000 units. Canadian Government sources expressed concern, saying, "We hope you have no intent of closing the Canadian plant after opening the Mexican plant." Honda responded to such concerns. On 4 May, it announced that "Civics" produced at the Canadian plant would be exported to Taiwan and Brazil. The timing of the announcement was superb as it was made five days before the news release on the Mexican plant. The number of exports will total only about 1,000 units during the year, but the announcement served to appease the Canadian government. Designating the Mexican plant for production of the midsized Accord rather than the small Civic was an action taken to distinguish the Mexican plant from the Canadian plant, which specializes in production of the Civic. Honda had initiated its feasibility study for the Mexican plant in 1992, before the debate on NAFTA assumed serious proportions. Mexico's laws prohibit the import and sales of vehicles made by manufacturers that do not operate plants in that country. The foremost objective of opening a plant in Mexico was to establish the basis for participating in the Mexican automotive market, which has a promising future. Notwithstanding, Honda needed to recognize the political consideration with respect to the United States and Canada. The implementation of NAFTA unified the U.S., Canadian, and Mexican markets and lowered economic barriers. Tariffs applicable to the automotive sector were either abolished or reduced. The change provided for a significant expansion of options available to private businesses that seek globalization of their activities. However, NAFTA also has the effect of allowing immediate expansion of Mexican business activities in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Thus, it is only logical that the U.S. and Canadian Governments show concern about movements by Mexican-based Japanese businesses. Lowering of national economic barriers has resulted in the "extension" of political influence beyond national borders. Honda officials admit, "If NAFTA did not exist, we would not have to exercise so much concern about U.S. and Canadian positions." Honda is a pacesetter for globalization of Japanese businesses. Despite its posture in that respect, Honda has been forced to exercise a higher degree of political sensitivity than that of the past. Japanese businesses are plagued by an ironic phenomenon wherein the lowering of economic barriers has been replaced by the need to exercise strong awareness of political barriers.
