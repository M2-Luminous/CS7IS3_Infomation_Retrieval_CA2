FR940223-2-00034 FR940223-2-00024 [Docket No. CP93&hyph;261&hyph;001] Algonquin Gas Transmission Co.; Amendment February 16, 1994. Take notice that on February 15, 1994, Algonquin Gas Transmission Company (Algonquin), located at 1284 Soldiers Field Road, Boston, Massachusetts 02135, filed an amendment in Docket No. CP93&hyph;261&hyph;001, pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act, requesting a certificate of public convenience and necessity authorizing Algonquin to construct and operate facilities and to transport and deliver a total of approximately 14,758 MMbtu of natural gas per day on a firm basis to Bay State Gas Company (Bay State), all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Algonquin states that the withdrawal of New England Power from the AFT&hyph;5 project has resulted in a reduction in the service and facility requirements originally proposed. Specifically, Algonquin now proposes to: (1) Construct and operate 3.8 miles of 16-inch loop on Algonquin's I&hyph;2 system from Valve I&hyph;22 to the Brockton Meter Station in Brockton, Massachusetts; (2) upgrade Turbine Nos. C&hyph;7 and C&hyph;8 to 4,700 hp at the Cromwell Compressor Station in Cromwell, Massachusetts; and (3) make various modifications to metering and regulating facilities in Waterford and Pomfret, Connecticut and in Ashland, Brockton and Norwood, Massachusetts. The cost of Algonquin's proposed facilities is estimated to be $13,139,000. Algonquin would provide the firm transportation service for Bay State under proposed Rate Schedule AFT&hyph;5, and would charge a 100% demand rate of $19.3606 per MMbtu for the incremental service. Algonquin seeks a shortened notice period and expeditious Commission action in order to construct the necessary facilities and commence the proposed service by November 1, 1994. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said petition should, on or before February 23, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission), 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, a petition to intervene or protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214) and the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a petition to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. Any person who has heretofore filed need not file again. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4017 Filed 2&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
