The crisis is being prolonged because of a lack of unity in the world community, Francis Briquemont, former commander of the U.N. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia, said in the local media. Earlier this month, NATO issued two ultimatums to the Bosnian serbs but did not imposed the same pressure on the other two warring sides, Muslims and Croats, he explained. General Briquemont, who retired from the post in January, stressed that the "game of two against one" can only deepen the crisis. Differences on Bosnia among the big powers has led the warring sides to have a "wrong vision" and to make "wrong judgements", the general added. Along with a common strategy, Briquemont indicated, the world community must make it clear to the warring parties that "the use of arms will not resolve any problems, but will only hurt each nationality". Referring to NATO air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions, the general said that representatives of the United Nations should not give in to "political pressure" by asking for such action. The general further stated that air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs will not resolve the crisis.
