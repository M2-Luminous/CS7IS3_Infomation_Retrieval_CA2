The Slovak Agricultural and Foodstuffs Inspection Service in Bratislava is testing to see whether a product meets our standards and issues appropriate certificates. Every day, businessmen come to Bratislava to find out if everything is all right or whether some additional certificate or certification is required. These are not easy to obtain. A Slovak businessman must obtain a certificate from the country from which he is importing to indicate that the manufacturer is well known to state offices there. "To travel to Turkey or Malaysia to chase down a manufacturer and to convince him that in Slovakia the authorities want to see his documentation that indicates that he is authorized to produce the product is expensive. If the manufacturer does not have such a document, do I have to look for an independent state organ in the country in question and ask, say, a Spanish office to issue a document for a Spanish manufacturer? And, in the final analysis, I will have to find and pay for a translator. And what if six of us import items from a single firm to Slovakia?" is a question by one of the worried businessmen standing in the passageway, who chose, rather, not to order a product for four weeks now. "I import material from a distributor who has the exclusive rights for all of East Europe. I cannot imagine how I can explain to him that he must find some kind of certificate for me," says an importer of chocolate products angrily. The quest for documents and certificates does not end when the application and all certificates are submitted. Even the customs officials have no idea what to check on. If a businessman wants to bring a sample across the border for testing purposes, he requires a certificate indicating that it is a test sample. In importing agricultural raw materials for subsequent processing, a document indicating that the product in question is an "uncertified" product is required. "We shall have to include the costs of all of the `expediting' moves requiring visits to manufacturers and official authorities in Italy, Austria, Turkey, or Spain, as well as the costs of translations in our prices. Added to these will be the cost of traveling from our firm to Bratislava several times each week," say several of the businessmen. "And, after all of our peculiarities, I believe that Slovak products will be competitive," added a beer importer.
