FR940930-0-00026 FR940930-0-00005 The industry-wide cost for adding the three data items at issue would be a one-time programming and testing cost of approximately $34,000, ten carriers at $3,400 per carrier. Once the programming is in place, the annual cost to the carriers would be approximately $1,000 per carrier. The economic benefits to the industry, as well as to the consumer, far outweigh the cost of supplying the data. Eliminating the exclusion of flights that are delayed by mechanical problems in the carriers' on-time performance reports should result in a net savings to the air carriers. Delta stated that the mechanical exclusion has caused it to incur unnecessary expenses. While the elimination of the mechanical exclusion will require carriers to report more data to DOT, the carriers will not be required to identify the cause of the delays and to filter out those flights delayed by mechanical problems. The end result will be better consumer information and a cost savings to the reporting air carriers. The NPRM estimated the elimination of the mechanical exclusion should save the airline industry at least $154,000. Although the Department encouraged carriers to comment on this estimate, Delta was the only carrier that did; however, Delta did not quantify costs. A regulatory evaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. In the notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department estimated there was a potential annual savings to the airline industry and to the general public of $85 million. This rule is consistent with the objectives of the executive order because the rule creates market based incentives for carriers to improve their on-time flight performance by providing consumers with superior information with which to make informed choices. The amendments to 14 CFR Part 234 enable the Department to readily verify that the carriers are in compliance with the reporting requirements. The Department will be able to match a carrier's reported flights with the carrier's scheduled flights as listed in the Official Airline Guide . Previously, such a matching was not possible, because carriers did not report qualifying mechanical delays and mechanical cancellations. Title 14 CFR Part 234 does not specify an on-time flight performance standard which carriers must meet. Rather, the carriers' reports provide consumers with information on carrier performance, which the consumer may use in carrier selection. On-time flight performance data are pertinent information for state or local airport operators. The Port Authority filed in support of the amendments to 14 CFR 234. The amendments to 14 CFR Part 234 simplify carrier reporting by eliminating the special, and sometimes complicated, treatment of flights affected by mechanical delays. The three new data items were added at the request of the FAA, who will now be able to use the existing data base as a more complete source of information for airport and enroute delay studies. This action negates the need for the FAA to create a data base of its own. Executive Order 12612
