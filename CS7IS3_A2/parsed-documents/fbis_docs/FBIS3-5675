Tan Sri Haji Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik, chairman of the UMNO Youth Movement, said it would be good for the SUNDAY TIMES to promise not to publish baseless and untrue reports about Malaysia to ensure that the economic interests of the two nations are maintained. In a statement issued in Melaka, the movement also severely criticized the provocative attitude of the SUNDAY TIMES, which urged the British Government to retaliate against Malaysia by freezing payments to the Pergau hydroelectric plant project. Malaysia should be prepared for any eventuality, in case the British Government is really forced to bow to the wishes and pressure of the SUNDAY TIMES which led to the Malaysian Government's decision not to award government contracts to British companies.
