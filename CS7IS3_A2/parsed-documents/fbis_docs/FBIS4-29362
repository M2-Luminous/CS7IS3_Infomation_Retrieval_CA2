Hata made the request, the first of its kind to be done formally, during a breakfast meeting with power industry leaders, including Kohei Abe, head of the Federation of Electric Power Companies. Hata said the power industry should reflect "anticipation of the Japanese people" in its rate policy. Abe said the industry will decide whether or not to extend the rate cut by considering economic conditions like crude oil prices. In November 1993, power and gas utilities implemented a temporary cut in their rates, valid until Sept. 30, to pass on to consumers the benefits of the yen's appreciation against the dollar. On construction of nuclear power plants, Abe, president of Chubu Electric Power Co., said the industry will give priority to safety and environmental protection in selecting new locations. Large-lot industrial power demand is still slack amid the overall economic slump, Abe said. But he added power demand will turn up in a long-term, increasing the importance of nuclear power plants.
