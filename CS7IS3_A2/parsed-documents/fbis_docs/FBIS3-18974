The newspaper put a discussion of whether the minister was quoted correctly in connection with the selection of the Foreign Ministry's East European Aid Committee, which deals with technical and administrative aid, on the front page. A formality that suddenly became interesting. However, the newspaper did not find it interesting a month earlier when the entire Folketing (with the exception of the Progress Party) agreed on the total substance during an interpellation concerning the whole future of East European aid. At any rate it was not on the front page or subsequent pages. That is a pity, for the interesting discussion was important. People should take a stand on how East European aid is to be administered and prioritized in the future if only because of the large sums of money that are involved. More than 2 billion kroner has been set aside for East European aid in 1994, which corresponds to one-third of what is spent on aid in the rest of the world. This money can be a good investment if it is used correctly. The money can help stabilize the budding democracies in the former communist countries, and reducing water and air pollution will also improve the Danish environment. At the same time, it is realized that there is reason to fear unrest and refugees from these countries unless we help them get off to a good start. Denmark has something to contribute to this kind of good start in several areas: In the environmental and energy sector Denmark is on the leading edge of development. We have good possibilities for the continued development of environmental technology and knowledge, and with a goal-oriented effort we could also help Danish firms to increase exports. The government's new report on trade and industry points to the need to develop the welfare sector. Denmark has a lot of experience and expertise in this area that could be utilized to export systems. Among other things it mentions the possibility of exporting services to countries in East and Central Europe. A concrete positive example is systems exports in the gerontology area. It is necessary to make a connection between expanding the social networks in the East European countries and building up a market economy. Just as an expanded commercial infrastructure is necessary to help the Danish commercial sector build up exports. In the future this will provide opportunities in energy, communications, and transportation projects, as well as housing and education projects. The labor market is also relevant to systems exports. A solid labor market system contributes to political stability and firms that are already partly owned by western capital are demanding parity and cooperative organs. The Danish provisions for aid to the East should include conditions on good job environment and social safety net considerations. This will counteract "social dumping" from the East, and at the same time, enable us to improve employment here at home by exporting services and welfare programs. All this will be discussed in the weeks ahead by the East European Aid Committees that have been set up in several of the ministries. It will be debated by the Folketing spokesmen on East Europe and the minister in charge of the area.
