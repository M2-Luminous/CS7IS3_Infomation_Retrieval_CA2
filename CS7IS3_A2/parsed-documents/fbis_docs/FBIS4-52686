It is important to have economists reaffirm their opposition to numerical targets. Even though some observers claim the United States will not use them as the basis for punitive sanctions, we cannot be sure that will be true. 2. There is no good reason why Japan should be in a hurry to reopen comprehensive trade talks. The U.S. trade strategy is under attack at home. An easy compromise was rendered moot by the failure of U.S.-Japan summit talks in February. Japan must deal constructively with U.S. complaints based on the principle of "equal opportunity." Some U.S. complaints, however, should be rejected without compromise. In this era of distrust, a debate over setting "targets" would be pointless. 3. Japan should urgently embark upon a program of much-needed deregulation, fend off external criticisms by announcing substantial market-opening measures, and enter into bilateral negotiations such as the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) with the United States. Japan must also make a positive contribution to the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO). EU Also Opposes Numerical Targets Immediately before the U.S.-Japan summit meeting on 12 February, 154 Japanese economists made a public appeal to the United States to withdraw its demand for numerical targets, and to Japan to firmly resist numerical targets (see NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 28 January 1994). This appeal was made directly to both leaders as well. Last fall, U.S. economists, including several Nobel prize winners, published an open letter addressed to both leaders which said very much the same thing. I believe that it is safe to say that nearly all Japanese and American economists are strongly opposed to U.S. Government demands for numerical targets. Not only do numerical targets place the burden of proof on Japan while placing the United States in the judgment seat, they also distort trade between the world's first and second largest economies. Economists have appealed to both sides to conduct bilateral trade negotiations according to economic principles. I am not sure whether our appeal influenced the result of the summit meeting, but Japan was able to avoid becoming an accomplice in managed trade by rejecting numerical targets. Moreover, the failure of the U.S.-Japan summit bolstered the opinion in Europe and the United States that Japan had "rejected managed trade and upheld the principles of free competition." Strangely enough, the Japanese decision actually helped to shape public opinion. Japan is widely believed to have won a tactical victory by taking the high road and appealing to concise principles. This is but one example of the importance of tackling international trade disputes with easy-to-understand principles. After the failure of the summit, however, share prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the yen rose sharply against the dollar on international financial markets. These occurances were fueled by a sense of uncertainty. The U.S. Government, moreover, immediately resurrected Super 301 (the authority to name and sanction unfair trading nations) in order to increase the pressure on Japan. Many in Japan began to call for a compromise with the United States. But did the failure of the summit disadvantage Japan? Was our advice concerning numerical trade targets wrong? I do not believe so. The United States and Japan are currently going through a necessary period of adjustment as they move toward a more constructive, long-term economic relationship. There is not much that we can do about the intermediate tensions that are part of this process. Over the long run the extremely high yen will reduce our current account surplus, but in the short term it will cause our trade surplus to expand. This phenomenon is known as the "J-Curve." Japan-U.S. relations are experiencing a political J-Curve at the present time. It is important to be patient. In order to restart comprehensive trade talks, some Japanese analysts appear to be advocating a "policy of compromise." One such group has proposed "voluntary goals" to get individual corporations to purchase more U.S. manufactured goods. Another group recommends "macroeconomic targets" aimed at reducing the overall current account surplus. These analysts would like to see U.S. demands satisfied by July. Various ideas have been proposed in Japan, and U.S. Government officials in Washington have expressed keen interest in this "policy of compromise." Macroeconomic Targets, Procedures Unclear However, there are two major strategic errors in the arguments of the "compromise faction." First, the United States will view "voluntary goals" as "numerical targets" no matter how it is presented and will use them as the basis for sanctions. At the very least, these "voluntary goals" can be used as a pretext for Super 301 if they are not met, or if anti-Japanese sentiment intensifies. "Voluntary goals" were incorporated into the semiconductor agreement and were again promised for automobile and automotive parts imports during President George Bush's January 1992 state visit to Japan. In both cases, the United States used them as the basis for sanctions to coerce Japan into meeting the goals. This despite the fact that Japan considered them "voluntary goals." In the revised semiconductor agreement of 1991, a foreign semiconductor target of 20 percent of the domestic market was explicitly stated in the text. However, the text of the agreement also stated that this goal "would not be used as the object of sanctions should it fail to be reached." In spite of this provision and significant progress under the agreement, sanctions were threatened when foreign semiconductors failed to reach the 20 percent mark by the 31 December 1992 deadline. The United States will not care if they are only "voluntary goals." Today's compromise will undoubtedly become a source of conflict tomorrow. The second problem with the "policy of compromise" is that it encourages the mistaken opinion among some in the United States that Japan will always compromise if enough pressure is brought to bear. At meetings within the U.S. administration, the hardline faction advocates use of the threat of sanctions to force Japan to accept a comprehensive agreement by the time of the G-7 summit in July (the second deadline). They remain steadfastly opposed to the more conciliatory faction which considers U.S. demands to be unreasonable. News that unease is growing in Japan and that a compromise is being considered would only embolden the hardliners. Despite the fact that these goals were "voluntary," they would end up serving as a U.S. strategic weapon. The policy of compromise would only complicate matters by encouraging the hardliners. If this were to happen, it would become impossible to say "no" at the upcoming summit. As for macroeconomic targets, those who propose them must clarify their goals and procedures. More important than the result (a reduction in the current account surplus) are the political steps for bringing it about. For example, if the goal were to bring the current account surplus down under 2 percent of GNP within three years, proponents would have to indicate who would be responsible. This would be especially difficult to assign considering the volatility of the yen on exchange markets and the demand created for several trillion yen by the addition of public corporations. Didn't advocates of reducing the current account surplus below 2 percent of GNP welcome the appreciation of the yen after negotiations failed? Some advocates of macroeconomic numerical targets believe they would obviate the need for microeconomic numerical targets or at least reduce pressure on the microeconomic level. I believe they are wildly optimistic. While Japan did not accept numerical targets in the agreement reached at the opening of comprehensive talks last July, it did agree to reduce its current account surplus "substantially." The Japanese Government used macroeconomic targets as a jumping-off-point, but did not have the power to change microeconomic behavior. In addition, the U.S. purchasing targets for automobiles and automotive parts are not realistic. The quality of Japanese automobiles and the lack of effort on the part of U.S. automobile manufacturers are beyond dispute. Privately, even U.S. trade negotiators concede that the automobile issue has no basis in economic reality. If Japan were to agree now to numerical targets or voluntary goals, it would only leave the United States with the impression that it can demand whatever it wants and Japan will comply. It would be best for all concerned if Japanese automobile companies were to make an unpublicized "voluntary" effort to increase purchases of U.S. automotive parts. Reaffirm Market Opening Intentions What then should Japan do? What should be our strategy? First, Japan must impress domestic and foreign observers with its commitment to market liberalization and free market economics by swiftly deregulating the domestic economy. This is something Japan should do for its own sake, but it must so all the more quickly because of the current impasse in comprehensive trade negotiations. The ironclad logic of resisting numerical targets while unilaterally deregulating and liberalizing the market would have the effect of countering Japan bashers, who claim that Japan is somehow different, and supporting the pro-Japanese forces in the United States. For example, there have been proposals to amend broadcasting standards to allow 20 or more FM stations in the regional metropolitan areas to specialize in certain types of programming. Others are advocating the complete liberalization of airline fares outside of the Haneda corridor. There is no need to link these initiative to imports from the United States. In addition, negotiations must become truly "bilateral." The current trade negotiations have fallen into the same old pattern of the United States making demands and the Japanese responding passively. This approach has left both sides frustrated. All exchanges between adults must be reciprocal. There is tremendous resentment in Japan against the United States because it has broken promises by refusing to reform its patent system and lower tariffs on electronic equipment. What is needed is an aggressive Japanese campaign to make demands of the United States. We need to understand that U.S. public opinion concerning international affairs is diverse. Furthermore, Japan must come up with a long-term vision concerning the global trading system. What is Japan's relationship with the global economy, including and excluding the United States? We should play a constructive role in GATT and in the establishment of the new World Trade Organization (WTO). We should view this as an opportunity to harmonize patent systems, define dumping, and determine when subsidies are permissible--problems that have exacerbated international trade disputes in the past.
