The sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia border on a genocide against a nation and their consequences have acquired the proportions of war operations, Kontic said during talks in Belgrade with a delegation of the Greek committee for humanitarian aid to the people of the former Yugoslavia. The Yugoslav Information Ministry announced that Kontic said that the sanctions are counterproductive and are an expression of the inability of the international community to resolve regional conflicts. Underscoring Greece's objective approach to the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis, Kontic said that the tragedy in the former Yugoslavia would not have occurred if the other members of the European Community had taken the same stand. Kontic expressed gratitude to the Greek delegation, headed by the honorary president of the World Council for Peace and the president of the Greek Anti-War Committee, Evangelos Makheras, for everything Athens and the Greek people have done for the resolution of the Yugoslav crisis and in sending the humanitarian aid which has saved many lives and reduced the suffering of the people. "We believe that Greece, as the chairman of the European Union, will do everything towards reaching a political solution to the Yugoslav crisis, and this will be the biggest humanitarian aid," Kontic said. Makheras pointed out that the lifting of the sanctions is a priority of the Greek Anti-War Committee and the committee for aiding the people of the former yugoslavia. "We are opposed to all forms of sanctions because they are aimed against the people," he said. Makheras informed Kontic that his humanitarian organization had three months ago requested from the U.N. sanctions committee permission to send an additional 550 tonnes of relief aid, but has received no answer so far. Although humanitarian aid is exempt from the sanctions, it arrives in Yugoslavia infrequently and in insufficient quantities due to the inefficiency of the U.N. sanctions committee. The almost two-year strict blockade of Yugoslavia has gravely affected the health and living standards of the 10.5 million Yugoslavs and some 600,000 registered refugees from the former Yugoslav republics.
