This was an enforced break. And although the journalists of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI are not at fault, we apologize to our readers for the information loss that it caused them. But here is what happened. The editorial office introduced a favorable subscription for them, taking into account the high price of the subscription to a state newspaper and desiring to assist citizens who are oriented on receiving accurate and truthful information at first hand. The creditor did not transfer money to the newspaper in time to pay for printing services, dispatching the publication, and payment for paper. It is difficult not to associate this kind of "selective approach" with the fact that the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI journalistic collective itself decided at the end of last year to become the founder of its own newspaper, breaking off relations with the government, which was not fulfilling its duties as the founder. The policy of the government and the establishment of Russian statehood nevertheless remain one of the main themes of our newspaper, but we can now elucidate it more accurately and objectively, but, above all, from the aspect with which important policy is turned to the individual and his daily needs and interests. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is with you once again, dear reader. You, too, stick with us!
