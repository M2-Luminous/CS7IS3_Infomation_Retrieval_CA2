He said: "We will continue the war even for 100 years because we see nothing wrong with fighting in defense of constitutional legitimacy, until the mutiny falls." He added: "We know that war is not easy and that the way to Aden to put down the mutiny will not be easy but whoever imposed that war must pay the price." He emphasized that "the only condition for stopping the war is to recognize the legitimate constitutional leadership and place all the armed forces under the command of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the supreme commander of the armed forces." He said that Sanaa absolutely refuses to receive Arab forces to disengage the warring forces in Yemen. "We cannot possibly allow such interference because we are fighting an internal mutiny, fighting to end and put down that mutiny. Do the Arabs accept fragmentation of a homeland? Would any Arab country accept interference to end a mutiny in it?" He added: "We welcome Arab mediation if it is within the context of fulfilling constititonal legitimacy and the context of dealing with the state of unity." He also said that 'Ali Salim al-Bid's rejection of the legitimate decisions dismissing him, al-'Attas, and some ministers is not important because he is, after all, a mutineer. He emphasized that the legitimate forces will continue the war and the fighting "because we are fighting for a cause. A mutineer has no cause. That is the difference." Dr. al-Iryani stressed that the northern forces "have not retreated one inch on the Abyan front," and that "fighting is now raging in al-'Anad base, the last stronghold of the rebel forces." He said that the southern forces are now concentrated in the area of al-'Alam, north of Aden, considered to be the city's first and last line of defense. He confirmed "the surrender to the legitimate forces of 550 officers and soldiers from al-Labwazah Brigade on the Kirsh front with all their arms equipment." Dr. al-Iryani also confirmed "the surrender of the southern 30th Brigade three days ago. That brigade no longer exists in the Abyan Governorate and al-'Urqub area." He added that he contacted Sanaa yesterday and was assured that "al-'Amaliqah Brigade has not retreated from its positions in Zinjibar and Mudiyah and that it is there in full strength." He emphasized that "not a single gun, tank, or piece of arms was lost on the Abyan front. These forces are now advancing towards al-'Alam area." On the conflicting reports on how close the northern forces are to Aden, al-Iryan affirmed that these reports did not come from military sources, but he said that forces from Khalid Camp, al-Wahdah Brigade, and the 125th Brigade are occupying the area of Kharaz west of Aden.
