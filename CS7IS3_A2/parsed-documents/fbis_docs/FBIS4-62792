Speaking to residents of the ancient Russian city of Yaroslavl in the overcrowded hall of local cultural centre at what he called a regional conference of the LDPR, Zhirinovskiy reiterated that only his party is capable of leading Russia of the crisis [sentence as received]. He criticised severely Communists and Liberals, called them "weak teams" but said all disputes should be solved peacefully, through elections. In the field of economy, Zhirinovskiy said, his party advocates a combination of socialism and capitalism. He called to impose a tax maximum at the rate of 40 per cent, to curb the conversion of defence industries, and to halt ruining the state sector in industry and agriculture. Zhirinovskiy did not support the idea of restoring the Soviet Union but said that if the former Soviet republics have to pay their debts in full, they will volunteer to rejoin Russia themselves. Paying tribute to his usual eccentricity, Zhirinovskiy promised to sack the local authorities for inadequate treatment. The Yaroslavl administration decided against red-carpet reception of the notorious politician limiting its services to providing premises for his performance and ensuring his security.
