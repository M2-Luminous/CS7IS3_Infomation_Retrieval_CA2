"We hoped that the resolution of the UN General Assembly adopted last December, which pointed to unsettled problems in Estonia concerning big ethnic groups, mostly Russians, will be correctly comprehended in Tallinn", Vasiliy Svirin, head of the Russian delegation at talks with Estonia, told a press conference on Wednesday after the end of the 16th round of talks. "We called on Estonia to begin a concrete discussion of a draft agreement on settling the citizenship problem which has been on the negotiating table for two years without any progress because Estonia had blocked it", he said and added that the Estonian delegation refused to work on the agreement. The document grants Russians in Estonia and Estonians in Russia the right to acquire the Estonian or Russian citizenship on a free basis. Svirin also said that Estonia demanded that Russian military who retired after the abortive Soviet coup in August 1991 be withdrawn from the Baltic state together with Russian troops, but agreed that 9,670 military who retired before that can count on receiving a residence permit. "The issue of deporting a considerable number of retired military is put on the agenda", Svirin commented. The deportation problem may diminish the "considerable progress" which, according to Svirin, was reached on the draft agreement on the Russian pullout. He added that the agreement might be initialled in the near future, but the deportation problem had now emerged. The Russian chief negotiator said that Russia had for the first time warned Estonia, which categorically refuses to jointly demarcate the border with Russia, that it has to begin doing the job by itself.
