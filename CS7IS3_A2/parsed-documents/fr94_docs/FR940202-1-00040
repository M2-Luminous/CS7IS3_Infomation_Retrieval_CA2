FR940202-1-00040 FR940202-1-00014 Livestock grazing is another form of habitat alteration that is contributing to declines in the California red-legged frog. Jennings et al. (1992) found livestock grazing to occur at all known historic locations of the California red-legged frog in the Central Valley hydrographic basin. Livestock grazing also has been implicated as a contributing factor in the decline and disappearance of California red- legged frogs from the lower Salinas River (L. Hunt, in litt. , 1993) and the San Francisco peninsula (S. Barry, in litt. , 1992). Two remaining aggregations of California red-legged frogs in the Central Valley hydrographic basin (Corral Hollow Ecological Reserve and Frank Raines Regional Park) are threatened by sedimentation of aquatic habitats either directly or indirectly caused by livestock grazing and off-road vehicle use (Jennings et al. 1992). Rathbun (pers. comm., 1993) reports that grazing is adversely altering California red-legged frog habitat on Pico, Van Gordon, San Simeon, Santa Rosa, Cambria Meadows, and Cayucos Creeks in San Luis Obispo County. Numerous studies, summarized in Behnke and Raleigh (1978) and Kauffman and Krueger (1984), have shown that livestock grazing negatively affects riparian habitat. Cattle have a disproportionately greater adverse affect on riparian and other wetland habitats because they tend to concentrate in these areas, particularly during the dry season (Marlow and Pogacnik 1985). Cattle trample and eat emergent and riparian vegetation, often eliminating or severely reducing plant cover (Gunderson 1968, Duff 1979). Loss of riparian vegetation results in increased water temperatures (Van Velson 1979), which encourage bullfrog reproduction (bullfrogs are a predator and competitor of California red-legged frogs). Riparian vegetation loss due to cattle grazing includes the loss of willows (Duff 1979), which are associated with the highest densities of California red-legged frogs (Jennings 1988b). Cattle grazing also results in increased erosion in the watershed (Lusby 1970, Winegar 1977), which results in the sedimentation of deep pools (Gunderson 1968) used by California red-legged frogs and adversely affects aquatic invertebrates (Cordone and Kelley 1961), which are common prey items of California red-legged frogs. Off-road vehicle use adversely affects California red-legged frogs in ways similar to livestock grazing. Off-road vehicles damage riparian vegetation and increase siltation in pools. Off-road vehicles also disturb the water in stream channels and may crush eggs, larvae, juveniles or adults. California red-legged frogs were eliminated either all or in part by off-road vehicle activities at the Mojave River above Hesperia, at Rincon Station on the San Gabriel River, and at Piru Creek above Pyramid Lake (M. Jennings, pers. comm., 1993). Timber harvest threatens California red-legged frogs through loss of riparian vegetation, which is needed for cover and water temperature regulation, and increased erosion in the watershed, which fills pools with sediment and smothers egg masses. In Santa Cruz County, timber harvest is proposed adjacent to Adams Creek (Celia Scott, private citizen, pers. comm., 1993), 1 of 12 remaining streams in the county that support California red-legged frogs. B. Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes . Records of harvesting California red-legged frogs for food date back to an account by Lockington (1879) of the commercial harvest of this species for the San Francisco market. From 1890 to 1900, the California red-legged frog supported a significant commercial fishery (Smith 1895) with about 80,000 frogs harvested annually (Jennings and Hayes 1984). Counties surrounding San Francisco Bay provided the bulk of the frog harvest in the early to mid 1890s, with the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys increasing in importance by the end of the decade (Chamberlain 1898, Jennings and Hayes 1985). By 1900, harvest figures for California red-legged frogs fell dramatically, indicating that overharvesting may have occurred. Jennings and Hayes (1985) hypothesized that this rapid decline in the California red-legged frog population was the result of selective harvesting of the larger females. Introduction of the bullfrog in California in 1896 was probably in response to the dwindling California red-legged frog population (Jennings and Hayes 1985).
