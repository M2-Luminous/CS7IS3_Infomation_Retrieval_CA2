FBIS4-33072 "drlat106bb_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 INTER-AMERICAN AFFAIRS Uruguay Rejects Chilean Access to Mercosur Without Joining Uruguay Rejects Chilean Access to Mercosur Without Joining PY0206004694 Madrid EFE in Spanish 0204 GMT 1 Jun 94 PY0206004694 Madrid EFE Spanish BFN [Text] Montevideo, 31 May (EFE) -- Uruguay will challenge Chile's partial entry into the Common Market of the South (Mercosur) or access through a free trade zone, and will only accept it as a full-fledged member, diplomatic sources linked to the negotiations stressed in Montevideo today. Chile is the only South American country that has its way paved toward joining Mercosur, as it is not a member of any other system. An exception clause for Chile's future entry into the common market formed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay was specifically included in the Asuncion Treaty of 26 March 1991. Other countries do not have this possibility as the Asuncion Treaty bans the entry of those countries that have joined other agreements such as the Andean Pact, of which Chile is not a member. So far, this clause has prevented the entry of Bolivia, the first country to be interested in joining the Southern Cone's economic system. Chilean Foreign Minister Carlos Figueroa announced that in June, his country would formalize a proposal to join Mercosur by establishing a free trade zone. The Uruguayan negotiators' reaction did not take long, and they expressed that any country that wants to join Mercosur would have to meet all requirements, including the implementation of a common external tariff. The Uruguayan stance seems to challenge the interests of Argentina and Brazil, Mercosur's main partners. Following the interest expressed by President Frei's new administration, Argentina and Brazil are promoting a partial association with Chile. The Uruguayan officials admitted that the Mercosur partners have not yet discussed the Chilean proposal. The Uruguayan Government has therefore not yet had an opportunity to express its official opinion. Experts, however, have noted: "A country that does not pay the cost of a common external tariff cannot enjoy the same benefits in exporting to markets in Brazil and Argentina." In a commentary for a newspaper that specializes in economic issues, another Uruguayan official said: "We Uruguayans do not want to lock ourselves into a stubborn stance, nor replace imports with local products, but if we do not respect legal frameworks we would be drawing up agreements like custom-made clothes." According to the newspaper EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO, for Uruguay, "any integration must take place within the legal framework that we are handling. In this regard, the Asuncion Treaty applies. Any country that wants to join in will have to abide by the entire treaty and not by part of it alone."
