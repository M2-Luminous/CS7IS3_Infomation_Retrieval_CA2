This was decided at the end of another round of talks in Washington. It was also decided that a border survey will be performed by joint Israeli and Jordanian teams. Elimelekh Ram reports from the U.S. capital: [Begin recording] [Ram] The fact that Major General 'Uzi Dayan, head of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Planing Branch, took part in the talks which were mainly economic, attests to the security aspect of the decisions made -- whether the issue in question is planning a road that would link Israel and Jordan or whether it was the establishment of joint projects in areas that could be sensitive from a security point of view. Dr. Elyaqim Rubinstein, head of the Israeli delegation, sums up the current round of talks: [Rubinstein] This was a good round of contacts on both the tripartite level of Israel, Jordan, and the United States -- which mainly focused on economic issues such as trade, finance, and projects -- as well as on the level of the additional talks we held with Jordan -- which focused on issues such as security, borders, water, and the like. [Ram] The atmosphere at the talks was most optimistic. There is a Jordanian readiness to make progress in the negotiations. [passage omitted] [end recording]
