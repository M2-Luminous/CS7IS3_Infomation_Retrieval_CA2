The debt will be repaid over the next 10 years. A formal protocol on the agreement will be signed in Moscow in January. Other major creditor nations like Germany, the United States, and France have already concluded similar agreements with Russia. With the agreement between Japan and Russia, the focus of attention will henceforth turn to the issue of what to do about the debt that is due in 1994, and full-fledged negotiations on it are expected to begin this month, primarily dealing with the debt due by around next March. As far as the matter of accepting delayed payment on Russia's official debt which was due in 1993 is concerned, a general agreement was reached at a meeting of the major creditor nations (Paris Club) in April 1993. Most of Russia's official debt to Japan is insurance money, and the remainder are loans from the Export and Import Bank of Japan. While the repayment will be made over the next 10 years, first five years will be accepted as a grace period. Regarding Russia's official debt due in 1994, the creditor nations--Japan, the United States, and Europe--make it a condition to accept the delayed payment that the IMF and Russia arrive at an agreement on Russia's economic reform plans and that the IMF extend loans to Russia. But Russia's problem of fund shortage is only worsening, and there is no telling when the IMF will implement its second part of loans for economic system transition ($1.5 billion) or short-term relief loans ($4.1 billion). Consequently, there is now emerging among creditor nations a feeling that they should accept delayed payment only on $1-$2 billion due by March or April. Their assumption is that in the meantime the Russian financial authorities will enforce money-tightening measures, and economic reform in the country will make progress.
