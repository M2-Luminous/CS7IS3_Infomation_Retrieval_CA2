This has been suggested by FRG Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, Free Democratic Party [FDP]. The goal is to ensure "minimum orders" for German armament companies. A final political decision has not yet made on his ideas, Rexrodt admitted. An amendment to the Military Materiel Control Law and a change in the Federal Government's political principles for the export of military weapons and other armament goods from 1982 to loosen the export policy is not planned, however, the FDP politician stressed. The Economics Minister stressed that he thinks a common European arms export policy is urgently necessary. However, he admitted that the views of the 12 EU member states on a unified policy in this field are still far apart. The establishment of unified European rules for the export of so- called dual-use goods, which can be used for military and civilian purposes, is of particular importance, Rexrodt said. According to the current state of negotiations, agreement concerning this issue can be achieved in the Union only below the standard of the regulations that are valid in Germany now. Nevertheless, Rexrodt assessed the emerging compromise as progress, not least regarding the desire for equal competitiveness of Germany's export business.
