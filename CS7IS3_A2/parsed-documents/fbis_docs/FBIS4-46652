Melnikov, Scientific Research Center for Study of Surface and Vacuum Properties, Moscow; UDC 521.1] [Abstract] The gravitational constant G is the least accurately measured of the fundamental constants. No group of researchers in the past decade has been able to go beyond the CODATA error of 10[.sup]-4[/], and three of the four determinations made of the absolute value of G are not in agreement in terms of measurement error. Sanders and Deeds's method, which achieved a level of 10[.sup]-6[/] in 1992, was based on observation of the motion of two bodies of different mass within a blow-free satellite, with use of a horseshoe trajectory, i.e., the lighter object (the particle), lower than the heavier object, catches up with it, interacts, goes to a higher orbit, and then falls behind in orbital motion. The researchers here propose a method that salvages the advantages of Sanders and Deeds's and adds another: it relies on a precise solution for the points of equilibrium points of the particle in the overall field of the Earth and the libration points. Accuracy of measurement of G can be increased by two orders of magnitude. Figures 2, references 6 (Russian).
