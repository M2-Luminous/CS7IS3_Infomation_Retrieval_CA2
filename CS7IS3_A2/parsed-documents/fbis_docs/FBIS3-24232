The process, we recall Mikhail Sergeyevich once again, of the discovery of consensus. Consensus between the radical-right nomenklatura-bourgeois groupings victorious in December. For whoever did not understand this, even having listened to President Yeltsin's report to parliament, all the discoveries will be to come. It will very shortly be revealed that the new Kremlin ideology of the "national cause" and the anticrisis policy of the government will successfully combine the white Bolshevism of Russia's Choice and the black Bolshevism of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], and the upshot will be something suspiciously Zyuganovian. The odious super-radicals are cut off here as yet--Gaydar has quit the government, Zhirinovskiy has not yet arrived, and Chernomyrdin is coping by himself. But the conservative projects going back to the summer-fall initiatives of Oleg Lobov and--horrors!--Khasbulatov's leadership of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation: the inflationary financing of "priority" state industry, the self-organization of apparatus-bureaucratic capital into "financial and industrial groups," the renunciation of privatization romanticism, and so forth, have been tacitly restored. The political realities of Russia, on the other hand, are evoking the specters not only of "Ukrainianization" or the "Belarusian option" but of Central Asian dictatorships also. Many people certainly already understand that the LDPR did not support the "democratic" constitution fortuitously. It is not only a question of the keen political sense of Mr. Zhirinovskiy. Today's "strong of this world," having adopted the oligarchic precept: "The strong determine progress by exploiting the weak," are already quite openly seeking an acceptable leader figure. This figure began to show in outline, it would seem, in the person of the main favorite on 12 December--in quite grotesque fashion as yet, but give it time! Practice makes perfect. Even more important is the fact that the LDPR, which was the mirror reflection in the election campaign of the anti-Gorbachev tactics of Democratic Russia, is oriented toward the national-fundamentalist circles of that same nomenklatura bourgeoisie whose comprador wing is the social client of Russia's Choice. While deliberating a great deal on how Vladimir Volfovich managed to attract the votes of 14 million Russians (which is not difficult in our times for a man with his inclinations), commentators are omitting a far more serious question: How did this person attract multimillion financial flows, that is, win the support of part of the ruling elite? The other December winner, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, is essentially from that same crowd. Having become ideologically loosened since 1987, having joined up with bureaucratic business, and having lost direct access to the managerial function, the Communist Party, as a whole, ceased to be a totalitarian structure--this was the undoubted achievement of April-85 and August-91. But, having ceased to be totalitarian, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation has moved not to the left but to the right flank of the political spectrum. The program reference points of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation are based on the same conservative populism and fundamentalist statism as of the LDPR. True, Zyuganov's leadership is concerned more for respectability and is of a traditionalist frame of mind, furthermore--whence the commitment to the Soviet form of authoritarian rule and criticism of the constitution. As far, however, as left-wing phrase-mongering, of a social-protection motif particularly, is concerned, nowhere is state paternalism the prerogative of forces of the left, being the alpha and omega of any populism--from Le Pen through Turkes (about the NSDAP we will say nothing). Today's Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, for example, are demanding an end to privatization and the concentration of all property in the hands of an independent state, but this does not make them people of the left. There is no effective alternative to right-wing-authoritarian hegemony in the Federal Assembly. Sergey Shakhray's PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] has demonstrated the quite lifeless launch of Civic Union-2. It is possible that Shakhray's attempt to consolidate big national capital, state capital particularly, will prove more successful thanks to the chord which is being struck between the industrialists and the regional administrators, but there is no guarantee that the PRES will not be supplanted in its parliamentary niche by that same Communist Party of the Russian Federation or by New Regional Policy, which has appeared like a bolt from the blue. The Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc has created for itself the image of a constructive democratic alternative to Gaydar, Zyuganov, and Zhirinovskiy put together and has partially managed to attract the sympathies of the electorate committed to liberalism and social democracy. But YABLoko has not fallen far from Russia's Choice, despite the strong intellectual efforts of Yavlinskiy, who has been forced to concoct differences. The "liberal-legal" concept of essentially that same model of capitalization is formulated speculatively, which is partially connected with the absence in YABLoko of the criminal resolve typical of the leadership of Russia's Choice. In fact, YABLoko assigns itself the role of respectable generator of liberal ideas, which will someday, "at a new historical stage," be claimed in a reformed Russia. The ascent to this stage still has to be made, it is true.... So "accursed friends" were the winners in December. A kind of symbol of this community was the election of the right-wing populist Nevzorov in an elite district of Petersburg--"an area of hard-currency taverns and privatized apartments." The clashes between Russia's Choice and the LDPR and the Communist Party of the Russian Federation are a prepared version of the conflict of the "mafia against the bureaucracy" known since Mussolini's times. The political struggle of the Gaydarites and the Zyuganovites and Zhirinovskiyites has been brought about by the differences in the interests of comprador-speculative capital, the administrators of the state economy, and nationalistically oriented business. Whence the different ideological slogans--liberalism, chauvinism, communism--whence the appeal to different social strata in the search for mass support, whence the success of the demagogy: "Either us or... (insert as required)." The common denominator of the ruling oligarchy remains, however, authoritarian elitism and statism and reliance on state power as the instrument of compulsory capitalization. By and large, the claret-colored shadow of fascization looms over the country for the uncontested struggle of the right against the extreme right is being played out in the Russian political space. The niche of the forces of the left is empty, and wage labor and the independent economy have been cut off from actual politics--this is the main result of the menacing totalitarian degeneration. To blame for the failure of the left (the real left!) is primarily the left itself. In an excruciating search for a path, the Social Democratic Party of Russia has split into several groupings. Thanks to its leader, Rutskoy's NPSR [Free Russia People's Party] has sunk to the bottom. Having concluded a "pink-beige" alliance with the moderate nationalists, Cossacks, and oil industrialists, the Socialist Workers Party allowed itself to be dragged into the plan for a "social-patriotic alliance" struck up on the basis of the conservative Federation of Commodity Producers and the personal interests of Yuriy Skokov. The Socialist Workers Party has thereby excluded itself from the movement of the left, virtually, which is not all that surprising, considering its genetic kinship with the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. Running in majority-system constituencies, certain representatives of forces of the left frequently ended up on the Communist Party slate, which complicates the situation even further. In short, the formation of a center left, in which social democracy can alone exist, has to be started almost "from scratch." This is difficult, but there is the hope that society will soon understand how dangerous it is to fly on one wing. And the left itself, it has to be thought, will bestir itself. There are already some signs of revitalization on this flank, incidentally. The defeat of Civic Union and almost all the trade union bosses stirred among the leaders of the "traditional" trade union movement interest in the plan for a Labor Party, which is being proposed to them by the social democrats of the Social Democratic Party of Russia, the Free Russia People's Party, and the Party of Labor, which has for three years served politically the Moscow Federation of Trade Unions. The cornerstone of the plan is a strong, typically Laborite coupling of left-wing-democratic organizations and social civic associations--the "traditional," "free," and "corporate" unions, the STK movement, self-managing associations, consumer unions, civil rights organizations, and so forth. In the event of realization of this plan, the Russian Laborites would be a political force potentially capable of defending the formation of the civil society and of strengthening and stimulating its structures. This ensues naturally from their main function--defense of the socioeconomic rights of the citizens against the background of the essentially anti-civic position of the principal political subjects of contemporary Russia. Economic democracy and self-government, the employees' share in profits and ownership, reform of the system of social insurance and taxation, the social responsibility of enterprise and state administration, stimulation of all forms of civic self-organization on a firm material and legal foundation--a movement with such a program "package" could obviously lay claim to the "pink" niche, which stands empty in today's political spectrum, and constitute a real democratic alternative to the "claret-colored" Stalinists and the in fact perfectly "white" Zyuganovites. The consolidation of the antiauthoritarian and antifascist movement along the lines of the National Front in France in the 1930's--the sole historical example of a mass democratic movement stopping fascism--is possible on a Laborite basis. It is hard to say what would result from Russian Laborites, but the citizens are required to forestall a "chief"--they have no worthier option.
