Rodriguez begins the discussion by saying that politically and socially, Cuba is one of a kind: "We have a steep economic crisis, yet we maintain political stability; and why not say it -- social stability as well. Cuba is the only such case." Sexto points out that Cuba's political present cannot be judged without considering its past. He says: "Never have I seen in any other country such a solid bond between past and present; between history and history-in-the-making." He goes on to say that: "Despite shortages that are in some aspects acute, but not tragic; despite deficits; despite sacrifices; and despite the postponement of legitimate individual and social dreams, the Cuban people are aware that there is no other political system or political idea that would guarantee what they themselves have lived during the past 35 years. "This is part of the reasoning, even unconsciously, of any Cuban today. What alternative does Cuba have today if not to remain bonded to the political idea of the Revolution? What other options do we have? The option proposed by the people in Miami who support annexation? The most progressive of the Miami annexation supporters are proposing private property and a market economy." Rodriguez replies: "I recently read in the Miami NUEVO HERALD an article going beyond that, proposing for 1994, U.S. annexation as a solution to our problems." Sexto notes that some say that socialism has failed in Cuba, adding: "That is something that remains to be seen. What completely failed 35 years ago in Cuba was capitalism." Rodriguez stresses that history is a factor in analyzing attitudes Cubans assume today in contending with the situation. He points out that despite the shortages, the situation in Cuba is far removed from that of many Latin American countries because Cuba is trying to maintain an equilibrium in terms of social services. Rodriguez and Sexto discuss the importance of the ration booklet in Cuba's present situation. Rodriguez points out: "I believe the ration booklet is an element of that equilibrium you mentioned." Sexto responds: "The ration book is precisely an element that favors distribution equilibrium. I am not an enemy of the ration book, but I believe that getting rid of it someday will benefit us all. I have had that opinion for years. But right now, the ration booklet guarantees minimal distribution and equilibrium in distribution." Rodriguez disagrees with Sexto's point of view: "I do not agree with you. I believe the ration booklet must be maintained because it is what guarantees goods for people with lower incomes." Sexto says that in Cuba they are working hard to cover basic needs. He adds: "We are trying to avoid anyone's being abandoned or anyone's literal starving to death. I do not believe that anyone in this country is literally starving to death because in one way or another, they get what they need. It has a lot to do with our policies. We have a policy that favors the services and views of social justice and protection." In discussing these policies of social justice, Rodriguez says: "We have only one option: To stay with the Revolution and sacrifice ourselves to maintain our independence and dignity. Many of our leaders, including Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina during his trips abroad, have said that anything can be discussed here but our independence or the dignity of the Cuban people." Sexto adds: "If we look at the trend and the fact that the country continues to survive after a three-year crisis, that it remains standing with determination to overcome the crisis, this means that this country, the Revolution, the government, and the social regime that supports this country have the support of the majority of the people. That is irrefutable proof. The fact that we remain standing is irrefutable proof that the majority of Cubans support the Cuban Revolution. The fact that the majority of people support the Cuban Revolution does not mean that there is no irritation. I believe there is a certain level of irritation in the streets. I believe that everyone can take the shortages, the deficit, but not everyone can take these challenges with a rational, serene, and stable attitude. I believe there are times when the irritation is produced because -- and I believe you said this during a recent program -- I get home, for example, and there is no power. I might get upset because maybe I wanted to read a good book or write an article for the magazine. I am not just talking about myself; I am referring to any citizen. This does not mean that deep down I do not understand the causes for the outages. I say to myself that this is what I must go through so we can overcome this situation, because the other option is not in my best interest. The other option is capitalism, which is offered to us by some in Miami, and by some who leave us, to back them up." Rodriguez remarks: "With capitalism, everyone knows that some will benefit while the majority will drown." Sexto says he was once asked what capitalism is. He answered: "The underground economy is the capitalist economy." Rodriguez adds that capitalism's equilibrium is established by the law of the market: "A market economy is the underground economy, where the price is determined by the supply and demand, regardless of who can or cannot buy those goods." Rodriguez says: "We are living in a country facing a difficult economic crisis, a country that despite its economic crisis, lives in social equilibrium and political stability." He concludes: "I will define the country we live in. We live in a country that struggles to be better, to overcome, and to defend itself." Straight Talk ends at 1615 GMT.
