Ekeus, chairman of the UN Security Council Special Commission for Disarmament, has confirmed that the bulk of Iraq's chemical weapons have now been destroyed and the requisite barriers erected to prevent Baghdad manufacturing these categories of arms. In total 28,000 tonnes of chemical shells, warheads, and bombs and a sizable quantity of components for the production of mustard gas have been destroyed in Iraq under UN supervision. By and large, Grigoriy Karasin, director of the Russian Foreign Ministry Press Department, believes that this can be seen as confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with the United Nations. Such actions on Iraq's part should be encouraged, Russia's permanent representative to the United Nations said in New York during the latest examination of the question of sanctions against Iraq. Among the problems that the UN special commission still has to resolve, Grigoriy Karasin cited the task of preventing the restoration of Iraq's military potential in the future. To this end, diplomats in Moscow believe, a mechanism for long-term international supervision of disarmament must be launched as soon as possible and a new "trial period" begun. If Baghdad passes the test, the sanctions may be lifted.
