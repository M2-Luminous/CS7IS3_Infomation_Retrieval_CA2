Even so, it is difficult to disagree with the Cuban president when he complains, as he did at the Ibero-American Summit held recently in Cartagena (Colombia), about his counterparts --with the exception of Itamar Franco -- remaining silent about the blockade the United States has imposed on the island for 32 years. There are at least two strong reasons to substantiate the claim that the embargo entails an unacceptable act of violence. The first is humanitarian. It has become crystal clear during the past 32 years that it is the Cuban people, not their leaders, who have suffered the blockade's effects. The embargo has not provoked the regime's downfall but rather a steady decline in the people's standard of living in general, especially now that Cuba can no longer count on the resources it used to receive from the now-defunct Soviet Union. The second reason has to do with being consistent. There is no way of justifying the U.S. Government's decision to maintain its embargo against the Cuban dictatorship after having granted preferential trading status to another even more brutal dictatorship, that of China. It should be admitted that a dictatorship is a dictatorship under any circumstance, or that a dictatorship can be more readily accepted when it offers a more profitable business. There is no denying that this factor introduces a great deal of cynicism in relations among countries and makes the embargo of Cuba all the more unacceptable. It is appropriate to note another inconsistency here: The Latin American political map was plagued by military dictatorships during the 70's and part of the 80's. This fact did not cause the United States to impose an embargo on any of those regimes that were unwilling to cooperate with it. Again, a dictatorship -- whether from the right or the left -- should be considered a dictatorship. Otherwise, the "democratic" logic behind the embargo would be untenable. The truth is that the blockade of Cuba is a remnant of the Cold War. The United States appears to remain watchful despite the failure of communism, despite the theory that socialist regimes are tolerated in other parts of the world, although not in what used to be called its "back yard." Obviously the fact of living under a dictatorship has overshadowed Cuba's merit of having some good social accomplishments compared to other countries in the region, Brazil included. One cannot absolve, however, totalitarian regimes only because one of them may have obtained some rather positive statistics. It will not be by strangling Cuba through the embargo that we will make it a democratic country. The correct reasoning is exactly the opposite: It is by reincorporating Cuba into the inter-American system, instead of leaving it isolated, that we would make it more democratic. By coexisting with countries that today are mostly democratic, Cuba would be decisively influenced by the example of these countries.
