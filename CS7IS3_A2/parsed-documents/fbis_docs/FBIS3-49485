Slovak Television reported today that the ethnic Hungarians "no longer seek to create a province," and the 100-member representative body, which was to have put resolutions of tomorrow's meeting into practice, is also unlikely to be elected. According to television reports, the reason is the Slovak Interior Ministry's refusal to register the representative body. Discussion of a self-administrative province stretching across southern Slovakia is also being abandoned and proposals appear instead providing for the creation of three areas -- the Danube, Palocz, and Mezibodrozi regions -- where more than 80 percent of the almost 600,000-strong Hungarian minority reside. According to the television reports, these concessions may be linked to the fact that the Komarno Appeal has been opposed not only by Slovaks but also by Hungarians and that it has not met with favorable response abroad either. However, representatives of the Matica Slovenska (Slovak cultural and historical organization) allege that the reason may be a tactical temporary lessening of the well-thought out demands which will further escalate. It is necessary to wait for an answer till tomorrow, the report concluded.
