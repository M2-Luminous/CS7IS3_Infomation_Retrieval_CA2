FR940928-0-00043 FR940928-0-00016 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 50 CFR Part 641 [Docket No. 940536&hyph;4202; I.D. 041994B] RIN 0648&hyph;AG28 Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico; Correction AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Final rule; correction. SUMMARY: This rule corrects the final rule to implement Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Resources of the Gulf of Mexico, which was published on August 2, 1994. This correction also extends the effective date of certain amendments previously published. EFFECTIVE DATE: July 27, 1994. See paragraph 1, which corrects the effective date of rules published on June 15, 1993, and December 27, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert Sadler, 813&hyph;570&hyph;5305. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The final rule to implement Amendment 9, among other things, extended the red snapper endorsement system and its associated trip and landing limits from their scheduled expiration on December 31, 1994, through as late as December 31, 1995. Changes to the regulatory text clearly stated this extended effectiveness regarding the endorsement system. The intent to extend the effectiveness of the associated trip and landing limits, and associated prohibitions, which originally appear at 58 FR 33027, June 15, 1993, and 58 FR 68326, December 27, 1993, was stated in the preamble of the final rule to implement Amendment 9, but was inadvertently omitted from the EFFECTIVE DATE section. In the final rule, the telephone numbers of the Regional Director and of the Regulations and Permits Branch, Southeast Region, NMFS, are incorrect. The address of the Southeast Region as published under the definition of ``Regional Director'' requires a revision. Accordingly, the publication on August 2, 1994 (59 FR 39301), of the final regulations (I.D. 041994B), which were the subject of FR Doc. 94&hyph;18683, is corrected as follows: 1. On page 39301, in the third column, under the EFFECTIVE DATE heading, add the following sentence to the end: ``In addition, 50 CFR 641.7 (u), (v), and (w) and 50 CFR 641.21(d), which were to expire December 31, 1994, are extended through December 31, 1995.'' ยง641.2 [Corrected] 2. On page 39304, in the first column, in ยง641.2, in the definition of Regional Director, in line 3, the address is corrected by inserting ``N.'' after ``Drive'' and in line 4, the telephone number is corrected to read ``813&hyph;570&hyph;5301''. ยง641.10 [Corrected] 3. On page 39304, in the third column, in ยง641.10(b)(3), in the next to last line, the telephone number is corrected to read ``813&hyph;570&hyph;5326''. Dated: September 22, 1994. Samuel W. McKeen, Acting Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, National Marine Fisheries Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;24009 Filed 9&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;22&hyph;W
