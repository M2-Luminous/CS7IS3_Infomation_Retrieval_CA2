You have just heard [U.S.] Senator Biden saying: "Let them die their own way if we don't have the courage to help them live." Is this also your way of looking at the situation? [Briquemont] The least that can be said is that the senator makes himself quite clear. But I think -- as it has been widely admitted over the past few weeks -- that one will have to choose between the logic of war or the logic of peace. If one wants to lift the arms embargo, the fighting eventually will intensify; this might correspond to the attitude of the Bosnian Government. But I stress again vigorously that if the three warring sides keep on fighting, the 10,000 Blue Helmets will not be able to go on providing humanitarian aid. One will have to choose: either there is an agreement in a few days or in a few weeks, or there is no agreement. In the latter case I believe that one will head toward intensified fighting. The situation will need to be thoroughly reassessed. [Lamair] General, public opinion understands less and less the Bosnian issue and wonders why it is still impossible after 20 months of war to put an end to it. What are the obstacles to a settlement to the conflict? [Briquemont] Well, listen, I do not think that such a conflict will ever be solved with packages of resolutions; actions have to be envisaged. The first of these perhaps should be to make it possible for those on the spot to be able to apply the UN Security Council resolutions. Another aspect also seems important to me: We always apply our concepts, our Western, West European concepts to other societies which absolutely do not handle problems as we do. It always strikes me to hear some generals and also some political leaders saying: "You know, conflicts here are solved by force." Maybe one should understand what is happening over there before thinking that anything in which we believe in Brussels, in Washington, or elsewhere can materialize in that region [Bosnia]. [Lamair] Your successor, British General Michael Rose, has the same mandate, the same number of troops. Would it not be necessary, for him to succeed, to change the mandate and, if nothing changes, well, to withdraw the Blue Helmets? [Briquemont] Change the mandate? Well, I do not know if it is necessary to change it now. Simply, I would say that we should be given the means to implement the UN Security Council resolutions -- as I have been saying over and over again for weeks together with General Cot: "Give us the troops we need to carry out our mission successfully." The other problem is to be able to use the troops within the framework of the resolutions of course, but also in a way that the military chiefs deem necessary. I will not hide my deep shock when a battalion commander refused to execute an order because his government, or the governments of Nordic countries, refused to deploy a company in Srebrenica. I was deeply shocked because Srebrenica is a sensitive spot in Bosnia, and a key point of one of the most important UN resolutions -- Resolution 836. I thus believe that the contributing nations must accept the UN mandate, but it is far too easy to decide to send troops while saying at the same time: "I wish to use them here or there only for this or that purpose." This shocked me deeply and I can tell you that this battalion commander also was very ill at ease because refusing an order from one's commander is very serious for a soldier. I think this represents an intolerable intrusion by the political [leaders] in the conduct of operations. This must change and my successor has raised the issue in New York, but in the meantime, the governments of the contributing nations must admit that. Unfortunately, I do not believe this will happen anytime soon. [passage omitted] [Bredael] This is another vision of everyday reality in Sarajevo. General, have you experienced these desperate efforts by the population to preserve the life it had before [the war]? [Briquemont] I experienced them intensely and you know the admiration I have for the Sarajevo population. And they were grateful to me because I probably did a little for them. You would not believe all the efforts made by the UNPROFOR to provide those people with a little water, electricity, and gas, all the efforts made so that those artists could come and perform. But the population also taught me lessons. I deeply admired their dignity, their resistance, and as I have already said in several interviews, I admired the women of Sarajevo. [Lamair] General, judging from the report we have just seen, do you think that it is still possible for Sarajevo, and for the whole of Bosnia, to be a multiethnic region in the future? [Briquemont] Yes, but... we probably have reached the most remote limit of that possibility. I believe that the fighting must stop very soon because if it does not, Sarajevo will no longer be that multicultural fortress and all the sides will become radicalized and Sarajevo will lose this multicultural feature. I believe that the city increasingly will become a Muslim city. [Bredael] Do you mean that the Muslims are now also carrying out an ethnic cleansing? [Briquemont] I do not know if I can call this ethnic cleansing, but if the fighting continues, the Muslims will want to turn Sarajevo into their capital and it then could be a kind of administrative cleansing. [Bredael] Well, thank you, General, for your comments.
