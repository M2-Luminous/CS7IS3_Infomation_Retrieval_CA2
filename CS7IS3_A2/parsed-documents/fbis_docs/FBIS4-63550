But if the limit is exceeded, Kravchuk would lose one of his main trump cards -- the image of a person who has been able to keep Ukraine peaceful following the proclamation of independence. "In the event of such a conflict, Russia and Ukraine would risk losing the image of normal members of the internatioal community. However, neither can one fail to recognise that a war of nerves, during which one can manage to solve certain private internal political tasks and show adherence to principles without much expenditure of efforts or means, is utterly beneficial to all the sides." KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) carries an article on the political situation in the Crimea under the headline "It Is Clear in the Crimea so Far, Although the Weather-Gauge Pointer Approaches the `Storm' Mark." Covering the latest developments there, the newspaper draws the following conclusion: "All things considered, it is clear so far that Kiev has not abandoned attempts to put strongarm pressure on the 'mutinous' peninsula". The newspaper believes that an escalation of tension is of benefit to Ukraine. On the one hand, in the event of a successful undoing of the `Crimean knot' (a peaceful way is meant), this would influence Kravchuk's rating at the forthcoming presidential elections of June 26. On the other hand, an aggravation of the situation may lead to cancellation of the elections, which would also suit the president and his entourage". PRAVDA on the situation in the Crimea: "The Crimea is becoming an explosive region nowadays. Only a return, even if a staggered one, to a single common fatherland will save the Crimea, Ukraine, Russia, and the entire Commonwealth of Independent States from confrontations which are fraught with bloodshed". ROSSIISKIYE VESTI publishes remarks made by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at a meeting with the directors of industrial, building and transport enterprises and organisations on May 20. Explaining the contents of a package of draft normative documents to resolve economic reform problems, Chernomyrdin said in particular: "With a view to attracting foreign investments, the government intends to exempt enterprises with a considerable amounts of foreign investments from paying a profit tax to the federal budget for three years. In subsequent two years, the profit tax is to be exacted at a lowered rate". "Provision is made for a considerable reduction in the export customs tariffs on staple Russian export commodities, such as oil and oil products, gas, electric power, aluminium, and pulp, and for the abolition of fixed quotas for and licensing of those commodities' export," Chernomyrdin said. KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA frontpages a report on the repatriation of two former Soviet servicemen taken prisoner in Afghanistan. "About 290 Soviet servicemen are now listed as missing in the war in Afghanistan. Approximately 20 captives are held by Afghan rebel groups. Seventeen captives returned home following the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan in February 1989. Prior to the Soviet withdrawal, 111 POWs had been released, with 53 freed through intelligence channels, and the rest through diplomatic ones". KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA publishes a column of comments by influential Russian politicians on the arrival of prominent writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in Russia. RABOCHAYA TIRIBUNA runs an article written on the strength of remarks from academician Andrey Sakharov's speeches, reports and articles. TRUD draws readers' attention to the political life of parties and movements that are in opposition to the government. The writer of an article, headlined "A Springtime Exacerbation", analyses Aleksandr Rutskoy's chances to head a mass, organised party.
