Voskoboynikov, in a brief interview with Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, asks: "Yesterday seven foreign ministers worked out a coordinated position. Is it not the case that in a few weeks time, should the situation deteriorate -- around Brcko, for instance -- this coordination will completely disappear?" Kozyrev responds, "Unfortunately, we should be prepared to see our cooperation put to the test, but a fairly good basis has been laid down for progressing forward. This is not a complete answer to all the questions. These are only the basic elements for going on to work out a joint approach which needs to be worked on by the parties." The report then continues with a round-up of the Geneva meeting.
