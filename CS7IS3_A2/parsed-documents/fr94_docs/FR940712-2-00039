FR940712-2-00039 FR940712-2-00034 Western Area Power Administration Provo River Project_Proposed Rate Methodology of Annual Charges AGENCY: Western Area Power Administration, DOE. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Provo River Project Rate Methodology of Annual Charges. SUMMARY: The Western Area Power Administration (Western) is proposing a methodology to determine annual charges to accompany the independent marketing of Provo River Project (PRP) resources. A previous proposal to integrate this project and its resources with Western's Salt Lake City Area/Integrated Projects (Integrated Projects) was not supported by customers. To date, PRP's resources have been sold to the Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) at a rate to cover project costs. Western proposes that capacity and energy produced by the PRP be marketed to those members of two Western customers, Intermountain Consumers Power Association (ICPA) and Utah Municipal Power Agency (UMPA), located in the area of the Provo River drainage, in Utah and Wasatch Counties in Utah. Power will be allocated to these two customers proportional to the electrical sales of their members who meet the criteria for receiving it. These customers will pay all of the annual expenses of the PRP, including an amount to be used to assist the Provo River Water Users Association's (Water Users) timely repayment of the original Federal investment in the PRP. In return, these customers will receive all of the total marketable output of the PRP. The proposed rate methodology constitutes a minor rate adjustment as defined by the procedures for public participation in general rate adjustments covered in 10 CFR 903.2(f). The PRP annual sales are less than 100 million kilowatthours and installed capacity is less than 20,000 kilowatts. A 30-day comment period will begin with the publication of this Federal Register notice and end 30 days thereafter. After review of public comments, Western will recommend a proposed rate methodology for establishing the annual charge to be approved on an interim basis by the Deputy Secretary of DOE. The proposed rate methodology will be sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval on a final basis. The proposed rate methodology for marketing capacity and energy is expected to become effective November 1, 1994, and it will remain in effect until October 31, 1999, unless superseded by another rate action. At present there is no existing PRP rate. Energy has been sold to the CRSP at an amount that meets the PRP's annual revenue requirements for expenses and repayment obligations.

Written comments should be received by Western by the end of the consultation and comment period to be assured consideration and should be sent to the address below. A related notice appears in today's Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Acting Area Manager, Salt Lake City Area Office, Western Area Power Administration, P.O. Box 11606, Salt Lake City, UT 84147&hyph;0606, (801) 524&hyph;5493. Background Information Construction of the PRP was begun in May 1938, with the powerplant completed in 1958. It has a present generating capacity of 5 megawatts of power. The Water Users, a corporation of stockholders owning prorated water entitlements, executed contract No. Ilr&hyph;874 in 1936, with the Federal Government to construct and repay project facilities. Contract No. Ilr&hyph;1082, dated December 20, 1938, established a contract among several entities to compensate the Utah Power and Light Company with PRP power in exchange for power foregone at its powerplant. Only energy excess to project purposes has been available for Federal marketing. Since 1963, CRSP has needed additional energy and has purchased the available PRP energy at an amount established annually for the PRP to cover its costs, including operation, maintenance, and replacement costs and repayment expenses. These expenses have included $1.623 million of irrigation assistance to the Water Users. PRP's original power investment has been repaid. In December 1993, Western proposed to change the way it marketed power and energy produced by PRP in response to customer interest in its available resources. The part of the proposal that suggested inclusion of the PRP in the Integrated Projects was not supported by customers for various reasons, thereby requiring Western to modify its original proposal to one which will market PRP's power and energy independent of the Integrated Projects. Two Western customers, ICPA and UMPA, pursued acquiring the available PRP capacity and energy. The members of these customers are located in the PRP drainage area in Utah and Wasatch Counties. Western proposes that these customers receive all of the total marketable output, with the power allocated proportionally to their eligible members' energy sales. ICPA and UMPA would pay all of the annual expenses of the project. An amount to meet the repayment assistance to the Water Users would be recovered under separate agreement. Proposed Methodology If Western adopts the proposal, Western will prepare a power repayment study (PRS) annually for PRP to establish the revenue needed to meet annual costs, including operation, maintenance, and replacement repayment costs and interest. Budgeted estimates of these future costs will be used in the PRS. The power assistance to the Water Users will not be included in the PRS but will, instead, be paid under a separate arrangement among the Bureau of Reclamation, Western, ICPA, UMPA, and the Water Users which will provide for equal annual installments of $102,285.71 over 14 years.
