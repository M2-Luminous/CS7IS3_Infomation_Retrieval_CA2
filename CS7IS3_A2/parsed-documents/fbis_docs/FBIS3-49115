According to the radio, local discontent with the mayor's approach to solving daily problems of the town was the reason. Petitions demanding the mayor's resignation have been put up by civic initiatives at many places in the town and a public rally was called for Wednesday [5 January] in the headquarters of the Slovak cultural organisation Matica Slovenska. Pasztor as chairman of the Council of the Association of Towns and Villages of the Zitny Island, is an initiator of a meeting of deputies and mayors from southern Slovakia scheduled for January 8 in Komarno to demand the establishment of a "region with special status" in southern Slovakia populated by a large Hungarian minority. Matica Slovenska has sharply condemned the meeting.
