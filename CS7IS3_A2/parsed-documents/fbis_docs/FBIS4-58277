The Syrian and Russian sides signed a military cooperation agreement on the evening of the day before yesterday which political circles described as the first of its kind in this sphere since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the establishment of the Russian Federation. [passage omitted] Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Kolov [name as transliterated] stressed the day before yesterday that, while he understands the Israelis' concern over selling weapons to Syria, he confirms that the Syrians too are concerned over the sale of modern Western weapons to Israel. He added that, "if arms sale deals are not concluded with Syria, other states are bound to make offers. It is out of the question that the Russians are going to offer anything except the sale of defensive weapons and spare parts for weapons sold to Syria under previous deals."
