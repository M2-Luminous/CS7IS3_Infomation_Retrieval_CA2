Speaking at a luncheon sponsored by the University of Southern California in a hotel here Monday, the former South Korean opposition leader said the North Korean nuclear problem should be solved while Kim Il-song is alive because he alone can offer a real concession in foreign policy. North Korea has made a number of diplomatic concessions, such as simultaneous admission of North and South Korea to the United Nations, cross-recognition of Seoul and Pyongyang by the four powers (the United States, Japan, China and Russia) and mutual recognition by Seoul and Pyongyang of the legitimacy of their respective governments, for its survival since 1991. Since Kim Il-song alone could concede such issues, he said, solution of the nuclear dispute and other matters is necessary before the death of the 82-year-old strongman. The commonwealth plan will likely be realized during President Kim Yong-sam's term in office, he observed, adding that he believes the plan, if referred to a national vote, will be approved by the people. "In that case, the government can launch inter-Korean negotiations with confidence and authority," he remarked. Because Kim Il-song is using the nuclear issue as a bargaining card to normalize relations with the United States and secure American economic cooperation, the only way to break the nuclear standoff is for Washington to guarantee Pyongyang's security by establishing diplomatic relations and suspending the "Team Spirit" military exercise with South Korea, he said, reiterating that the nuclear issue should be solved in a package deal. North Korea must expose its nuclear development program to the world and promise to maintain peace and security on the Korean peninsula, he stressed. China should then cooperate in ensuring North Korea's commitment to security on the peninsula, he added. As Kim Il-song recently showed an interest in visiting the United States, "We should not sneer at this olive branch he offered," Kim Tae-chung said. If "the great leader" ever visited the United States, North Korea might adopt a milder and more flexible foreign policy. Asked whether he would run for president again at a critical stage leading to reunification, he replied, "I'll not run even if the people want me to run."
