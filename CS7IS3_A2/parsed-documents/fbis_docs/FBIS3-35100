Dhar] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 13 -- Russia has assured India that the emergence of ultra-nationalist forces in its newly elected Parliament will not affect the India factor in its foreign policy. It has also sought an early visit by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao to Moscow to review implementation of the agreements signed during President Boris Yeltsin's New Delhi visit last year and to discuss more areas of cooperation. As a result of the exchange of communications between President Yeltsin and Mr Rao and other exchanges through diplomatic channels, it is likely that the Prime Minister will visit Moscow in June for extensive talks on international issues and bilateral matters. The Indian factor in Russia's Asian policy plays an important role and Moscow is now getting more conscious of the importance of strengthening stability and security in South Asia and the Asia- Pacific region as a whole in view of the growing fundamentalist and ethnic pressures on the Central Asian republics and the need for friendly and peaceful neighbours. Moscow has assured New Delhi that the bottlenecks to trade and supply of defence equipment and spares have now been removed and economic interaction between the two countries will increase. The backlog of supplies of equipment and spares for the Indian Air Force will be cleared in the next few weeks, as more Russian ships will dock in Indian ports. As regards the Navy and the Army, supplies will be speeded up after the visits of Russian Naval Chief Admiral Felix Nikolacvich here next week and of Indian Army Chief Gen. B.C. Joshi to Moscow later this month. India has been informed that President Yeltsin has constituted a special department to expedite arms exports. Earlier, Indian defence teams were expected to negotiate directly with the enterprises spread all over the Commonwealth of Independent States, which was a frustrating experience. After receiving frantic Indian requests, the Russian Defence Ministry shipped to India small consignments of spares from the inventory of its own armed forces until firm arrangements for supply were made. But considering that nearly 60 per cent of the arsenal of the Indian defence forces is of Soviet origin, the supplies were extremely inadequate. However, there is little progress on the cryogenic rocket engine front since the agreement between ISRO [Indian Space Research Organization] and Glavcosmos was annulled by Moscow under US pressure. Up to the time of cancellation of the pact, some technology transfer had taken place, but it had not reached the stage of handing over design, drawings and actual components of the engine, as well as fuel. The Russians are now willing to honour the financial component of the deal by supplying more finished engines than envisaged in the contract, but the Indian side is still undecided. However, other agreements regarding exchange of scientists and technicians under the umbrella of the science and technology cooperation are being implemented as per schedule. Recently, an agreement was signed between the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL) and Myasischev Design Bureau (MDB) for joint design and production of a nine to 14 seater light transport aircraft (LTA). The project is worth Rs [rupees] 80 crore (with MDB investing Rs 40 crore) and the first prototype is expected to be ready by 1995-96. Indo-Russian trade, too, is showing signs of revival after a massive disruption following disintegration of the former Soviet Union, though actually a large component of Indian exports are accounted for by debt repayments. Indian imports from Russia in the first half of last year rose by 25 per cent, mainly on account of deliveries of newsprint and non-ferrous metals. Since a proper administrative machinery for recoveries and settlement of debt did not exist in Russia, several lobbies came into operation. The Finance Ministry, which is supposed to affect recoveries, is one such lobby, with the Ministries of Foreign Economic Affairs and Industry-cum-Trade the others. Of the Rs 1,300 crore available to Russia last year as instalment of debt repayment, Moscow has been able to order imports worth Rs 700 crore only because of disagreement among Ministers on the list of commodities to be imported. The Russian Prime Minister, Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin is supposed to draw up an indicative list of items to be imported from India.
