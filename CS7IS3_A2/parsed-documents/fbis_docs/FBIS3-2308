Sources in Beijing said group of liberal intellectual had drafted a petition which they hoped would be discussed at the upcoming National People's Congres (NPC) and the Chines People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). The drafters intended to implement a signature campaign to go with the petition but they were stopped by police and state security agents last week. The five-point petition asked the legislature to consider constitutional and legal revisions allowing freedom of speech and assembly. It said workers should be assured "freedom from exploitation" and have the right to strike and organise non-official trade unions. It also demanded a better deal for the 800 million peasants and assurances that they get a fair price for produce as well as the removal of excessive taxes. A major focus was to ask the legislature and the CPPCC to put more pressure on the Government to get tough on corruption. It suggested that the NPC pass a law obliging senior officials and their offspring to declare their assets. Chinese sources said the petition was started by three dissidents who were arrested by the Government last week--trade unionist Zhou Guoqiang and legal scholars Yuan Hongbing and Wang Jiaqi. The sources said, however, that while the three initiators of the petition had been detained, this did not mean an end to the movement. They said copies of the petition had been circulated among the intellectual community in the capital and had reached more-outspoken NPC and CPPCC members, including those from Hong Kong. The sources said there was a possibility other dissident intellectuals might proceed with the signature campaign. The petition would then be presented to NPC and CPPCC deputies on an individual base and be publicised in the overseas and Hong Kong press. Hong Kong businessman and publisher Xu Simin, who is a member of the standing committee of the CPPCC, has expressed support for some form of an anti-corruption law obliging senior officials and their offspring to declare their assets and incomes. Mr Xu said the principle of the declaration of wealth had been accepted by the leadership, even though there was opposition to the ruling applying to the children of officials. Legal analysts in Beijing said, however, that the authorities would not allow NPC or CPPCC deputies to discuss more controversial aspects of the petition, particularly freedom of speech, and the rights of workers to strike and to organize trade unions. The analysts said the authorities had also decided other controversial legal issues should be avoided at the twin sessions. These included the suggestion that the law on "counter-revolutionary crime" be abolished. Discussion on the draft law on publication and the media would also be discouraged, if not stopped, because of Beijing's fear that liberal deputies might use this to clamour for a more free flow of information. While there is no clear evidence linking the unsigned statement to the detentions, the points underlined in the document are among those included in a "Peace Charter" signed by some of those detained in the current crackdown.
