FBIS4-28353 "dreas111__a94027" FBIS-EAS-94-111-A Daily Report 27 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Atomic Energy Policy in 21st Century Outlined Atomic Energy Policy in 21st Century Outlined OW2805121794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 27 May 94 Morning Edition p 3 -- FOR OOFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2805121794 Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The outline of a report on the government's basic policy on atomic energy use in the 21st century has been revealed. The report is to be compiled on 27 May by a working panel on atomic energy under the Advisory Committee for Energy [ACE], an advisory body to the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy under the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. In the report, the panel recommends that a study be made on developing a next- generation light water reactor which is safer than existing models and requires fewer operators and workers; the report suggests such a reactor would need to be ready for use by the year 2010. As some nuclear reactors are expected to have reached the end of their useful life by the beginning of the 21st century, the panel also urges a prompt start to studies on developing technology to handle the disposal of nuclear waste that arises with the dismantling of reactors and on drawing up adequate safety standards. On the issue of plutonium use, the panel's report is in line with the Long-Range Plan on the Development and Use of Atomic Energy, the outline of which was announced earlier by the Atomic Energy Commission. Light water reactors account for about 90 percent of the world's nuclear reactors used for generating electricity. However, a great deal of trouble is involved in their maintenance and repair. The Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, manufacturers of nuclear reactors, and power companies plan to jointly compile a report on the results of their research over the next three years on next generation nuclear reactors. Such reactors, it is felt, must have "a high degree of safety, dependability, low impact on the environment, and low personnel costs." On the basis of such efforts, work will begin on making next generation nuclear reactor technology practical. Japan is to start work on finalizing specific safety measures for its next generation nuclear reactor. However, the United States, which has already developed its next generation nuclear reactor, plans to reduce its scale and simplify it by making further improvements to a safety device that cools the reactor core in case of emergencies. Meanwhile, nuclear reactors which began operating in the 1970's will be getting too old by the 21st century. The ACE working panel, in its report, stresses that in dismantling old reactors "it will be necessary to gain the understanding of local residents for dismantling procedures, the disposal of waste materials, and land use after dismantling." The panel, therefore, urges that detailed procedures and standards first be drawn up.
