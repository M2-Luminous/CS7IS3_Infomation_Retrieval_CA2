Fidesz, which according to the most recent data is the last--sixth, with scarcely more than 7 percent of the votes--of the parties to get into parliament, will make a decision at a session of the presidium tomorrow about the convening and date of this extraordinary meeting. Viktor Orban said that as long as he is chairman of Fidesz his party would certainly not enter into a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party, which received the most votes. According to Orban, the country has voted for a radical change; Fidesz, however, wanted only a partial turnabout, and this is probably why it performed more poorly than expected.
