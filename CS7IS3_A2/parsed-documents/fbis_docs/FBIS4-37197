In an interview with Qol Yisra'el, Rabinovich -- who is also Israel's chief negotiator with Damascus -- urged Syria to seize the moment because the Americans will not continue to be interested in the process for an unlimited period of time. Rabinovich says he believes U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will come again to the region in the coming weeks. With regard to peace talks between Israel and Jordan, Rabinovich said he does not expect a breakthrough as a result of King Husayn's visit to Washington. The next round of talks with Jordan is due to get under way at the beginning of July. This, according to government sources in Jerusalem quoted by the ITIM news agency.
