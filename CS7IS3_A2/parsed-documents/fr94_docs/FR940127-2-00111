FR940127-2-00111 FR940127-2-00071 One commentator preferred the Commission's definition of ``accredited investor'' to the definition of ``institutional account'' in the proposed rule change. The Commission's accredited investor definition includes a wide range of investors, such as any private business development company or individuals making in excess of $200,000 per year for three years. The term ``accredited investor'' is used as part of an exemptive provision from certain registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. Having a customer classified as an ``accredited investor,'' however, does not excuse dealers from obtaining specific customer account data when making recommendations in equity transactions. Moreover, because ``institutional account''_rather than ``accredited investor''_is used by the NASD to define a dealer's customer account requirements, the Board believes that the use of a different test for municipal securities transactions would complicate the internal recordkeeping requirements of most securities firms. Transactions With Investment Advisors Two commentators requested clarification of the suitability requirements that exist when a dealer executes a transaction for an investment advisor. The Board notes that this question is answered by determining who the dealer's customer is_the investment advisor or the investment advisor's client. The Board believes that, in general, the investment advisor will be the dealer's customer. However, it is not possible to state this as an ironclad rule. The requirement for establishing suitability may depend on whether the beneficial owner is looking to the dealer or exclusively to the investment advisor for recommendations on investments. The dealer, of course, should obtain the necessary customer account data from whomever is the customer. If the investment advisor is the customer, then the dealer would proceed as with other institutional accounts. However, if a dealer has a dealer-customer relationship with the beneficial owner and treats that entity as its own customer, then the dealer must obtain the information necessary to make a suitability determination prior to making a recommendation. In this case, the investment advisor is treated as an interested party to the transaction. III.
