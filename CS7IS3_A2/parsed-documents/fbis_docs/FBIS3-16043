The agreement was signed between Linkevicius and his Danish counterpart Hans Haekkerup who was on visit in the Baltic state. With the help of Denmark which is a member of NATO, Lithuania is going to create and develop its armed forces and voluntary service of national defence, to train servicemen, to make up a peacekeeping corps. Linkevicius said Denmark was participating most actively in forming units of "blue helmets". A company of Lithuanian soldiers has already been trained in Denmark, another one is due to leave in the nearest days. In August, Lithuanian peacekeeping contingent is going to go to Croatia together with Danish battalion. No doubt, the agreement pushes Lithuania nearer to the Western Europe, Haekkerup said. Denmark is taking part in preparations of a programme introducing Lithuania to NATO, joint exercises of military units of both states are planned. Late in January, Lithuania became the second state after Romania to sign a NATO initiative "Partnership for peace". In March 18, representatives of Scandinavia, Germany, Britain, the U.S. and the three Baltic states are going to meet in Copenhagen and consider assistance to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia creating their own peacekeeping forces. A joint battalion of the three countries is planned to set up with its training centre in Lithuanian southern city Alytus, in a former military basis of Russian paratroopers.
