FBIS3-33086 "drlat033_r_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-033 Document Type:Daily Report 17 Feb 1994 Peru CCD To Question Bustamante on Passage of Jurisdiction Law PA1702003794 Paris AFP in Spanish 1702 GMT 15 Feb 94 PA1702003794 Paris AFP Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Lima, 15 Feb (AFP) -- The Peruvian opposition on Tuesday initiated the process whereby Council of Ministers President Alfonso Bustamante and two other members of the cabinet will be formally questioned about their approval of a controversial law that transferred jurisdiction of the case involving the disappearance and murder of nine students and one professor, presumably by soldiers in July 1992, to a military court. An opposition coordinating board announced on Tuesday morning that most of the questions will be directed at Bustamante, who must clearly establish whether or not there is any truth to the growing rumors of his resignation from the Council of Ministers. Another question he must answer is why he failed to sign the controversial law, which has been viewed by various sectors as a "coup d'etat" against the Judicial Branch because of its "unconstitutional" nature, according to Congressman Fernando Olivera. The procedures for the questioning have come at a time when rumors are circulating regarding the possible U.S. withdrawal from the Support Group seeking Peru's reinstatement in the international economic system. "There is no official report concerning a possible suspension of U.S. support," says Democratic Constituent Congress [CCD] Vice President Carlos Torres. The local media expressed concern over statements by U.S. Senator Bob Graham, who said on Monday during an official visit to Peru that the law's approval "may constitute a reversal of the pledge to restore democracy and respect human rights." Nevertheless, Graham said he is confident that the discrepancy between the two governments will be resolved through dialogue. The other two ministers who may be questioned are Defense Minister General Victor Malca, for his alleged political responsibility in this case, and Justice Minister Fernando Vega, who signed the law. Local observers maintain that if there is any truth to the reports published in just about every Peruvian newspaper to the effect that Bustamante is resigning, a ministerial crisis may be brewing and it might break upon President Alberto Fujimori's return from Colombia. Bustamante is a member of his official entourage. In accordance with the controversial law, known as the jurisdictional dispute law, the Supreme Court resolves litigation between civilian and military courts. The law was enacted precisely when a court was hearing the case of the nine students and one professor from La Cantuta Unversity in Lima, whose charred remains were discovered in common graves on the outskirts of Lima last year. By virtue of the law, the case was settled when three Supreme Court justices voted in favor of transferring the case to a military court and two voted in favor of the common courts, thus eliminating the need for a decisive vote. In the past the Supreme Court required a majority of four votes to resolve a jurisdictional conflict and in the event of a split decision, another justice would cast the decisive vote. Opposition congressmen on Tuesday began collecting the 27 signatures required for approval of the ministers' questioning.
