The outcome of the recent round of by-elections spread across the country may or may not be wholly reflectvie of the popular mood, but it has certainly served to further boost Mr Narasimha Rao's position. Even if one were to view the Congress victories in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal pradesh, Punjab, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh as individual aberrations, there surely must be some lesson to be drawn from the fact that out of 18 parliamentary and assembly seats which went to the hustings, the ruling party won as many as 10 while its two main national opponents, BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] and Janata Dal, managed respectively two and none. This relative supremacy of the Congress; under Mr Narasimha Rao's leadership over political rivals is all the more creditworthy in the light of the party's performance in bypolls under past Prime Ministers in mid-term. Both Mrs Indira Gandhi and her son and successor looked distinctly vulnerable after their honeymoon period with the electoral had worn off and invariably tended to lose bypolls: And as for non-Congress Prime Minister of yore, none of them even managed to last at the Centre long enough the middle of their full term in office. There are other crucial differences between Mr Narasimha Rao and his predecessors in the Prime Minister's chair. The pupularity graphs of leaders like Mrs Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and even those of Mr Morarji Desai and Mr V P Singh tended to follow an uniform pattern. They rose dramatically when these Prime Ministers first assumed power and then started slumping as disillusionment set in with their respective regimes. Mr Narasimha Rao's graph, on the other hand, has followed a more complex course. He became Prime Minister amidst few expectations and was in fact widely considered to be a stop gap leader to be cast aside as soon as Mrs Sonia Gandhi or some powerful Congress boss managed to seize power. His graph rose, however, when in, the first year of ofice he staved off such challenges in a quiet and dogged manner but then on a downward spiral after the demolition of the Babri Masjid and the corruption charges levelled by Mr Harshad Mehta. Now that the Prime Minister has not only managed to survive the crises of last year but emerged the leader of a reasonably stable government with a full-fledged majority in the Lok Sabha, his stock has once again mounted. Not surprisingly, this checkered political track record which if nothing else illustrated Mr Sarasimha Rao's ability to handle the rough as well as the smooth has pushed to the corner his opponents within the Congress and outside. Former ruling party dissidents like Mr Arjun Singh and Mr Sharad Pawar have become increasingly wary of openly crossing swords with the Prime Minister and the dissidence which had once threatened to engulf the Congress has virtually faded away over recent months. More importantly, there is a new respect within the party for Mr Narasimha Rao's political judgement which was not there before. Most Congressmen today grudgingly admit that even the Prime Minister's only palpable blunder over the Babri Masjid demolition may not have been a mistake after all but a shredw piece of procrastination. They concede that while dismissing the Kalyan Singh Government or order fire at the militing masses at Ayodhya to protect that mosque may have been morally right and brave but could have had disastrous political consequences for the party if a enervated BJP had swept Uttar Pradesh in the subsequent election. Mr Rao's prescription of patiently riding out the saffron wave was indeed painful for those in the Congress used to Mrs Gandhi's penchant to do open battle but in hindsight now seems to have been the correct' strategy. There is also far less panic in the ruling party about being swallowed by either the Mandir or the Mandal Wole. Congressmen realise that the wheels of the Sangh Parivar's judggernaut has got badly stuck after the denouncement of last year's Assemby polls while the Janata Dal's missionary zeal in promoting a caste revolution has not been able to prevent the steady disintegration of the party. This is not to suggest that Mr Rao has managed to orchestrate a resurgence of the Congress. There are no indications whatsoever of the party reviving in states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar where it has become even more marginalised than before. Yet there are few partymen today who would support an alternative leader to Mr Rao who after all has shown the way of keeping a political fossil like the Congress alive at the centre without the life support of the country's two largest states. Many of them privately criticise the Prime Minister's reluctance to revamp the party organisation in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar but at the same time acknowledge the Herculean nature of this task. Some have even started to say that Mr Rao may be making the best of a bad job. General public perceptions of Mr Rao are more difficult to pin down. But there is little doubt that he has emerged a seasoned leader who for all his flaws has been able to rise out of political turmoil to give the country a relatively stable government than his immediate predecessors. Jokes about the Prime Minister's notorious indecisive nature still do the media circles and perhaps have some justification but they no longer raise the sort of derisive laughter at the popular level. After all it is difficult to sneer at a leader for faillng to take decisions when he manages to come out on the top everytime by doing so. In fact, there are some people who see Mr Rao as a wise stateman who realising the limitations of the party he leads and the country he rules gives time for problems to resolve themselves. They see his foreign policy successes as well as his ability to manage contradictions at home as signs of a Prime Minister who may be the best candidate for leading such a large and diverse nation as India. Much of this present aura about Mr. Rao could quickly vanish if his political career hits another iceberg. People are quick to change their perceptions about leaders and a major economic disaster or communal turbulence may well send the Prime Minister's image plunging down again. Yet, considering Mr Rao's proven skill of surmounting disasters without appearing to put much effort, most may hesitate before writing the obituary of a Prime Minister who has proved his detractors wrong so many times before.
