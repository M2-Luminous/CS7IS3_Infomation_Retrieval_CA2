Speaking to correspondents after his meeting with Gustave Feissel today, Denktas said that Mr. Feissel must be satisfied now because he said that he gave Feissel all that he wanted. He further maintained that Feissel also gave the Turkish Cypriot side what it wanted. Denktas said that some changes will be made to the latest UN document of 21 March. He also noted that what is left now is to prepare the draft agreement for signing. Gustave Feissel said after the meeting that Rauf Denktas has moved from some of his positions, but it has not become clear whether he accepts the 21 March UN document as is. Despite repeated questions from journalists, Mr. Feissel avoided saying whether the document had been accepted. He said: It is up to the UN secretary general and the Security Council to decide whether the clarifications given by Denktas today represent a development in the right direction. Feissel confirmed that Denktas did not give anything in writing and added that today's meeting with him was the last. The UN secretary general's representative has briefed President Glavkos Kliridhis on Denktas' clarifications. In a statement made to CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] a short time ago, Gustave Feissel noted that what Rauf Denktas said about him having accepted all the points on the confidence-building measures is only the opinion of the Turkish Cypriot leader. Asked if Mr. Feissel really gave all that Denktas was demanding, as the Turkish Cypriot leader had said, according to REUTER, the UN official replied that this was inaccurate. Mr. Feissel made it clear that his mission was not to agree on anything. He added: My mission was to receive some clarifications, which I did and I will convey them to New York.
