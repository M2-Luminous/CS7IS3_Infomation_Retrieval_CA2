He said that the support and signing of the PFP at the highest level by President Berisha is a further element in the framework of cooperation, thus granting a possibility to prepare the Albanian Army on the road of accomplishing one of the most important goals in Albania's foreign policy, that of membership with full rights in the Alliance. Underlining the situation in the region for a permanent solution to the problem of Bosnia and for a practical and preventive stance by the international community so as not to allow the spread of conflict to Kosova and beyond, he expressed the readiness of the Albanian democratic government to fulfill the obligations that derive from its presence in the cooperation process with NAKSI [expansion unknown] and PFP, as well as the determination of the Republic of Albania to be a factor of peace and stability in the region and Europe.
