The bill was adopted by the State Duma on May 11. The bill puts a limit on Russia's borrowing abroad at 4.7 billion dollars, and on its credits to foreign countries at 400 million dollars. It goes into effect as soon as it is published. As the chairman of the Federation Council committee for budget, finances and currency regulation, Nikolay Gonchar, explained to the deputies, under the bill "the maximum size of credits will depend on the ability of Russia's economy to service its foreign debts." According to him, since the amount of 4.7 billion dollars is one billion dollars less than the size of borrowing envisaged by Russia's Finance Ministry in this year's budget estimates, amendments will have to be made to the corresponding articles of the state budget without increasing the budget deficit or incurring additional expenditure. According to the data submitted by Gonchar, Russia's foreign debt (not counting the debts to East European countries and overdue commercial payments registered by the beginning of 1994) surpassed 80 billion dollars, while the annual payments Russia is obliged to make under the schedule for servicing and repaying the main bulk of its debt exceeded 20 billion dollars in 1992-1993. This year the payments connected with servicing and repaying the foreign debt, taking into account payments postponed from 1993, make up 32 billion dollars, or 70 percent of the export revenues expected this year.
