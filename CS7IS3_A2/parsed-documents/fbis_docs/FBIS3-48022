Washington expects the Hosokawa government to display a positive attitude, unlike past Japanese Governments, in the talks. This "excessive expectation" has led to an aggressive attitude by U.S. negotiators in the talks. Also, because of its weak political basis at home, the Clinton administration "cannot retreat from its tough stand" in the talks. Last November, a senior USTR [U.S. Trade Representative] official said, "We do not need to hurry because there will be more negotiations on 11 February," indicating the trade talks would be concluded during the summit talks between Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton. This suggests that the U.S. Government, which gives high marks to Prime Minister Hosokawa, places more hope on "a decision to be made by Hosokawa" than on negotiations with Japanese bureaucrats. However, even after welcoming in the new year, the Hosokawa government remains stymied by the "political reform" problem. The administration is unable to lead bureaucrats in the trade talks. Instead, it has recently made remarks in favor of bureaucrats' opinions. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor recently expressed dissatisfaction with Japan, saying: "The United States has made efforts to fulfill Japan's requests for reducing financial deficits and realizing low interest rates. Meanwhile, Japan has made little effort to open its markets to foreign competition." The United States is irritated because things have turned out contrary to its expectations. As in Japan, the political base of the ruling party supporting the Clinton government is weak. Some tough elements in the U.S. auto industry are now saying: "Do not conclude the trade talks if the two sides reach an agreement without setting numerical targets." Washington has not changed its view that the Hosokawa government is "better than past Japanese Governments which formed collusive ties with bureaucrats and corporations" (according to a senior Commerce Department official). Thus, when Washington criticizes Japan, it directs its criticism at bureaucrats, not Hosokawa. U.S. Under Secretary of State Wirth has suggested the summit talks between Clinton and Hosokawa could be held not only on 11 February but also in the evenings of 10 and 12 February. Washington seems to have concluded that at the final stage it will have no choice but to urge Hosokawa to make a decision.
