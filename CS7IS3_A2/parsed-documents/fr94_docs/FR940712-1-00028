FR940712-1-00028 FR940712-1-00009 Tuesday July 12, 1994 Part III Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Parts 164 and 165 Sale of Lumber and Other Forest Products by Indian Enterprises and Sale of Forest Products, Red Lake Indian Reservation, MN; Proposed Rules Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 132␣/␣Tuesday, July 12, 1994␣/␣Proposed Rules DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Bureau of Indian Affairs 25 CFR Part 164 RIN: 1076&hyph;AC77 Sale of Lumber and Other Forest Products Produced by Indian Enterprises From the Forests on Indian Reservations AGENCY: Bureau of Indian Affairs, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) is proposing to delete regulations which govern the terms and conditions under which forest products produced by Indian tribal forest enterprises from the forests of Indian Reservations may be sold. The BIA is proposing to delete these regulations because the ``General Forest Regulations,'' prescribe a similar policy for sales of Indian forest products in the section, ``Indian Tribal Forest Enterprise Operations.'' Therefore, the proposed deletion is necessary to eliminate redundancy and potential confusion in forestry program regulations. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Mail or hand deliver comments to: Mr. Jim Stires, Billings Area Office, BIA, Branch of Forestry, 316 North 26th Street, Billings, Montana; or Mr. Bill Downes, Division of Forestry, 1849 C Street NW., Mail Stop 4545 MIB, Washington DC 20240. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Jim Stires, Billings Area Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Branch of Forestry at (406) 657&hyph;6358. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action, deleting 25 CFR part 164, results from the BIA's need to eliminate the redundancy and potential confusion arising from having two regulations governing the same operation in the 25 CFR Indian forestry program regulations. The BIA recognizes that provisions in §163.13 of the revision of 25 CFR part 163, ``General Forest Regulations,'' are adequate to govern the sale of Indian forest products and, as a result, that 25 CFR part 164 is no longer needed.
