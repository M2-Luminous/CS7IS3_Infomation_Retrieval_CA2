Reports say that the ambassadors were convinced that Pakistan is behind terrorism in the state. The group has assessed that ordinary people in the state would like to see the end of violence and the situation brought back to normal. They were unhappy that the Hurriyyat Conference leaders changed the venue of the meeting at the last moment and that envoys could not meet them. However, the delegation was satisfied it could meet a cross section of the people. The delegation regretted that Amnesty International released its report on human rights situation in Punjab without going there, although it was permitted to send a team to the state.
