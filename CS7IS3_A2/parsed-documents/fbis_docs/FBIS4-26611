Some 79 big industrial groups selected from 11 sectors, including the machine building, metallurgical, chemicals, textiles, power and petrochemical industries, will be the main participants in the program. These groups are now the mainstay of the provincial economy, including the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Dongfeng Motor Vehicle Company, the Jinmen Petrochemicals Plant and the Hanchuang Power Plant. The provincial government will adopt preferential policies for these enterprises in technical upgrading and implementing reform measures in a bid to increase their market share. It plans to increase their sales by an average of 1 billion yuan (about 120 million U.S. dollars) each year. The province's fixed industrial assets have come to more than 80 billion yuan (about 10 billion U.S. dollars). A committee made up of members of the provincial economic, planning, finance, banking, taxation and science departments has been set up to coordinate the implementation of the program.
