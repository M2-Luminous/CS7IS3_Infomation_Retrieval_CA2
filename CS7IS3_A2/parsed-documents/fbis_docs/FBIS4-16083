FBIS4-16083 "drsov072_s_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-072 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Georgia Opposition Leader: Shevardnadze `Mafia's Hostage' Opposition Leader: Shevardnadze `Mafia's Hostage' LD1304211594 Tbilisi IBERIA in Georgian 1445 GMT 12 Apr 94 LD1304211594 Tbilisi IBERIA Georgian BFN [Text] Tbilisi, 12 Apr -- In an interview with an IBERIA correspondent, Giorgiy Chanturia, chairman of the Georgian National Democratic Party [NDP], said an analysis of political life in Georgia shows that the forces ruling Georgia, including the head of state, have no political will. Eduard Shevardnadze only acts as a passive observer of events. As a result, the country's political course keeps changing, swinging from pro-American to pro-Russian and back, which is ruinous for the country. Giorgiy Chanturia said the head of state was committed to a doomed policy of personnel balancing in the state structures. The notorious incident involving the chief of the Tbilisi police directorate, Davit Zeikidze, was a result of that policy. The two enemies ended up working in the same system -- the Interior Ministry. Giorgiy Chanturia described Shevardnadze's policy as a policy of the past, saying that Shevardnadze had a choice of either being with the mafia or not. Since he lacked political will, he had, in fact, become the mafia's hostage. On the issue of the opposition, the NDP leader said it had no political will either; however, there were definitely some outstanding figures in it. The West was now relying mostly on three forces in Georgia -- the NDP, the Republican Party, and the People's Front, among which, according to Chanturia, the NDP had the priority. On the South Ossetian problem, Giorgiy Chanturia said the issue was a nuisance for the Georgian parliament, whose deputies were involved primarily in buying property abroad and accumulating wealth at home. The coolness of their attitude towards that issue was demonstrated, for example, by their trust in the quadripartite agreement on the settlement of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The Abkhaz side had cheated Georgia before and would do so again, concluded G. Chanturia.
