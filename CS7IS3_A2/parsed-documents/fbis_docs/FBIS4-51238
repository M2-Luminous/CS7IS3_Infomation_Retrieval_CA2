The five pleasure boats were handed over to Commissioner of Hong Kong Police Li Kwan-ha at a handling-over ceremony held at a pier in Shekou, in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone of southern China's Guangdong Province and then towed back to Hong Kong. The recovered pleasure crafts have a total value of 12.2 million HK dollars (1.56 million U.S. dollars), said Perter Yam, senior staff officer of the Organized Crime and Triad [word as received] Bureau (OCTB), at Sai Wan Ho Marine Police Headquarters, where the five boats towed to and anchored. A total of nine pleasure boats were stolen from the Causeway Bay and Pochong Wan Typhoon Shelters in Hong Kong between January and October last year. Hong Kong Police passed on relevant information to its counter parts in China and some southeastern countries. After a period of investigation, the public security bureau (PSB) in Guangdong Province recovered five of the nine stolen crafts and arrested two Hong Kong residents in connection with the case, Yam said. Meanwhile, Hong Kong Police also arrested six Hong Kong residents based on information supplied by the Chinese PSB, he added. As for the other four boats, Yam said, "The Chinese side tried its best to assist us in locating them, but there was no evidence that the boats are at the moment in China." He believes the other four boats are still somewhere in Southeast Asia. Four of the five returned boats will be handed over to the insurance company and the fifth will go back to the original owner, Yam said. In future, local police will tighten patrol on the sea and keep in closer contacts with China in cracking down on unlawful activities, he added.
