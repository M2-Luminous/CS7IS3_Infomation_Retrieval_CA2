The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] thinks that "the unilateral report has been compiled based on false premises." The refutation will be formulated as a report and will be sent to the U.S. Government as early as mid-April. It will convey Tokyo's position at every level of upcoming bilateral negotiations. In the report on trade barriers, the USTR listed 43 items deemed to be Japan's "trade barriers," and, in a follow-up news conference, USTR Counsel General Ira Shapiro stressed that "Japan's trade barriers are extremely numerous compared to those of the seven advanced nations." In reaction, the government criticized the U.S. report, noting that "the definition of `trade barriers' is unclear and the report has been written based on the wishes of U.S. industrial circles" (as stated by MITI). Moreover, the government said that individual trade barriers are "based on false premises." As for government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment, which has been newly added to the trade barriers list, the government noted that the "U.S. request concerning this sector has already been incorporated into our economic reform guidelines." The government intends to convey the aforementioned points to the United States.
