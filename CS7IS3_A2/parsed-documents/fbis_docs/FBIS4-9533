Society must know that the strikes in the brown coal mines constitute a threat to Poland's power supply, and the spread of strike actions can ruin the chances of economic development, a Government Press Bureau communique on 27 April states. [passage omitted] In the government's assessment, their are no substantive grounds for reaching for the strike weapon. The strikes are continuing in spite of clear assurances that the reform of the brown-coal mining industry depends on an earlier agreement with the trade unions and in spite of the annulment by the industry minister of the instruction concerning changes in this sector of the economy. The response to the decision by the minister of industry and trade was more demands and attempts at diktat. The readiness for talks is being ignored. Such a reaction proves unambiguously that, for the strike organizers, the content itself of the demands and negotiations is of lesser importance. Unrest and tensions themselves are what count. The leaders of the Solidarity trade union have made a nervous attempt to force decisions by the state's constitutional bodies and to restore a situation guaranteeing Solidarity a privileged position vis-a-vis the other trade unions. To achieve these aims, it is deceiving the working milieux by disseminating untrue reports of mass redundancies being prepared. The government is open to talks with the trade unions, employer representatives, and local self-government leaders. [passage omitted] Such talks are already under way. It is Solidarity that has refused to take part in them. [passage omitted] The organizers of the strike bear responsibility for diminishing chances for development. The effect of their deeds is that we in Poland see, with each passing hour, a disorganization of the economy, a smaller cake to share, and less to satisfy the needs of the population. These strikes have no legal basis nor any substantive, rational justification. Enterprises have every right to seek compensation from the strike organizers for losses incurred, we read in the communique of the Government Press Office. The government is taking essential steps to limit the danger to the security of the country and to lessen the extent of economic losses and the inconvenience caused to Polish families by strike actions. Unfortunately, should restrictions in the production of electricity be protracted, periodic power cuts in homes will become inevitable. The Council of Ministers expresses its trust that the Polish people will not surrender to the blackmail of strikes. While keeping its open-minded attitude toward substantive negotiations, the government declares that it will decisively oppose any anarchy in economic life and work for the security of the citizens. Negotiations need an atmosphere of cooperation and not one of threats and irresponsibility. Participation in the strike is like voting for destabilization and for hindering any chance of social demands being implemented. The prime minister has empowered Industry and Trade Minister Marek Pol to hold talks on demands made by different sectors of industry. As far as issues concerning the whole of society are concerned, such a remit has been entrusted to Leszek Miller, minister of labor and social policy. A meeting of all the trade unions that belong to the Tripartite Commission will take place on 29 April. According to the prime minister, there is no basis for calling a national strike, states the communique.
