FR940110-1-00071 FR940110-1-00006 Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that during the required long-term period applicable to an owner-occupied housing unit assisted by a grant provided under the AHP, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the unit to determine whether it has been sold to a household with an income that exceeds the level committed to in the AHP application. The Board requests comments on two proposed options for implementing this requirement. These options incorporate the use of sampling to monitor AHP-assisted projects. The Board recognizes that as the number of AHP-assisted projects in existence grows, the costs of monitoring these projects may place an undue financial burden on the Banks and the AHP. Monitoring AHP-assisted projects on a sample basis may be one way to minimize the costs of monitoring while continuing to meet the monitoring requirements of the Act. Section 960.14(e)(1)(ii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review of relevant reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor, including any reports or certifications received pursuant to ยง960.15(c)(1)(ii) of the proposed rule and, at least on a sample basis, periodic review of land title records at intervals determined by the Bank, based on the amount of funds received by the project pursuant to the AHP, the type and complexity of the project, or other factors deemed relevant by the Bank. An alternative option would be to require that the Bank only would have to review land title records on a sample basis, as determined by the Bank. (ii) Rental housing projects. Section 960.14(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank shall require an AHP-assisted rental housing project to be subject to a deed restriction or other legally enforceable mechanism which requires that upon sale of the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which the project's rental units, or portion thereof, must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the level committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee must receive notice of the sale, and: (1) The project's rental units, or portion thereof, must continue to be affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and the purchaser agrees to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that applied to the seller; or (2) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) above, and if the Bank provided a direct subsidy to the applicant which was passed on as a grant to the seller, the seller must repay a pro rata portion of the grant to the applicant, as provided in ยง960.16(d)(1) of the proposed rule; or (3) If the purchaser does not satisfy the requirements in (1) above, and if the Bank provided a subsidized advance to the applicant which in turn provided a below market rate loan to the seller, then the provisions of ยง960.16(d)(2) shall apply. Section 960.14(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule provides that upon initial full occupancy of the units in an AHP-assisted rental housing project or one year after initial disbursement of the subsidized advance or direct subsidy, whichever occurs first, the Bank or its designee shall obtain a certification from the sponsor or the owner that the project's units, or portion thereof, are affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at initial occupancy at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application. Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(A) of the proposed rule provides that during the long-term period for which the units, or portion thereof, of a rental housing project must remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application, the Bank or its designee shall monitor the project to determine whether the project's units, or portion thereof, remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels committed to in the AHP application. The Board requests comments on several options for implementing this requirement. Section 960.14(e)(2)(iii)(B) of the proposed rule proposes that monitoring shall include, but is not limited to, periodic review of relevant household income and rent reports or certifications obtained from the sponsor or the owner and, at least on a sample basis, periodic inspections of the project at intervals to be determined by the Bank, based on the amount of AHP assistance received by the project, the type and complexity of the project, and other factors deemed relevant by the Bank.
