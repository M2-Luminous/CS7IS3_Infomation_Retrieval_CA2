The withdrawal clearly showed that the process of forging a new political alliance in the region has begun. As little as 12 hours before the withdrawal, international news agencies did not give any hint that the resolution would be taken back. Rather, the news agencies reported that the Kashmir resolution might be passed. In the resolution, Pakistan condemned human rights violations in Kashmir and called for sending a UN Human Rights Commission fact-finding mission to the state. Pakistan considered this resolution very important. Prime Minister Bhutto sought the support of each of the member countries, but she failed even to win the support of the Muslim countries. Pakistan was asked by China and 10 Muslim countries -- including Iran -- to withdraw the resolution. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali said it was very difficult for his country to refuse a request made by China and Iran. Only Saudi Arabia and Bosnia-Herzegovina supported Pakistan's resolution. Bangladesh remained aloof, saying it would abstain from voting on the resolution. It did not side with the 10 Muslim countries led by Iran or with Pakistan. It should be mentioned that neither Saudi Arabia nor Bosnia have any voting rights in the 52-member UN Human Rights Commission, but they have a large number of supporters. Bangladesh's stand on this issue is not transparent. For a long time, Bangladesh has been raising its voice against human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir. It has always supported UN resolutions on Kashmir, but it did not support this Pakistani-sponsored resolution. Diplomatic sources told this correspondent that Bangladesh does not have any strategy of its own. Its foreign policy has no specific goals. It is difficult to say whether there is any logic behind the nonaligned foreign policy currently being pursued by Bangladesh following the end of the Cold War between the United States and the former Soviet Union. It should be mentioned that Bangladesh does not want to support either India or Pakistan on this issue. India has described Pakistan's resolution as interference in its internal affairs. The resolution proposed that a delegation from the International Red Cross Society or any reliable representative of the UN Human Rights Commission be sent to Kashmir. Before the withdrawal of the resolution, India allowed a group of diplomats from Muslim countries to visit Kashmir, and officials briefed them on the situation in the state. During the visit, the Kashmiri people observed a strike and held protest demonstrations. The diplomats observed these events from bulletproof cars. Foreign diplomats based in Dhaka have said that this the visit India arranged for the Muslim envoys was aimed at countering Pakistan's diplomacy on Kashmir. India achieved tremendous success in this regard, as the 10 Muslim countries led by Iran agreed to ask Pakistan to withdraw its resolution. Thus, India was able to win a diplomatic victory over Pakistan. This was possible because of the Muslim countries. It must be concluded that India has strong ties with the Muslim countries. It may be recalled that when Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao visited Iran toward the end of 1993, Iranian President Hashemi-Rafsanjani proposed that China, India, and Iran form an alliance. India did not reject this proposal, and China did not voice any opposition to it. Pakistani Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ali gave an interview to THE TELEGRAPH during his visit to Bangladesh in which he said it is impossible for India or China to form such an alliance. He said that Iran made this proposal because of its anti-American stand. The undeclared alliance among these three countries became clear with the withdrawal of the Pakistani-sponsored resolution on Kashmir at the UN Human Rights Commission. China's policy is that other countries should not have any say regarding the human rights situation in this region. The current Iranian policy is anti-American, while Indian policy is to overcome the present crisis by any means. India does not support Western interference in the country's human rights situation. It is therefore quite likely that these three countries may forge an alliance at any time. If this is done, the alliance will be very strong. In the near future, this alliance will also be able to influence Pakistani policy. China not only wants to compete with the United States by forming an Asia-Pacific Economic Council, it also wants to form a regional bloc. After pulling out of Vietnam and Cambodia, China tried to establish ties with the ASEAN countries. In view of its strained relations with ASEAN, China is now in search of new allies. For this reason, China is saying that the small countries in the region should form an independent bloc. It is not clear what stand small countries such as Bangladesh will take toward the new bloc China is considering proposing. The nonaligned policy is gradually losing significance. A meeting of the nonaligned G-15 group scheduled for New Delhi last December was not held. The South American member countries did not attend the meeting. These countries -- including Chile, Brazil, and Argentina -- are eager to join the North American Free Trade Association [as published]. The other members of this nonaligned group -- including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Zimbabwe -- emphasize the importance of this grouping because they have anti-American stands. The pro-American members are unhappy about this. Under the prevailing circumstances, the countries of this region feel it is necessary to form an alliance. Pakistan's resolution on Kashmir led to a diplomatic debacle for that country. China believes that Pakistan's resolution had the backing of the United States. Beijing is not willing to tolerate U.S. interference in the region. It is not clear what sort of understanding China would like between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue. If China wants regional problems to be resolved on a regional basis, then we have nothing to say. If it wants to achieve its own objectives, however, the small countries should consider the matter. We have seen that India is unwilling to resolve problems bilaterally. Hence, any alliance between India and China would be a cause of concern for the small countries.
