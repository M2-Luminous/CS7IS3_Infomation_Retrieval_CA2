Unexpectedly, when he checked in at the airport, he was detained by the authorities. By late Friday night there had been no news about him, and his family also knows nothing of his whereabouts despite inquiries through many channels. As disclosed by a friend of Lin Muchen in New York, Lin was approved and issued with a student visa by the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai to further his studies at his own expense. Lin's friend pointed out that the Chinese authorities had approved allowing him to leave the country, but suddenly went back on their word and detained him. Obviously, this action is unwise as it happens on the eve of when U.S. President Clinton is about to announce whether he will extend most-favored-nation treatment to China on 3 June. Lin Muchen is an "old line" pro-democracy activist. He was one of the organizers of the "Shanghai Spring" during the period of the "Xidan Democracy Wall" movement in Beijing as early as the late 1970's. Later, he was thrown into prison for his active participation in the pro-democracy movement in 1989. Meanwhile, last Saturday [7 May] marked two years' of detention without trial for another Chinese dissident, Kang Yuchun [1660 3768 2504], who is being kept in the heavily guarded Beijing Banbuqiao Detention Center, and whose relatives and friends have heard nothing about him so far.
