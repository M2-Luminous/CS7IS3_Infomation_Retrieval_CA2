FBIS4-55863 "dreeu099_k_94005" FBIS-EEU-94-099 Daily Report 23 May 1994 CROATIA Assembly Chamber To Elect New Speaker Assembly Chamber To Elect New Speaker LD2305115594 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network in Serbo-Croatian 1100 GMT 23 May 94 LD2305115594 Zagreb Radio Croatia Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Excerpt] The 14th session of the Chamber of Counties is expected to resume within an hour. Josip Manolic is expected to finally resign at this session. A new speaker and new deputy speakers of the chamber will also be elected. This is what the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] deputies have been discussing since 1000, that is 1100 [as heard], in state president and party chairman Tudjman's residence. Opposition leaders, too, are talking behind closed doors at the Croatian Assembly. Both sides are outlining their strategy for implementing an interparty agreement. The opposition must come up with their candidates for deputy speakers in the Chamber of Counties by 1400. As yet, no one is willing to make any official statement. This is why we can reveal only an unofficial and unconfirmed piece of information: the deputy speaker posts in the Chamber of Counties should be allocated to the Croatian Liberal Democratic Party and the Croatian Peasants' Party.
