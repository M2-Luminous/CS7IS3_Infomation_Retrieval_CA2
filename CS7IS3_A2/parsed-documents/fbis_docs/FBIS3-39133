In fact, as regards the possibility of military intervention in former Yugoslavia, [Democratic Party of the Left] Secretary Occhetto has found himself holding a similar position to that of [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi and the MSI [Italian Social Movement], whereas Communist Renewal has declared itself against armed intervention. Occhetto said he was in no doubt that "we must intervene in Bosnia, and the international community must take up an active position. We cannot be helpless bystanders in witnessing such an atrocious war." MSI Deputy Cristiana Muscardini also stated where her party stood on this matter: "We have had enough words, enough of war! We Italians, and all Europeans, have the duty to commit ourselves resolutely so as to achieve a solution to the Bosnian conflict." For Berlusconi, on the other hand, peacemaking actions in Bosnia must be backed by military force, and Italy must support, within the European Community, the "line of determination," making available "its prestige and its military bases" to this end. The only voice against armed intervention was that of Communist Renewal member Ersilia Salvato, who stated that her party was definitely against the use of force in former Yugoslavia.
