FR940119-2-00044 FR940119-2-00028 [OPPTS&hyph;400084; FRL&hyph;4757&hyph;1] Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know; Notice of Public Meeting AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of public meeting. SUMMARY: EPA will hold a one half day public meeting to discuss the options the Agency is considering for developing an exemption to the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA), section 313 reporting requirements for chemical reports of small release amounts. In connection with this meeting, the Agency has prepared an issues paper that will be available at no charge through the address or telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. DATES: The meeting will take place on Wednesday, February 16, 1994, at 9 a.m. and adjourn by 12 noon. ADDRESSES: The meeting will be held at the: Environmental Protection Agency, Auditorium, Education Center, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Samuel K. Sasnett, Chief, Toxic Release Inventory Branch, Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Information Hotline, Environmental Protection Agency, Mail Stop 5101, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, Toll Free: 1&hyph;800&hyph;535&hyph;0202, Washington, DC and Alaska (703) 920&hyph;9877, Attention: Docket No. 400084. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In 1986, Congress enacted the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA). Section 313 of EPCRA requires certain businesses to submit reports each year on the amounts of toxic chemicals their facilities release into the environment. The purpose of this requirement is to inform the public and government officials about releases of specified toxic chemicals. The current reporting requirements apply to facilities in the manufacturing sector (Standard Industrial Classification codes 20-39), that have 10 or more full-time employees, and that manufacture, process, or otherwise use 1 or more chemicals on the section 313 list of toxic chemicals above certain thresholds. In conjunction with expansion of the TRI reporting requirements, the Agency has been considering whether other adjustments are needed in the scope of the TRI program. EPA received petitions from the Small Business Administration and the American Feed Industry Association seeking an exemption for ``small sources'' (i.e., those facilities that file TRI forms with zero or small release estimates). EPA previously put those petitions out for public comment and, on review, believes there is substantial merit to the general concerns raised in the petitions. EPA is examining four options for establishing a small release exemption from the TRI reporting obligation: Cut-offs at zero, 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds, and 5,000 pounds. EPA has developed a paper that presents findings from analyses conducted on several low-release level options. This paper describes background information in greater detail and issues related to exemption options being considered. Copies of this paper will be available on or before Monday, January 31, 1994, from the address or telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. Oral statements will be scheduled on a first come first serve basis by calling the telephone number listed under FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT. All statements will be made part of the public record and will be considered in the development of any proposed rule amendment. Dated: January 12, 1994. Mark A. Greenwood, Director, Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1236 Filed 1&hyph;18&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
