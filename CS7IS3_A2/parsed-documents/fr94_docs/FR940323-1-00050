FR940323-1-00050 FR940323-1-00006 DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR Fish and Wildlife Service 50 CFR Part 17 RIN 1018&hyph;AC13 Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Proposal to List the San Xavier Talussnail as Endangered AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to list the San Xavier talussnail ( Sonorella eremita ) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The San Xavier talussnail is found only in an area of 15 by 30 meters (m) (50 by 100 feet (ft)) on private land in Pima County, Arizona. The primary threat to the species results from its vulnerability to habitat disturbances that would remove talus, increase interstitial soil, or alter moisture accumulation and retention. This proposal, if made final, would implement Federal protection provided by the Act for the San Xavier talussnail. The Service seeks data and comments from the public on this proposal. DATES: Comments from all interested parties must be received by May 23, 1994. Public hearing requests must be received by May 9, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments and materials concerning this proposal should be sent to the Field Supervisor, Arizona Ecological Services Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 3616 West Thomas Road, Suite 6, Phoenix, Arizona 85019. Comments and materials received will be available for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Debra T. Bills, at the above address (602/379&hyph;4720). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The San Xavier talussnail ( Sonorella eremita ) is a land snail, first described in 1910 by H.A. Pilsbry and L.E. Daniels (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915). The species has a globose shell with as many as 4.5 whorls, a white to pinkish tint, and a chestnut-brown shoulder band. It is approximately 19 millimeters (0.7 inches) in diameter. This is the only land snail fitting this description in the Mineral Hills area, but its shell is very typical of desert Sonorella (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915). The San Xavier talussnail lives in a deep, northwestward-facing, limestone rockslide in Pima County, Arizona. Its habitat is protected from drying effects of the sun by outcrops of limestone and decomposed granite to the northeast and southwest, and by the hill itself to the southeast (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1915, Hoffman 1990). The vegetation, slope of the hillside, and depth of the slide provide necessary moisture conditions. This talussnail is similar to other Sonorella species in that it feeds on fungus or decaying plant material (Hoffman 1990). The San Xavier talussnail is hermaphroditic (Morton 1968, Hoffman 1990). After a rain, the snail will lay eggs, feed, and mate. Fertilization and production of eggs takes several days. If the rains are short-lived, the eggs are held until the next rain. The species requires three or four years to mature, depending on rainfall frequency, and has a reproductive life of four to six years, depending on the total number of days it remains active (Hoffman 1990).
