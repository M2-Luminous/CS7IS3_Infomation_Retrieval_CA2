FR940128-1-00006 FR940128-1-00003 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MN&hyph;14&hyph;1; FRL&hyph;4830&hyph;2] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Minnesota AGENCY: United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: In this action, the USEPA is proposing to disapprove the revision to Minnesota's State Implementation Plan (SIP) for sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of Air Quality Control Region 131. Assuming no other substantive, adverse public comments are received, the USEPA will proceed with a final approval of the submittal when the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) addresses the concerns detailed in this notice and submits the Administrative Orders to USEPA before the end of the 30-day comment period. The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act. The revisions are the result of a call for SIP revision issued by USEPA on December 5, 1984, based on monitored violations. The revisions in the Minnesota submittal are in the form of non-expiring Findings and Orders for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver Hills Generating Facility. DATES: Comments on this requested revision and on the proposed USEPA action must be received by February 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be addressed to: William L. MacDowell, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Air Enforcement Branch (AE&hyph;17J), United States Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Air and Radiation Division, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Randy Robinson, Air Enforcement Branch, Regulation Development Section (AE&hyph;17J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;6713. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background USEPA published the designation of Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) 131 as a primary nonattainment area for SO 2 on March 3, 1978, and October 5, 1978. In response to Part D requirements of the Clean Air Act, Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) submitted a final SO 2 plan on August 4, 1980. USEPA published its final rule approving and promulgating the Minnesota Part D SIP for SO 2 for AQCR 131 on April 8, 1981 (46 FR 20996). On December 5, 1984 (49 FR 47488), USEPA issued a call for SIP revisions for the Minnesota SO 2 SIP for Dakota County declaring the SIP inadequate based on 1982 monitored violations. The SIP call required that the MPCA submit a revision to the Twin Cities SO 2 SIP demonstrating attainment of the SO 2 National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) in the Pine Bend Area by September 1985. The promulgation of a Good Engineering Practice stack height rule, along with difficulties negotiating a control strategy with Koch Refining Company, and the selection of an appropriate computer model, delayed the submittal. On September 10, 1987, the MPCA submitted revisions to the operating permits for five sources and requested redesignation to attainment for all of AQCR 131 except the Pine Bend and St. Paul Park areas. As a result of numerous USEPA comments, MPCA withdrew the Pine Bend SO 2 SIP while passage of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments delayed action on the rest of the SO 2 revisions for AQCR 131. On August 3, 1992, USEPA received from MPCA a revision to the SO 2 plan for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131. The submittal consisted of administrative materials demonstrating that the State had adopted the revision as required and that a public hearing was held. The submittal also contained administrative orders and technical support for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Plant, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Corporation, and Northern States Power-Inver Hills Generating Facility. The rest of AQCR 131, including the St. Paul Park Area, are being addressed in separate rulemakings. On February 16, 1993, USEPA received an amendment to the original administrative order for Koch Refining Company. The amendment revises the completion dates for construction and operation of a new stack and control equipment. II. Analysis of State Submittal This section will provide a review of: (1) The attainment demonstration modeling methodology for the sources in the area; (2) Specific aspects of the administrative orders (AOs); and (3) Whether the submittal meets the requirements of section 172 of the Clean Air Act. Modeling Methodology The short-term dispersion modeling was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Short-term (ISCST version 90346) model. Dispersion modeling for annual impacts was performed using the Industrial Source Complex Long-Term (ISCLT version 90008) model. All modeling was conducted in accordance with applicable guidance in the ``Guideline on Air Quality Models (Revised) (1986),'' and ``Supplement A (1987).'' The dispersion modeling reflects USEPA Good Engineering Practice stack height regulations where applicable. The modeling also incorporated urban dispersion coefficients using 1973&hyph;1977 Minneapolis/St. Paul hourly surface meteorological data and St. Cloud mixing height data. These years were used to maintain consistency with the original SO 2 SIP. Although there is no reason to believe the 1973&hyph;1977 meteorological data is not representative of current meteorological conditions in the Dakota County area, it is suggested that future SIP revision modeling incorporate the five most recent years of available meteorological data, as is stated in the guidance. Combined SO 2 impacts resulting from modeling Koch Refinery, Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen Resource Corporation, and Northern States Power, were calculated at 549 receptors, with model resolution ranging from 1,000 meters near grid boundaries to 100 meters near hotspot locations. Screening modeling was used initially to identify all events with the potential for an exceedance of the Ambient Air Quality Standards. These critical events were further processed using refined modeling techniques to determine if the NAAQS for SO 2 were protected. Several operating scenarios were modeled. The highest, second-highest predicted concentrations for the 3-hour and 24-hour averaging times, including background, were 965.1 and 361.6 μg/m 3 , respectively. Annual average impacts were predicted by using a refined modeling approach. The maximum annual predicted concentration, including background, was 69.1 μg/m 3 . Additional short-term modeling investigated interstate impacts at distances between 10 and 50 km from an MPCA monitor site. The Wisconsin border is approximately 25 km to the east of the Koch Refinery facility. Modeling was performed using worst-case emission parameters. The modeling results demonstrated that Dakota County SO 2 emissions do not prevent attainment or maintenance of the NAAQS in any other State. General Statutory Requirements The purpose of this section is to discuss whether the submittal meets the statutory requirements set forth in the Clean Air Act. The Pine Bend area of Dakota County, Minnesota is designated nonattainment for the primary NAAQS for SO 2 . As a result, SO 2 nonattainment area plans must meet the requirements of subpart 1 of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly section 172(c). Section 172(c)(1) states that part D plans must require reasonably available control measures (RACM), (e.g., RACT). The definition of RACT for SO 2 is that control technology which is necessary to achieve the NAAQS. The Minnesota submittal includes modeling which, if comments are adequately addressed, demonstrates that the Pine Bend area of Dakota County will achieve attainment of the SO 2 NAAQS with the control measures fully implemented by April 1, 1993. This satisfies the RACM requirements of the Clean Air Act. Section 172(c)(2) states that plans shall require reasonable further progress. The term ``reasonable further progress'' is defined in section 171(B)(1) as ``such annual incremental reductions in emission of the relevant air pollutant as are required by this part or may reasonably be required by the Administrator for the purpose of ensuring attainment of the applicable NAAQS by the applicable data.'' The Minnesota submittal provides for attainment of the NAAQS by April 1, 1993. Section 172(c)(3) requires a suitable emission inventory. A suitable inventory of SO 2 emissions in the Pine Bend nonattainment area was provided in Appendix D of the submittal. Section 172(c)(4) mandates that any stationary source growth margin included in the submittal be expressly identified and quantified. The submittal provides for a zero growth margin. Section 172(c)(5) mandates a suitable permit program for new and modified major stationary sources. A new source permitting program for nonattainment areas has been submitted to USEPA by MPCA and is currently undergoing review. It will be addressed in a separate rulemaking. The Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program is delegated to Minnesota and a general permitting rule has been SIP approved. Section 172(c)(6) requires enforceable limitations sufficient to provide for attainment. Some enforceability concerns associated with the submittal are detailed in the next section. If these concerns are adequately addressed, the limitations will be sufficient to provide for attainment. Section 172(c)(7) mandates satisfaction of section 110(a)(2). A primary requirement of section 110(a)(2) is that the State adopt its limitations following a suitable opportunity for public comment. The MPCA certifies that a public hearing was held on May 27, 1992. Section 172(c)(8) states that the Administrator, in some circumstances, may allow the use of equivalent modeling emission inventory and planning procedures. In the Dakota County submittal, no ``equivalent techniques'' were used for modeling, emission inventory, and planning procedures. Section 172(c)(9) requires the plan to provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the primary NAAQS by the attainment date applicable under this part (i.e. contingency measures). In the event of nonattainment of the SO 2 NAAQS, the MPCA has the authority to enforce all provisions of the AOs, as well as all applicable State and Federal rules and regulations. Administrative Order Details The purpose of this section is to provide details on the individual AOs and state any comments that apply. These comments, provided by Region 5, must be adequately addressed before final approval of the SIP revision for Dakota County can be published. Continental Nitrogen and Resources Corporation (CNRC) The Rosemount CNRC facility has three boilers which discharge SO 2 emissions into the atmosphere. The Company is required to limit emissions of SO 2 from each of the 3 emission points to 1.5 pounds of SO 2 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). In addition, the three boilers may not operate at a heat input greater than that listed in Exhibit 1 of the AO. The Company is authorized to burn only natural gas and #6 fuel oil in the three boilers. The Company may not burn #6 fuel oil with greater than 1.5 percent sulfur by weight. Other restrictions include a limit of no more than 16,000 gallons of #6 fuel oil per 24-hour period (midnight to midnight), no more than 70,833 gallons of #6 fuel oil per month on a monthly, 12-month rolling average, and the Company cannot burn #6 fuel oil at more than two of the boilers at any one time. Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through sampling and analyzing the #6 fuel oil for sulfur content and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods. Also the Company shall measure the total gallons of #6 fuel oil burned at each emission unit. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination of compliance with the order. Region 5 Comments: The emission limits in the administrative order are written as pounds of SO 2 per million British Thermal Units (lbs/mmBTU). None of the limits have an averaging time associated with them. This leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case, the administrative order should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to the emission limits. The administrative order, Part V.B.2.b.1 & 2, states, in part, that the Company must retain records containing information on sulfur content and heating value. The administrative order must include a formula to relate this information to the emission limit in order to determine compliance. Northern States Power There are six distillate and residual oil fired gas turbines at the Northern States Power (NSP) facility which discharge sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. The Company is limited to 1.1 lbs of SO 2 /mmBTU from each of the 6 emission units. Also, the Company may not operate the 6 gas turbines at greater than the rated heat input described in Exhibit 1 of the AO. The Company is authorized to burn only distillate and residual fuel oil in each of the gas turbines, and the fuel oil sulfur content may not exceed 1.0 percent by weight. In addition, the Company may not burn more than 8.75 million gallons of fuel oil per month on a 12-month rolling average. Compliance with the limitations shall be demonstrated through either sampling and analyzing the fuel for sulfur content and heating value in accordance with approved ASTM methods, or obtaining and retaining a fuel supplier certification. Also, the Company is to measure the total gallons of fuel oil burned at each emission unit both on a 3-hour basis, and a monthly, 12-month rolling average basis. The Company is required to keep appropriate records to allow for determination of compliance with the order. Region 5 Comments: The emission limits in the administrative order are written as lbs/mmBTU. None of the limits have an averaging time associated with them. This leads to the assumption that the limits exist on an instantaneous basis. If this is the case, the administrative order should state as such. Otherwise, other appropriate averaging times should be applied to the emission limits. The Company is required to keep records on percent sulfur of the fuel, and heating value of the fuel. The administrative order, Part IV.B.2.a., does not specify a formula which would convert this data to a lbs/mmBTU basis. This is necessary since the emission limits are in lbs/mmBTU units. A formula is also required in the Annual Reports section of the administrative order (Part V.B.). Part of the demonstration of compliance with emission and operating limits involves obtaining and maintaining a fuel supplier certification. The administrative order, Part I.D.1.a.4., states that the certification must include the method used to determine the sulfur content of the fuel oil. It must be made clear that the method used must be an approved ASTM method as listed in 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, method 19, §5.2.2. Koch Refining Company The AO for Koch Refining includes a compliance schedule for required modifications at various locations around the facility. Each modification activity is accompanied by completion dates. All of the activities had been completed at the time the submittal was sent to USEPA. The emission limits for the Refinery are listed in the AO and cover the Sulfur Reduction Unit (SRU) 1/2 facility, the Sulfur Reduction Unit 3 and 4 facility, the Sulfur Reduction Unit 5 facility, the FCC facility emission points 5, 6, and 8, the Oil Separation and Waste Treatment Plant (OSWTP), the Platformer facility, and the Powerformer facility. The table lists emission limitations for each applicable SO 2 standard averaging time, 3-hour, 24-hour, and annual. The 3-hour average is based on three consecutive one-hour periods, the 24-hour is based on 24 consecutive one-hour periods, and the annual is based on a 12-month rolling average. The emission limits for the Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit (KSAU) facility are listed in Table 3 of the AO and cover Absorber emission points numbers 1 and 3. However, emission point 1 becomes inoperational when emission point 3 begins operation. Again, the applicable averaging times are based the same as for the Refinery limits mentioned above. Koch Refinery may burn refinery fuel oil, from the refinery fuel oil distribution system, only at select locations. The fuel oil limits on quantity and sulfur content are specified in Table 2 and Table 2a of the AO. The Refinery may burn refinery fuel gas at specified locations. The Company may not put fuel gas into the refinery fuel gas distribution system which contains greater that 0.10 grains of hydrogen sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas. The diesel fuel used shall not have a sulfur content greater than 0.1 percent by weight. Fuel restrictions at the KSAU facility limit the Boiler to burning only refinery fuel gas, propane, or commercial natural gas. The hydrogen sulfide content of refinery fuel gas burned at KSAU cannot exceed 0.10 grains of hydrogen sulfide per dry standard cubic foot of gas. Compliance with the various limitations and restrictions applied to Koch Refinery are detailed in the AO. The compliance demonstration include calculations, monitoring, record keeping, diesel fuel certification, and stack tests. Compliance with the emission limits at KSAU also consist of calculations, monitoring, and data and record keeping. Region 5 Comments: Flares nos. 5, 6, and 7 may only use gases from Refinery operations when the gases are from pressure relief, from upsets of Refinery process equipment, or are required for equipment maintenance (Part II.B.6.C.). At all other times the flares must burn natural gas. Information must be provided to justify not limiting these sources and not including them in the modeling. Compliance for emission points 348, 458, and 459, is to be based on initial stack tests as specified in Table 1, note #4. Some method needs to be specified for determining future compliance. The administrative order states in Part V.C.2. that the company shall conduct performance stack tests to determine compliance with the emission limitations and fuel restrictions outlined in the order as required by the Commissioner. Stack tests must also be able to be required by appropriate USEPA personnel. Exhibit 2&hyph;page 3 discusses the startup incinerators for SRU 3 and SRU 4. These startup incinerators operate when tail gas bypasses the Shell Claus Offgas Treatment (SCOT) Units and SCOT Unit incinerators. Information must be provided to justify not limiting or modeling these emission sources. On page 9 of Exhibit 2, emission point 17 is listed as an active emission source. However, in Exhibit 2, Attachment 6 emission point 17 has a rated input of 0.0 mmBTU/hr. Also, emission point 17 was not included in the modeling demonstration. If #17 is shutdown, it must be removed from reference in the administrative order. On page 8 of Exhibit 5, the Company is required to measure the amount of hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas by analysis once per calendar quarter. The limit on hydrogen sulfide in sour water tank purge gas is 162 parts per million as a 3-hour average. We would request than analysis be conducted with increased frequency (e.g., daily). III. Proposed Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment The USEPA is proposing disapproval of the Minnesota SIP revision for SO 2 for the Dakota County/Pine Bend area of AQCR 131, contained in the Administrative Orders for Koch Refining Company and Koch Sulfuric Acid Unit, Continental Nitrogen and Resources Company, and Northern States Power Company&hyph;Inver Hills Generating Facility. However, if the above comments, detailed in this notice, are adequately addressed in revisions to this plan, and those revisions are submitted to USEPA by the end of the 30-day comment period, then, assuming no other substantive, adverse public comments are received, USEPA will proceed with a final rulemaking approving the SIP revision as a whole including the supplemental submittal. If at the end of the 30-day comment period, the issues are still unresolved, final rulemaking disapproving the SIP revision will be promulgated. Public comments are solicited on the requested SIP revision and on USEPA's proposal to disapprove. Public comments received by February 28, 1994, will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. USEPA shall consider each request for revision to the SIP in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989, (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years. USEPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the temporary waiver until such time as it rules on USEPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq. , USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. The USEPA's disapproval of the State request under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Clean Air Act does not affect any existing requirements applicable to small entities. Any pre-existing Federal requirements remain in place after this disapproval. Federal disapproval of the State submittal does not affect its state-enforceability. Moreover, USEPA's disapproval of the submittal does not impose any new Federal requirements. Therefore, USEPA certifies that this disapproval action does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it does not remove existing requirements nor does it impose any new Federal requirements.
