Li Ruihuan delivered an important speech during the meeting. First of all, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, he paid high tribute to the model workers at the meeting, and extended season's greetings to workers, peasants, intellectuals, and the working masses of all nationalities on all fronts across the country! Li Ruihuan said: Marxism's maintaining labor is of the utmost importance. Labor creates the world, social wealth, and a happy life, and promotes the progress of the civilization of mankind. Fundamentally speaking, all advanced systems and policies are formulated for the purpose of encouraging and protecting people's honest, vigorous, and creative labor. Model workers are outstanding representatives of laborers. The model workers' advanced thinking and splendid deeds carry forward the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation, make clear to all the course for the era to forge ahead on, should be commended by the party and government and respected by all walks of life, and should become examples for all the people across the country to learn. Li Ruihuan pointed out: China's reform, opening up, and modernization have entered a new phase. "Seizing the opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" constitute the overall situation of our work in the country. The destiny of China's working class has always been closely interrelated to that of the party and state. The party and government believe the broad masses of staff and workers will conscientiously subordinate themselves to and serve [the needs of] this overall situation, properly do their duties in a down-to-earth manner, and give full play to their role as the main force. He said: No doubt, reform can benefit the overwhelming majority of people, but it cannot benefit all the people at the same time or to the same extent. At present, the improvement of the living standards of some staff and workers and some of the masses has been achieved at a slow pace and they have even encountered some temporary difficulties due to various reasons. Naturally, the party and government should be concerned with them. As a mass organization of the working class and as a bridge and link between the party and staff, workers, and the masses, trade unions should treat representing and protecting the interests of staff, workers, and the masses and helping them solve problems encountered in their livelihood as their basic responsibilities. Trade unions at all levels must carry forward their fine traditions, frequently go deep into the realities of life, maintain close links with the masses, pay more visits to localities that encounter difficulties to appreciate their situation, and call on more comrades who hold different opinion to have a heart-to-heart talk with them and to offer them services; they must enthusiastically and attentively listen to the voice of the masses, understand their wishes, and report problems accurately to the party and government departments in good time; they must do solid work with all their heart and all their might, continue to successfully carry out the project of sending warmth to the masses, and help them solve difficulties; and they must painstakingly do a good job of conducting ideological work with patience, eliminate contradictions, boost the morale of the masses, and win their understanding and support. Finally, Li Ruihuan said: Our great motherland has an immeasurably bright future and we are full of confidence in our future. Let us unite, work hard, surmount difficulties, and continuously promote the great undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core. Among the leading comrades participating in the meeting were Li Lanqing, Wei Jianxing, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Lei Jieqiong, Cheng Siyuan, Buhe, Peng Peiyun, Luo Gan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Wan Guoquan.
