As a result, overseas assets by the 22 Arab League members have far surpassed their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at a time when they badly need funds to finance reforms, said Usamah al-Faqih, chairman of the Arab Monetary Fund (AMF). By the end of 1992, Arab investments abroad, mainly in Japan and the West, exceeded 650 billion dollars while the combined Arab GDP stood at a round 450 billion dollars, he told a conference on Arab economic reforms here. "Despite economic achievements made in some Arab countries due to the reform programmes and efforts being exerted in others, our stock markets still need a comprehensive structural development," he said. "There is a general weakness in the legislative and organisational structures in the markets as well as the absence of secondary exchanges, market-makers and qualified personnel in the financial, auditing and legal functions associated with the stock markets." Only 10 of the Arab states have official exchanges but activity in such markets have remained relatively small due to political instability in some members and lack of incentives and information about trading institutions. In the oil-rich Gulf, turnover in most of the stock markets is among the lowest in the region due to high government ownership, a tendency for long-term investment and restriction of dealing to nationals. Egypt, Jordan, Algeria, Morocco and other Arab nations have embarked on reforms to heal their economic problems, mainly large foreign debt, slow growth, low investment, unemployment and deficits in their budgets and balance of payments. The four countries owe more than 70 percent of the total Arab debt of over 150 billion dollars. The problems have persisted though Arab states have received more than 370 billion dollars in loans and other forms of cash over the past two decades. Experts blamed instability, mismanagment of funds and state control. Al-Faqih, a Saudi, said his Abu Dhabi-based Fund was setting up a data base to link Arab stock markets, where around 1,100 banks and companies trade their shares, with a market capitalisation of 35 billion dollars in 1992. He said the base, which would provide information on trading institutions in all member states, would start operation this year. He urged Arabs to step up reforms and those without stock markets to open floors. "Despite reforms by some members, chronic deficits in the internal and external balances remain an obstacle for growth, and even stability, in Arab economies, with the latest figures showing the deficit in Arab budgets reaching around 15 percent of the GDP," he said. "This underscores the need for redressing financial policies and developing stock markets in the Arab world in order to create a framework capable of attracting national and foreign investment and stimulating the private sector to play a greater role in economic and social development." United Arab Emirates (UAE) minister of state for financial and industrial Affairs Ahmad al-Tayir, who opened the two-day conference, said financial policies in the region needed to be improved to ensure the success of reforms and cushion foreign influences on the domestic economy. "Arab states, including those in the Gulf, should give financial instruments a greater role in economic growth and in reducing the impact of foreign factors like the decline in demand for their exports," he said. "This could not be done without upgrading their stock markets."
