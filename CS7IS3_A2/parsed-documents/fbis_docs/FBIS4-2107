Yang Shuaibang, deputy director of the provincial construction department, said the construction companies in the province have signed 562 contracts involving 730 million U.S. dollars with foreign construction firms from 1988 to 1993. This was 5.1 times the total value contracted in the previous seven years. Last year, the contracted investment registered a record high of 150 million U.S. dollars. The province's cooperation with foreign counterparts has been strengthened, when builders in the province have so far set up ties with 41 countries and regions and the number of joint ventures have seen an increase from 32 to 84 since 1992, Yang said. The local construction enterprises have also launched 45 branches abroad. Some of them have branched out into other fields, including food, real estate and building materials. Meanwhile, the province has seen good results in boosting exports in this field. The export volume just to Russia in recent years has amounted to 15 million U.S. dollars. As their capabilities have grown, these enterprises have won contracts to build entire projects for foreign employers. In Malaysia, they have won bids for eight projects which were worth 120 million U.S. dollars. The industry in the province began to explore overseas market since the early 1980s, focusing on labour exports at that time.
