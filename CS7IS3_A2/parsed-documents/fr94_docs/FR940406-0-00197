Geographic Coverage a. FMRs for the Section 8 Rental Certificate program (Schedule B) are established for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), Primary Metropolitan Statistical Areas (PMSAs), other HUD-designated metropolitan FMR areas. FMRs also are established for nonmetropolitan counties and county equivalents in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Pacific Islands and for nonmetropolitan parts of counties in the New England states. b. FMRs for the areas in Virginia shown in the table below are established by combining the 1990 Census data for the nonmetropolitan counties with the data for the independent cities that are located within the county borders. Because of space limitations, the FMR listing in Schedule B includes only the name of the nonmetropolitan County. The full definitions of these areas including the independent cities are as follows: Virginia Nonmetropolitan County FMR Area Allegheny Augusta Carroll Frederick Greensville Halifax Henry Montgomery Rockbridge Rockingham Southhampton Wise Virginia Independent Cities Included with County Clifton Forge and Covington Staunton and Waynesboro Galax Winchester Emporia South Boston Martinsville Radford Buena Vista and Lexington Harrisonburg Franklin Norton c. FMRs for Manufactured Home spaces in the Section 8 Certificate program (Schedule D) are established for MSAs, PMSAs, HUD-designated metropolitan counties, and for selected nonmetropolitan counties and the residual nonmetropolitan part of each State. 2. Arrangement of FMR Areas and Identification of Constituent Parts a. The FMR areas in Schedules B and D are listed alphabetically by metropolitan FMR area and by nonmetropolitan county within each State. b. The constituent counties (and New England towns and cities) included in each metropolitan FMR area are listed immediately following the listings of the FMR dollar amounts. All constituent parts of a metropolitan FMR area that are in more than one State can be identified by consulting the listings for each applicable State. c. Two nonmetropolitan counties are listed alphabetically on each line of the nonmetropolitan county listings. d. The New England towns and cities included in a nonmetropolitan part of a county are listed immediately following the county name. e. The FMRs are listed by dollar amount on the first line beginning with the FMR area name.
