The Laboratory for Technical Optics in Iserlohn, Mark Brandenburg, (Professor Doctor Burkhard Neumann, Frauenstuhlweg 31, 58644 Iserlohn) now hopes to utilize these techniques in interferometers and pulse oxymeters. To this end, the researchers have developed an economical laser interferometer, whose laser light source and electronic components, which take up a relatively large amount of space, can be placed a considerable distance away from the miniaturized interferometer measuring head. Owing to the sensor's small dimensions, position systems, like the cross-table syste, can now be retrofitted with this interferometer without difficulty. This has been made possible through the use of a polarization-holding monomode faser, in which the light source is directed without disturbance to the measuring head, which is a few centimeters in size. In addition, a pulse oxymeter for the determination of blood oxygen content has been developed in cooperation with the Mark Brandenburg Company for Medical Developments mbH in Luedenscheid. By employing a faser sensor, this instrument can now also be used with nuclear spin tomographs. The light is detected and evaluated in the patient's illuminated finger. The photograph [see original] shows the measuring head set on a control path.
