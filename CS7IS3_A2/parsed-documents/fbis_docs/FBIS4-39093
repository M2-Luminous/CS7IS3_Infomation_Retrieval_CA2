This was stated at a news conference in Dushanbe today by Lieutenant General Anatoliy Chechulin, commander of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan, in connection with the killing of seven Russians, including five senior officers, two of whom were border guards. All these were committed in a short period between 31 May and 4 June. Mecheslav Senkevich, Russian ambassador to Tajikistan, and Major General Afanasiy Kim, military procurator of the Russian border troops, who also took part in the news conference, said that the question of adopting measures to protect Russians was raised today at an emergency session of the Tajikistan Government. In the view of General Chechulin, the killings of the Russians mark "the start of the implementation of directions issued by leaders of the extremist wing of the armed opposition, including Sayed Abdullo Nuri, leader of the so-called government-in-exile, who have recently called for acts of terrorism against Russian servicemen." Their aim, the commander stressed, is to destabilize the situation in Tajikistan, to wreck the second round of inter- Tajik talks, and also to provoke negative public opinion regarding the desirability of a Russian military contingent in Tajikistan. Major General Gennadiy Blinov, first deputy interior minister of Tajikistan, acknowledged that the acts of terrorism against Russian servicemen and ethnic Russian officers serving in Tajikistan's national armed forces were planned. The search for the criminals is being carried out in close contact with the Russian military procuracy, he said. ITAR-TASS has learned that three individuals suspected of killing Russian officers have already been detained. Having stated that the Russian leadership "does not intend to tolerate any more blows from behind and is adopting the most decisive measures to ensure the armed protection of its servicemen," General Chechulin called on Tajikistan's bodies of law enforcement to take all measures to catch the criminals and to carry out a strict and objective investigation. Russian servicemen will do everything to "protect themselves from the threat of banditry from whatever source, using their professionalism and the force of their weapons," the commander of the Russian border troops in Tajikistan stressed.
