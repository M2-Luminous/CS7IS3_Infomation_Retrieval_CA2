According to reliable information, it seems that the war option chosen by Alija Izetbegovic has no support among the Muslim population in that part of Bosnia-Herzegovina. We have learned from reliable sources that the Center of Security Services has done an analysis of the political and military situation in the area, concluding that the process of making Tesanj independent following the model of west Bosnia and Velika Kladusa is under way. The analysis, made by Semsudin Mehmedovic, coordinator of the Center of Security Services, has warned the authorities in Sarajevo that the appearance of "a new Fikret Abdic" was possible in the Tesanj area. Semsudin Mehmedovic and his Security Service, naturally, blame the Croats for this process. However, things are much simpler. Namely, the War Presidency of the Municipal Assembly of Tesanj refused to carry out the order of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency concerning the unconditional placing of all HVO [Croatian Defense Council] units active in the areas controlled by Muslim political and military forces under the command of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. The War Presidency of the Tesanj commune issued the following statement: "On the territory of Usora and Tesanj the Croats and Muslims have fought against the same enemy since the beginning of the war. The result of this fighting is fully defended territory. So far there have been no conflicts between our two peoples. The Presidency believes that these relations should remain the same in the future, since that is the only guarantee and token for the survival of both peoples in this area.... The civilian and military bodies, as well as members of both peoples consider the implementation of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency pointless. Any attempt to implement this decision by force would result in conflict with incalculable consequences for the population, and probably in the loss of the free territory, which has been defended at the cost of a great number of lives. With all due respect for the importance and possible consequences of the decision of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, the War Presidency of the Tesanj commune has decided not to implement the decision on this territory..." Therefore, the matter simply concerns the fact that the political leadership of the Tesanj commune believes that the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army troops should continue to work together, but that an integration of the HVO in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would be politically and militarily inopportune. In the analysis made by the Center of Security Services and signed by Semsudin Mehmedovic, this decision of the War Presidency is being interpreted as a subversive activity -- carried out primarily by the Croats, but also by some military and political structures of the so-called Serb republic. Mehmedovic does not substantiate such statements in the analysis, but instead merely provides a catalogue of accusations. Ekrem Ajanovic, regional representative in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly, also joined the action of disrupting the unity of the Muslims and Croats in the Tesanj area and the surrounding territory. On the basis of the alleged approval of Alija Izetbegovic, he formed a committee for negotiations between the Muslims, Croats, and Serbs, but this committee submitted to the Center of Security Services a list of Croats to be arrested, and if this was not possible, killed. They were HVO representatives who, from October to December, participated in political negotiations between Muslims, Croats, and Serbs in this area. The result of all this is the absurd situation in which the Tesanj area is being defended by joint forces of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, while they are continuously being attacked by Bosnia-Herzegovina Army units that want to implement Alija Izetbegovic's fundamentalist policies. All efforts to create disunity between the Muslims and Croats living in the Tesanj area have, fortunately, been unsuccessful. Evidently there is an increasing number of Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina who realize how damaging Alija Izetbegovic's policies are, and who want to do everything to end the war as soon as possible, along with the Croats, and continue to live in peace and understanding.
