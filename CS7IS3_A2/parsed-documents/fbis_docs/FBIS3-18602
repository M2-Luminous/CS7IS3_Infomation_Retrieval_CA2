Andreatta stressed that "there has been no official request from the United Nations for Italian participation in Bosnia" but he confirmed that talks on the subject are going ahead at the United Nations in the wake of promptings from Britain. Answering a question on possible Serbian reaction to an Italian presence, Andreatta said that "the opposition of the Serbs referred to Turkey, not to Italy." "The problem is rather whether troops should be used under the auspices of NATO or that of the United Nations, since one choice or the other requires a different type of commitment." Andreatta was speaking after a brief visit to the large Italian community in Koper, the capital of Slovenian Istria, during which he inaugurated a historic palazzo restored with Italian funds. Noting in his speech that ethnic minorities help sharpen "critical acumen and a relish for contradiction," Andreatta expressed the view that "our generation is only passing through, but it has the job of reducing borders to an archaeological status." Andreatta's visit was keenly awaited by the Italian minority in Istria -- also in the Croatian part, which he will visit this evening (Verteneglio) -- who are hoping for a new constitutional settlement from Croatia and Slovenia in the wake of Yugoslavia's break-up.
