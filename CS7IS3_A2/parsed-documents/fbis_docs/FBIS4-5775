Takashi Mukaibo, chairman of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum, urged participants to discuss the elimination of nuclear weapons and the peaceful uses of atomic energy as the 50th anniversary of A-bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki is approaching. About 1,500 atomic power specialists from Japan and abroad are taking part in the 27th annual conference. Around the conference hall in central Hiroshima, about 30 antinuclear activists protested the meeting. Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), told the meeting that the IAEA will hold a special meeting on April 21 and 22 in Vienna to discuss the Chernobyl nuclear reactors in Ukraine. Chernobyl was the scene of one of the world's most serious nuclear accidents in 1986. Although the nuclear reactor involved in the accident has not been operational, two other reactors have since been in operation. The Ukrainian government decided to continue to operate the two reactors and has asked the IAEA to investigate safety. On Thursday, atomic power advocates are scheduled to meet with citizens of Hiroshima and victims of the 1945 atomic bombing, including the head of an association of Korean victims of the nuclear holocaust, Yi Sil-gun [name as received], for an exchange of opinions.
