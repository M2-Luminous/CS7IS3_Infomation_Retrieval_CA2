FR940812-0-00049 FR940812-0-00014 The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be minimal because these regulations will be in effect only for small segments of a two day period, specifically for 1.5 hours on Friday, August 12, 1994, and for one half hour on Saturday, August 13, 1994. The fact that the time periods for the safety zone are limited, as well as the advance notice that will be given to potentially affected entities concerning the events and proposed safety zones, allow the impacted vessel traffic to schedule transits and operations around the planned activities with minimal hardship. The entities most likely to be affected are large commercial ships and barges in or outbound from Fall River terminals, fishing vessels, and recreational vessels. Only a limited number of commercial vessel, approximately four or five, transit the impacted water per week. Because of their limited number and the advance notice given, these vessels will not be heavily impacted. Fishing and recreational vessels have shallow drafts such that they are able to transit the waters around the regulated areas. These vessels have alternate routes available outside the main shipping channel and outside the safety zones in which they may transit or conduct operations. Furthermore, in the case of the tall ships parade safety zone, vessels will be able to transit the area as soon as the moving zone passes. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). For the reasons outlined in the Regulatory Evaluation above, the Coast Guard expects the impact to be minimal on all entities. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.) Federalism The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this rule and has concluded that under Section 2.B.2.c. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, it is an action under the Coast Guard's statutory authority to protect public safety, and thus is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination will be made available in the docket.
