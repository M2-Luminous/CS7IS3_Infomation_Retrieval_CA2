Mr. Major was pressed by Labour Leader John Smith in the Commons over speculation that British troops may be pulled out at the end of the winter. Mr. Smith urged Mr. Major, who was reporting on the outcome of the NATO summit, to put an end to such suggestions. To some Tory jeers, Mr. Smith said: "Don't we need a commitment to increase ground forces as requested by the UN to make a greater effort to bring some peace to Bosnia?" But Mr. Major replied: "We have committed ourselves to assist with humanitarian aid. I have to say that is not a commitment I am at this stage prepared to extend until I am certain of the security of the British troops working for the UN there. Despite remarkable work they have done for humanitarian reasons, our first concern must be the security of UN troops and in particular those of our own country." Mr. Major hailed the summit as having reaffirmed America's commitment to Europe and shown the allies "standing closely together in maintaining their collective security." Insisting that the priority was to ensure there were no new dividing lines in Europe, he said the summit had launched a vital new initiative towards the East, opening the way for new relationships and new NATO members. "I believe that the summit has successfully equipped the alliance to meet new challenges." He said of the threat to use air strikes to relieve peacekeepers in Srebrenica and reopen Tuzla airport: "We would prefer not to have to use force. But those who are impeding UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] at Srebrenica and Tuzla must realise that force is available if necessary to support UNPROFOR and its ability to protect relief efforts." Mr. Smith said he broadly welcomed the summit declaration but asked if the threat of air strikes now was any different or stronger than the apparent commitment made last August, which had not resulted in any effective action. "Repeated declarations which are not followed through, risk undermining the credibility of both NATO and the whole UN operation and only strengthen the hands of those who have become adept at defying the wishes of the international community," he warned. Mr. Smith called for effective action in Tuzla and Srebrenica and to lift the siege of Sarajevo. He said it was "wholly intolerable that a defenceless population in Sarajevo should be shelled so relentlessly and pitilessly." Mr. Major said practical decisions on air strikes were best made not by politicians but by commanders near at hand. "It is predominantly on their advice that I think it would be right for NATO leaders to act. There are reservations expressed from troop commanders from time to time and I think we would be very unwise to sweep those to one side." Agreement in principle for military strikes was certainly there in these two specific cases, he said. But "casual edicts" should not be issued from afar. Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith (Conservative Wealden) asked for an assurance that contingency plans were in place to prevent British and other UN troops being "sucked in" to the conflict if air strikes were authorised. Mr. Major said he could not go into details, "but the security of our troops in such a circumstance would be given the very highest priority of all." Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr. Major had been warned many times that the "bottom-line credibility" of the UN operation in Bosnia was at risk and the opening of Tuzla airport was central to that credibility. "As President Clinton said, `If we cannot show the determination to deliver our promises, then don't make promises.'" Mr. Major retorted: "We have been very careful about the promises we could make -- unlike you, whose shifting and manoeuvring throughout this whole operation have included everything from all-out war to apparently pulling out immediately. Your opinions seem to have been moving on an escalator at rapid speed." Peter Viggers (Conservative Gosport) said the delivery of humanitarian aid depended on cooperation of Serb, Croat and Muslim control posts. He asked: "How can we be sure that this local cooperation will continue if we should have previously taken military action against one of the sides?" Mr. Major replied: "You point precisely to one of the primary factors that needs to be taken into account before determining whether any military action of any sort needs to be taken." He added: "It is very easy to say that it is an easy decision and that all you have to do is unleash an aircraft or two and all is well. I have to say to those who readily advocate that course, without careful thought, thought that it may well not be a wise policy. It may be a necessary policy at some stage -- but it is a policy that should be entered into with very considerable caution." Tory Patrick Cormack (Staffordshire South) said it was essential the Serbs understood NATO "meant business" so that the conflict did not grow. Mr. Major agreed but said the conflict was no longer a clear-cut case of one aggressor and one victim. The war was now a "horrible dispute in which each of the participants have committed actions which they should be thoroughly ashamed of." Labour's Bob Cryer (Bradford South) demanded: "What's the point of spending time and a great deal of money looking around for something for NATO to do, simply in order to keep the organisation in existence when it really has no function left?" To Tory protests, Mr. Cryer added: "NATO is redundant and we would be a lot better off without it." Mr. Major told him: "NATO has been the guardian of our security for over 40 years. It would be folly beyond belief not to make sure that NATO is securely in place for the next 40 years." Tory Cyril Townsend (Bexleyheath) urged Mr. Major to say that the "special relationship" with the United States remained cordial. Mr. Major stressed that he would have much to discuss with Mr. Clinton when they meet in Washington at the end of February. They would discuss Russia, free trade, GATT, the Middle East peace process, Lockerbie, sanctions on Iraq -- "all matters on which the UK and the U.S. are in complete agreement and upon which the two governments have worked together." He added: "The fact of the matter is the relationship between the UK and the U.S. is in very good repair."
