Talks to end the 25- year-old communist rebellion had ground to a halt because rebel leader Jose Maria [Joma] Sison insists on unacceptable terms for the talks, President Ramos told a visiting European Parliament delegation about the government's problems in talking to the fragmented communist movement. Joma Sison issued a statement from his exile base in Utrecht last weekend calling on Ramos to drop his insistence that any accord should not violate the Philippine Constitution. He also asked for a second round of preliminary discussions to be held in the Netherlands before peace talks open in Vietnam. President Ramos was informed yesterday by European parliamentarians that Utrecht-based communist leader Jose Maria Sison and his group no longer enjoy substantial support in Western Europe. The group told the president that Sison and his followers are now considered an isolated group, where before had received sympathy and support from some quarters. The visiting parliamentarians explained that the change in attitude towards Sison is on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist ideology, which now belongs to the past and has almost no future.
