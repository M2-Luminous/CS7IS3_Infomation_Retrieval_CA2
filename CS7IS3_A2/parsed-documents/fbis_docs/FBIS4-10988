Right now in Panama City we are hearing rumors that there has been an attack on Cuban President Fidel Castro. What is being said in Cuba at this very moment? [(Zardales)] We are surprised by this information. We have no knowledge of such an attack. We have not even heard that President Castro is sick, which is another rumor I hear is going around. The president of Cuba has not appeared in public in these past few days because there has been no need for it. No activity has been held in which he has had to participate. His brother has been seen in public at events to mark the anniversary of the Bay of Pigs victory. That is why rumors started that he was victim of an attack or a stroke. The truth is that we have no official or unofficial information on this. To be honest with you, we have not even heard street rumors about this. [Reporter] In other words, Mr. (Zardales), nothing is being said about this in Cuba. [(Zardales)] No, not really. I have just come in from the street. I was reporting from the city, and I have no information on this. Before receiving your call, I talked with comrades here at the radio station and no one has information on this. [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), what do you think prompted the international version on what might be happening to Fidel Castro? [(Zardales)] I think it is wishful thinking on the part of some people. Many people would like to see something happen to him. I believe these people are trying to create a bizarre perception of our country in advance of the upcoming emigre meeting in Havana. The meeting will be attended by Cubans who live in several countries -- in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and even Australia. [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you have said Fidel Castro has not been seen in public for the past few days. When was the last time he was seen in public? [(Zardales)] The truth is that I cannot remember. I cannot remember. I know it was a few days ago, however; there are no indications that he is sick. Similar rumors were spread in the past when he was not seen in public. I imagine he has a lot of work to do. I believe he is involved with the upcoming meeting in Havana, and this must be keeping him pretty busy. We are hoping it will be a successful meeting -- a meeting of rapprochement with the Cuban community living abroad. We are all Cubans and have the right to discuss the political and social future of our country. [Reporter] Mr. (Zardales), you are a reporter. Are there any rumors that Castro is sick? Has an official announcement been made about some kind of illness he may have, perhaps heart disease? [(Zardales)] All he is suffering from is having excellent health. If we are going to talk of illness, we can talk about old age. Old age is something natural for all of us. However, I do not think he is ill. He enjoys good health. We saw him recently. He is a man who keeps himself physically strong. He enjoys sports. He will jump into the water and take a swim at any time of the day, even in the early morning hours. He also plays basketball. He keeps himself physically strong. We honestly have not heard that he is ill. [Reporter] In conclusion Mr. (Zardales), has an official announcement been released regarding the international rumors that Castro is ill? Do you know of this? [(Zardales)] No, no, no. I have heard nothing of this. I am just arriving. I have not read today's news releases, but I have seen nothing about this. As I said earlier, I believe such rumors begin every time he is not seen in public for two or three days. I also believe that these rumors are being spread in light of the upcoming meeting with Cubans living abroad, or with representatives of the Cubans living abroad. [Reporter] Thank you, Mr. (Isidro Zardales), Radio Havana Cuba editor in chief.
