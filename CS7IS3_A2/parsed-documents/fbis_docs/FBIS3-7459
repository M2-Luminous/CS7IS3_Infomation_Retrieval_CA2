The iron-like will and tested leadership ability of our party have been more vigorously demonstrated in stern struggles recently. The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has taught: Recently, we have vigorously proven once again in the stern trials and struggles that our party is the great party with an iron-like will and tested leadership ability, that our people are the heroic people with a firm revolutionary faith and indomitable struggling spirit, and that socialism of our own style which embodied the chuche idea is the invincible socialism deeply rooted in the popular masses. The iron-like will and tested leadership ability are a basic criterion for the working class party leading the revolution. The working class party can overcome any trials, and victoriously lead the people, and consummate its historic cause to the end only if it cherishes the iron-like will and tested leadership ability. Therefore, it is very fortunate for the people to live under the leadership of the great party with an invincible might. Today, our party has widely demonstrated its might as a great party with iron-like will and tested leadership ability by upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il at the head. Above all, the iron-like will and tested leadership ability of our party are being clearly demonstrated in firmly leading our people on the socialist road, thus constantly upholding the revolutionary banner of the chuche idea. The historic mission of the working class party lies in building the socialist and communist society. The will and leadership ability of the party can be vigorously demonstrated in adhering to the socialist cause and in leading it to victory. Furthermore, firmly adhering to the socialist cause and victoriously carrying it out today are emerging as important matters related to the destiny of mankind. In recent years, socialism collapsed in some countries. With this, imperialists and reactionaries are babbling about socialism coming to an end. Also, they are more viciously conducting antisocialist plots. However, our party is firmly leading the socialist cause down the single road of chuche with its iron-like will and tested leadership ability that will not falter at any antisocialist plot. It is the invincible will of our party to endlessly consummate the socialist cause by upholding the banner of the chuche idea without the slightest hesitation and backwardness in any difficult situation or trial. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's works, such as The Historic Lesson of Socialist Construction and the General Line of Our Party, On the Fundamental Question of Revolutionary Party Building, and Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable, have vigorously demonstrated our party's determination on how it is firm in consummating the socialist cause. Our party has learned lessons from the collapse of socialism in some countries and is vigorously moving forward by invoking wisdom and by showing courage of turning a misfortune into a blessing, thus resolutely refuting the reactionaries' plots against socialism. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il has always made it a rule to solve all problems in conformity with the aspiration of the people and actual conditions of our country. The dear comrade leader has developed and consummated the chuche socialist idea and has enabled the popular masses to strongly arm themselves with it to strengthen the main force of the revolution. With its might, he has lead our country to be ever victorious. Even when the socialist betrayers threw away the socialist principle and moved toward wholly accepting the capitalistic political method and economic system, we firmly adhered to the chuche-oriented position, thoroughly embodied the Taean work system, and implemented the rural theses. This clearly proves our party's revolutionary leadership. Truly, our party's leadership is a fundamental source that made it possible to further consolidate and develop socialism of our own style. Our party's iron-like will and refined leadership are also manifest in leading the revolution and construction toward endless upsurges with far-reaching aspirations and ideals and without the slightest stagnation or stalemate. The socialist cause is a long-term cause that accompanies a serious social change and large scale construction work. This cause can advance victoriously only when endless struggle is launched through far-reaching aspirations and ideals. We are leading the socialist construction toward the one road of rapid progress without the slightest stagnation and stalemate by always highly upholding the banner of continued revolution. Here lies the resoluteness of the working-class party's will and invincible leadership. Our party is an experienced and ambitious revolutionary party endlessly advancing and struggling with the far-reaching aspiration and ideal for the bright future of socialism and communism. Our party's firm position is to continue revolution to the end until imperialism is wiped out on this land and the banner of socialism's victory flies high. Therefore, our party is firmly adhering to and vigorously pushing ahead with the three revolutions--ideological, technological, and cultural--and is resolutely adhering to the revolutionary principle and socialist principle under whatever circumstance. Because of our party's wise leadership which leads socialist construction by unfolding an extraordinary high goal and far- reaching blueprint and mobilizes the popular masses' revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity to look ahead into the distant future, unprecedented miracles and innovations are being created in our country, and many great monumental creations that elucidate the era of the Workers Party are being built. Our party has the strong will and militant base that does not yield to difficult situations, does not boast of victory, and which vigorously advances toward a new goal. Last year, on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory of war, the party Central Committee announced its slogans to call the whole party, the whole country, and all the people, thus achieving a great revolutionary upsurge and brilliantly decorating the 40th anniversary of the victory of war as a great festival of victors. Also, at the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth party Central Committee, a revolutionary economic strategy organizing and mobilizing the whole party, the whole country, and all the people toward a new general march was presented. This is clear manifestation of our party's iron-like will and refined leadership. Although our people were faced with great difficulties and barriers due to the unexpected international events and the acute situation created in the country, they consistently rose to create mass heroism and collective innovation without the slightest wavering and with revolutionary optimism and faith in victory, because of our party's leadership. Today, our people are overflowing with confidence that when they move according to our party's leadership, there is nothing in this world that cannot be achieved and no trial or difficulty that cannot be resolutely overcome to occupy a high peak in socialism. Possessed with an iron-like will and refined leadership, our party takes pride as a great party leading the socialist cause toward the one road of being ever victorious. This wholly lies in the fact that our party is highly upholding the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il. The dear comrade leader's iron faith and peerless courage comprise our party's iron-like will and his extraordinary ability and leadership capability comprise our party's refined leadership. The faith and will possessed by the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is an iron-like will which does not waver with any kind of thunder and lightning and which does not shake even with the attack of a myriad of powerful enemies. It is also a peerless courage that achieves victory in revolution by turning misfortune to good fortune and an adverse situation into a favorable one. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's leadership is shown in the great decisive step of taking the initiative to overcome difficulties in revolution through dauntless operations; in the extraordinary organizational capability of achieving the final victory ahead of schedule by always thrusting oneself toward the attack line; and in the revolutionary leadership art that provides a new upsurge of revolutionary offensive by calling forth at once the whole party, all the people, and the whole country. Because the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il's wise leadership encompasses wisdom of keen insight, peerless courage, and refined leadership, our party is highly manifesting to the whole world, the dignity of a militant party which possesses invincible, ever-victorious leadership, and our party is highly manifesting to the whole world the dignity of a heroic people possessed with revolutionary faith. Our people will adhere to the socialist banner according to the leadership of the great party and leader [suryong] to the end, and will brilliantly build socialism of our own style centered on the popular masses.
