Gen. Kostyantyn Morozov, military commentator of UKRAYINSKA HAZETA: "Taking a Look at the `Partnership for Peace.' Appeasement By the Betrayal of Partnership. Questions of Security, Nuclear Disarmament, and Relations Between NATO, the U.S., and Ukraine"] [Text] It seems that, having won the cold war against communism, the West and its military organization NATO, found themselves not knowing which way to turn. The question arose: what next? No matter how hard the provincial diplomacy of the countries that emerged out of the ruins of the USSR tried to persuade Western politicians of their peaceloving intentions and their desire for democratic change and integration, there was no sign of any significant response from the West. Western politicians listened to them, reassured them, but did not act accordingly. The West was perfectly aware that these countries posed absolutely no threat, that the democratic changes are being implemented by trained politicians (there is a real shortage of them in the provinces) [as published], and that there is no particular advantage to developed from integration with the hungry. The West did not envisage (nor did it seek) new formulas for effective cooperation with a whole host of new states. Things were more or less clear as far as the countries of the former Warsaw Pact were concerned. As soon as they emerged from under the influence of communist ideology, they immediately turned towards cooperation with the West, including its military structures. The countries that formed on the territory of the former USSR merited special attention from the West. The presence of nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan, Ukraine's singular position with respect to her attitude towards nuclear disarmament, Russia's harsh policy of pressure on her former sister states in the Union directed at creating obstacles on their road to independence -- all these things prevented the est, and especially the United States, from formulating a clear plan for building relations with the new states. It is preferable to deal with a single partner -- we often heard this undisguised nostalgia for the past. This makes it easier to direct one's own policy and to predict that of the other side. Thus a new center was needed to replace the USSR. Immediately! It goes without saying that Russia aspired to assume this role. The West wanted Russia to be its only partner in solving all the problems that arose with the collapse of the Union. Consequently, the West did not condemn Russia's policies towards some of the CIS members. The West needed this CIS that the rest of us find incomprehensible. It represented for the West that future center in which Russia would be the leader. And this leadership was already discernible in the growing ambitions on the one hand, and the shaping of a policy of relations with the "older brother" on the other. All that this center lacked was the necessary level to control the emergence of problems of an unnecessary partnership with the countries of Eastern Europe. In order to involve everyone in a joint effort to achieve this end, at the end of 1991, the West came up with the idea of cooperation with NATO. Almost all the countries seized on this idea. Russia was to be the leader of all those who joined. A situation was needed that would unite the CIS members more closely around Russia and force the West to reject the inopportune demands of Eastern Europe for close cooperation. There was not enough pressure on the West by the new "center"... And so they began to organize it. The first voice to be heard was that of Andrey Kozyrev. The Russian foreign minister delivered a speech in Stockholm that shocked all those present. He virtually announced to the world that Russia wanted to return to the cold war. "Too many liberties should not be taken with `Great Russia'," stated the diplomat. "The territory of the former Soviet Union... is a space on which Russia has to defend its interests will all available means, including military means!" The Western delegates were stunned by this sensational speech. And even though Kozyrev explained later that same day that he had been joking, they have been repeating this same "joke" for more than a year now. The old Russian parliament, which passed a resolution on the status of the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol, and the new Duma, which has rehabilitated the State Committee for the State of Emergency and reverted to thoughts of restoring the empire, are "joking" in this very same vein. President Yeltsin, who even earlier had recognized the right of nations to self-determination but not their right to separate from Russia, condemned the parliament in words, but in reality he was "joking" as well. And now, having announced that his foreign policy is based on defending Russians in all the countries of the world, he is "joking" in the Duma. Just a month after the Stockholm "joke," in January 1994, Kozyrev himself announced that Russia would leave its troops on the territory of neighboring countries: "We should not give up our presence in these regions, which have belonged to Russia's sphere of interest for centuries." Kozyrev was "joking" once again, only more concretely this time, when he advised Western diplomats not to rush to open their embassies in Kiev because they would soon have to downgrade them to consular representations. Jokes are fine, and therefore after some of the explanations that follow, everything seems to fall into place, but policy is being shaped. In shaping it, Russia increasingly treats other countries in a joking manner. That is what Russian President Boris Yeltsin did when he gave his "O.K" for the entry of Poland and her Visegrad colleagues (the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary) into NATO. This time, it was the generals from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense who unanimously made excuses in Moscow for the president's joke in Warsaw. "Expanding NATO membership threatens the security of Russia" -- such is Russia's current policy on this issue. Unsurprisingly, it did not incur any resistance from the West, because the West was waiting for it, and Eastern Europe understood this. The West now has to formulate a new policy. It should be perceived not as a new policy, but as a continuation of earlier policy which has already been accepted -- that is, within the framework of military and political cooperation. The North Atlantic Council on Cooperation [NACC] lasted a little over two years. It was created on an American initiative by a decision by the NATO Council on 8 November 1991 and announced as the Rome Declaration on Peace and Cooperation. The declaration established new relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Instead of opposition --consultations and cooperation aimed at strengthening the initiatives of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. This initiative for cooperation was immediately accepted by all the states of the former Warsaw Pact, including the states of the former USSR. Two conferences of defense ministers of NATO countries with their partners in cooperation within the framework of the NACC were held in Brussels (1 April 1992 and 31 March 1993). The first meeting of the session of the military commission on cooperation was held on 10 April 1992. At this meeting, the chiefs of the general staffs, representing the same parties as those taking part in the conference of defense ministers, planned cooperation among the partners for the coming year. I visited Brussels at the end of February. This time, meeting with political and military representatives, including NATO representatives, as well as during my visit to NATO headquarters, I received no answer to my question regarding what new mechanisms of cooperation have been established by the "Partnership for Peace" program that had not been offered by the NACC initiative. Why was there a need for a new initiative, and what is the purpose of persuading us that the new program opens up wide opportunities for cooperation? There are no answers. There are only strenuous appeals to embrace the program as a new wise step by President Clinton, his Administration, and NATO towards peace in Europe. What is this program in reality? Countries have been given the opportunity to decide for themselves how close they wish their relations with NATO to be in the future. This is to be done by submitting formal requests which will serve as the basis on which draft agreements between NATO and the partner countries will be jointly prepared. The framework document grants all who sign it the same rights as those already established for them by other documents, which Ukraine and all the other future partners have already joined. In particular, the new document sets forth the general commitment "to voluntarily abide by the provisions of the UN Charter and the principles of the Declaration on Human Rights." It also contains valuable clauses that hint at security guarantees for our state: "especially to refrain [emphasis mine -- K.M.] from the use of force or the threat of force against the territorial integrity and political sovereignty of any state, to respect existing borders..." And more specifically: "...fulfilling the obligations that they assumed in the field of disarmament..." This is followed by a statement of the goal of the partnership, which, in my opinion, had already been made in the earlier principles of cooperation contained within the framework of the NACC, and which do not commit anyone to anything. As to new provisions, it unlikely that Ukraine will take advantage of them in the near future. Because our country has no money to maintain a "liason office" at the Brussels headquarters or to maintain there "personnel, property, and equipment," and no aid for this is anticipated. The key principle is set forth as follows: "NATO will consult [emphasis mine--M.K.] with any active member of the partnership, if this partner perceives a direct threat to its territorial integrity, political independence, or security." That is all. Nothing more. What is the strategic premise of the new program? One can arrive at the answer on one's own by simply reflecting on one thesis that failed to attract sufficient attention from analysts and the press. Responding to a question from journalists regarding the objective of the "Partnership for Peace" program at a press conference in Brussels on 9 January of this year, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that the partnership "...will give us the best means by which to respond should the future be threatened." In other words, the goal is not to strengthen trust between the countries of Europe by expanding NATO membership through greater cooperation with the partners within the framework of the NACC, but to respond to crises with existing forces and political means. As regards the partnership, it applies to the more powerful, as does peace among them. It is not difficult to see that what we have here is the same division of "spheres of influence," in which there is no room for cooperation on an equal footing for the partners. There is a strategic objective, and strategy requires strategic partners. The partnership for peace is meant for the powerful, and the powerful know well enough whom and how they should allow or invite to cooperate with them as their "partners." The partners have been divided in the same way as territories. Nonnuclear Ukraine with her hopeless economy and undefined policy is clearly to be left to her old "master," who, by restoring ties (the disruption of which, incidentally, is being lamented in Ukraine for three years now), will provide us with work and sausage and will defend us from those he deems necessary. It is difficult to cooperate with those who have not taken a clear stand, because it is difficult to predict their policies, and for that reason (at least for now) there is no reason to trust them. Because trust means concrete assistance in exchange for something in the future. And this future (be it socialist or social-market oriented) cannot be discerned, at any rate in Ukraine. That is why self-reliance is another goal of this compromise program. On 10 February 1994, The Washington Times published an article entitled "Talbott foresees no change in focus," in which it quotes the deputy secretary of state: "If... reform in the East falters, if a new threat arises, NATO will be able to work through the partnership to protect regional stability through closer ties with the active participants." But since it is clear even now that reforms are faltering (in Russia, of course, because this has nothing to do with Ukraine whatsoever), a partnership is possible only between the centers. The second center (other than the U.S.) was traditionally the USSR. Now Russia is ambitiously pushing to take its place, and, appeasing it, the West supports this. Nothing reflects a country's political intentions better than its budget. On 7 February 1994, the Clinton Administration published details about appropriations for its new policy on foreign aid... The Administration will refrain from allocating budget funds to specific countries. But the review materials of the U.S. Congress note that an exception is made in the case of Israel, Egypt, and... Russia. The apartments of Ukraine's citizens have not grown any warmer as a result of our nuclear weapons having been pawned for energy supplies from Russia, but where is that promised multimillion (to start with, then to be followed by multibillion) aid that we were to receive from the West? There are plans to allot 2.8 billion dollars from the U.S. budget for "building democracy." Of this sum, the former Soviet republics (which, insultingly, also include Ukraine) are to receive 900 million dollars, which is approximately half the sum allocated last year. This reduction is especially interesting in light of the recent announcements made by the American administration to the press that it is "doubling" assistance to Ukraine to 300 million dollars, which amounts to nearly 12 percent of the current 2.8 million [as published]. If this percentage does not change substantially, Ukrainian democracy in 1995 will receive "all of 100 million dollars in aid." (Footnote *) (Based on data provided by the Pylyp Orlyk Institute of Democracy [11 February 1994].) Aid to Central and Eastern Europe is also being reduced. The American negotiators who recently succeeded in persuading the president of Ukraine of the necessity to deprive Ukraine of her nuclear weapons were inspired by a secret assessment by U.S. intelligence that Ukraine will most probably not survive the next two years as a fully sovereign state. The Ukrainian people hoped in vain that they could hold on to their nuclear weapons until they received substantial economic aid and adequate security guarantees. The declaration promising the surrender of weapons without assistance and guarantees was signed by the president of Ukraine on 14 January of this year, and by 8 February, our foreign minister signed in Brussels and thereby espoused the "Partnership for Peace" program, which rids Ukrainians of other illusions as well. Thus, Ukraine will be provided with economic assistance and security guarantees by Russia at Russia's own discretion. We have thus come full circle. It would be interesting to know what prognoses and conclusions Ukraine's own intelligence service is arriving at. The partners have be betrayed, appeasement continues, but will there be peace? The position of the West is understandable, but who will understand us? I am astonished by the position of our president, who was unable to achieve the objective in the negotiations which we had posed from the very beginning. Now they "report" to us that our missiles are allegedly in a dangerous condition and that we have no more time. But just two weeks before the Moscow summit, Defense Minister Radetskyy assured the citizens of Ukraine in a television appearance that the opposite was true. In other words, there was time then. Ukraine's journey to specifically trilateral talks was a difficult one --more than a year was spent persuading us that only with the participation of a third party, and specifically the U.S., could we be confident that the fulfillment of obligations assumed by the parties would be monitored. In my opinion, all three parties to the agreement should have assumed obligations. Ukraine -- reduces her nuclear weapons and, if it proves impossible to organize their conversion on her own territory (the Supreme Council adopts a decision following a review of government programs), she hands the weapons over to plants in Russia. Russia --compensates Ukraine for the value of the materials in the nuclear weapons, including tactical weapons, and guarantees Ukraine's security for her part (commits herself to eliminate pressure, blackmail, threats of force, and territorial claims from her policy towards Ukraine). The U.S. --promises to monitor the fulfillment by the parties of their obligations and, by its own policy of relations with Ukraine and relations with Russia, to promote political relations between Ukraine and Russia founded on principles of justice and security. The obligations assumed by the parties should be ratified by their respective legislative bodies and be subject to verification by an international commission created by all three parties. Were this the approach, we in Ukraine would not feel that we are again being stripped naked and that an attempt is being made to cheat us. These would be those external political guarantees, which together with internal political, economic, and social guarantees, would guarantee our security. This was something that we (at least I) stated many times at various talks: "That is how we in Ukraine envisage the guarantees that we are talking about." I do not know whether the president and Foreign Minister Zlenko envisage these guarantees in the same way. It was Zlenko's job to reach the same conclusions, prepare the data on which the president could form his position, and plan the negotiations. I know many more intelligent people who work in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but apparently the minister himself abides strictly by the principle "it is easier this way." Or, perhaps, we have no one at all whom we can entrust with affairs of state, no one on whom the president can rely? One is seized with sadness upon reaching this conclusion. Is our own policy being conducted outside the context of world politics? How many concessions have already been made, and how many more are being planned... These are the very things that are reducing Ukraine to a second-rate position in world politics. These include, first and foremost, hindering the building of our Armed Forces and the system that will assure their security, which, coupled with "invisible borders," makes it impossible to lay the foundation for our own security and our own military policy -- a situation that puts in question the independence of our state policy and, therefore, Ukraine's very statehood. In another sphere -- putting off the implementation of the principles of a social-market economy helps to maintain the catastrophic situation in production, and, along with growing crime, heightens social tensions among the people, who are being incited in an increasingly organized manner to demand brotherly ties with our neighbor. Finally, the lack of state programs for supporting and reviving national culture, science, health, and sport are destroying all hope of things improving in the future. But hope dies last. The people of Ukraine are holding elections specifically for the purpose of getting a new parliament, which will work in the interests of the state, of getting a new government, capable of finally beginning economic reforms, rather than confining itself to market phraseology, while continuing to work in a command-administrative system. The people are hoping that at least their children and grandchildren will have a normal life. We are for partnership and, unquestionably, also for peace. But not for a partnership, in which there will be peace only between the centers, peace attained through the division of spheres of influence. We do not want to become part of an empire for the sake of peace only between the West and the empire. We want peace in our own land as well, peace in our own home. We want our own partnership with others and not through intermediaries. And we will have it. If we become a state.
