President Jiang Zemin gave an important speech. After warmly congratulating them, he said: Time flies fast. Many urgent tasks remain to be done at a faster pace because in three years China will resume its sovereignty over Hong Kong. He pointed out: The CPC Central Committee has already formulated a series of important principles and policies on the administration of Hong Kong after 1997. Deng Xiaoping pointed out sincerely as early as a decade ago that Chinese people in Hong Kong have the ability to administer Hong Kong well and that not believing this is the case is an idea left over by the old colonialism. We have full confidence that people in Hong Kong will administer Hong Kong well. He said that Hong Kong's economic stability and prosperity today are inseparable from the Hong Kong people's diligence and creativity. This was true in the past and remains so today. The people of Hong Kong will surely be able to create a bright future for Hong Kong. Of course, Hong Kong's economic stability and prosperity can not be separated from the mainland's economic development either. Jiang Zemin said in conclusion: One important purpose of setting up the preliminary committee and inviting Hong Kong affairs advisers is to provide a chance and channel for Hong Kong people to participate in the cause for a smooth transition in Hong Kong and to lay a foundation for the realization of "Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong" after 1997. He expressed the hope that all the Hong Kong people will care for the affairs related to China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong and for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, because these are closely connected with the interests of the Hong Kong people. He also expressed the hope that the advisers and members of the preliminary committee will increase their contacts with the mainland and facilitate the Hong Kong people's participation in the cause so as to make full preparations for the coming of 1997. Also present at today's reception were Zou Jiahua, Qian Qichen, Li Lanqing, Luo Gan, Ji Pengfei, Lu Ping, and Zhou Nan.
