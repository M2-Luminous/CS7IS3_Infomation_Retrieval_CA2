In particular, he told them of a speech delivered by Belarusian National Bank Chairman Stanislav Bahdankevich, who told deputies that "we have almost matured to the point of taking new steps to reform the economy." Syarhey Navumchyk speculated that the majority in parliament is ready to "fire" Bahdankevich, because the latter has recently begun to show a more and more skeptical attitude toward Belarus' joining the common ruble zone. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, at the behind-closed-doors session, also discussed was the issue of appointing Anatol Butevich chief of the recently established Ministry of Culture and Press, and Alyaksandr Stalyarov as chairman of the Committee for Radio and Television Broadcasting, which will be established in place of the State Broadcasting Company. Although both candidacies have been put forward by Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich, they are subject to approval by the Supreme Soviet Presidium and appropriate committees. Syarhey Navumchyk, as a member of the Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human Rights, stated that it is very unlikely that his committee will support the candidacy of Alyaksandr Stalyarov. According to Syarhey Navumchyk, Alyaksandr Stalyarov has warned him in a private conversation that if members of the committee do not vote for him, he will "cut off the oxygen to the opposition and all democrats," because he is convinced that the Supreme Soviet Presidium will support him. Nevertheless, Syarhey Navumchyk said, even if Stalyarov is appointed by the Supreme Soviet, the Committee for Glasnost, Mass Media, and Human Rights will have the right to veto this decision, and it is going to do so. Syarhey Navumchyk also pointed out that the presidential campaign has already begun, and that the mass media are being concentrated in the hands of the Cabinet of Ministers, the leader of which is gathering "faithful people" around himself.
