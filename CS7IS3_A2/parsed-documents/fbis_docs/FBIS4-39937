Interfax was informed by the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry that some of the department's functions would now be transferred to local authorities. Fuel and Energy Minister Yuriy Shafranik told Interfax that the removal of those articles from the draft had been another necessary compromise. He said that during a year and a half of revision, much had been lost from its content in the search for compromises. However, he said he was happy that the draft law had been adopted at its first reading. Without such a document, he said, the government would find it very difficult to exercise control over the holders of licenses for oil and gas production. The president, government and constituent members of the Russian Federation, parliamentary committees and fractions must, by 24 June, submit their comments to prepare for the draft law's second reading before 1 July.
