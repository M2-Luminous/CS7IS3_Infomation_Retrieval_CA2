FR940830-2-00039 FR940830-2-00016 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000,001] Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership; Availability of the Environmental Assessment for the proposed Cove Point LNG Peakshaving Project August 24, 1994. The staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC or Commission) has prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) on the liquefaction unit and recommissioning of existing facilities proposed by Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership (Cove Point LNG) in the above-referenced docket. The EA was prepared to satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act. The staff concludes that approval of the proposed project, with appropriate mitigating measures, would not constitute a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. The EA assesses the potential environmental effects of: •The construction and operation of a 15.0 million cubic feet per day liquefaction unit; and •Recommissioning of onshore facilities at Cove Point LNG's existing Cove Point LNG terminal. The purpose of the proposed project would be to provide up to 5,000,000 dekatherms of storage and up to 1,000,000 dekatherms per day sendout for peak winter demand. The EA will be placed in the public files of the FERC on August 26, 1994 and will be available for public inspection at: Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Division of Public Information, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Room 3104, Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;1371. Copies of the EA have been mailed to Federal, state and local agencies, public interest groups, interested individuals, newspapers, and parties to this proceeding. A limited number of copies of the EA are available from: Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental Project Manager, Environmental Review and Compliance Branch I, Office of Pipeline Regulation, Room 7303, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, (202) 208&hyph;0980. Any person wishing to comment on the EA may do so. Written comments must reference Docket No. CP94&hyph;59&hyph;000, and be addressed to: Office of the Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426. Comments should be filed as soon as possible, but must be received no later than September 26, 1994, to ensure consideration prior to a Commission decision on this proposal. A copy of any comments should be sent to Mr. Hugh Thomas, Environmental Project Manager, Room 7303, at the same address. Comments will be considered by the Commission but will not serve to make the commentor a party to the proceeding. Any person seeking to become a party to the proceeding must file a motion to intervene pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214). The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by §385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your comments considered.
