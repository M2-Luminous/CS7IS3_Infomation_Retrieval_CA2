Following their talks behind closed doors that lasted for half an hour, Zhirinovskiy told a TANJUG journalist: ``His holiness blessed us, and we invited him to come to Moscow where a congress of Slav nations is to be held on 4 April. "We spoke of Russia's return to the right path of the Orthodox religion," Zhirinovskiy said stressing that the Russian and Serbian Orthodox churches should direct all their efforts to the spiritual renaissance of their nations. "We shall invest efforts that the state make amends for everything that the Russian and the Serbian churches have lost over the past years. It would be better if the youths that have gone astray experience their purification through spiritual education than through prisons and emigration," Zhirinovskiy said. Zhirinovskiy stressed that he was moved in particular by a plea made yesterday by a little girl from Herzegovina who told him: "Vladimir, save my dad who is on the front, don't let NATO kill my dad." "Such moving things brought us here," he said. Asked if he would meet Serbian President Milosevic, Zhirinovskiy said: "Maybe." Even though it had been announced that only Zhirinovskiy and his two associates would pay a visit, numerous members of the Association of Serb-Russian Friendship also came to the Patriarchate, including the leader of the Party of Serb Unity, Zeljko Raznjatovic, and the chairman of the Serb National Renewal, Mirko Jovic.
