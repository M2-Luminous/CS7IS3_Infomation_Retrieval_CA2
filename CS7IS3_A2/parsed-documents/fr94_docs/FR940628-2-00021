FR940628-2-00021 FR940628-2-00014 Golden Field Office; Notice of Grant Award to University of Minnesota AGENCY: Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to the University of Minnesota for continuing research efforts in support of the DOE Office of Building Energy Reserach programs. The project will experimentally evaluate a side-arm thermosiphon heat exchanger unit. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Government of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: John W. Meeker, Contract Specialist, 303&hyph;275&hyph;4748. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar heating technologies for use in buildings. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization of solar heating systems. Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research. DOE funding for the Grant is estimated at $50,000 and the anticipated period of performance is twelve (12) months. Issued in Golden, Colorado, on June 20, 1994. John W.
