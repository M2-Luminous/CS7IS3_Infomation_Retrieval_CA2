FR940208-2-00121 FR940208-2-00079 TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY Environmental Impact Statement; Integrated Resource Plan AGENCY: Tennessee Valley Authority. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) on its Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) in concert with the preparation of the IRP. The IRP will establish TVA's long-range energy strategy and will meet the requirements of section 113 of the Energy Policy Act, Public Law No. 102&hyph;486. The IRP will evaluate the means of providing electric energy services, including demand-side management programs, to meet the demand for future electric energy services by TVA's customers. The EIS will consider the potential environmental impacts of alternative energy resource strategies. TVA is inviting comments on the scope of the EIS analyses. DATES: Comments on the scope of the EIS must be received on or before December 5, 1994. A number of public meetings will be held to obtain comments on the scope of the EIS and to provide information about TVA's IRP process. The locations and times for these meetings will be announced later. TVA encourages those wishing to provide comments to do so as early as possible. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to Dale Wilhelm, Manager of NEPA/IRP, Tennessee Valley Authority, 400 West Summit Hill Drive, WT 8C, Knoxville, Tennessee 37902. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Lynn Maxwell, Manager of Resource Planning, Tennessee Valley Authority, 1101 Market Street, MR 5D, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37402, telephone (615) 751&hyph;2539. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: TVA Power System TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the United States, charged by Congress with promoting the proper use and conservation of the resources of the Tennessee Valley region. One component of TVA's regional development program is the generation, transmission, and sale of electric energy. TVA operates one of the largest electric power systems in the country, producing four to five percent of all the electricity in the Nation. TVA's power system serves about eight million people in a seven-State region. The TVA Act requires the TVA power system to be self-supporting and operated on a nonprofit basis and directs TVA to sell power at rates as low as are feasible. Dependable capacity on the TVA power system is about 25 million kilowatts, and consists of approximately 58 percent coal, 21 percent hydro (including the pumped storage unit and certain units operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), 13 percent nuclear, and 8 percent combustion turbines. TVA expects to initiate operations at Unit 1 of its Watts Bar Nuclear Plant and to recommence operations at Unit 3 of its Browns Ferry Nuclear Plant in the near future. TVA transmits electricity it generates over 16,000 miles of transmission lines to 160 local municipal and rural cooperative electric systems (``distributors'' of TVA power) which in turn retail the power to individual consumers (homes, factories, schools, hospitals, etc.). TVA also directly serves 68 large industries and Federal installations. Like other utility systems, TVA has power interchange agreements with the utilities surrounding its region, and it purchases and sells power on an economy basis almost daily. Previous Energy Planning Activities TVA has employed a largely internal integrated resource planning and study process for many years. Information from this process has been used to propose energy resource decisions. Under the 1992 Energy Policy Act, TVA is directed to continue employing an integrated planning process. This Act also requires TVA to provide distributors of TVA power an opportunity to participate in the process. TVA prepares individual environmental reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) for proposed energy decisions. As appropriate, information from TVA's IRP analyses is used in these environmental reviews. TVA has committed to employing a public IRP process and has decided that use of the EIS process under NEPA would be an appropriate means of obtaining public involvement in the planning and decisionmaking processes. Preparing an IRP EIS will also promote consideration of the environmental impacts of alternatives, and will allow TVA to use the IRP/EIS with other NEPA reviews for future specific energy decisions or projects.
