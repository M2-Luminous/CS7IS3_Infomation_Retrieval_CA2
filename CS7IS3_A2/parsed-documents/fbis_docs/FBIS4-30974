FBIS4-30974 "dreeu106_y_94002" FBIS-EEU-94-106 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 YUGOSLAVIA Federal _O_Protest Over Expulsion of Foreign Journalists _O_Protest Over Expulsion of Foreign Journalists 94P20815A 94P20815A CSO [Editorial Report] The expulsion of foreign journalists ordered by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's Ministry of Information has drawn protests from a variety of Serbian organizations, including opposition political parties, journalists and writers, and an independent trade union. While Federal Secretary for Information Slobodan Ignjatovic, in a statement carried by Belgrade TANJUG Domestic Service on 12 April, accused AFP and CNN of "waging a fierce media war against Yugoslavia... on the territory of Yugoslavia," those who have protested the expulsion decision have said they view it as a serious mistake that violates freedom of thought and political expression and is detrimental to the interests of the country. Some also see it as foreshadowing action against domestic journalists. The 14 April issue of BORBA contains several articles expressing what the editor called "stormy reaction to the decision by the Federal Ministry of Information to withdraw the credentials of CNN and AFP journalists." One of the articles, titled "High-Risk Ban," presented the Serbian Renewal Party's view that the expulsions were an alarming warning that Serbia is going through the process of reintroducing bolshevism and isolating itself from the world, a development that is a serious threat to lasting peace, the lifting of sanctions, and monetary and economic reforms. Another article reported the reaction of the Serbian Democratic Party [DSS], which charged that the Ministry of Information had itself "significantly contributed" to the "biased views" of the foreign media by failing to inform foreign journalists "about the real causes and consequences of this civil war." Now, according to the DSS, the ministry had made another serious mistake. Instead of helping journalists to witness developments, the ministry has forced them to seek information exclusively from "the other side." In a third article, titled "Step Toward Further Isolation," the Independent Association of Journalists of Serbia declared that the withdrawal of credentials of any foreign or domestic journalist was " contradictory to the fundamental right to be informed, which is an important aspect of human rights in general." Under the title "Cancel That Decision," BORBA of 19 April published a statement by the Serbian PEN [International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists, and Novelists] organization, stressing that "withdrawal of foreign journalists' credentials represents a rude violation of one of the fundamental principles of the charter of PEN, which specifically strives to secure the free exchange of information and opposes all forms of censorship.... Such acts... are plunging the Serbian people further into isolation and away from the world community. Therefore, the aforementioned decision must be retracted and cancelled." On the same page, BORBA carried a statement by the Association of Writers of Serbia titled "Attack Against Freedom of Thought and Interpretation of Facts." It called the expulsion order "a dangerous policy of preventing the free flow of information" and charged that "if this trend continues, Serbia's spiritual space will become a hopeless wasteland, completely isolated from all media." These groups were joined by the "Nezavisnost" (Independence) Association of City Trade Unions in strongly criticizing the Serbian Government. It pointed out ironically that the "purge of foreign journalists sheds much more light on the actual objectives of this latest democratic offensive by the Serbian authorities." This is "only a warm-up... before the final showdown with domestic journalists who think differently." Nezavisnost's prediction about the ultimate domestic media target of "the Serbian authorities" was supported by a statement attributed to Milorad Vucelic, director general of Serbian TV and Radio, in the 25 April issue of the Belgrade opposition weekly VREME: "It is not CNN, not the foreign media which made up all these lies about the Serbian people, but journalists from Belgrade who write for DANAS, OSLOBODJENJE, VREME, Studija B, TV Politika, BORBA.... They provide the references for the writings of the foreign media." The VREME article observed that "bad omens are accumulating. A change in the membership of the Association of Journalists of Serbia has been announced, and, like parrots, the self-appointed patriots keep repeating the names of the unfit media houses, demanding that `this' question be resolved once and for all."
