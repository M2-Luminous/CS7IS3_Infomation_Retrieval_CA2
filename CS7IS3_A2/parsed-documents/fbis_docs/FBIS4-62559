It started with Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the Army General Staff. He was followed to Beijing by State Duma Chairman Ivan Rybkin, Deputy Premier Aleksandr Shokhin, and, finally, the premier himself. In the opinion of a number of Chinese observers, such a rapid expansion in mutual contacts shows that a "new old love" has bloomed again between Moscow and Beijing. Admittedly, the Beijing newspaper BEIJING QINNIAN RIBAO provided a more prosaic explanation for Moscow's intentions. It claims that, not having received the loans it was promised, Russia is disenchanted with its Western partners and is now banking on restoring its traditional ties with the East. What do official Chinese circles think? A prominent Foreign Ministry official diplomatically replied that he saw no shifts in Russia's foreign policy. Talking about Russo-Chinese relations, he did not refer to love or even friendship, but talked about mutual interest -- primarily in the sphere of economic cooperation. Until this year trade between our countries had been rising rapidly. Then suddenly, in the first quarter of 1994, the volume of reciprocal shipments fell by 40 percent. The leadership of Heilongjiang Province, which borders Russia, attributes the slump to the fact that Moscow introduced visa restrictions on Chinese "shuttles" and businessmen. But our trade experts believe that the roots of the crisis go deeper than that. The PRC authorities, striving to curb inflation, are currently holding back the growth of capital investment -- particularly in construction. And this, in turn, has led to a fall in demand for some of our traditional exports -- metals, timber, and machinery. Russian exports are becoming less competitive on the Chinese market as a result of rising prices for raw materials and transportation. Relations between neighbors may also be complicated by differences about who owns what islands in the Amur and Argun Rivers. Judging by the statement from the head of the Khabarovsk Kray Administration printed in the Moscow newspaper SEGODNYA, five Chinese warships attempted to penetrate the border 40 km from Khabarovsk. Our border guards prevented this from happening. Weapons were not used. But, according to information received by IZVESTIYA from Khabarovsk, there were no "five warships." The border guards merely recorded a violation of sailing regulations by a single Chinese cutter, and, according to them, such incidents often occur, but do not constitute military provocations. As the aforementioned PRC Foreign Ministry staffer put it, what occurred were "not clashes, but disputes." Disputes arise because the 1991 border agreement states that sailing regulations along the Amur and Ussuri Rivers will be further elaborated. But they do not yet exist. The Chinese are insisting that their ships are entitled to sail down the main channel of the river -- that is, between the center of Khabarovsk and Bolshoy Ussuriyskiy and Tarabarov Islands. But the Russian side is trying to prove that since the two islands, which are part of the city, are our territory, Chinese ships sailing through this stretch of the river are obliged to observe the regulations existing in Russia's internal waters. Whatever happens, we should not whip up feelings over these incidents, much less call for the denunciation of the 1991 agreement -- as certain politicians in Khabarovsk are doing. The stability of our Far Eastern borders, which was achieved after long, hard negotiations with the PRC, is at stake.
