[Al-Hariri] Let us just say it is difficult to govern. As you know, Lebanon is a country that just emerged from a long war. I agreed to become its prime minister because I knew that I could make a difference. Today, one and a half years after taking office, I can consider that the government achieved many of its goals and that as such, it has already made a difference as compared with those that came before. [Nasr] So you consider that your action brought positive results, overall? [Al-Hariri] Indeed. Very positive results, and this is a statement based on fact. First there was the stabilization of the Lebanese pound's exchange rate. Only a few years ago, the national currency's standing with respect to foreign currencies was a prime concern for the Lebanese. Regularly, and in every single news bulletin, there were special items monitoring real time variations in the local exchange rate. Today, the Lebanese pound is stable and therefore is not an issue any more. This is already very important inasmuch as a stable foreign exchange market is the very foundation of the economy. Without it, there cannot be a successful reconstruction plan. [Nasr] The economy may have pulled out of the hole, but recovery is still some way off! [Al-Hariri] I never said you could rebuild an economy all at once and just wave away war's every disaster. However, results achieved so far are very promising. When I came into office, the reserves of the Bank of Lebanon were an estimated $450 million. Today, they exceed $1.5 billion. Not to mention our balance of payments which shows a surplus. This is what gives Lebanon its almost unique character worldwide, and will let it become a large economic hub once again. [Nasr] But all this does not seem to have had any immediate impact on daily life. I think in particular of the unavoidable threesome: electricity, water, and telephone, not to mention the awful roads. [Al-Hariri] I am perfectly aware of people's impatience. But these are tasks that require very careful planning. We do have a plan, and this plan is being carried out according to a specific schedule. Every sector is concerned, including services, Beirut's international airport, which was in an unbelievable mess; we just finished straightening it up, and electricity, which, unfortunately cannot be supplied on a 24-hour-a-day basis for at least another 17 months. Any such enterprise takes time. You need to plan, call in experts, establish preliminary requirements, issue invitations to tender, negotiate prices... These are stages you cannot bypass, especially in a country like Lebanon, where each official has his own prerogatives. Bids from the various companies interested in the rehabilitation of the telephone network alone weigh in at 500 kg... Now this is what I call working! [Nasr] Are not the connections between yourself and the reconstruction project for downtown Beirut a little too close for comfort? Is not this project a kind of "insurance" that would guarantee that you remain "indispensable?" [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you right away that in a democracy, no one is indispensable. Institutions remain, and officials are hired or fired as part of this very specific framework. I would remind you, however, that my group became involved in downtown reconstruction well before I was appointed prime minister. Furthermore, I consider the government duty-bound to take an interest in this. No state could remain passive when the core of its capital is in ruins, it could not remain aloof and unconcerned just to avoid being charged with doing business. [Nasr] Your very business-like style of government does not go down well in traditional political circles. [Al-Hariri] Well, I would say that this is democracy. I became prime minister by being a member of Parliament. My political opponents are trying to do the same. This is the name of the game. Not only in Lebanon, but in all countries ruled through democratic institutions. [Nasr] A major factor preventing Lebanese capital from flowing back and international investors from regaining confidence is indisputably the huge influence of Syria. Have you made a deal [last word in English] with the Syrians to retain some maneuvering space? [Al-Hariri] Let me tell you one thing in all sincerity: I can assure you that since I became prime minister, the Syrians have not contacted me once on any issue directly connected with internal affairs. Before I took office, like everybody else, I was hearing that you could not appoint a civil servant or set up a project without Damascus' imprimatur. I am not in a position to comment on the way my predecessors did things, but as far as I am concerned, there is no truth to all this. In fact, our relationship with the Syrians is based on two unchanging features: cooperation in internal security matters -- and I think all the Lebanese can see it is effective -- and coordinated foreign policies. [Nasr] You happen to be a naturalized Saudi citizen, a privilege seldom granted an Arab national by the Wahabite ruling family. As the Lebanese prime minister, do you ever find yourself caught between Damascus and Riyadh's conflicting interests? [Al-Hariri] Contrary to popular misconceptions, Lebanon can never find itself in an unpleasant situation with respect to Syria and Saudi Arabia, for a simple reason: Its relations with these two countries are very different in nature. Geographically, Syria could not be closer to Lebanon. We have common interests that cannot be dissociated. The two countries' populations are very close, and there are many obvious family ties. Moreover, many Lebanese people own land in Syria, while others work there. This is nothing new; ties between our two nations go back a long way. Such is not the case for Saudi Arabia, which has no special interest in Lebanon. Riyadh has a very clear foreign policy which is limited to its sphere of influence. On the other hand, the Saudis help friendly countries, including Lebanon. Insisting that there is a power struggle between Damascus and Riyadh in Lebanon is ludicrous. I would even add that to my knowledge Saudi Arabia has never attempted to exert any influence on our country. [Nasr] You visited France several times, meeting its top officials, not to mention businessmen, of course. Were tangible promises made with respect to funding specific reconstruction projects? [Al-Hariri] Relations between France and Lebanon date back hundreds of years. The French have a special relationship with Lebanon, and so do the Lebanese with France. When a Lebanese says he is going to Europe, chances are he will end up in France. The reverse is just as true. When a Frenchman comes to the Middle East, you just know he will stop over in Beirut. There is indeed a very special relationship. As far as tangible promises are concerned, on meeting French officials our requests were very specific. For the most part, these related to new equipment for internal security forces, the provision of spare parts for military equipment, and the construction in northern Lebanon of a 450-megawatt power plant. Furthermore, we reached an agreement in principle for increasing the capital of Middle East Airline. [Nasr] Is there currently a will to renegotiate the agreement entered into by Paris and Beirut as regards General Michel 'Awn? [Al-Hariri] To tell you the truth, I fail to see how that could be. You know that the agreement was concluded before I came into office. To my knowledge, none of the parties which developed it has shown any desire to have it renegotiated so far. [Nasr] In the Washington bilateral talks, the Lebanese and Israelis still cannot seem to agree on anything. Jerusalem and the PLO entered into an agreement last September, while Jordan seems to be headed in the right direction. If this goes on, all Arab countries will end up signing a peace treaty with Israel, with the exception of Lebanon and Syria, which will be left alone in seeking an "overall solution." Is not Beirut mostly waiting for Damascus' "green light" before it forges ahead? [Al-Hariri] Now listen carefully, I will say this only once: there can be no peace settlement in the Middle East that excludes Lebanon. This is no empty slogan; it is a fact. Even if all our Arab neighbors enter into a peace agreement with Israel, such an agreement will no be viable without our participation. The reason for this is obvious: All opponents to the agreement will converge here and will not sit still until they have wrecked it. Beside, there is no reason for Lebanon to rush at a time when the Syrians themselves do not oppose the notion of a peace agreement with Israel. Why should we be in a hurry while Damascus has formally entered the process and has been overtly negotiating with the Israelis? All that we ask for at this stage is full enforcement of Security Council Resolution 425, which provides for the withdrawal of Israel's army from the border zone it has been occupying in southern Lebanon. The Israelis will not hear of it and want us to rush into a peace treaty. However, there is nothing in Resolution 425 that requires Lebanon to conclude a peace agreement.
