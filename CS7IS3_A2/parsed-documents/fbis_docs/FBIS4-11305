Robaina dedicated the event at Havana Convention Palace with a 10-minute speech to 204 Cuban citizens who live in 27 countries and who were invited on a personal basis to participate in the meeting, which will last until Sunday. He said: We must collectively establish the areas in which we, with everyone's participation, may make progress toward the establishing of the normal relations to which we are entitled. Robaina said one of the objectives of the meeting is "to examine what measures can be adopted to normalize ties between the emigrants and the country, institutions, and families." Another goal, he said, is to encourage stable relations and exchanges in the family, cultural, and social realms. He noted that efforts are being made "to encourage constructive actions by residents abroad considering that in the current historic situation, the future of the nation and the safeguarding of its sovereignty, independence, and achievements represent a common motive for all Cubans of goodwill." Robaina said the meeting is being attended by the most diverse political and ideological currents, "something that does not block the willingness to work for the objective that brought us together." The minister explained that the participants include professionals, artists, housewives, retired persons, workers, businessmen, religious persons, and social and student leaders who love and are identified with the fatherland. He said their participation in the conference "represents acknowledgment for our government's courageous decision to convoke this meeting in the midst of the unpostponable tasks the nation is tackling." The foreign minister said the meeting is not the result of either a miracle or an accident, but, especially, of the maturity, strength, and independence of Cuba and of "a growing attitude of respect and understanding in a considerable number of emigrants who increasingly identify themselves with the fundamental interests of the nation." In his brief speech, which was greatly applauded by the participants, Robaina recalled that the meeting is taking place in spite of the hostile U.S. policy toward Cuba that so far has served as a framework for the development of relations between the island and its emigrants. The conference was called on 14 February by Robaina. This is the second effort made in this direction after the dialogue held in this capital in 1978. Robaina said the first fruit of this new meeting is precisely the fact that it has taken place and the possibilities it has opened for a continuation on the road to the normalization of ties between the nation and its residents abroad. He said: Respect and intelligence in discussing each of the issues that concern us in the relations between the nation and its emigrants is what must characterize our current dialogue and serve as the premise for the future. Following the dedication, the first working session began at noon behind closed doors. Robaina will speak about Cuba's emigration policy, sources close to the meeting have reported. The meeting will last until Sunday. The president of the Cuban Parliament, Ricardo Alarcon; Council of State Vice President Carlos Lage; and Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists will also participate in the meeting. They will discuss issues concerning the country's life.
