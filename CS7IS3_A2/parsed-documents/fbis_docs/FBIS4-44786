However, an agreement between French and German companies to use composite molding techniques, developed for spacecraft antenna, in the production of civil aircraft simulators, represents the first transfer of the programme. In another early success Photek Ltd., a UK company, has taken a licence on an ESA patent covering developments in imaging techniques used by ESA in optical astronomy. Photek specialises development of high intensification photoncounting cameras for biomedical applications. The cameras can capture high quality pictures of the sub-molecular structure of cells, and are used as tools in DNA research and as an aid to new techniques such as fluorescent microscopy, which offers advances in the way the spread of certain diseases may be monitored. Photek initially plans to carry out further development of the camera through an EC Eureka programme called "Phobia" in collaboration with the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory and Scottish and Dutch partners. The camera will then be marketed worldwide by Photek; at that stage, ESA will collect royalty revenue to feed back into the transfer program. The licence agreement was made possible by the efforts of Spacelink Europe, the consortium of technology transfer agents set up by ESA to assist with the spin-off program. Spacelink publishes an annual catalogue of space technology and is able to assist non-space companies at all stages of the transfer process, including the all-important sourcing of investment funds for technology adaptation. The catalogue is called TEST (Transferable European Space Technologies) and is distributed annually in five languages to more than 30,000 companies throughout Europe. TEST 3 has recently been issued and contains "offers" of innovative space technology in many fields, including optics, sensors, communications and robotics which are available for licence for use in other applications. Another early success for the programme has been the adaptation of novel material techniques, developed by Brunel Institute for Bioengineering for an ESA orbiting laboratory programme, to orthopaedic surgical applications. Shape memory alloys (SMAs) can be made into structures whose shapes can be controlled precisely by heating them to a known temperature. With assistance from the ESA programme, Brunel has developed a range of SMA staples which, when cooled and used to join a fractured arm or leg bone, alter shape as they heat to body temperature to hold the ends of the fracture in compression and speed the healing process. Hospital trials of the staples are imminent and, when these are complete. Brunel will collaborate with medical equipment suppliers to market them worldwide. Many Contacts Over 90 company-to-company negotiations stimulated by the ESA programme are in progress and eight transfers have already been signed or are close to completion. One particularly satisfying aspect is the transnational nature of most of the contacts. For example, spotting the wider possibilities for some high spec seals developed in France for use in rocket motors, the Spacelink UK agent will be able to alert a UK supplier to their existence. The company was seeking higher performance seals to meet tighter EC environmental regulations and, with assistance from the Spacelink partner in France, a licence deal is now in its final stages. Many other examples of transnational co-operations are taking place. Prototype miniature pumps developed for a space based microgravity laboratory are currently being evaluated for several applications including the continuous infusion of intravenous drugs by an Italian medical equipment company. The device -- four of which would fit in a matchbox -- has the ability to pump minute quantities of fluid continuously with great accuracy and reliability. Elsewhere, a Danish producer of advanced power supplies is in negotiation with a potential German collaborator, and Swiss-originated solid-state accelerometer technology is attracting interest throughout Europe. Transfers in progress are not confined to hardware. There is also much interest in ESA's software. A "generalised" version of the "ESA Software Engineering Standards," which have been in demand by software engineers since their introduction to space programs by ESA a number of years ago, have now been accepted for worldwide promotion by an international publishing house. Again ESA will benefit from royalty returns on the sales and it is the agency's plan that royalty income from such transfers will eventually make the program self-supporting. The momentum of the technology transfer program is now increasing as links continue to be forged between space and non-space companies. A database of over 2,000 companies actively seeking new technology has been established and Spacelink undertakes regular focused searches of the ESA research establishment ESTEC in the Netherlands for technology to meet specific terrestrial needs. One hundred and ten space technologies are on offer for transfer through the first two issues of the TEST catalogue, and significant opportunities exist for companies seeking to broaden their technological base to take advantage of the money invested throughout Europe in space research. Many of the spin-off applications so far have been medical. Both space and medical engineers have interests in automation, advanced optics, sensors, materials technologies and miniaturisation, and both (at least currently) are better placed than other sectors to absorb the higher costs related to advances in these areas. ESA is interested in hearing from non-space companies which are seeking innovative technology and space companies which believe they may have technology to offer.
