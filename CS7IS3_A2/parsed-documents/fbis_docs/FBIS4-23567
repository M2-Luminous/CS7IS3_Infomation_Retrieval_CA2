The government has submitted a new document on this issue. Today's session was only between the negotiators. The mediator was not present. The negotiators failed to reach an agreement, but a meeting of heads of negotiating teams is scheduled for tomorrow. Meanwhile, UNITA today reacted to the government proposal on the organization's participation in the governing of Angola. UNITA's response was presented to Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola and is already in the government delegation's hands. Also today, UNITA issued an official statement in Lusaka, saying it fully accepts the government's proposal on participation in government. In terms of national reconciliation, the government has offered the following posts to UNITA: four ministries, seven deputy ministries, three provincial governments, seven deputy provincial governments, 30 municipality administrations, 35 deputy municipality administrations, 75 communal administrations, and six diplomatic missions. In the statement read by Information Secretary Jorge Valentim, UNITA says it accepts all that, but asks the government to include the government of Huambo Province. The government has not yet reacted officially, but confirmed it has received UNITA's response demanding Huambo province's government and the legitimization of districts occupied by the force of arms. [Luanda Radio Nacional in Portuguese at 1900 GMT on 8 June broadcasts a similar report saying "the statement released by UNITA in Lusaka this afternoon does not reflect the reality. A source close to the talks says UNITA has accepted the overall number but not the localities proposed by the government. The source gave the example of municipal and communal administrations, as well as diplomatic missions. The source said UNITA only wants to impress the international public opinion. In practice the organization wants to force the government to legitimize the areas it occupies militarily."]
