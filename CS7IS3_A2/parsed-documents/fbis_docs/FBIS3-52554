The paper says that it is a shame that hopes for Arab unity are foundering in this crucial Arab region. In its Thursday [6 January] editorial, the paper, which is a mouthpiece of the opposition al-Wafd Party, links the bread demonstrations, which occurred amid an atmosphere filled with pessimism and disappointment, and the impending failure of unity, which came about after many years of struggle by the northern and southern parts of Yemen. The paper notes the repercussions of political differences between the two conflicting leaders, 'Ali Salih and Salim al-Bid, on the political and economic situation in the country. It adds that the differences have reached the point of threatening separation and loss of unity. The paper expresses hope that the Yemeni people will heal their political wounds and preserve the unity of their country. It also expresses hope that, for the sake of the Yemeni people, the views will converge and the rift will not increase so that the Yemeni people can deal with their economic problems and sail to the shore of safety.
