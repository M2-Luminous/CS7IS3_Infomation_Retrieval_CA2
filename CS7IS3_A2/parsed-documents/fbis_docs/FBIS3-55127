Chechnya, which proclaimed sovereignty, refused to hold elections to the new Russian legislature on December 12. The Central Electoral Commission proposed to the people and the leadership of Chechnya to "consider and positively solve the issue of the republican participation in elections to the Federal Assembly of Russia in March 1994". "The Chechen republic, according to the Russian Constitution, was and remains a fully-fledged subject of Russia and should be worthily represented in the Federal Assembly", the commission said.
