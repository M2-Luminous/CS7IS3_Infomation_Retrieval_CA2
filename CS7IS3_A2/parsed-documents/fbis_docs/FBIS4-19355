As he was boarding the aircraft, which is now taking him back to New York, UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali agreed to the request from Radio 1 of Radio Nacional de Espana to make a statement about the situation in former Yugoslavia and Gorazde. Before that, the UN secretary general expressed his gratitude to the Spanish people and government for the warm welcome that, he said, they had given him during his visit to Madrid and Barcelona, highlighting Spain's participation, with over 1,000 soldiers, in peace operations. Regarding the situation in Bosnia, Butrus-Ghali said that in the last few hours he has talked with Yasushi Akashi, his representative in Yugoslavia, and with NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, with whom he discussed, he said, what possible measures could be taken to bring peace to that region. The UN secretary general said that when he arrives in New York he will hold further consultations with his advisers, although I can tell you, he said, that, given that I am by definition an optimist, I believe that we will be able to find peaceful solutions in this dramatic case. Concerning the situation in Rwanda, Butrus-Ghali said that he had been in touch by telephone with the UN commander in the region who told him that the situation remains confused.
