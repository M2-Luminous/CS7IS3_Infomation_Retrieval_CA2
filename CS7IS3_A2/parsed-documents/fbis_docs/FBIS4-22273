As the date of the first payments draws closer, many of the reluctant creditors of the VEB [Bank for Foreign Economic Relations] have finally grasped that all of them have been granted far from equal rights during the repayment of the debt and have snapped out of the state of preholiday euphoria. For example, the clients of the VEB itself are now wondering why commercial banks that have kept the funds of foreign economic associations similar to their own have been granted the right to unfreeze their savings 14 years sooner. The commercial banks themselves are guessing at the mechanism for transferring real money to their clients, which is not known to anyone. While the Ministry of Finance, the VEB, and the Central Bank of Russia keep silent, the most impatient organizations have begun to make preventive attempts to "enliven" the money through commercial banks. As was to be expected, given the state of a legislative vacuum, this could not but cause incidents. A conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks became the first such incident; arbitration proceedings between the two will begin on Thursday. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT, the foundation for future conflicts was laid by the authors of the government decree of 15 March 1993. Let us recall that according to this document, the repayment of the currency debt of the VEB must be effected in five stages over time. In the process, commercial banks were granted the most preferential terms: The government resolved fully to redeem bank bonds, making the first payments in an amount of about $100 million as early as 14 May 1994. The situation of foreign economic association-clients of the VEB itself turned out to be the least attractive. Their debts will be paid back only from May 2003 on; the government is planning to fully settle with the associations as late as the year 2008. Besides, commercial banks were to receive bonds for the entire amount of the debt, whereas, in keeping with the letter of the Central Bank of 14 February 1992 "On the Legal Succession of the Russian Federation With Regard to the Obligations of the Former USSR by Virtue of Currency Accounts at the USSR Vneshekonombank," organizations that had accounts with the VEB itself may count only on some of the "frozen" funds less debts to foreign creditors (by now, these funds constitute the foreign debt of the state). It is noteworthy that the funds that the authors of the decision, specialists from the Ministry of Finance and the VEB, view as debt to commercial banks are nothing other than the funds of their clients, primarily the same foreign economic associations. Under the circumstances, the actions of some VEB clients involving the sale of their "frozen" accounts to private structures from among the commercial banks under their tutelage are easy to understand. On the contrary, the principles from which the authors of the regulations proceeded, whose official obligation it is to resolve the issues of the foreign debt of the state, are completely unclear. As "X-hour" drew nearer, it became clear that the process of "enlivening" the money would not be easy for anyone. The point is that in the already mentioned chain "the VEB--the commercial bank--the client," the government document regulates only the relations between the VEB and the commercial bank in whose correspondent account the money was frozen. The document does not at all touch on how much the clients of the bank should receive and in what manner. As stated by Mr. Gatsenko, the chief of the currency department of the Ministry of Finance of Russia, a commercial bank that has received VEB bonds "can either distribute the bonds to its clients or allocate currency to them out of its own resources." At the same time, Deputy Minister of Finance Igor Selivanov explained that the bank should discuss the principles and terms for the placement of bonds directly with the clients, "proceeding from the contract on settlement services." As a poll of bankers engaging in bond operations revealed, the Mezhekonomsberbank and the Inkombank have taken full advantage of such advice; they have embarked on distributing the bonds of the first tranches to clients (proceeding from a logical discourse). At the same time, following such explanations many banks came to feel like unattached travelers lost in the woods by night. Having received bonds in the total amount of the debt to their clients, they still do not have official data on the amount of the debt of each organization to the state. If such information is announced after the fact, but the bonds will have already been received by the legitimate owners, the banks may possibly have to pay the state debt of their clients. A conflict between the Imperial and Lefortovskiy Banks may very well be considered an illustration of the above. Proceedings involving them will begin tomorrow at the Moscow Arbitration Panel. A client of Imperial, the foreign-economic association Tekhnopromiport, sold $15 million "frozen" at the VEB to a certain commercial structure-client of the Lefortovskiy Bank in April 1993 at the rate of R100 [rubles] to the dollar. Some time later, Lefortovskiy, which in turn is a holder of a blocked correspondent account at Imperial, suddenly demanded that this amount be transferred to its correspondent account abroad, but this time in "live" form. It does not make sense to engage in polemics about the logical flaws in these instructions, especially given the fact that at present, the debt of the Tekhnopromimport to the state comes to about $400 million, according to some data. Imperial, which refused to transfer funds for reasons that are quite easy to understand, was slapped with a "desperate" lawsuit for $15 million by Lefortovskiy. Commenting on this "transaction," Chairman of Imperial Bank Sergey Rodionov stated that, regardless of the outcome of the proceedings, the bank intends to return to the VEB the bonds issued by the government in an amount equivalent to the debt of the bank to Lefortovskiy. Imperial intends to postpone the distribution of securities to other clients until the issue is settled legislatively. It has come out that the Stolichnyy and Russian Credit banks have also resolved to wait for a precise legal interpretation of the issue.
