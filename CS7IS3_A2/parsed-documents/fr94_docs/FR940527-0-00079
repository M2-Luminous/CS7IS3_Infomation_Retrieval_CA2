FR940527-0-00079 FR940527-0-00024 26. In the Final Recommended Decision, the Board stated, in support of its recommendation to retain the frozen circuit equipment allocation factor, that the factor at issue applies equally to AT&T and Alascom. 34 We clarify here that the frozen factor development procedures shown in Section 36.126(d)(3) of the Commission's rules do apply equally to AT&T and Alascom because they are both interexchange, not exchange, carriers. 35 However, the actual calculated frozen factor is not the same for each carrier because it is based on carrier-specific usage data. 34 See Final Recommended Decision, FCC 93J&hyph;2 at para. 92. 35 47 CFR 36.126(d)(3). 27. The State of Hawaii cites various portions of the Final Recommended Decision as conflicting with Commission orders on rate integration. 36 We clarify in response to concerns of the State of Hawaii that in this order we do not adopt any change in definition of rate integration or its applicability, as required in prior Commission orders. We merely change the market structure by which rate integration is achieved for interstate services to and from Alaska. To eliminate any possible misunderstanding, we also emphasize that this order only pertains to MTS services and does not include private line services. 36 Ex parte letter from Herbert E. Marks and Andrew W. Cohen, to William F. Caton, Acting Secretary, FCC, November 19, 1993. V. Alascom's ``Opposition'' to the Final Recommended Decision 28. Alascom filed an Application for Review of the Final Recommended Decision on November 29, 1993, under Section 1.115 of the Commission's rules. AT&T and GCI argue that Section 1.115 applies to a final action taken pursuant to delegated authority under Section 5(c) of the Communications Act and that the Alaska Joint Board's actions were taken pursuant to Section 410(c) of the Act and do not constitute final actions taken pursuant to delegated authority.'' 37 We agree with AT&T and GCI that Alascom's filing is improper under Section 1.115 of our rules. 38 Accordingly, we dismiss Alascom's petition. 39 We, however, will address on our own motion, certain matters raised by Alascom's pleading. 37 AT&T filed an Opposition (December 10, 1993) and GCI filed a Motion to Strike Application for Review (December 14, 1993). 38 See 47 U.S.C. ยง410(c); 47 CFR 1.115 (1992). 39 We also dismiss Alascom's related motion (November 29, 1993) to exceed the page limitation provided in ยง1.115(f)(1) of the Commission's rules, 47 CFR 1.115(f)(1). 29. In its pleading Alascom makes a number of charges regarding supposed substantive and procedural infirmities in the Alaska proceeding. 40 For the most part, these arguments were thoroughly discussed and rejected in the Final Recommended Decision. We incorporate by reference the Joint Board discussion on substantive and procedural issues and, unless noted otherwise, we adopt the Joint Board's analysis as our own. Nevertheless, we think that some of the matters raised by Alascom deserve further attention here. 40 AT&T opposes Alascom's claims and reserves the right to respond further when these claims are raised properly. AT&T Opposition at 2 n. 4. GCI does not respond to Alascom's substantive claims, arguing that Alascom raises issues that were already raised in the Final Recommended Decision and elsewhere in this proceeding. GCI Contingent Opposition at 2, n. 2. A. Alascom's Substantive Arguments 30. Alascom claims that the Board has ``elevated the policy goals of efficiency and competition,'' above other Board objectives. 41 There is no merit to Alascom's claim. First, we do not agree that efficiency and competition are lesser objectives than the other Board objectives. As stated in the Board's Supplemental Order tentatively adopting these objectives, ``a proper resolution of the issues before us must represent a balanced effort to achieve each of these goals. 42 Second, we find that the Board has balanced the five Board objectives in a manner that best serves the public interest. The Board has addressed the efficiency and competition objectives by recommending the termination of the JSA. It has addressed the objectives of universal service and revenue requirement neutrality by recommending several transition mechanisms including the continuation of the JSA for the first phase of the transition period, the AT&T payment of $150 million to Alascom, and the AT&T second phase must-purchase requirement. Thus, the Board's recommendations will not affect the Commission's policy on rate integration for interstate MTS services for Alaska. 41 Alascom Application for Review at 3. 42 Supplemental Order, 4 FCC Rcd at 398, para. 24.
