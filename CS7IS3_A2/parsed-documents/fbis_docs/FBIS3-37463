He pointed out that the Foreign Ministry is considering the NATO ultimatum as "illegitimate and contradicting with the U.N. decisions". Lavrov told parliamentarians that "the Russian Federation's representative in the U.N. Security Council had received instructions to object to air strike on Sarajevo". He said that at Russia's request a commission of the U.N. security Council was set up to investigate the explosion at the marketplace in the Muslim part of Sarajevo on February 5. Lavrov said the special presidential envoy of the Russian Federation Vitaly Churkin reported from the former Yugoslavia that "the agreements reached by the Serbs and the Muslims a few days ago are being implemented, heavy equipment is being transferred to the U.N. forces or pulled out of Sarajaevo". Even limited air strikes of the NATO aviation on positions of the Bosnian Serbs around Sarajevo would mean qualitative changes in the military political situation not only in Bosnia, but all over Europe, a high-ranking Russian diplomat told Interfax on Wednesday. In his words, such air strikes "would put an end to the plan of peaceful settlement of the Bosnian conflict, because they would embitter the Bosnian Serbs and make the Muslims even more irreconcilable". The diplomat also said that the special envoy of the Russian president, deputy foreign minister Vitaliy Churkin, who is in the Balkans now, left Zagreb for Belgrade on Wednesday to meet again with the Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. The diplomat did not go into details about this unplanned trip noting only that it was urged by "supreme interests".
