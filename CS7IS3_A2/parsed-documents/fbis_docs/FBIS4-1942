Peasants' per capita net income came to 891.61 yuan in 1993, up 390 percent from 1978 when reform just began. When allowing for price rises, the increase was 236 percent. Peasants had 512.5 yuan in their hands per capita, up 56.6 times from 1978. Thanks to the increase in their income, peasants began to become particular about their food. In 1993, their per capita grain consumption totaled 324.16 kg, up 24.2 percent from 1978, of which rice and flour accounted for 51.5 percent. Food on their table became varied, which included rice, steamed buns, chicken, duck, fish, and other kinds of meat. By the end of 1993, there were 68 radios and 85 black and white television sets in every 100 peasant households. Peasants spent most of their spare time listening to radio and watching television. Per 100 peasant households had 70 sewing machines, 235 clocks and watches, and 123 bicycles, up 140, 180, and 280 percent, respectively, from 1978. They also had one camera, 31 washing machines, one refrigerator, two electric fans, two motorcycles, and 2.7 pieces of large furniture. In addition to increasing their durable goods, peasants also notably improved their housing conditions. In 1993, their per capita housing space increased to 16 square meters, up 84.1 percent from 1978. Under such circumstances, they began to pay attention to interior decoration. In 1978, most of them lived in thatched or earth cottages. Now, brick-and-tile houses can be found everywhere in rural areas, small multi-story houses have been built, and interior decoration has become more urbanized, with telephones, carpets, and ceramic-tile floors and walls entering the peasant family. Some peasants also have heaters to keep their houses warm all year.
