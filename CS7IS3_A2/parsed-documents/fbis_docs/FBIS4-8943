We were embittered by the reports that a group of French citizens yesterday committed an unprecedented vandalistic and anti-civilized act, Gordic told TANJUG commenting the raid by Moslem extremists and their French friends on the Yugoslav cultural centre and their day-long blockade carried out with the tacit agreement of the French authorities. `The aggressive and destructive conduct of the participants in the attack on the Yugoslav cultural centre was received with insufferable tolerance of the French authorities who stood by as two of the staff were brutally harrassed and thrown out on the street, and watched the hours-long demolishing of the facilities and the destruction of the documentation and books,' he said. The minister said that Paris, viewed by the Serb people as the capital both of the French and world culture, has now shown another side which mars its humanistic tradition. Gordic described as specially depressing the fact that the group also included French philosopher Bernard Henri-Levy who is well-known for his numerous verbal attacks against the Serbs, Serbia and Yugoslavia. Henri-Levy has sided with the attackers and thus committed an act fundamentally contrary to all humanist principles which has revealed all the misery of his unconcealed biased political activities, Gordic said. Serbian Information Minister Ratomir Vico also believes that the raid on the French cultural centre in Paris, Yugoslavia's only such representation in the world, is an act of vandalism, unworthy of French democratic traditions and that the reaction of the French authorities `has left a sickening impression because it was inadequate and too late in coming.' Instead of immediately condemning the incident as an act of terrorism, the French authorities allowed the Moslem extremists and the French advocates of Moslem interests to abuse the centre for anti-Serb propoganda, Vico told TANJUG. Vico warned that the benignant attitude of the French authorities and public is completely in keeping with the anti-Serb public opinion in that country. The French politicians have lost their neutrality regarding the civil war in Yugoslavia, and a part of the intellectuals, who were virtually unknown to the public prior to the war in the Balkans, have now emerged to use their anti-Serb views to blame the Serbs for all the tragic events in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, Vico said. Vico recalled that the Yugoslav cultural centre in Paris used authentic and objective information in an attempt to introduce somewhat different views to the French public. The centre responded to the demonization of the Serbs, provided documented proof of their sufferring and invited foreign newsmen to convince themselves on the spot that the events in the Balkans are not only one-dimensional. The cultural centre did not pay French intellectuals to speak the `truth' but it reacted when the French media carried the apparent untruths about the developments in the Yugoslav territories, Vico said.
