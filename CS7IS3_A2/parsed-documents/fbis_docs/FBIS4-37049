Towards that goal he has been working relentlessly for the past 15 years. According to his friends, Dr Kalam's only dream is to make India a respected, if not feared, world power by the end of this century. Dr Kalam, an aeronautical engineer and bachelor, has been the architect of India's integrated guided missile development programme and the most important achievement of the programme is that it is the first successful endeavour in the country to harness indigenous talent to design and develop state-of-the-art tactical and strategic missiles. Of the five families of missiles that he committed himself to develop and deliver four surface-to-surface missile Prithvi, medium range ground-to-air Akash, short-range quick reaction SAM [surface-to-air missile] Trishul and the Anti-tank guided missile Nag are close to production stage. His most ambitious project, Agni, the intermediate range ballistic missile, has already completed three tests. For him Agni is truly like a child. The bachelor Tamilian in his poem, "Ancestors' desire" tells about his parents, now dead, wanted him to marry and have the children and how he could not satisfy their desire. But after Agni was successfully launched, Dr Kalam wrote: "My parents appeared in my subconscious mind. Smiles on their faces, tear filled eyes, blessing me with grace For their grandson `Agni', the symbol of strength And a continuity of their name." In another poem "From Tipu's rockets to Agni," Dr Kalam said "I was walking on the historical shores (of Cauvery) in Srirangapatnam where two battles took place in the 18th century. India made the world's first war rocket. These rockets are in the British War Museum. Small tube with gun powder, tiny nozzle and warhead. The use of these rockets defeated the Britishers. History repeats." Dr Kalam was born in the temple town of Rameshwaram six decades ago. Memories of doting family and a secure childhood explain the serenity on his face. Perhaps the only unpleasant event of his childhood he can remember was when he was separated from his brahmin friend by a new teacher who had his own ideas about social harmony. Dr Kalam who always sat on the front bench with his friend, was ordered to sit in the back row of the classroom. "Even today, I am living with the image imprinted on my subconscious mind, of Ramaswamy crying in the class when I changed my seat to the rear row", writes Dr Kalam in his annotation to his book of poems "My journey". Dr Kalam, the Agni man, says the benefits of defence research should also be used for humanitarian work, particularly in the field of medicine. He has founded a society for biomedical technology for this purpose. After studies, Dr Kalam got his first job as an aeronautical engineer with the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited at Kanpur. He then joined with Satellite Launch Vehicle Programme, and led the team that made Rohini and Menaka, those tiny rockets which aroused scepticism even derision. But the two rockets instilled pride -- and passion -- in Dr Kalam. No longer did Indian payloads need to ride on the French-built Centaur rockets. The success convinced him that with will and even without money, Indian science and technology could attain dizzy heights.
