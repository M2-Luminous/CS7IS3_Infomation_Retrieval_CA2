In statements to MENA, they noted that this barbaric and criminal act could hamper international efforts currently being made to establish peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians. They called on the international community to shoulder its full responsibility toward this heinous crime and punish Israel for it. They held Israel responsible for the incident for not taking the necessary security precautions that could have prevented this crime. Grand Imam of al-Azhar Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq 'Ali Jad-al-Haqq described this incident as ugly, criminal, and painful since the perpetrators did not take into consideration the fact that the worshipers were standing in the hands of God, performing their duties for God at such an early hour of the morning. These evil men, who honor no truce or covenant, harvested the worshipers with their weapons, killing and injuring those people who were in God's hands. He said this incident reveals the bestiality, absence of humanity, and deviation from the spirit of religion and emotion that watches over people who place themselves in the hands of God. He added that this is a grave crime for which Israel should be made answerable internationally. The families and guardians of the martyrs should take Israel to account. Those involved in the peace process should also take this crime into consideration. Dr. Mustafa al-Sa'id, chairman of the People's Assembly's Economic Committee, said that this incident confirms that the cause of peace has not yet reached the mentality of the ordinary Israeli, who still thinks he can continue his occupation of territory and evacuating its inhabitants through violence and terrorism which are practiced against the Arabs in the occupied territories. He added that this was the policy pursued by the Israelis during the first stages of establishing the so-called State of Israel. He noted that such an incident underlines the need for the Arab nation to be aware of what is happening in the region now and to take whatever step is necessary to make Israel understand that these criminal and terrorist actions impede the peace efforts that the Israelis claim to welcome. He said that this painful incident is no less grave than the Serbs' crimes against the Muslims of Bosnia-Herzegovina. He deeply regretted Western society's silence over the repeated violations of human rights in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the occupied Arab territories. Kahlid Muhyi-al-Din, National Progressive Unionist Grouping Party leader, described the crime as an ugly one and asked why people who were kneeling in prayer and not doing anything to harm Israeli settlers were shot at. He said that this incident shows that keeping the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories threatens the process to establish peace and destroys any attempt to establish any peaceful coexistence. Liberals Party leader Mustafa Kamil Murad stressed that this incident indicates the increase in the number of extremist Israeli elements whose extremism reaches the level of criminality, bloodshed, and the violation of God's houses. He said that shooting at people in prayer is unprecedented anywhere except in Israel. He noted that this incident will have bad consequences on the progress of the peace negotiations between Israel and the PLO. He called for an international investigation into this incident, condemnation of it, and international punishment for it. The Wafd Party Secretary Yasin Siraj al-Din said that this incident confirms the barbarism of the Israelis and their ability to challenge the world public. He noted that the incident is aimed against all heavenly principles, including Islam and Christianity. He said that the incident is bound to impede all the current efforts to establish peace in the region in general and the Gaza-Jericho Accord between Israel and the PLO in particular. He called for halting all cooperation or normalization between the Arabs and Israelis. Siraj al-Din stressed the need to convene an emergency Arab summit to be attended by kings and presidents to put an end to these repeated criminal Israeli practices. He said if this is unachievable, the summit must be held at the level of heads of government to end such criminal acts effectively. Ahmad Hamrush, chairman of the Egyptian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, said that this massacre is added to the list of massacres committed by the Israeli extremists, starting with the massacre in Dayr Yasin in 1947, and including the Sabra and Shatila [in Beirut] massacres, and now the Hebron massacre. Today's massacre comes at a delicate time when the Israeli and Palestinian peoples are joining efforts to achieve peace in the region. Hamrush stressed that these extremist terrorist elements that perpetrated this bestial massacre aim to halt the peace process, to incite hatred between the Arabs and Jews, and to continue the tension and wars that have engulfed the region for 50 years. He said Rabin should be held responsible for this massacre, as he continues to procrastinate in the implementation of the agreements reached between the Israeli Government and the PLO. Continuing his statement, Hamrush said: I hope this incident would not thwart the peaceful settlement and that we will not give the Israeli extremists and terrorists the chance to have the final word concerning the nations' fate. He added: We are passing through a stage that requires self-restraint and recourse to logic and rationalism to confront this tragedy so that we can avert its consequences and continue the peace process.
