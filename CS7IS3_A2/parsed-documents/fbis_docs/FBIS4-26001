Such a practice is aimed at enabling the academy to further build up a competitive and incentive mechanism. The Director of the Scientific Research Bureau of the academy Mr. He Bingmeng, said in an interview with this agency that the academy had formulated regulations of such bidding on a trial basis. He added that the regulations stated that the academy would offer public bidding each year for some key research projects in order to ensure high quality results. The traditional practice employed by the academy for key projects started with applications by each of its institutes which would be discussed by the Scientific Research Bureau. The applications were then submitted to the academy for final appraisal and approval. The main shortcoming of such practice lay in failure of highlighting the key projects which in turn led to fewer number of researchers who took up such projects. The Vice President of the academy, Mr. Ru Xin, said that there were some 460 treatises last year as the result of research on specific topics, together with 530 investigative reports, 2,500 academic papers not including translated and academic references. All these totalled 150 million Chinese characters. Mr. Ru frankly acknowledged that the success in terms of quantity was rather great but there were not many of high quality while most of them were of general level and some even were of low quality. The bureau made public some guidelines for the bidding which covers 12 research projects including research on situation of and solution to state-owned enterprises which are in serious loss, research on loss of state-owned asset seen in the transaction of property rights of state-owned enterprises, research on division of revenue and expenditure by governments at various levels and a shift of revenue between governments, legal protection on the build-up of clean administration, policy on absorption of surplus of rural labour force in main urban areas and research on relationships between China and Japan as well as the United States in economic cooperation in Asia and Pacific region. The 12 items make up one seventh of key projects set by the academy for the entire year. The period of time for such bidding was between May 10 and June 30 which is open to all researchers of the academy on a basis of fair competition and the most suitable candidates will be chosen. The academy specially appropriated RMB [renminbi] 680 000 to fund the research items under the bidding. Mr. He said that in order to ensure high level outcome from these projects, the academy suggested to carry out joint research on these items and organized research teams featuring various disciplines and institutes as well as experts and scholars.
