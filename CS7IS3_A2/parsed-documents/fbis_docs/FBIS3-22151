Heavy financial input and raw material consumption have helped maintain China's high economic growth as well as giving rise to heavy pollution, said Qu, head of the Environment Committee of the National People's Congress, in Environment Protection [HUANJING BAOHU] magazine. Despite significant progress, China's industrial efficiency in recent years still lags behind that of developed countries. To produce the same amount of industrial products, China uses five to 10 times more water than developed nations, Qu said. Authorities have not fully recognized the importance of environmental protection in drafting economic plans. Priority has been given to increasing the input of raw materials and energy, while encouraging low energy consumption and low pollution has been largely ignored. China can no longer afford this model, Qu said. First, resource reserves are limited. China's per capita water availability is only a quarter of the world average; per capita land area is only one-third of the global level; and per capita mineral resources only account for half the world average. With population growth and economic development, the shortage of resources will only become more acute. If measures are not taken to raise efficiency, production costs will rise and industrial development will be handicapped, Qu said. The environment has become an important concern in the world. Pollution control and environmental protection regulations have been included in many international trade laws, with possible sanctions against nations with poor environmental performances. And China, increasingly dependent upon foreign trade, must abide by international laws. Qu suggested that China speed up its industrial, structural reshuffle and technological renovation to reduce pollution. One method would be to increase the number of nonpolluting industries, such as the service sector. Another method would be to reduce the consumption of energy and raw materials. Pollutants should be recycled, treated or stored to create a more efficient consumption. Qu also called for increased government funding to fight pollution because environmental protection has become very costly. The government should try to allocate 1 to 1.5 percent of its GNP to protecting the environment. Presently the figure is only 0.7 percent. And environmental investment is very profitable. For every 100 yuan of investment, 600 yuan of profit could be generated. The State might not be able to afford the increased expenditures, Qu said, but spending cuts should come from other portions of the budget to finance environmental protection. More money earmarked for industrial projects should be given to environmental protection. The government should demand that 8 to 10 percent of new industrial investment go to environmental protection, instead of the present 4.5 percent. The government can also raise standards for pollutant discharge, Qu said, adding that low standards partly explain why many businesses are not eager to fight pollution. The government needs to adjust financial policies to make it easier for the environmental protection projects to get bank loans.
