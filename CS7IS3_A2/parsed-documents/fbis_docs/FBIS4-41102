The specialists from the Russian Coal and Raw Material Mutual [sovmestnyy] Bank have found a way out of the apparent deadlock. The first "industrial experiment" has already shown the high degree of effectiveness of the decisions which have been found. A financial chain linked the "Vorkutaugol" association, the Novyy Lipetsk metallurgical combine, the Vyksa pipe welders, and the transport workers and oil extraction workers. A clearing accounts procedure has been developed for each enterprise. Nonetheless it is still too early to rejoice. The country is in acute need of modern financial legislation. A realistic way out of the situation is the creation of financial and industrial groups. In the coal industry this process has already begun. In the opinion of specialists, the profitability of "buying and selling" operations is receding into the past. Life has shown that the future of the economy and its normalization belong to the producers.
