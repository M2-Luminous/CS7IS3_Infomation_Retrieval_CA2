North Korea sent a message to Hans Blix, director general of the IAEA, yesterday [1 December], a day before the meeting of governors of the IAEA is held, and showed a negative response by saying that it cannot accept the overall inspection at present. The IAEA said that it had received a reply message from North Korea in connection with its 24 November message urging the North Korean side to accept the overall inspection, but the contents of the message shows that there is no change at all in its previous position that it would only allow the change of monitoring equipment. Also, IAEA authorities say that the IAEA may declare North Korea as a country that has not fulfilled the Nuclear Safeguard Accords unless it allows access to experts of the suspected nuclear facilities. An IAEA official said the IAEA has no other choice than to refer the North Korean issue for the second time to the UN Security Council around the end of this year.
