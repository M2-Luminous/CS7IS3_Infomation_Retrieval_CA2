A communique issued by the Quirinale [president's office] explained that Napolitano was received by Scalfaro in accordance with Article 88 of the Constitution. Essentially, Scalfaro heard him, as the constitutional document stipulates, before dissolving parliament. Napolitano has not made any statement. He limited himself to saying that he did not know the date of the election, and that it would be chosen by the government. He was asked if elections would be held on 20 March, since Jews have reportedly been assured that elections will not clash with Passover.
