Speaking at a one-day seminar on future of oil and foreign policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, he said that the oil supply and demand at the international markets have undergone strategic and relatively wide-scale changes. He said oil producing countries which were highly dependant on the crude oil revenues in the last decade, suffered heavily due to the oil prices fluctuations. OPEC production output rose from 14 million BPD in 1985 to the current 23 million BPD without tangible rise in the revenues of the member states, Velayati said. However, he added, the European Union countries had a total revenue of dlrs. 200 billion from 11.8 million barrels of oil they consumed in the last year alone. "This is three times as much as the amount earned through the export of the similar volume of oil by the oil exporting countries, i.e. dlrs. 74 billion." Citing another example Velayati said Italian tax revenues from the two million barrels of oil the country consumed last year, were equal to the total revenues of Saudi Arabia of selling daily 8 million barrels of crude oil. He elsewhere noted that the prospect of the world energy consumption concerning oil and other substitute energies does not show a significant change at least in the next two decades, and that oil will remain the only existing source of energy. On the gas exports Velayati said Iran is aware of the importance of establishing a gas pipeline to Europe, adding that the Islamic Republic is willing to mount efforts in this regard in a manner that joint interests of Iran, Russia and European consumers are ensured.
