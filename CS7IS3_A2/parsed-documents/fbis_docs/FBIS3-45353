The Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Lu Ping, was quoted yesterday as saying Beijing had already responded to the British side's recent concern over financial arrangements for the new airport. After meeting Mr. Lu in Beijing, the spokesman for the Junior Chamber of Commerce, Ng Man-kun, quoted the official as saying China had yet to receive feedback on its reply to the Government. But he said Mr. Lu "did not go into detail about what their response was". A Government spokesman said last night: "We have not seen Mr. Lu's precise remarks and as both the Governor and the Financial Secretary said last week, the right place to discuss these issues is within the Airport Committee. "We have been pressing the Chinese side for a meeting but have had no response. We have also called for expert talks on land matters and again we have had no response." Financing of the new airport has been deadlocked since August's Airport Committee meeting. It is understood the Government has held a number of informal discussions with the Chinese side. Legislator Samuel Wong Ping-wai, who convenes the Legislative Council Airport Committee, urged both sides to release more information about the financial arrangements. "The fund is the money of Hong Kong people," he said. According to Mr. Ng, Mr. Lu had again accused the Government of mixing politics with business by refusing to send officials to Beijing to explain the Airport Corporation Bill to the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). "Mr. Lu said he had read the contents of the bill several times but there were many things he could not understand and things that were unclear," he said. "Therefore, he hoped the PWC, being the main adviser to the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), could be more familiar with it." The Government is to decide tomorrow on which funding proposal will be submitted to the Legislative Council. The funding proposals -- either a $377 million suggestion to retain the operations of the Provisional Airport Authority (PAA) or a $1.6 billion proposal to keep the PAA and urgent airport projects going -- will be tabled during the Finance Committee meeting on Friday. Meanwhile, the controversial partial political reform bill passed the Legislative Council bills committee yesterday and is now headed for final approval.
