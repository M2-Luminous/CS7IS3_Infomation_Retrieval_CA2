The U.S. Group AT&T Would Be The Ideal Partner"; as released by Bern ATSA/SDAA database] [Text] Zurich, 11 Feb (ATS) -- Ascom, the Bern-based telecommunications group is facing serious difficulties. However, it still has one chance to avoid the worst. If it fails to seize this opportunity, this will mean the end of the Swiss telecommunications industry. Mr. Heinrich Steinmann, member of both the management of the Union of Swiss Banks and the board of directors at Ascom, affirmed this in an interview published in the economic weekly "CASH". If Ascom does not succeed in turning the page, it will find itself in the hands of major companies and will cease to exist as an independent group. In his capacity as committee member of the board of directors and as president of the Hasler Foundation, which owns a majority stake in Ascom, Mr. Steinmann feels that he is facing a major challenge. He must come up with a corporate strategy that everyone will understand, and which proves feasible. New Strategy With the help of the McKinsey consulting company, a market-based strategy has been developed. This strategy is based on three main pillars: telecommunications, corporate networks, and the automation of services. Sectors were selected in these three areas where Ascom can obtain a market share of over 25 percent, stated Mr. Steinmann. All the rest will be liquidated or sold. In the future, the group will be strictly managed according to the needs of its customers. The time devoted to the development and production of each product will have to be considerably reduced. At present, Ascom depends on the Swedish Ericsson group for public telecommunications. The Bern-based company is good, but a fair portion of the know-how involved comes from Sweden, noted Mr. Steinmann. In the long term this sector will have to be given up to Ericsson, bit by bit. Becoming World Champion The strength of Ascom lies in its conventional telephones, small exchanges, and cordless telephones. Here, both the quality and design are good. In addition, Ascom's telephones are user-friendly. Ascom must become "world champion" in man's contact with the system. However, in order to do this, it will have to make considerable progress. In this respect, collaboration with the U.S. telecommunications giant AT&T would be ideal. AT&T cannot sell its telephones in Europe, because they were designed specifically for and in accordance with the taste of U.S. consumers. However, it could take over Ascom's telephones. Should a group of this type open up its market, this would represent a tremendous opportunity for Ascom. Chairmanship Not Targeted Mr. Steinmann specified that he was not targeting the chairmanship of Ascom's board of directors, led by Mr. Heinz Frey, which is currently under tremendous pressure. It is up to Mr. Frey to decide what he wants to make of his chairmanship. Ascom's board of administration and the founding board of the Hasler Foundation should clearly support Mr. Frey. Should either of these two bodies indicate doubts regarding Mr. Frey, then the chairman-in-office would probably have to take the consequences.
