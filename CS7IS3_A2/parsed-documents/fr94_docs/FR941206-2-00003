FR941206-2-00003 FR941206-2-00002 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of the Census [Docket No. 941117&hyph;4317] Annual Retail Trade Survey AGENCY: Bureau of the Census, Commerce. ACTION: Notice of Determination. SUMMARY: In accordance with Title 13, United States Code, Sections 182, 224, and 225, I have determined that the Census Bureau needs to collect data covering annual sales, year-end inventories, purchases, and accounts receivables to provide a sound statistical basis for the formation of policy by various government agencies. These data also apply to a variety of public and business needs. This annual survey is a continuation of similar retail trade surveys conducted each year since 1951 (except 1954). It provides, on a comparable classification basis, annual sales, purchases, and accounts receivable balances for 1994, and year-end inventories for 1993 and 1994. These data are not available publicly on a timely basis from nongovernmental or other governmental sources. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald Piencykoski or Dorothy Engleking on (301) 763&hyph;5294. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Census Bureau is authorized to take surveys necessary to furnish current data on the subjects covered by the major censuses authorized by Title 13, United States Code. This survey will provide continuing and timely national statistical data on retail trade for the period between economic censuses. The 1992 Economic Censuses are currently being tabulated. The data collected in this survey will be within the general scope and nature of those inquiries covered in the economic census. The Census Bureau will require a selected sample of firms operating retail establishments in the United States (with sales size determining the probability of selection) to report in the 1994 Annual Retail Trade Survey. We will furnish report forms to the firms covered by this survey and will require their submissions within thirty days after receipt. The sample will provide, with measurable reliability, statistics on the subjects specified above. This survey was cleared by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act, Public Law 96&hyph;511, as amended, and was cleared under OMB Control No. 0607&hyph;0013. We will provide copies of the form upon written request to the Director, Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233. Based upon the foregoing, I have directed that an annual survey be conducted for the purpose of collecting these data. Dated: November 18, 1994. Martha Farnsworth Riche, Director, Bureau of the Census. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;29944 Filed 12&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;07&hyph;P
