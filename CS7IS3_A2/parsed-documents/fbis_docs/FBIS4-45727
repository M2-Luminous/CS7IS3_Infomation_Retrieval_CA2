The environment and agriculture departments unveiled 72 Vulnerable Zones, covering 1.6 million acres, in which farmers will have to modify their use of manure, fertilisers and sludge to curb nitrates leaking into rivers and the sea. Many of the areas are in East Anglia, where drinking water samples sometimes fail European standards. Thirty three areas were also announced where water companies will have to fit sewage treatment works with anti-phosphate pollution equipment. They cover Windermere and the rivers Avon, Test, Blackwater and Nene.
