The present conference, the top Russian diplomat noted, is yet another attempt to "tackle seriously the extremely dangerous manifestations of aggressive nationalism, xenophobia, ethnic and religious intolerance". Russian foreign minister reiterated that the initiative to organize this conference concerned nine states of Central and Eastern Europe which agreed to it. They are preparing to become members of the European Union and wish to discuss the problems connected with the condition of national minorities and fraught with possible complications. It is quite natural, Andrey Kozyrev said, to seek to link this work to the context of the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and rely on support from the countries participating in the all-European process. "Certainly, within this framework Russia is prepared to make its own contribution in such a form which will be considered expedient," the Russian foreign minister elaborated. He believes that the main thing is that the chosen negotiating model -- the organizing of regional tables -- should not lead to duplication, to weakening of the existing international institutions and negotiating mechanisms but concentrate on concrete steps for the establishment of inter-ethnic relations and the guarantees of the rights of national minorities. "This is particularly necessary for the three Baltic states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. The problem of national minorities is inseparable from the general establishment of goodneighborly relations, the Russian minister said, and the work on the "Pact on Stability in Europe" is to become yet another contribution to the formation of unified Europe of partnership and prosperity which must succeed not only Cold War but also uncertainty of the post-confrontation period. In this context, he noted, discussing of issues related to state borders just as national minorities, should be held exclusively within the framework established by the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "The enhancement of the effectiveness of the CSCE and its transformation into a supreme political organization on the European continent is a key element of the concept of the all-European partnership put forward by Russia," Andrey Kozyrev stressed. The head of the Russian foreign office expressed hope that the forthcoming summit meeting will strengthen a special role of the CSCE and its responsibility for the general development of European affairs. In the near future, he said, Russia will submit comprehensive and concrete proposals on these issues. The merit of the present Paris conference, the minister emphasised, is that this forum is considering the problems of stability "from the angle of democracy and human rights but not in the military context". At the same time, he noted, military and political aspects must find its place in the course of wider efforts. In this connection Andrey Kozyrev dwelt on mutual relations between Russia and NATO. Russia, he said, will join "the Partnership for Peace" program and sign a corresponding framework document with NATO along with a substantial program of cooperation which certainly will reflect a special role of Russia as a nuclear power". "We stand for the deepening of equal partnership between Russia and NATO without mutual vetoes and surprises," the foreign minister accentuated. Andrey Kozyrev expressed confidence that the Conference on Stability in Europe would be an important link in the process of forming the all-European future which may become a reality only with the help of joint efforts by all states.
