The ministry will submit a bill to revise the Food Control Law this fall to the extraordinary session of the Diet. It will propose introducing more market forces to production and marketing of rice, the country's staple grain. Although the key framework of the system will be left unchanged, the new law will allow farmers to grow as much rice as they like, oblige the government to stockpile rice in case of emergency and ease regulations on rice marketing. The sources said the ministry's steps were forced by a rapidly changing situation in Japan's rice market in recent years. The Uruguay Round trade pact, completed last December, requires Japan to buy foreign rice. The country also suffered its worst rice harvest in the postwar era last year due to poor weather, prompting consumers to panic in search of domestic grains. Furthermore, more rice has been traded on the black market, out of government-approved channels. The Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory body to the prime minister, will draw up an interim report on the future of Japan's agriculture and food control system in late July for the government to formulate a revised Food Control Law. In the revision, the second since the law was enacted in 1942, rice growers will be allowed the option of not reducing their rice-planting acreage. Currently, farmers are forced to cut their rice acreage every year in line with the government's annual plan for rice supplies. The revised law would call for state stockpiling of rice, in order to respond to public criticism that scant government reserves bear part of the blame for the recent rice panic. The details of the planned stockpiling have yet to be worked out, but the sources said the ministry is considering increasing state stockpile to 650,000 tons by October 1995 and 1.3 million tons by October 1996. At the end of October last year, only 230,000 tons were reserved in government warehouses. The Japanese rice year starts in November and ends in October. The sources said the overhaul will take into account calls from rice growers to allow them to sell their products freely, citing possible difficulties in stable supplies. Instead, the ministry plans to boost "jishu ryutsu mai" rice, which rice growers can sell directly to the market, not through the government. Also being considered is a more flexible licensing to would-be rice wholesalers and retailers, they said.
