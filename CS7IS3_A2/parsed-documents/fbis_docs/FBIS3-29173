Fujii told reporters that he served as an adviser to the organization, Enyu-kai, when he was elected as a member of the House of Councillors in 1977. He left the post in August 1993 when he became finance minister. Fujii said his two designated political groups accepted the donation on August 11 as a bonus for his longtime service to the organization but dealt with the money properly. Fujii said he has always tried not to confuse his ministerial position with accepting such donations, and "to avoid misunderstanding," he has paid back the money. The YOMIURI SHIMBUN, the nation's leading national daily, said it questioned Fujii's office February 4 about the donation and later learned that the office returned the donation to the Enyu-kai on February 5. The Enyu-kai has since returned all the money to the companies which donated it, the daily said. Fujii, a longtime adviser to the Association of Salt Dealers Cooperatives and a former member of the Liberal Democratic Party, is a member of Shinseito, one of the ruling coalition parties. The Enyu-kai office is located in the Tokyo headquarters of the association. Salt is sold in Japan under a monopoly operation by the salt division of Japan Tobacco Inc. A report from the Tobacco Industries Council has recommended that the salt monopoly be abolished but such a move would hurt many small wholesalers who are members of the Enyu-kai, the YOMIURI said.
