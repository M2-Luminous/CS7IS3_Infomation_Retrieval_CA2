This indicates that for the first time, an aircraft model developed and manufactured by China has qualified for civil aviation. Obtaining a certificate of quality according to the rules of airworthiness is indispensable for any aircraft model to gain permission for civil aviation. China has been batch producing the Yun-8 since 1980 and added them to its military equipment. In 1989, the former Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry and relevant departments decided to provide Yun-8 planes to airline companies as cargo planes and demanded that the original model be improved and rebuilt so that it would meet various civil plane requirements. By the end of 1989, the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory officially applied to the CAGAC for a certificate of quality for the improved model of Yun-8 plane. Over the past four years, the CAGAC airworthiness department has conducted serious examinations of the Yun-8 civil cargo plane and its Chinese-built engine and propeller, according to the relevant Chinese civil aviation regulations. China's aviation industries have invested considerable capital in the organization of the Shaanxi Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and relevant enterprises and have conducted a lot of analyses, experiments, and test flights to check the aircraft's airworthiness. The Yun-8 civil cargo plane's certificate of quality has opened up a bright future for itself in the civil air cargo service market. This medium-range cargo plane, built into a medium-sized model, has a maximum loading capacity of 16 metric tons of consolidated cargo or 20 metric tons of bulk freight. The plane has excellent taking-off and landing functions, which allow it to take off or land on airstrips, grasslands, gravel, or sandy roads. Two Jiefang brand trucks can directly drive into the plane's spacious cargo bay from its back door.
