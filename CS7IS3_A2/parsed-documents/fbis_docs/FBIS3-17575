Golembiovskiy: "Boris Yeltsin: Passions Must Not Be Further Intensified. Russian President Speaks on Telephone With IZVESTIYA Chief Editor"] [Text] On the morning of 25 March the editorial office telephoned Sochi, where the Russian president is completing his brief vacation. The transcript of Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin's conversation with Igor Golembiovskiy follows. [Golembiovskiy] Boris Nikolayevich, hello. Pardon me for calling you so early, but we were afraid it would be harder to talk to you later. The first question I would like to ask you is extremely trivial, but it has political undertones today: How is your health? [Yeltsin] First, I must tell you that I am, regrettably, beginning to get accustomed to speculation about my health starting up as soon as I go on vacation. I feel normal [chuvstvuyu sebya normalno]. I have not been seeing my doctors, I have not been going to Matsesta.... I have been working -- I have a lot of mail, a lot of documents, I have been reading, writing, and meeting people. But I have, of course, also been relaxing. I have been swimming and going for walks: There has not been much tennis, the weather has been disappointing, the court was wet, but over the last few days it has dried out and I have played. In a word, there are no signs of illness. Talk of illness is just another provocation. [Golembiovskiy] I cannot fail to ask how you regard the appearance of the so-called "Scenario No. 1" document, if I can use the old terminology. All the mass media are writing and talking about it, and "Scenario No. 2" has appeared. Is political life in the country reaching a new acute pitch? It is strange that the security services are still unable to say anything intelligible either about the authors or the sources of this material. [Yeltsin] First, this smacks of provocation. Second, you are right, unfortunately. The relevant services have proved powerless, although they were given instructions straightaway; however, I still do not have any precise information today. [Golembiovskiy] Of late you have noticeably distanced yourself from the democrats and radical reformers as if you were choosing a new role for yourself as the voice of the interests of all strata of society, not just the political forces whose objectives and convictions you hold dear. Are you not afraid that the upshot will be that, on the one hand, you will not win supporters among the opposition and, on the other, you will lose support among the democratic strata? Lastly, won't there be too high a price to pay for concessions to conservative forces, namely the abandonment of the reforms? [Yeltsin] First of all I cannot agree with what you call my "distancing myself" from anyone whatsoever. I prefer another, more precise definition -- broadening the spectrum of cooperation. The complex, crisis situation in Russia and the events of the last few months have revealed two trends in our political life. On the one hand, once again we have the clear polarization of the political forces. The voices of those people who are calling for us to leap backward or forward in a single bound ring loudly in the ears. On the other hand, there is more and more understanding and a desire to organize cooperation and build bridges. These sentiments are being reinforced among political movements and parties of the most diverse orientations. As president I have no right to ignore and disregard this. Following the period of confrontation there is finally a chance of making the mood of cooperation and accord the determining factor. Precise, thorough, patient work is essential here. Passions must not be further intensified. At the same time I share your disquiet regarding the price of compromise. Can it be achieved, can cooperation be established and the course of reform preserved at the same time? It was this question that was one of the main ones when work on the presidential message was under way. And I believe that an answer has been found. The main idea of the message -- strengthening the state on the basis of the Constitution -- is cherished by everyone whose common sense has not failed them, everyone who has a sincere interest in Russia's well-being. This is also a platform for cooperation and for deepening reform, and not for turning back the clock. My position is as follows: If you share the spirit of the message, we will find a common language; if not, don't resort to demagoguery, don't divert Russia's citizens from the course toward accord. [Golembiovskiy] Many political observers are extremely skeptical about the prospects for the rapid signing of an accord document -- the opposing sides' interests are too polarized. Do you believe that political reconciliation is indeed feasible? How will events develop, how will you, the president, act if that does not happen and disputes over the document do not defuse but, on the contrary, aggravate the situation? [Yeltsin] Needless to say, the agreement on civil peace is not a panacea. I have been around a long time and I am not so naive as to expect the agreement to resolve all the problems. But I am convinced that it can be a step toward this. Especially since the range of political forces which have voiced a desire to work on the agreement is quite broad. The question is: How far will we be able to go down this road, will we stop at formulating a declaration of good intentions or will we be able to take another important step and determine the fundamental bases of accord, the forms of cooperation, and, most important, the mechanisms of our responsibility to society. I hope we will be able to achieve that. If we do not, I will suggest other options. I will not lose heart. I feel that the main demand now being voiced by people and by all strata of society is that stability is strengthened and our life rendered more peaceful. [Golembiovskiy] How would you define the essential nature of the present stage in the economic reform? Which way is the Russian economy heading? Both under Gaydar and under Chernomyrdin we seem to be managing the economy as though blind, and there is still the feeling that we do not have a reform program and have not defined the priorities, hence the inconsistency and mutually exclusive measures. This could all end badly, and it is no wonder that people are forecasting a "spring offensive of the working people" when the country will be living not "from one wage packet to the next" but "from one strike to the next." What are your views on that? [Yeltsin] It has to be acknowledged that the pace of real reform has clearly slowed down and the state's role in deepening the reform is negligible. You can damp down the crisis by means of flexible measures, even timely measures, of course. But you cannot overcome it and transform the economic mechanism that way. As for whether it is a government of reform or not -- you can only judge that from whether the reform itself is working and what its results are. That being so, the government still has considerable reserves and is obliged to use them energetically, just as it is obliged to ensure control of the situation and, above all, extricate the economy from the crisis of nonpayments. As for living "from one strike to the next," all that can be avoided if we learn how to properly elaborate economic policy, anticipate its social consequences, including the negative consequences, and ease the burden of the reform. To be blunt, that is a complex task but not an impossible one. [Golembiovskiy] Recently politicians and state figures of various persuasions in Russia have been increasingly persistently talking about the need to create some kind of new union on the territory of the CIS. Some see this as a manifestation of Russia's imperial ambitions, others as economic expediency (which is also being disputed), while yet others predict new cataclysms across the whole territory of the former USSR. Is a new unification possible in principle? And who will make the final decisions -- presidents, parliaments, or peoples? [Yeltsin] I would like to rephrase your question -- is a complete disunification in the area of the former USSR possible in principle? I believe that life itself has answered that question. It is impossible because it would lead to a sharp lowering of the survivability threshold of each of our countries. It is impossible because it is contrary to the interests of the peoples and their ideas about a normal life. And if that is so, it changes the question -- it is necessary to find the optimum, the most painless, and least conflictual form of cohabitation. And, of course, avoid all adventures. No matter what people now say about the former Union, I cannot call it the most successful form of the existence of our states and peoples. After all, it was sustained primarily by Russia's potential and resources. It is already being forgotten that for a long time today's independent states were called nothing less than "backward boondocks." We even took pride in the fact that they almost overtook Russia in a very short time. Admittedly, as a rule it was not the done thing to consider at what expense this was achieved. Russia's position was extremely unsatisfactory. It did not have its own aspect or statehood. It seemed to have blended in with the background as it supported the former Union at the cost of its own prosperity, with the result that its own problems were the last to be resolved. I am convinced that this model of life is completely outmoded now. Today there can be no going back to that. As for the rapprochement of the states, that has to happen on the basis of a mutual consideration of interests in which Russia's interests are paramount for us. It is hardly possible today to plan in detail how each step in that rapprochement will be formulated politically and legally. But I am bound to agree that Russia's position on this question must be more active, purposeful, progressive, and, if you will, passionate. Especially when we are talking about the fate of our fellow countrymen. [Golembiovskiy] At the meeting with chief editors you said that, aside from everything else, you wanted to devote the period before the 1996 elections to preparing a worthy successor to yourself. I realise that today is not the time to mention a specific name, but do you know of such a person? This question is relevant today because several people, Rutskoy among them, have already announced their claims to the post of future president of Russia. [Yeltsin] First of all I am deeply convinced that the Russian presidential elections must be a truly nationwide event [vsenarodnyye]. There can be no deviations from this fundamental principle of Russian democracy. Attempts are being made to deprive the country's citizens of this right. This is a mine of tremendous destructive power laid under Russian statehood. Second, I am well aware of the desire of certain political circles to artificially destabilize the situation. To call a spade a spade, what they want is to overthrow the president at any price. Such adventures are founded on a thick tissue of lies, baseness, and greed. I want to warn everyone, and journalists first of all -- do not believe the rumors that are being circulated, do not succumb to provocation. I can disabuse these people -- all their schemes will be exposed in the early stages and we have sufficient forces to take appropriate measures to preserve and strengthen stability in Russia. As for the presidential elections, I am working on the assumption that they are to take place in 1996. I am now closely monitoring the activity of potential candidates for the supreme state post. There have been some disappointments and, as they say, some pleasant surprises, too. The parliamentary elections taught us all something. I can now say with a great degree of confidence that if in the 1996 elections the people show their inherent wisdom and perspicacity, then a truly worthy individual and state figure will be elected to the post of president. [Golembiovskiy] One final question. Boris Nikolayevich, what are your immediate plans on your return to Moscow? [Yeltsin] I am returning Sunday, and Monday I shall resume my duties in full. On 28 March I am meeting with Nursultan Abishevich Nazarbayev, this is an important meeting for both states. But as for the immediate period ahead, I have three major issues in addition to my current work. They are -- work on the mechanism and levers for implementing the presidential Message. Second -- the problem of the budget. I had a meeting here in Sochi with Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, we examined my observations and corrected certain positions, although questions remained. The budget, as you know, has been sent to the Duma, and we will work on it further. The third issue is the document on civil accord -- for me this is a most important matter which, in my view, will determine the political health of society. [Golembiovskiy] Thank you, Boris Nikolayevich, and I wish you a happy return.
