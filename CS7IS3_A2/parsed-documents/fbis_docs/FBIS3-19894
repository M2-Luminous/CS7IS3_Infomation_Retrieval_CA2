After the center in St. Petersburg and another in Moscow, it will be the third permanent institution in Russia intended to retrain former Russian officers with German help and prepare them for a civilian career. If everything works according to plan, then some 700 people will go through the Moscow center each year and receive commercial and computer training. The Central Institute is part of a purely bilateral program between Germany and four countries of the former Soviet Union: Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. It is funded by the Federal Government with a total of 200 million German marks [DM]. With this program and a housing-construction scheme, Bonn has supported the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from the new laender since 1991. In 1991, the Russian Government published alarming figures, according to which some 50,000 officers would resign from military service each year until 1995. To this one must add the approximately 30,000 soldiers who will return home from Germany in August 1994 and will no longer serve in the Army. Apart from the other two institutes in Russia and one each in Belarus and Ukraine, the ZIKWOK is the fifth functioning retraining center in the former Soviet Union. At the end of the year, when the German support program will expire, 14 centers should be able to offer training and retraining independently: nine in Russia, three in Ukraine, one in Belarus -- near Minsk, and one in Kazakhstan -- near Almaty. About 7,000 former officers per year will then undergo a crash course in economics in 25 different careers. At the same time, retraining seminars are being held in the garrisons of the CIS forces in the new laender, which have so far been attended by 12,822 officers. After a public competition, a working group, headed by the German consulting company Gopa (Corporation for Organization, Planning, and Training), which is based in Bad Homburg, was commissioned to implement this program of the Reconstruction Bank and what was then the Soviet Labor Ministry. Another retraining program is supported by the European Union with 12 million ECU (some DM23 million) as part of the program for technical assistance for the new independent states (TACIS: Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of New Independent States). With these funds, 16,000 officers who are resigning from military service are to be trained within the next three years in the field of Western marketing and management in the republics of the former Soviet Union.
