The treasury is faced with deficits, the investment policy is not working, industrial bankruptcies are on the increase, and the process of economic recovery has been aborted. This state of affairs is partially explained by absence of economic reforms, political instability, and breakdown of commercial relations with the former Soviet republics. In my view, however, the primary fault lies with improper developmental and financial priorities. For example, in 1989 87 percent of Ukrainian farms made a profit of 30 percent or better; in 1992 only a fourth of them did. On the surface the problems appear insurmountable, but are they really? The March 1993 currency emission of 1.2 billion karbovantsi gave a 803 billion karbovantsi credit to the agricultural sector. Unfortunately, the credit was squandered across the board rather than directed at the remaining productive collective, state and private farms that can still show a profit. Although the number of private farms in Ukraine has already exceeded 25,000, the average size is only 15 hectares and most are about two hectares. Obviously, such farms have a limited profit potential and cannot make a serious contribution to the national economy. In his time Stolypin saw Ukrainian future as a land of 100 hectare farms. In the U.S. an average farm has 187 arable hectares and in Germany 77. What can Ukraine accomplish with an average of 15 hectares? The fact that only a small percentage of the farms is profitable need not be discouraging. This is the case in most countries. In the U.S., for example, 52.4 percent of the farms are weekend farms or farms that barely make a profit or operate at a loss. The average income from such farms stands at $930 a year. The real income is generated by the 13.9 percent highly profitable farms that feed the nation and provide industry with raw materials. In addition, the U.S. treasury makes more than forty billion dollars a year from agricultural exports. The following facts can be used to assess efficiency of our farms. For example, in the Brusyliv Rayon of Zhytomyr Oblast Volodymyr Stadchenko runs a very efficient farm consisting of 60 hectares of arable land. To feed the entire rayon, only two such farms would be needed. The entire oblast could be fed by some 50 farms, and all of Ukraine by 1250. If we could but concentrate our attention on some 5000 farms and provide them with full financial support, young stock, high quality seeds, and the latest in agrotechnology and education we could get rid of many of our problems. I have the impression that the present minister of agriculture is heading in this direction. Concomitantly, Ukraine must restructure its credit-granting and financial systems so as to enhance productivity and production. Consider average wages: in Ukraine it comes to $7 a month and in Germany $21.3 an hour. The hourly wages in France are $15.2, in Italy $16.2, and then follow Portugal --$3.5, South Korea -- $4.1, Singapore -- $3.7, Hong Kong -- $3.2, and Poland -- $2.7. Prices of sugar, meat, butter, gas, gasoline, electricity, housing and services have approached -- and in some cases exceeded -- world prices, while our government has not seen fit to increase wages. Frankly, the people feel that they are merely the chattel of a bureaucratic-mafia cabal rather than builders of an independent and sovereign Ukraine. The majority of laws passed in Ukraine are unenforced and exist only on paper. Issuance of housing, industrial and real estate "Privatization Certificates" has been scheduled but not implemented. What value will they have if they cannot be purchased, sold, or transferred as a gift or inheritance? What we need are certificates that have commercial value and can be freely traded and exchanged to create funds in lieu of money. Since they will be unsuitable for commercial transactions they will be unlikely to affect productivity. Ukraine needs a national currency, but its introduction is beset with difficulties. Our economic problems, lack of gold reserves, shortage of industrial goods, and of a stabilizing fund in the amount of two billion dollars demands a novel approach since we cannot wait until these roadblocks are overcome. Further, I believe a national currency has to be introduced in a stepwise manner to maintain its value. Initially the hryvnya should be limited to certain sectors of the economy such as agriculture, gas and oil industry and railways. The hryvnya should have been introduced at the time of the 1993 harvest for gas and oil purchases, while the railway industry should have been included because of its massive size and stability. Thus, for a time two currencies would coexist: a convertible hryvnya and free-floating kupon, with the hryvnya establishing its own sphere of influence and stability. In 1993 the need for hryvnya was acute since we had to buy gasoline, salt, oil, mineral fertilizers, etc. for world prices while the price for hard wheat was set at 362-600,000 karbovantsi a tonne -- or $60 at the old exchange rate -- while the world price was $240. How can we expect our farmers to sell their products to the state at a quarter of the world price? And if they don't, will we have to buy these products abroad? The first order of business should be to instill in the farmers a sense of confidence in Ukraine and the introduction of the hryvnya is a step in the right direction. Successful introduction of the hryvnya will also depend on creating the right conditions for its support. One priority is to reduce the size of the military establishment -- over a million men in the army, navy, national guard, border guards, security service and other formations -- which in proportion to the general workforce exceeds that of any other country. Ukraine has 2800 military airplanes while England has 1500, Germany 1350, Italy 840 and France 1550. Then there are thousands of modern tanks, strategic missiles... What country has the economy to support all this? A rational review of the military doctrine should save us 500-700 million dollars. A second priority is exporting grain, which in 1993 could have earned us 450-500 million dollars. A third priority would be to utilize the productive might of the military-industrial complex in which a karbovanets-kupon equals a dollar or, in some cases, five dollars. The income derived from such sources could be on the order of two to three billion dollars. A fourth priority is the creation of a tax base to support the hryvnya. All industrial sectors have to be taxed without exception. For example, the metallurgical complex in Kryvyy Rih has been working at 100 percent capacity since April 1993 and its production has been on the increase as a result of the industry getting tax relief. But 70 percent of the metal goes to Russia and the profits are lodged in their banks, while the rest of the Ukrainian industry lacks for metals and the Ukrainian treasury doesn't get a penny from such "close relation." For whose benefit does Kryvyy Rih complex pollute the environment and deplete Ukraine's natural resources? The fifth and last priority in setting our economy aright has to deal with rational use of our energy resources and raw materials. No one yet has reimbursed the state for oil imported in 1992. The oil just disappeared into various mafia-controlled networks. What happened to the oil of the Black Sea fleet? Was it paid for by the dismissal of the Ukrainian naval commander Borys Korzhyn? Finally, the economy will only improve if every aspect of society and production -- land, capital, work, science, technology, intellect, environment -- is recognized as having monetary value. Unless land is sold, work valuated, and the ecologic costs of oil pipelines and terminals computed, it will be impossible to create a Ukrainian market economy.
