The security authorities, however, are continuing to follow the moves of members of foreign embassies who are trying to collect information on Cyprus' defense. Alternate British High Commissioner Colin Jennings visited Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Tasos Panayidhis to explain the presence of British military officers at Larnaca Airport last Sunday [17 April]. According to information from British sources, Jennings claimed that the military officers--two of whom were at the airport with their children--were observing airplanes landing and taking off. According to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation [CyBC], Lieutenant Colonel John Anderson, the British military charge d'affaires, was one of the military officers. He gave his identification to security men when they asked him for it and left the airport. The British claim that Anderson was not at the airport last Sunday, but they have confirmed that he was on a one-week leave of absence from the High Commission. Denying reports by other media, a reliable source explicitly told CyBC that no Cypriot is involved in the case. Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis today told reporters that the government is not handling the case as espionage. According to CyBC's information, foreign missions in Cyprus and Greece have recently embarked on a campaign to collect information on the implementation of the new defense doctrine. The same sources said Cypriot security authorities are trying to limit the efforts of foreign missions to collect information on the National Guard.
