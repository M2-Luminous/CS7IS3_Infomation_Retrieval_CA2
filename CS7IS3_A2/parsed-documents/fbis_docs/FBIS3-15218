At Supreme Soviet's request, the government has drafted proposals regarding changes within the structure of the Council of Ministers and local executive bodies. In my report I would like to both substantiate these proposals and inform you about the government's standpoint on a number of conceptual problems, typical for the transitional period of the state-building process in the Republic. Certain circumstances that are vital for choosing further ways of developing our state demand a more detailed analysis. First: We are standing at a historic crossroads; there is no way back, but neither have we definitely chosen a new path. Speaking about the crossroads in a simplified way, Belarus has to choose its foreign policy orientation between East and West, North and South. Some politicians have been trying to treat this issue rather inflexibly. In the economy, [we should choose] between unrestrained market romanticism with all its deadly consequences and social security for the people; between the [?ruining] of the industrial and agricultural potential and the course of gradual reform directed at building a state with controlled socially oriented market relations. These are the two primary spheres that cause a division of approaches determining the fate of our people and our state. Second: In the sphere of strengthening statehood, stability, and accord in society, there also exist two diametrically different approaches. One approach provides for the destruction of the current basis of the Republic's constitutional structure -- that is, the elimination of the institute of soviets of people's deputies, the adoption of a law on lustration and its introduction into political life. This would amount to a ban on the activities of the left and (?other) parties. Strange as it might seem, there are attempts to politicize the history of the Belarusian nation and to plant Russophobia in the social mentality. The other approach is based on common sense and is advocated by the Supreme Soviet, the government, and an overwhelming majority of our people. It envisions building a democratic state of law and a priority nature of an individual. This kind of state would rule out violence against an individual; and the ideas of national self-awareness would begin to dominate in society, based on historic truth and in concurrence with the political course pursued by the administration and the expectations of a majority of people. I think that nobody will negate the fact that since the Republic won independence and the CIS was formed, the government had to resolve a number of various complicated problems. It was necessary to reduce social losses to a maximum, and safeguard [word indistinct], humanitarian, and moral aspects of reform, as well as the balance between the interests of the Belarusian people and those of other CIS citizens and the world community. This is why we have advocated and will continue to advocate the policy of sober step-by-step reform directed not against, but for the benefit of society. Events and developments in other newly independent states, primarily in Russia, have affected the rate of changes carried out in our country. Both [word indistinct] and Russians are concerned over the problems of civil peace and national accord. We understand perfectly well that if Russia abandons the policy of integration with CIS states, this would inevitably produce political and economic cataclysms in both the Commonwealth states and in Russia. Not only Belarus is aware of threats to civil peace. That is why our ideas to form an economic union and a single financial system have finally become the subject of serious negotiations with the Russian Government, have attracted the attention of other independent states, and have been supported in a recent address by the president of the Russian Federation. It is pleasant to point out that within the framework of the CIS, alienation, economic disintegration, and so-called communal sovereignty are being gradually but ever more steadily replaced with trust, understanding of common geopolitical interests, and a necessity to coordinate industrial and agricultural policies, credit and monetary relations, banking, investment, and finance. Relations with the Russian Federation are undoubtedly the main foreign policy priority for Belarus. This is a well-founded historic choice. It has no alternates because of the community of Russian and Belarusian cultures, the common interests of these fraternal nations, close integration, and former nearness of their industrial potentials and communication space. Addressing those who criticize the foreign policy of the Belarusian Government, I would like to underline once again that Belarus is ardently following the road of reform and building a democratic society, and a sovereign state of law, open for dialogue with all friendly nations. I am sure that we understand the importance of the historic moment experienced by the Republic and cannot tolerate the situation in which nationalism and extremism would prevail over wisdom, and individual rights and freedoms would depend on ethnic origin. Political monopoly of a separate party acting as a prophet on behalf of the entire nation, is inadmissible. In recent years, our society has received a perfect political education and has a good understanding of rhetorics. People do not want political fuss and promises; they want real improvement of their lives, justice, and protection against growing crime. Strong state power enjoying people's trust is the main condition for leading the Republic out of an economic crisis. We have had a chance to see for ourselves that in the period of structural reshaping, the state must not fail to control the economic development. [Words indistinct] that in our Republic, where the overwhelming majority of enterprises and almost the entire agricultural complex are state-run, rapid reform can be spontaneous and not supervised by the state. Control over this complicated process is probably the main condition for a gradual transition to market relations. Proceeding from what I have said, the government believes that the economic situation is complicated. However, our current hardships are to a great extent a result of the high degree of dependence on external factors, and can be attributed to the transition to a new-type economy. There is a way out of the current situation. The fact that the government has not lost control over finance and economy, and has prevented a disastrous decline in production and a destruction of industries and agriculture, gives ground for optimism. Working at the brink of its financial potential, the government has managed to maintain a social security system. As for implementing reforms this year, we believe the following tasks should be undertaken. One should accelerate privatization of small businesses. We are planning to privatize about 50 percent of the enterprises operating in trade and services; to transform about 50 percent of large state-run enterprises into joint stock companies; to hasten work on finishing building of uncompleted facilities. One should also pursue active antimonopoly policies intended to reveal natural and artificial monopolies, their division, and the control over price monopolism. [The government should] support private initiative by removing bureaucratic obstacles and their discriminating policies. The private sector should be developed in the quickest way possible to compensate for the inevitably shrinking production in the state sector, to increase the efficiency of the economy, and to provide jobs for the unemployed labor force. In addition, industries must be prepared to manufacture only those products for which there is a demand. One of the problems that raises the concern of the entire society is economic crimes and corruption. The criminal world is becoming more professional and equipped with modern types of weapons. One cannot help but see that in some CIS countries, organized crime poses an immense threat to their national security and to the course of reforms. In spite of all our mistakes in this extremely sensitive area, let me remind that the government declared combating organized crime as one of its priorities, and toughened measures to counter this evil. First of all, I am talking about the resolutions issued on 24 September and 25 November 1992. At that time, it was an excessive measure, but the government was supported by society and, importantly, by you, esteemed deputies. We appreciate your support and the fact that later on, the government policies found their reflection in laws that you adopted. Also to this end, was government resolution No. 711 curtailing circulation of foreign currencies. This displayed an understanding that the unrestrained circulation of different currencies inflicts substantial damages on the Republic. The crime-ridden situation in the Republic calls for a reform of our law enforcement system, in the first place, the Internal Affairs Ministry and the KGB. It is important that their functions be divided to avoid duplication. At the same time, I am confident that the Internal Affairs Ministry and the KGB should definitely be part of the executive branch, providing implementation of the main task -- security of the state and the protection of its sovereignty and citizens' rights. Combating crime must be an integrated and uncompromising process. In conjunction with other interested parties, the Cabinet of Ministers is completing the preparation of the state program providing for urgent anticrime measures. These measures will allow to substantially increase the efficiency of all law enforcement agencies. The Cabinet of Ministers was given this task yesterday at the Security Council meeting, which will then be examined by the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium and later by the Supreme Soviet Presidium. There is no denying that [words indistinct] tasks [words indistinct] improve the structure of law enforcement agencies as well. However, this is not the most important issue. The key task is to ensure firm governing of the state, strict executive discipline, and unconditional execution of all decisions by government institutions. For this purpose, one should reform power in accordance with [word indistinct] and the objectives, clearly define the scope of competence of power branches, and ensure their genuine independence within legal constrains. Anyone, regardless of position, who violates the law and oversteps legal limits must be held responsible for his actions. This task should be central to the entire judicial and law enforcement system. The fundamental issue raising heated debates in our parliament is the issue concerning the structure of government institutions. The government resolutely stands for introducing the post of president being the head of state and the executive branch. Unfounded are the fears of those who think that this move could lead to a usurpation of power and dictatorship. To avoid this, the draft constitution includes, to my mind, quite an effective system of restrains and counterbalances. It is based on the system of division of legislative, executive, and judicial powers widely accepted throughout the world. Besides, one should not forget that our people experienced dramatic changes in social consciousness over the past years. The people's mentality has changed, and their political activity has increased. Today, we have a pretty high degree of freedom, including political freedom. In my opinion, it is the free people in a democratic and law-governed state that are the guarantor preventing the usurpation of power. The legislative branch should, of course, counterbalance a strong executive branch and independent judicial power. I believe that the new constitution provides for a balance among all these branches. In a bid to make their relations more stable, the authors of the draft proposed that the prime minister, along with his deputies, power ministers, and the president, be appointed and discharged by the Supreme Soviet. Thus, the draft gives the Supreme Soviet control over the government and makes the president accountable to it. The relationship between people and power are the most important in the process of the political and economic reforms which are still under way, even though our opponents claim otherwise. The law on self-government and local economies passed in February 1991 affects, in the most direct way, the rights of citizens, because in their everyday life they have to deal with local authorities, and not the parliament or government. So they care what those authorities should be like, what powers they will have, and to what extent they, the citizens, can influence their decisions. The law has been passed but we already see its faultiness and isolation from the federal system of transformation. This law does not ensure the balance of executive power institutions. This task remains beyond the competence of the Cabinet of Ministers. However, we consider it important to present our point of view. Laws and decisions adopted by the parliament and government are not only often ignored in the hinterland, but meet with hidden and sometimes open resistance. This is caused, first of all, by the lack of a clear system of subordination in the government institutions, vagueness of competence given to executive bodies, and lack of coordination among executive and legislative bodies. Thus we need a fundamental restructuring of local executive power to define the competence of local governments, ensuring more responsibility of government officials for state discipline. What will these representatives of the authorities be called: local soviets, or perhaps some other name? This makes no difference. But there can be some difference. Nevertheless, the local soviets should not perform the functions of local parliaments, that is, the legislative organs which go against the laws of a single unitary state. Life itself shows [words indistinct] which should be changed, should be changed. These are, primarily, the following: the adoption of economic programs and budgets; the establishment of a system of local taxation which should correspond to the law; the granting of tax breaks that are being collected by local budgets; the legal use of natural resources; protection of the environment; the regular election of judges, and an entire range of other issues. At the same time, it makes sense to preserve the soviets or other organs at the level of oblasts, cities, rayons -- except city rayons -- while in the city rayons, workmen's settlements, and rural settlements there should only be the organs of executive power. It is necessary, in our opinion, to promptly reduce the staff of the representative bodies. To strengthen the management potential of the entire executive branch, we think it necessary to elect the chairmen of the local soviets -- who will simultaneously be chairmen of the executive committees -- to carry out the recommendation of the chiefs of the higher organs of the executive branch. By the way, the city executive committees are entitled to choose candidates to run in the elections for chairmen of oblast soviets. The same procedure should be implemented when the chairmen of the oblast soviets are dismissed from their posts. The responsibility of local soviets, especially in the sphere of municipal property, should be streamlined. We have many examples when local soviets, due to their specific activities, have stalled privatization and even the programs of privatization have been adopted with considerable delays from the established terms. We believe that the constitution should highlight the main things concerning local administration and self-administration, while the competence [words indistinct] and the activity of organs of local self-administration should be determined by a special law. Let me now move on to the proposal to upgrade the structure of the Cabinet of Ministers and its organization. Despite the fact that the government has been empowered with specific powers in this sphere, I am grateful to the Supreme Soviet for the understanding of the acute character of the situation. I consider it my duty to inform the Supreme Soviet deputies on the essence of the reorganization which is being carried out. Because we are living through a transition period, we should be aware that the organization of the state power organs cannot immediately receive a proper form. While our statehood is being developed and we are coming closer to the market, there arises the need to set up new organs of power and eliminate old, obsolete ones. Reforming the system of executive power is very important and is the main direction in our policy in the realm of state building. The organization of the Cabinet of Ministers, which was formed by the Supreme Soviet in the summer of 1990, has already undergone some changes. In the past, the Light, Local, and Timber Ministries, the Ministries of Municipal Services, Land Improvement and Water Resources, Construction and Installation and Special Building Works -- that is, seven ministries -- were liquidated. Many functions of these ministries were taken over by independent economic entities -- concerns and associations. In my opinion, two new concerns will be set up on the basis of the Ministry of Industry and Building Materials [as heard] and the Ministry of Building and Exploitation of Motorways. These considerable changes have greatly expanded the functions of some former ministries and departments. This allowed republican and local authorities to adapt to modern conditions. Though this organization has somewhat increased, it does not look as cumbersome as it has in the past. Its staff does not exceed 1.3 percent of the total number of people employed in the national economy, while in Lithuania this percentage is 1.8 and in Ukraine -- 1.4. In fact, in 1993, costs for the maintenance of state bodies in the framework of the overall republican budget stood at 1.21 percent, compared to the 1.31 percent predicted in the budget. The main purpose of reform in the sphere of management is to completely avoid direct administrative centralized pressure on the various domains of economy, to provide opportunities for economic entities to act independently, in other words, to create a qualitatively new system of administration on the basis of global norms. Simultaneously, our task is to preserve state regulation of state property. In the Republic's administrative system, the central place should be given to a ministry. The ministry should actively pursue the government's policy in various spheres and have the widest-possible powers. The ministry should be relieved of operative-administrative functions as much as possible. The number of ministries should not be large, but it should allow for an entire range of issues to be implemented on the macro level. In this regard, it is necessary to strengthen the state administration, to extend the functions of the ministries, and to adopt normative acts. Therefore, the government has already considerably extended the powers of the ministries and departments, has empowered them with greater responsibility in the upgrading of the organization of the central bodies, the management of property, and the setting up of specific funds at the expense of budget and non-budget sources of financing, as well as the development of new forms of employment. I will not speak in detail on the proposed changes. I will only specify the most important ones. First of all, it goes about the restructuring of the State Economic Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance. This is not only a change of title or that we take cognizance of the fashion. [sentence as heard] The problem is that the present status of this department does not correspond to its tasks, does not allow for concentration on the development of nationwide economic programs, to forecast the most important economic processes, and to implement market reforms. In other words, it should become a regulator of the Republic's economic life. The organization and the functioning of this ministry should perform a dual task: On the one hand, it should provide for the management of the entire economic complex, and on the other hand, it should develop economic policy on the path to market reform. To implement this idea, we are planning to set up an independent center of economic reforms within the Ministry of Finance. Economic researchers, managers of enterprises, entrepreneurs, and representatives of other interested parties will participate in the work of this center. Taking into consideration the increase in control over energy resources and the need to concentrate the administration in this sphere in one specific department, we deem it necessary to set up a Ministry of Fuel and Energy on the basis of the Ministry of Energy and the Committee for Energy within the Cabinet of Ministers. Thus, all of the complex issues related to energy and fuel deliveries will be coordinated by one governmental body. We deem it necessary to reform the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations into a corresponding ministry. The increased functions of this foreign economic committee demand that the issue of its status be adequately resolved. This ministry could become one of the key ministries in the sphere of foreign economic relations. It should take into consideration the importance of attracting hard currency and investments to the Republic. To strengthen the power of the Ministry of Finance over the nation's entire financial system, the functions of some state bodies, including the State Inspectorate of Valuables, the State Inspectorate for Insurances [Gosstrakhnadzor], and the State Committee for Minting [Gozznak] are being put under its jurisdiction. The setting up of a state treasury within the Ministry of Finance, to concentrate all the budget means and state non-budget funds, is very important. According to the decision of the Supreme Soviet, the State Committee for State Property is being reformed into the Ministry for State Property and Privatization; the State Committee for Ecology -- to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, with the Department for Protection of Fish on the basis of the Chief Department for Protection and Reproduction of Fish and Control Over Fishing within the Cabinet of Ministers. After the liquidation of the Ministry of Resources, a shareholding association is being set up on its basis. The functions of the Ministry of Grain Products, which is also liquidated, will be performed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Foodstuffs. A Ministry of Culture and Publishing is being set up on the basis of the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Culture. The National State Television and Radio Company is being reformed into the State Committee for Television and Radio. The Committee for Social Protection of Servicemen is being liquidated and its functions will be performed by the Ministry of Culture and Publishing, the State Committee for Labor, and the Defense Ministry. We are planning to set up a Committee for Science and Technology which will be charged with providing for the scientific grounding of economic reforms. In general, we are planning to eliminate 13 ministries and departments. This is almost one fourth of the present number. It is planned to reduce the staff of the central organs of the ministries and departments by 12 percent, or by 800 people. This all represents a savings of 1.5 billion rubles [R] -- in the terms of yearly salaries -- in December 1993 prices. Now I will say some words about the government bodies. Changes in the organization of the state administration naturally lead to a reorganization of government bodies. In connection with this, the functions of [words indistinct] and departments become considerably limited and are primarily handed over to the ministries which have independence in the management of their branches. In accordance to the new approaches and independence, which the ministries will receive, a number of branch departments and sections are being liquidated within the organization of the government bodies. Simultaneously, other bodies will be set up. A Council of Independent Experts will be set up within the Office of the Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers. By the way, this opinion is being supported by the Confederation of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs. In my opinion, this will allow for deeper analysis of the socioeconomic situation, and the government will be able to adopt prompt and precise decisions. New positions corresponding to the new tasks are being introduced, and the role and responsibility of advisers is being increased. The government's press service will be, or, to be more exact, has already been reformed: Today the decree on the government's press service was signed. In general, the staff of the Cabinet of Ministers is being reduced by 10 percent, which represents a savings -- in the terms of yearly salaries -- of R100 million in December 1993 prices. The staff of government bodies will be reduced by one third and will stand at -- I ask you to listen closely to this figure -- some 200 people. I am sure that the reorganization of the bodies of the Cabinet of Ministers will bring new, fresh staff, highly professional and honest people to the new organs. We hope that the implementation of the Law on Service in the state bodies -- effective 1 March 1994 -- will also serve this aim. As for the reduction of staff in oblast, city, and other Soviets, the Supreme Soviet has charged the government with resolving this issue. However, under current legislation, the Cabinet of Ministers has no adequate powers to unify and reduce their staff. Currently, we have a situation whereby, for example, the staff in one oblast executive committee has 150 people more than another. In this connection, the Cabinet of Ministers proposes to discuss this issue either at the Supreme Soviet session or at the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and to develop a unified organization of local authorities on the condition that their staff is reduced by 12-15 percent. Esteemed People's Deputies! I tried to briefly relay the stance of the government on the main issues of the life and activity of our state. I hope that our approach will find mutual understanding among the majority of those who are present here and, as a result, decisions will be adopted which will allow you to more decisively and efficiently build our state, reform the organs of power and administrative, and create a socially oriented market economy. Today, we are living through difficult times. However, we should not dramatize the situation too much. We have the most important and meaningful assets: extremely laborious people and an intelligentsia which is educated, highly intellectual, scientific, and creative. We have definite and noble aims: the creation of a decent standard of living for the Belarusian people, the striving to lead the Republic to well-being and flourishing. To realize these aims, the government will be resolute and uncompromising. Thank you.
