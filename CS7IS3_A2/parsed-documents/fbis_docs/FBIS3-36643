This is how the head of the Russian delegation, special envoy Vasiliy Svirin, assessed its results: [Begin Svirin recording] We note with satisfaction that by joint efforts we managed to achieve substantial progress in the work on the draft treaty on the withdrawal of the Russian troops and conditions of their temporary stay on the territory of the Estonian Republic. At the beginning of this round there were fundamental disagreements with regard to five articles of this treaty. In the course of our work we managed to resolve disagreements on four articles. All this gives us grounds to say that the troop withdrawal treaty can be initialled by the delegations in the very near future. [end recording]
