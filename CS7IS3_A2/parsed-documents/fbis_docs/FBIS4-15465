In an interview with INTERFAX on Thursday, he put the number of such missile carrying aircraft at 42 including 19 TU-160's and 23 TU-95 MC's. The two countries are still at odds about the price. Kiev wants Russia to write off Rbl 700 Bn of its debt, but Moscow agrees to settle for less than a third of that amount. Deinekin said the Russian Defense Ministry could easily order a new batch of aircraft for Rbl 700 Bn at home. He stressed that the Ukrainian bombers had been grounded for quite some time because of shortage of fuel and spare parts and extra spending would be needed to make them airworthy. He regretted that Moscow's attempts to try to help Ukraine to denuclearize itself had failed to meet understanding from the Ukrainian Defense Ministry. At the same time, he hoped further talks will be held in an effort to reach compromise.
