He said he had heard of various ways that North Koreans in Japan were funneling cash into North Korea, but to forcibly cut off such channels could raise the issue of human rights violations and thus required prudent consideration, he said. Hata described various suspicions regarding Pyongyang's nuclear program in an appearance on Fuji TV, including speculation that it is manufacturing weapons or has already done so and that it possesses the same type of atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima by the United States. Japan is ready to make its own assessment of North Korea's nuclear development based on inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and information obtained from the United States, South Korea and China, he said. North Korea still has two facilities that haven't been inspected, the foreign minister reminded. Depending on its future attitude, U.N. sanctions could be imposed, he said. On reports that money sent by Chochongnyon [General Association of Korean Residents in Japan], an organization of ethnic North Koreans and sympathizers, is being poured into Pyongyang's nuclear program, Hata said he had heard figures ranging from tens of million Japanese yen to hundreds of million yen. The money is reportedly carried personally by people returning to North Korea, aboard freight vessels or through Hong Kong and China, said Hata. But such funds are being sent by those who were born in North Korea and think of it as their motherland, he pointed out. Forcibly cutting off the flow, therefore, could raise the problem of human rights violations, he said.
