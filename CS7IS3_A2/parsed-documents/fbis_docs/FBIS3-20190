There is no end in sight to the wave of demonstrations and conflicts. The situation remains highly explosive. [passage omitted] What do our politicians have to say? SPD [Social Democratic Party of Germany] leader Rudolf Scharping told BILD: "The law must be rigorously applied against people who commit acts of violence and go on the rampage in our country." Speaking to BILD, Baden-Wuerttemberg Minister-President Erwin Teufel called for more police to be deployed against terror in the streets: "People who are eligible for military service should be able to serve in the police force as volunteers for a period of 10 years instead of joining fire brigades or disaster relief organizations." They should help the police in the case of demonstrations, large-scale operations, or assist with office work. Teufel also does not exclude the possibility of deploying the Bundeswehr within Germany. "Before I would let the state go to the dogs, I would support using the Bundeswehr as a kind of National Guard within the country, but only with the approval of majority that can alter the constitution."
