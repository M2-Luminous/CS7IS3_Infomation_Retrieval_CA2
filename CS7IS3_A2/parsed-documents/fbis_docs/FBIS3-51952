Deputies; Mr. President of the Honorable Supreme Court of Justice and Messrs. Magistrates; Your Excellencies heads of state and government and Vice Presidents; Your Excellencies and honorable heads of special missions; national, civilian, and military authorities; Mr. Archbishop of Tegucigalpa and bishop of Honduras; Messrs. Representatives of the country's organized groups; special guests; Messrs. Representatives of the local and foreign media; Honduran people: [shouts, applause] This prelude to the third millennium is a unique time in man's history; it is his time of freedom, freedom before nature, because a formidable breakthrough in the development of science has unleashed a spiral of technological miracles that constantly revolutionize our methods of production, life, and thought; freedom so that every nation may seek a better future, because not only have the markets reached world proportions, but, above all, hopes have reached world proportions; freedom for every man and woman to seek their own destiny, because all of the old dogmas have capsized, and the irrepressible tide of freedom has defeated totalitarianism and authoritarianism throughout the world. To state it is a time of freedom is tantamount to saying it is time for great moral decisions; hence, at this very moment mankind has again chosen between civilization and barbarism, between a rational dialogue, as in Central America, the Middle East, and South Africa, and the demential option of a new age of violence, as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Georgia; between the suicide of continuing to extinguish and poison our planet and the clear awareness that either we all survive or no one survives; between the myopic lack of solidarity among nations, such as the myopic decision to drown poor countries with the burden of foreign debt, or to deny them access to the markets of the rich countries, and the lucidity [applause, shouts] the lucidity [repeats himself] of knowing that the poor people of the world will respect no borders pretty soon; between the rarefied air of the government's corruption and the fresh breeze resulting from the moral anger of a citizenry that is ousting, in one country after another, ministers, heads of state, and political regimes. [shouts, applause] It is time for man's freedom, time for great moral options. That is why the moral revolution begins today in Honduras for all our people! [applause, cheers; crowd chants "Reina! Reina! Reina!"] Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution is much more than a campaign slogan. It is the foundation and keystone for building a new Honduras. The moral revolution means values will again be more important than interests and that the people's desires will always prevail over personal interests. The moral revolution means that Honduras is declaring itself of legal age, and its people have chosen to play a leading rather than a supporting role in their own history. The majority--underprivileged until yesterday--has decided to take control of their destiny. [cheers, applause] The moral revolution is a daily, constant effort that should be exerted not only at the government level but also in all of the actions of our public and private life. The moral revolution means all state officials--from the president to the most modest official--will dedicate their efforts to serving the people rather than using their position to get richer and helping their closest friends get richer. [shouts, cheers, applause] The moral revolution means Honduras will truly be a legal state, where the law is the only arbitrator of the people's actions and where the authorities are never able to abuse their power to violate citizens' rights. [shouts, applause, cheers] The moral revolution means placing once again the Honduran woman and man in a prominent position. It means recovering our fellow citizens' personal values and self-esteem. It means all the authorities' actions will be at the service of human development, and that our country's riches and potential are based on the talent, tenacity, and honesty of its people rather than in the abundance of its natural resources. It means recognizing that Honduras is not so much a poor country but a country that has been poorly managed. It means [cheers, shouts] in sum, we are not interested in economic development per se. We are interested in the development of our people, by our people, and for our people. [cheers, applause] Ladies and gentlemen, the moral revolution means a new pact between the Honduran people and their government, a pact to rationalize the size of its administration and simplify its procedures to have honesty instead of corruption, encouragements instead of obstacles to private initiative. [cheers] We will not continue to confuse the state with bureaucracy. Above all, the state will be the expression and guarantee that Honduras has a national unity. Honduras has a national identity, and Honduras has a national purpose. The state is the Honduran essence in action; it is the future about which we all have dreamed and the future we will all build. Furthermore, the state is the sovereign rule of the law. Therefore, with the authority I have as a lifetime jurist and invariable democrat, today I assert before the world: There will be no more impunity for human rights violations in Honduras! [applause, shouts] My government will not allow personal interests to prevail to benefit the upper class, nor will it allow discrimination to exclude the lower class. The state guarantees a free and just existence for each and everyone. It does not signify choosing between a neoliberalism without soul and interventionism without a future. It involves an effort to merge all the possible markets with all the state that is necessary. It signifies trying to respect and stimulate the free initiative of our businessmen and our workers, so that our agriculture and industry will compete openly but on an equal and effective footing with the other nations. It involves having the state, enterprise, and unions become partners in achieving a new place for Honduras, within the world economy. This was done by countries which, as the so-called Dragons of Asia, did not have more wealth than we do up until a few years ago. We will do so to defend our agriculture up to the phase of processing and commercialization, where the largest part of the aggregate value is generated. We will do so, to diversify farming and artisan exports, to reconvert industry or to consolidate ecotourism. It means, above all, an effort to progress from formal democracy to real democracy. Hondurans will not only be equal before the law but equal in life, to break that infamous encirclement in which hunger, poor health, and ignorance have so many of our fellow citizens trapped [applause] so that we may look into the eyes of our children and tell them there is an opportunity for everybody on earth. Ladies and gentlemen, I have never been a salesman of dreams. I am not unaware of the tenacity, complexity, or the extent of the problems of our Honduras, nor have I been a collector of recriminations. The people already had their say in the administration of my distinguished predecessor, whom I warmly embrace on this symbolic day of our republican life. [applause] The people know how difficult the economic, social, financial, and foreign exchange problems the new administration will have to face. I did not promise rivers of milk and honey. I offered to change the shamed face of our fatherland. I offered the dignified austerity of a government that will work with as much tenacity and honesty as do the peoples of the Republic of Honduras. [applause] I promised not to take into consideration how state decisions would affect or not affect my personal interests and those of my relatives and friends. I promised to govern for all Honduras, and I will govern for all Honduras. [applause] It is the only thing I can do after being in love for such a long time, always in love with my Honduras, my fatherland. I give you my word of honor before God, the people and history that I will succeed in the plan that I have undertaken. I am going to defeat corruption in Honduras. [applause, cheers] I am going to implement social liberalism. I am going to carry out a moral revolution for all our people. I pledged to do this and the time has come to begin fulfilling my solemn promises to the people. The administration of all properties I own will be crystal clear. The president of the Republic will not be directly or indirectly involved in private businesses or companies. [applause, cheers] The members of my government cabinet must present sworn statements of their current assets and liabilities, and they will refrain from conducting business deals with any state institutions. [applause] In the next few hours I will appoint a special auditor for each public institution. [applause] I will end the confidentiality with which certain budget entries have been handled for some time. [applause, cheers] I will impart precise instructions to the state's comptrolling and inspection bodies. I will not hesitate to report any attempt to shelter the corrupt with the blanket of impunity. [applause, cheers] I will send to Congress a bill for a code of ethics for government employees. I have nominated individuals of undisputed moral integrity, as well as of the highest intellectual qualifications and the most recognized professional backgrounds, for the Supreme Court of Justice. I will convoke the Higher Council of Economic Planning to begin the great process of national dialogue. We will immediately and drastically begin cutting all superfluous spending by the Honduran state. [applause] With the patriotic participation of the Armed Forces, we will define its role in the new scenario of peace, democracy, and development. I respectfully greet the chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Honduras. [applause] We have already initiated the dialogue with multilateral credit organizations to clear the horizon in matters pertaining to currency exchange and to prevent the need to service the debt from suffocating urgent social problems. Under the personal direction of the president of the Republic, ministers for economic and social issues will form a special council with new methods to coordinate social and economic issues into a single policy. We will increase social spending until we bring it to 35 percent of the state's budget. [applause] The savings derived from the austerity program and the cuts in superfluous spending, as well as the funds received from international cooperation, will be earmarked for priority programs of human development, food security, basic health, basic education, productive employment, and housing. Distinguished delegations from friendly countries and international organizations, you are cordially welcome in this land of liberty and tolerance called Honduras. [applause] It is true that in the struggle that brought mourning to our neighbors during that suicidial decade of the Cold War, Hondurans were forced to assume leading roles that we did not seek and did not want. But the wounds from that episode have already healed. Democrats throughout the world have a fatherland here in Honduras. I hope that Hondurans will continue to count on international solidarity to make this fatherland a pillar of democracy and development. Once more we can walk together with our Central American friends to consolidate our democratic accomplishments, to eliminate extreme poverty, to foster the economies, to protect the environment, and to adopt an emergency program that avoids any setback for the peace for which we worked so hard. We can now walk together to deepen economic, political, and social integration with greater participation by civilian society and a better articulation of regional institutions. We can be present for the processes of continental integration and inter-American forums and those of the international community without being haunted by the specter of old suspicions. Honduras has chosen to be genuinely free, socially just, and politically sovereign. Honduras has chosen to come of age. Fellow countrymen: Today we bid paternalism farewell. The tasks ahead are too beautiful for any Honduran to renounce the adventure of participating in their implementation. These tasks are too great for the shoulders of Carlos Roberto Reina alone. They are too great for a government team. These are tasks that can have but one size, the enormous size of Honduras, a Honduras that will keep its appointment with destiny and at long last cease to be the hesitant and uncertain fatherland that used to pain Francisco Morazan so deeply. [cheers] That is the reason for the great national agreement I proposed as a candidate and that I begin to promote today as the president of all Hondurans. [cheers, applause] Being a Liberal is a way, my own way of loving Honduras, but there are other ways to love it. There is the Nationalist way, and there are other ways of expressing the same love for the fatherland. Let us work together, said a wiseman in ancient China on the threshold of the first millenium. A people that remains together for year will be strong for five years. A people that remains together for five years will be strong for a century. But a people that remains united for a century will be strong forever! That is the new Honduras I am proposing in this solemn ceremony. [applause] Honduran brothers, let us begin now, with God as our witness. Let us begin! Good health to you, Honduran brothers. Good health to you, visitors to Honduras. [applause]
