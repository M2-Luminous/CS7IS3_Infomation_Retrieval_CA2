Talking to journalists, he said Baudys "should never have made similar proposals public without discussing them in government." He said the initiative could lead to further escalation of nationalist tension in the conflict, as he is actually proposing what the rest of the world is seeking to eliminate. Baudys presented his initiative at a press conference in Prague on Saturday [19 February], prior to his visit to Turkey. His proposal envisages the creation of a UN executive goodwill committee, which would oversee the peace process in the area and in which selected countries the identity of which is linked to the religious and cultural values of the warring parties, would participate. Baudys did not consult with the government or parliament about it and sent copies of it to various international organisations and prominent figures.
