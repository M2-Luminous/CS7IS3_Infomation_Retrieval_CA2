The agenda for this conference entitled "Democracy in Haiti is the Solution to the Refugee Crisis" might be changed at the request of the United States, according to a diplomat who wanted to remain anonymous. The conference on the Haitian crisis, the question of human rights, and the rights of refugees could take place from 14 to 16 January. According to the HAITIAN PRESS AGENCY, there will be many observers such as guests from the UN conference, guests from the four countries friendly to Haiti, and delegates from the 10th Department [the Haitian diaspora]. They also plan to invite delegates from [political] parties represented in the Haitian parliament, particularly those that signed the New York pact. People from Haitian democratic organizations and representatives of the religious community here (?will also be invited). The purpose of this summit, according to explanations, is to establish a dialogue between experts on human rights protection and those working in the diplomatic sectors and the democratic movements in order to find a quick means to resolve the Haitian crisis and allow the restoration of democracy. The refugee problem remains a particularly thorny issue for the United States, which has maintained a naval blockade around Haiti since October 1993 to prevent the boat people's entering the United States. It also decided to repatriate those Haitians as soon as the U.S. Coast Guard catches them. The U.S. State Department adopted this position in May 1992. Diplomats from Haiti's four friendly countries say that they will merely be in attendance and that they will have a very low profile; others say (?their attitude will depend on) the agenda set. AFP has reported that they [not further identified] also let it be understood that they will do their best to ensure adherence to the agenda. The OAS does not take an official stand on that issue. According to diplomatic sources, President Jean-Bertrand Aristide asked OAS Secretary General Joao Clemente Baena Soares to participate in this meeting. Soares said that the OAS cannot involve itself in such an adventure, according to a diplomat who wanted to remain anonymous. President Aristide has called for the Miami conference in response to the idea of the national conference in Haiti that Prime Minister Robert Malval advocated. Since then, there has been a divergence between the United States and (?President Jean-Bertrand Aristide) as to the policy he would like to adopt regarding a national conference. Up to the present, the United States has supported a national conference to untangle the crisis situation in Haiti, although it does not share President Aristide's idea of a conference on refugees in Miami on 14, 15, and 16 January.
