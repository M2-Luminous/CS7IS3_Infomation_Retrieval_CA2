Some political scientists expect a similar development also in our country. They even say that, in a certain way, those election results demonstrate distrust of changes and the market system. What if the left actually wins in Slovakia? [Carnogursky] As a democrat I respect, and will respect, the legitimate results of democratic elections. Should the voters really vote more in favor of the left, let them have a left-wing government. The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] would still stick to its right-wing positions, to the socially oriented market economy. But let us look at some factors from the past. Before the last elections, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] was promising an economic policy geared toward development that would be completely different from the federally applied reform. Three months after the elections, when the late Professor Koctuch returned from the United States, from talks with the IMF, the HZDS immediately changed its entire economic concept and acknowledged that right-wing economic policy was the only option. That is why, deep within, I chuckle when you ask me what will happen if left-wing parties win. Even if this happened, it would be only a question of time before they realized that they must pursue right-wing policies. After all, even [Party of the Democratic Left Chairman] Peter Weiss said in a newspaper interview about a year ago that the economic policy of the Party of the Democratic Left was to the right of the HZDS's economic policy. And, mind you, that was after Professor Koctuch's return from the United States. [Melicharkova] Is the formation of a coalition government composed in the same way as the present government possible after the elections, in your opinion? [Carnogursky] The present term of office is also a trial period whether such a coalition can continue even after the elections. It seems, for the time being, that it might. [passage omitted]
