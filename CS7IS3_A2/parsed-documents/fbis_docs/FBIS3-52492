The Kurds were preparing for a demonstration. Reports said that the Turks tried to obstruct some 200 Kurds from organizing a demonstration in the northern part of the city. A clash broke out and 11 people were hurt. According to political circles, one of the reasons for the recent clashes between the Turks and the pro-Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] supporters in Germany is the continuation of the pro-PKK activities in that country. Although the German Government banned the activities of the PKK and the organizations affiliated with it in November 1993, the PKK supporters have maintained their activities to a certain degree. Most probably, that state of affairs has made the Turkish Government uneasy. Considering their political relations with Turkey, Germany and several other countries in Europe decided to obstruct the PKK's activities toward the end of 1993. However, the measures they took were not enough to completely obstruct the PKK. Several experts on Turkey are convinced that the supporters of the Turkish Government in Europe are trying to help Turkey obstruct the PKK activities, regardless of the effective measures Ankara has taken against that organization. In view of that, the incidents in Brussels can be assessed from that viewpoint as well. Needless to say, similar incidents may occur in various parts of Europe in the future. The Turkish Government is trying to get PKK's activities under control by improving diplomatic relations with Western countries, particularly those in which that organization is active. Furthermore, it uses its military forces to crush the PKK in Turkey. However, intellectual circles are convinced that both Turkey and the PKK must adopt a moderate approach and make a more serious effort to hold talks to resolve their problem.
