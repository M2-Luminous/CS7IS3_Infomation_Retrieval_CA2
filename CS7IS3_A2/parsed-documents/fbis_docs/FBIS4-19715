The French armed forces chief-of-staff said the issue would be reviewed at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Friday in Brussels. On Wednesday U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was calling on NATO to harden its military stance in the face of the continuing Bosnian Serb offensive against the Moslem-held enclave of Gorazde in eastern Bosnia. "The idea which is now being looked at for the protection of the safe areas is a different idea which would consist of being able to strike with a greater number of planes a series of military targets in a given area," Lanxade told a news briefing. Such strikes would be launched "if the rules set by the Atlantic Alliance and the United Nations are broken," he said. There should be "a very significant change in conditions for the use" of NATO fighter aircraft "which would allow the air force to use its normal means which allow for firing from a safe distance," Lanxade said. Close air support requires the presence on the ground of soldiers to provide guidance for the planes, he said. Such a tactic, associated with often poor weather in the Gorazde area, had forced NATO planes to take risks, he added. One British fighter was shot down last week over Gorazde. Ambassadors of the 16 NATO countries are to meet Friday to consider the extension of air strikes in all six safe areas, NATO diplomatic sources had earlier said. On Wednesday, the ambassadors had "agreed in principle" to UN calls for air strikes to protect civilians in the Gorazde, Zepa, Srebrenica, Tuzla, and Bihac safe areas. Sarajevo, the sixth safe area, was given air cover in February when Bosnian Serbs withdrew their artillery from around the town.
