This was not due to some individual mistakes, but due to the incorrectly chosen course of switching over to a market economy by "shock" and monetaristic methods. This conclusion is contained in a report, drawn up by the Economics Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the international "Reform" fund. The report analyses the current situation in the Russian economy and outlines new approaches to reforms. Continuation of the chosen course, the authors of the document claim, will produce "disastrous consequences" and drive the country into an impasse. The Russian economy is in a critical state already today. The production slump has reached 40 per cent, and the total volume of investments has dropped by 150 per cent. Moreover, the production slump is of a universal character and has affected the most technologically advanced sectors of economy. Most alarming is the fact that depreciation of fixed production assets has reached 60 per cent, which is the limit, after which the country's production potential is bound to collapse. "In view of the fact that the key role in the ongoing inflationary processes is played by the inflation of outlays," the authors of the report claim, "it is impossible to combat it by purely monetaristic methods, because restrictions on the amount of money in circulation and reduction of the budget deficit will obstruct rational structural changes and aggravate the production slump." Proceeding from the results of a complex analysis of practically all the spheres of the national economy, the authors of the report have drawn the conclusion that it is not only necessary to correct the course, but to work out new approaches to the strategy and tactics of the socio-economic reforms in Russia. In their opinion, stabilisation measures, like the ones used by many countries in such situations, are most expedient in this case, too. This must include some short-term measure to effect state control over prices for raw materials and railway carriages. The state must also pay its debt to individual sectors of the national economy and to other spheres of economy. The correlation of prices and the level of wages must then be normalised by means of a conciliatory process. According to figures furnished by the Economic forecasting Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and used in the report, the general rate of inflation could be lowered by 8-10 per cent a month as a result of such measures. Prices could be "adjusted" to fixed correlations in most sectors within two or three months. Parallel with this, it appears expedient to introduce progressive taxes for excessively high profitability, to toughen sanctions for tax evasion, to reassess the fixed assets and to grant tax exemptions to the part of the profits used for accumulating fixed assets. As a result of all these measures the level of inflation may be lowered to 3-5 per cent a month within a period of four or five months. The proposed solution, the authors of the report believe, is one of the possible ways to resolve the problem which, if ignored, may lead to serious economic consequences.
