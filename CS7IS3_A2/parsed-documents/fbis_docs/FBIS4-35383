During the session, al-Sahhaf asked 'Amr Musa, chairman of the session, for permission to comment on the word "regime," which was used in Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad's speech in reference to Iraq. Al-Sahhaf pointed out that it had been agreed to discuss the basic issues that were listed in the report of the NAM's president. He noted that agreement was reached during the meeting of ranking officials not to raise the issue of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute. He said that the attacks on Iraq in the speech of the Kuwaiti foreign minister were not listed in the president's report that was submitted for discussion during the ministerial meeting. Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa then spoke in his capacity as chairman of the current session. He said that he had taken note of the Iraqi foreign minister's comment. He then asked the Kuwaiti minister to continue his speech. In his speech, Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad spoke at length about Iraq's non-adherence to the Security Council resolutions on recognizing Kuwait's international borders. He noted that there are still Kuwaiti prisoners being held in Iraq. The Iraqi minister had told MENA before the session started that the issue of lifting the international sanctions on Iraq and the damage Iraq is being subjected to would not be discussed during this meeting because it is not on the agenda.
