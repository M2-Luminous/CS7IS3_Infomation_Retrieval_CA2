Yesterday, the two sides took an important step forward when they reached an agreement on the formation of the future national police force. That accord provides for UNITA's participation in that force with 5,500 police agents, out of a total of 25,700 men. The agreement saw that delicate hurdle overcome and, also yesterday the two teams moved to discuss national reconciliation, the second point on the agenda of the proceedings and one of the fundamental issues concerns the distribution of ministerial portfolios. BBC reporter Carlos Alberto Araujo interviewed UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Alicerces Valentim this afternoon. Araujo began by asking what UNITA's demands concerning this issue were. [Begin Valentim recording] I can tell you that we will be presenting political points rather than demands. For instance, taking into account the great national catastrophe that has morally and otherwise ravaged the country, we are for a single entity, but a single entity with an acceptable standing. In view of that, we believe that decentralization will be an exit door, a door that will lead to our salvation and will allow the Angolan entity to remain united. In this case, unlike what happened in 1992, we want UNITA to have a more significant participation in government. I believe these are reasonable points of view. Another point that is very dear to us is the status to be enjoyed and the protection guarantees for our President Dr. Jonas Malheiro Savimbi. In addition, UNITA militants must be allowed economic participation in the national economy. We would have liked to have a wider national vision of the problem at this stage, we would like it made clear that it is not only the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola's [MPLA] militants who participate in the economic life of this nation and enjoy the country's great benefits. The sympathizers and militants of UNITA and parties must also be able to do so. [end recording] UNITA Information Secretary Jorge Valentim admitted that UNITA now wants to secure more important ministerial portfolios than the ones it was given in 1992 and he alleges that only such a move can guarantee the Angolan people that UNITA will substantively participate in the national life of Angola. [Begin recording] [Valentim] Yes, I mean, it is so that people believe in the truth, that we are moving toward national reconciliation and it is important that the ministerial portfolios be important, that they make the people believe that UNITA is responsible for really important public matters. Now, if we are given something like the Culture Ministry, a few secretariats, and so forth, that will amount to no more than an experiment. However, I think that even the government is rethinking its stand. If the government does indeed rethink its stand, then that will be a positive point. The year of 1994 will not be equal to 1992. We all evolve and we will reach an understanding, just as we did concerning the army and the police. [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: would you confirm that UNITA will be asking for the Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Interior Ministries? [Valentim] Well, I would only like to say that we will be asking for ministries that we deem important. However, because we are at the first stage of discussions, we would only like to discuss the general aspects, but as the talks progress, perhaps within the next week, we will give more details about what ministries we really want. [Araujo] Mr. Jorge Valentim: you said at the start of this interview that it is important to build a climate of trust between the two sides. Do you not think that it is contradictory that the two sides should have reached an agreement on the national police issue at a time when there are reports of intensified fighting in various parts of Angola? [Valentim] Well, even though we are here, we are concerned about the intensification of the clashes. We can even say that both the mediation and the observers have condemned and are not in agreement with this escalation in the fighting. We have presented requests to the mediation and the observers for the fighting to stop. We made such a request only yesterday and the day before. We should not be discussing national reconciliation in a climate of war. [end recording] UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali will today present to the Security Council his report on the progress of the peace talks in Lusaka. Diplomatic sources in New York believe the report will be positive. The agreement on national police happens a day after that report is presented, and this seems to suggest that UNITA may have been pressured. However, Jorge Valentim says that this was a mere coincidence. [Begin Valentim recording] No, this is a mere coincidence and has nothing to do with the UN timetable. It happened that, after 37 days, we finalized the talks. In reality we have reached an agreement. Why should we have discussed the police issue in a hurry, without bases? Let me say that it is not an MPLA or UNITA police that will emerge, it is a state police in the service of the nation, a police force which will look at the security of each citizen, regardless of his political affiliation, race or ethnic origin.
