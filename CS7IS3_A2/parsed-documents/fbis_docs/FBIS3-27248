The pioneering institute was jointly sponsored by the Tianjin Building Materials Research Institute and the Building Research Center of the University of New South Wales in Australia. Establishment of the institute marks the beginning of the adoption of a new way for Chinese scientific research institutions to cooperate with foreign partners. The institute will also adapt to international practices in management and operation. Instead of depending on government allocation of funds for research as do most other Chinese research institutes, it directly contacts relevant domestic and Australian enterprises to define research projects and seek financial support. The institute has already been commissioned and financed by Australia's CSR Ltd, the Asia-Assistance Bureau of the Australian Government and the Science and Technology Commission of Tianjin municipal government for four research projects, including exploration of new building materials, technology of construction, quality management and construction costs. According to Liang Su, chief of the Science and Technology Commission of Tianjin municipal government, establishment of such Sino-foreign research institutes will promote exchanges of domestic experts and research institutions with foreign counterparts and enable China to keep pace with foreign countries in technology research, production and marketing. He also said that more Sino-foreign cooperating institutes will be set up in succession as part of the efforts to promote the reform of the country's scientific institutions. The newly-founded institute has also facilitated the establishment on the same day of a Sino-Australian building materials company -- CSR Tianjin Ready Mix Ltd. It was jointly funded by CSR Ltd of Australia and Tianjin Building Materials Supplies Corporation and has commissioned two research projects at the research institute.
