However, cases of sewage treatment by methane fermentation are very rare, and the application of this technique outside of tropical and subtropical areas would involve many problems yet to be solved. The development of a field test was conducted on a scale of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. The target was to establish a bioreactor system capable of achieving a 60 percent or higher gasification rate for organic matter in sewage, supplied at an organic load of 2 kg BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] or more. Properties of Raw Sewage The properties of raw sewage are shown in Table 1. The ratio of dissolved organic matter to total organic matter is only 18 to 25 percent. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 1. Properties of Raw Sewage | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |mg-l[.sup]-1[/] | |mg-l[.sup]-1[/] | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |BOD |173 |SS |197 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |BOD (sol.) |31 |NH[.sub]4[/]-N |20.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CODcr |293 |VFA |3.3 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |CODcr (sol.) |72.6 |SO[.sub]1[/] |33.2 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- Process Flow A flow sheet of the process is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Process Flow Sheet of Field Test Plant for Sewage Treatment Charging of Seed Sludge The anaerobic bioreactor (UASB) and hydrolyzation reactor were fed with seed sludge. The seed sludge for UASB was imported from the Netherlands. Its volume was 30.4 m[.sup]3[/], about 40 percent of the UASB volume, and it had 78,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of TS and 58,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] of VS, or 1,778 kg as VS. The seed sludge for the hydrolyzation reactor was digested sludge in the existing treatment plant and had a volume of 6.55 m[.sup]3[/], or 67.9 kg as VS. UASB started out treating 56 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], and the treatment volume increased in stages as determined by the characteristics of the effluent. In three months, treatment volume reached 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. Results Hydrolyzation Reactor The results are shown in Table 2. When the SRT was 445 days and the temperature in the reactor was 25�C, 84.8 percent of the VSS charged was decomposed, and methane gas was generated at a rate of 335 l per kg of the charged VSS or 395 l per kg of the decomposed VSS. When the SRT was 144 days, the VSS decomposition rate was 76.8 percent. Judging from the fact that the VSS decomposition rate reached only about 40 percent at 25�C without membrane separation, such results are attributable to the combination with the membrane separation system. When the return from the tank to concentrate the backwashing of the aerobic reactor was charged together, its ratio to the total charged VSS, increased from 30 percent to 39 percent, and from 52 percent to 70 percent of the VSS decomposed at an SRT of 25 to 29 days at 25�C. In this case, methane gas was generated at a rate of from 153 l to 206 l per kg of the decomposed VSS. The concentrated water of the backwash mainly consisted of excess sludge from the aerobic reactor. It is far more difficult for this water to undergo hydrolyzation and solubilization than the concentrated water from the suspended solids separation device, and the higher its proportion in the charged VSS to the hydrolyzed liquid, the lower the VSS decomposition rate gets. When the proportion of the VSS from the concentrating tank of the backwash to the total charged VSS was about 35 percent, with no membrane separation system combined, the VSS decomposition rate would be around 45 percent at 35�C. The VSS decomposition rate of 52 percent or more at 25�C is thus attributable to the use of the membrane separation system. Membrane Module System The membrane module system is designed to treat hydrolyzed liquid from the hydrolyzation reactor. Physical characteristics and the operating conditions are indicated in Table 3. A cross-flow filtering method is used, and the operation is carried out at a constant membrane linear velocity. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 3. Physical Characteristics and Operating Conditions of Membrane Module| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Type and material |Capillary type PS/PVA composite | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Size |_P_ 2.0 x _P_ 1.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cut off molecular weight |8,000 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Membrane area (m[.sup]2[/]) |3.8-4.3 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Inlet pressure (kg/cm[.sup]2[/]) |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pressure loss (kg/cm[.sup]2[/]) |0.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Membrane linear velocity (m/sec.) |0.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Washing of module |Backwashing with permeant each 10 min-| | |utes | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Anaerobic Bioreactor (UASB) The pH and oxidation-reduction potential in the anaerobic bioreactor remained stable at 6.6 to 7.2 and -430 to -470 mV, respectively. The mean temperature in this reactor was 17.8�C. The BOD and SS content of the water inflow were reduced at 20�C from 140 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 68 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] and from 178 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] to 59 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], respectively, while the daily volume of excess sludge generated was 8.4 kg, or 0.035 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of waste water. Both sides of the anaerobic bioreactor are provided with 15 sampling valves at 200-mm intervals between a height of 300mm and 3,100mm from the bottom. The liquid in the reactor was sampled with these valves to measure the VSS, and the results are shown in Figure 2. After the rated treatment capacity of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] came to be fully utilized, the distribution of the concentration hardly varied, standing at 10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in the vicinity of the gas-solid-liquid separating section. Figure 2. Distribution of VSS Concentration in Anaerobic Bioreactor The part in which the VSS was 10,000 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] or more was assumed to be the effective volume of the anaerobic bioreactor, and the load on this effective volume was calculated. The results showed that the load on the effective volume was 1.7 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of BOD, or 2.8 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] in terms of COD. When the backwash discharge from the aerobic reactor was returned to the separating device (filter), the load became 2.0 kg-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. When the temperature in the reactor reached about 20�C, the gas conversion rate changed from 44 percent to 84 percent in terms of BOD, or from 22 percent to 53 percent in terms of COD. The gas conversion rate in terms of BOD (COD) is defined by the oxygen required to completely oxidize the methane produced to the total BOD (COD) load. The number of granules in the reactor 230 to 320 days after beginning treatment of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] is shown in Table 4. A granule was defined as being larger than 0.5mm[.sup]2[/], and the number of granules is based on the number present in 1 ml of the mixed liquor. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 4. Number of Granules | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |in 234 days |in 293 days |in 319 days | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |511 |100 |382 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |2 |742 |- |409 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |3 |459 |170 |159 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |5 |152 |105 |104 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |7 |31 |8 |25 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |8 |11 |8 |25 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |9 |12 |3 |30 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |1 |11 |- |12 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- The number of granules decreases from the lower part close to the inlet pipe towards the upper part in the reactor. In the effective volume, there are from 100 to 150 granules per ml. There is a clear difference in the concentration of calcium ions between seeding sludge and SS in raw sewage, as shown in Table 5. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 5. Concentration of Calcium Ion | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |in the seeding sludge |in the SS of raw sewage |in the granule | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |0.29 |7.3 |1.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- According to this fact, measuring the calcium concentration in the granules at 260 to 300 days after beginning treatment of 240 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] confirm to the theory that the granules partly consist of seeding sludge and partly of SS in raw sewage. Some of the seeding sludge becomes thin depending on the load. The methanogenic activities of the liquid samples in the reactor, taken from the bottom, middle, and top layers of the anaerobic bioreactor, were measured by the following method. Measuring the volume of methane product under shaking the vials after being put the substrate, formic acid or acetic acid, into on the constant load. [as published] The shaking temperature was equalized to that in the reactor at the time of sampling. Methanogenic activity is significantly affected by the temperature in the bioreactor. The acetic acid-fermenting methanogenic activity was found to be higher in the middle and bottom layers than in the top layer. Aerobic Reactor Air for aeration was 1.8 Nm[.sup]3[/] per m[.sup]3[/] of treated water. Backwashing was automatically conducted twice a day by each reactor. When backwashing water was 75 m[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/] and backwashing air 60 Nm[.sup]3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/], the backwashing effect was sufficient to keep the SS concentration in the drainage after backwashing below 100 mg-l[.sup]-1[/]. The mean values of BOD and SS in the treated water were 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], respectively, under a volumetric organic load of 1.9 kg-BOD-m[.sup]-3[/]-d[.sup]-1[/]. BOD reduction rate was 81.5 percent, and SS reduction rate was 84.7 percent. Conclusion The average quality indicators of the input water were 173 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD and 197 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS, and those for the treated water were 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in BOD and 8.9 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in SS. The average temperature in the anaerobic bioreactor was 17.8�C. When a flow was used in which the drain from the backwashing of the aerobic rector was treated within the system and the average temperature in the anaerobic bioreactor was 20�C, the BOD and SS contents of the final treated water were 13 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] (4.4 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] in ATU BOD) and 8.4 mg-l[.sup]-1[/], respectively. When the average temperature in the anaerobic bioreactor was no less than 20�C, a gas conversion rate of 60 percent or more (in terms of BOD) was attained. Excess sludge was generated at a daily rate of 8.46 kg from the hydrolyzation reactor and 8.4 kg from the anaerobic bioreactor. The daily rate from the whole plant was 16.86 kg, which amounts to 0.07 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage. When followed by post-treatment with an aerobic reactor, treatment with the two-phase methane fermentation system comprising a hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating membranes and a sludge blanket bioreactor (UASB) was found to steadily provide treated water of about 10 mg-l[.sup]-1[/] both in BOD and in SS. The volume of excess sludge was 0.07 kg per m[.sup]3[/] of raw sewage. This suggests that anaerobic treatment of raw sewage may be feasible in other than tropical and subtropical areas. The results also indicate that less excess sludge was generated than when using activated sludge. Regarding the hydrolyzation reactor combined with separating membranes, the reduction rate for volatile suspended solids charged into the membrane fermentation reactor reached from 76.8 percent to 84.8 percent under the condition that the temperature in the reactor is 25�C and only the raw sludge was charged from the separating device. Charging into the methane fermentation reactor the sludge mixed the concentrated backwashing with the separated sludge from the separating device, the reduction rate for volatile suspended solids showed from 52 percent to 70 percent at 25�C. Such high reduction rates for volatile suspended solids is attributable to the additional use of a membrane separation system.
