A meeting of the Tamil Nadu vidhan sabha members has been called for 30 December 1993 to discuss continuation of the present legislation. However, K. Ramamurthy, the state Congress Committee president, has expressed doubt over the government's intentions while referring to the Constitution's article 31 (B) or 31 (C). It is not clear yet which of these articles does the state government want to implement when continuing the present reservation system. It should be remembered that the Supreme Court had decided on the Mandal Commission that reservations cannot exceed 50 percent in any case. The state government is forced to go through this constitutional exercise because of this decision. Chief Minister Jayalalitha had called a meeting of all the political parties on 26 November and had discussed following the Supreme Court's decision. At the same time, they supported keeping the state's 69 percent reservation quota. As the result of this all, the government is using these two articles as an alternative, and has obtained the president's approval so that the Center does not block the effort to make the present reservation system constitutional.
