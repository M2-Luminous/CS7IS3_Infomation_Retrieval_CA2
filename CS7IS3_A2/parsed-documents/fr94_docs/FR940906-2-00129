Summary of Response Mission The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is the primary agency within the Department of Commerce (DOC) responsible for providing assistance to the Federal, State, and local organizations responding to a radiological emergency. Other assistance may be provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. DOC's responsibilities include: (1) Acquiring and disseminating weather data and providing weather forecasts in direct support of the emergency response operation; (2) Preparing and disseminating predictions of plume trajectories, dispersion, and deposition of radiological material released into the atmosphere; (3) Providing local meteorological support as needed to assure the quality of these predictions; (4) Organizing and maintaining a special data archive for meteorological information related to the emergency and its assessment; (5) Ensuring that marine fishery products available to the public are not contaminated; (6) Providing assistance and reference material for calibrating radiological instruments; and (7) Loaning radiation shielding materials. 2. Capabilities and Resources NOAA is the principal DOC participant in the response to a radiation accident. NOAA prepares both routine and special weather forecasts, and makes use of these forecasts to predict atmospheric transport and dispersion. NOAA's forecasts may be the basis for all public announcements on the movement of contamination from accidents occurring outside U.S. territory or during domestic accidents when any released radioactive material is expected to be carried offsite. NOAA has capabilities to do the following: (1) Provide current and forecast meteorological information as needed to guide aerial monitoring and sampling, and to predict the transport and dispersion of radioactive materials (gases, liquids, and particles). (2) Routinely forecast the atmospheric transport, dispersion, and deposition of the radioactive materials, and disseminate the results of these computations via automatic facsimile to all relevant parties, twice per day. (3) Produce (and archive) special high-resolution meteorological data sets for providing an improved capability to predict atmospheric transport and dispersion of radioactive materials in the atmosphere. (4) Augment routine and special upper atmosphere and surface meteorological observation systems, as required to improve the quality of these predictions. (5) Evaluate NOAA's transport and dispersion forecast products in conjunction with those of other nations' weather services responding to the emergency, to provide a more internationally consistent product.
