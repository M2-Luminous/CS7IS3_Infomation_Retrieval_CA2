Attendants at the annual Williamsburg Conference include representatives of Japan, China, Taiwan, Russia, South Korea, the United States and other countries. Organizers said the agenda includes such sensitive issues as the sovereignty of the Spratly Islands, which are rich in natural resources, whose ownership is claimed, either in whole or in part, by China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Taiwan, the Philippines and Brunei. The meeting is co-chaired by former U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and former Japanese Ambassador to Washington Yoshio Okawara and other officials. It marks the first time that Vietnam has hosted such a large-scale unofficial conference. The move followed the U.S. announcement February 3 to lift the trade embargo against Vietnam. The sovereignty of the Spratly Islands is so fiercely contested that it triggered a brief naval battle in 1988 between Vietnam and China. The conference follows an accord between the two countries last December to reconcile their differences over the issue. The Williamsburg Conference was first called in 1971 in Williamsburg, Virginia, under the initiative of John D. Rockefeller III.
