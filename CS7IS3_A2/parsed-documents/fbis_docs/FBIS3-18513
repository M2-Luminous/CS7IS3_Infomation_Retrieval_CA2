At Commons question time, Mr Major expressed his regrets about violence in what he called "that powder keg of the Middle East." He was responding to Labour's George Galloway, MP for Glasgow Hillhead, who said the Palestinian chief negotiator, Nabil Sha'th, was present in the Commons gallery to hear the exchanges. Mr Galloway asked the Prime Minister: "Do you have a message for Nabil Sha'th in the light of the fact that since last Friday's massacre in Hebron, the Israeli Army have shot down more people than were shot down by the murderer in the massacre itself?" He urged: "Will you suppoort a protection force, made up either of the United Nations or at least the co-sponsors of the peace process, to protect the Palestinians under illegal Israeli occupation?" Mr Major declared: "Violence from any source in that powder keg of the Middle East is to be regretted whether it comes from the dreadful massacre at Hebron or any other source." He said he believed UN observers in Israel were doing "an extremely good job," and he had discussed the situation with the UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali a few days ago in the United States. The Prime Minister stressed: "What would be most helpful is, as soon as it seems to be politically practicable, for the sides to sit down again and continue with the negotiations that have made more progress in the last 18 months than for many years past. What everyone wishes to see is a comprehensive peace settlement there that will enable the people who live there to live a decent, civilised and safe life." Mr Galloway, whose visit to Iraq was widely condemned in January, was strongly rebuked by Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg when he raised the issue at Commons question time yesterday. Mr Galloway criticised the Israeli armed forces which he said had shot down many people since the massacre. To Tory cheers, Mr Hogg retorted: "In view of your quite odious support for Saddam Husayn, I would have thought that you would have thought it wise to abstain from participating in questions on the Middle East."
