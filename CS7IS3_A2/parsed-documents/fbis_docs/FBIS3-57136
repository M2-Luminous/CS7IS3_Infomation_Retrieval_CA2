Their appeal to Yeltsin says that unlike Belarus, Ukraine and Uzbekistan and other republics of the former Soviet Union, Russia has acquired steady reformists such Yegor Gaydar, Anatoliy Chubays and Boris Fedorov due to your personal involvement. The DRM is now puzzled over Yeltsin's support to the upholders of the idea of "squeezing" members of the reformist wing out of the government to please "red" monopoly directors with Viktor Chernomyrdin in charge. DRM leaders accuse Yeltsin of backing up what is in essence is a new "Soviet government". Participants in the meeting reminded Yeltsin of his verbal commitment to "the policy of radical reforms" he had expressed at a recent news conference during U.S. president Bill Clinton's visit to Moscow. However, they said, Prime Minister Chernomyrdin announcing the make up of a new cabinet "made it clear the pattern of reforms would be corrected". DRM has warned Yeltsin of intending to put up resistance to the new economic policy leading to the winding up of reforms. The appeal ends with a question to the President: "What is your own policy, Boris Nikolayevich?"
