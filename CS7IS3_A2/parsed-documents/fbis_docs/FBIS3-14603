Bal'awi conveyed the Palestinian leadership's ideas on the current stage of Palestinian-Israeli talks to the Jordanian Government, and the circumstances that surrounded the adoption of Security Council Resolution 904. [Begin recording] [Jawad al-'Anani, minister of state for cabinet affairs and information minister] His excellency the prime minister today received Hakam Bal'awi who, in my opinion, presented a positive stand that covered many issues. We explained to him our viewpoint, which I explained in detail earlier, regarding our position on the Jerusalem issue. I think that, henceforth, we need to coordinate our positions on Jerusalem because this subject, as you know, is an Arab, Palestinian, Jordanian, Islamic, and Christian subject. The responsibility toward this subject is very great. [Bal'awi] I had the honor to meet with his excellency the prime minister this morning. I am here as the envoy of President 'Arafat and the Palestinian leadership to brief the Jordanian brothers on all details that preceded and followed the recent security council resolution, and on all Palestinian contacts with the Israelis and Americans on developments in the situation following the massacre in the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Undoubtedly, the brothers in Jordan closely follow all these speedy and important details. We should work together in all fields. We are not neighbors, but one people in the same geographic area. We work together and our capabilities are devoted to attaining the Palestinian independence that will eventually enhance the Jordanian independence, which will then create the forthcoming Jordanian-Palestinian cohesion which, God willing, will be a living model for the future, civilized Arab situation in this area.
