"The potential for danger is rising," State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for the intelligence services, admitted, but he added that, despite intensive observation of the market, there have not been any signs of a threat by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no indication at all. Weapons-grade material has not turned up in our country at all.... Terrorists do not have access to weapons-grade material because it is not available on the market," he said in an interview with RTL. "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are available in an uncontrolled manner," the newsmagazine quotes a report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). However, referring to the same source, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear bombs and biological weapons from Eastern Europe could soon be in the hands "of Western gangs." In its 18-page report the BND speaks of a "trend toward an escalation of the situation." Centers of smuggling include Vilnius and Kamas in Lithuania. According to the magazine, the FRG has become the hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer explained this by referring to the FRG's geographical location. The minister reported that over the past two years 300 to 350 cases of illegal nuclear trade or smuggling have been registered. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.
