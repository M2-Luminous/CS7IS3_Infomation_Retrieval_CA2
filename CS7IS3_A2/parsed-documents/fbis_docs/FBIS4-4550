The Embassy had issued a statement after the unsuccessful appeal of Michael Peter Fay against his sentence for vandalism. Its Charge d'Affaires, Mr Ralph Boyce, said the Embassy continued to believe that caning was an excessive penalty for a youthful, non-violent offender who pleaded guilty to a repairable crime against private property. He expressed hope that the Singapore Government would reconsider the caning sentence on Fay. The MHA statement said it was surprised at Mr Boyce's remarks. It said: "This is the second time he has criticised the judgment of a Singapore court in public. "This is regrettable. As a diplomat accredited to Singapore and representing a country that respects the rule of law, he should respect Singapore's judicial system." The statement went on to say that there were official channels for him to make representations and added that the damage Fay had caused was extensive.
