President Itamar Franco has forbidden Radiobras [Brazilian Radio Broadcasting Company] from retransmitting the interview. The retransmission request was made by the justice minister himself because, according to him, in his remarks he categorically defended the president, even though he may have talked about the coup. In a brief statement, President Franco said the minister himself is responsible for the remarks he made. Through acting presidential press adviser Fernando Costa, the president explained that he was informed about the interview by the justice minister himself, and declined to comment on the statement's content. Correa said Franco had "incentives" to impose a coup, as done by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. The Army's spokesman, General Gilberto Serra, said the military is not aware of the matter and Army Minister Zenildo de Lucena was surprised by those remarks. Gen. Serra said: "We, the military, are democrats. We fight for democracy, regardless of the inconveniences it might cause." Correa had difficulties explaining his remarks. He tried to minimize the interview's impact, saying that he only felt a climate in society favorable to a "Fujimorization of the country." He added: "No one had made a proposal in this regard, but we knew it existed. People in society felt the desire to see a strong hand." Correa's interview on television was clear, however. In response to a question on the possibility of a coup if Luis Inacio Lula da Silva was elected, he said: "I want to say something extremely serious. President Franco, who has democratic training and a lofty public spirit, has gone through one of the times of greatest turbulence in the country. Last year, with the establishment of the CPI [Congressional Investigating Committee], low salaries, and the difficulties in administration, there were certain incentives toward this Fujimorization. I am certain that had the previous government that was ousted been in power instead of President Franco, what happened in Peru would have taken place in the country: The president would have become a Fujimori, a dictator." Correa immediately answered the following question: "Would President Franco have the support of the people had he closed Congress?" "I think so because the people's indignation is great and the people want to see immediate results and corruption eliminated."
