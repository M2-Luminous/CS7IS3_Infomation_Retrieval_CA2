Ozolas said Kozyrev's statement refers to a new annexation of the Baltic states. Ozolas said the meeting in Moscow was attended by Russian ambassadors to the CIS countries and the Baltic states, as well as by a big group of Russian generals. It is also noteworthy, Ozolas said, that the meeting was held immediately after the visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Russia. According to Ozolas, Kozyrev has hastily distributed the keys to the solution of Russia's most important problems to the generals -- the keys to the CIS countries and the Baltic states. This is confirmed by Kozyrev's words that the refusal of military participation in those states would be the same kind of extremism kind as imperial suppression by tanks.
