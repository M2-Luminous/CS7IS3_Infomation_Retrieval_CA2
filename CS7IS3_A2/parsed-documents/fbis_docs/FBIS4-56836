Change `94 presented to the voters the best government program to be implemented by a team of men and women individually and collectively qualified. This is very true in terms of ability, proven honesty, and democratic convictions. The nation will be ruled, starting on 1 September, by a mandate of a minority of the voters in keeping with our current laws. Change `94 becomes, as of this moment, a constructive and overseeing opposition that will guarantee the necessary balance to watch over the democratic system and the honest execution of government actions. We are very proud of the work we carried out and of the plans we presented to the nation. We give our eternal and sincere appreciation to the thousands of Panamanians who believed in us and who supported our electoral plans and proposals. The political support we received represents the desire of those who wished to guarantee the nation's best interests, and that gives us peace of mind as citizens. We recognize the national government for offering the nation a clean and transparent electoral process, thereby imposing on the newly elected government the commitment to do the same in 1999. We admire and respect our political allies, friends, and associates for all their work and efforts. Once again, we are satisfied because we have served Panama while reiterating our firm willingness to continue to do so. Thank you very much.
