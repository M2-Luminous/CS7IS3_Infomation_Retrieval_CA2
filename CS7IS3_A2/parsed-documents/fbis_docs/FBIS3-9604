Following the signing of the Croat-Moslem federation agreement in Washington March 18, the Croats had "found a means to convince" the Serb forces around Maglaj to leave, Major Richard Margesson, commander of British UN troops in Maglaj, said. In Zepce, 18 kilometres (12 miles) south of Maglaj, a resident, who requested anonymity, said the Croat forces had simply paid off the Serbs, although it was not known if it was payment in kind or cash. Margesson said that in the summer of 1993 the Croats in Zepce had feared they would not be able to repulse Bosnian army offensives coming from Zenica, Zavidovici and Maglaj. They "made an agreement" with the local Serb forces, who sent them several hundred soldiers in return for food, the chance to evacuate their sick and wounded, some military material and also cash, he said. The Serb lines are still clearly visible 600 metres (yards) from the town centre, up on a hillside overlooking the city. From time to time, shots ring out, though not as frequently as before. On Friday, when a sniper targetted a British UN patrol, the UN shot back with 30-mm cannon fire, curtailing, at least for a while, further attacks. Since last Monday, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has brought humanitarian aid convoys into the town and public soup kitchens, operating for the past two years, have started to wind down their aid operations as more people are able to cook for themselves at home. Rocket and mortar fire, which mark the walls of every building, only stopped 10 days ago. But despite the haunted looks in most people's eyes, the grim expressions, the lack of smiles, it seems as if the city is starting to breath again. Daniel de Schryver, head of mission for the Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders) aid group, said the arrival of aid in the town had acted as a tremendous psychological boost.
