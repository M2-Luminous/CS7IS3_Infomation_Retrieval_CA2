FBIS3-32807 "drlat031_m_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-031 Document Type:Daily Report 15 Feb 1994 Brazil Amorim, German Source Welcome Nuclear Safeguards Approval PY1202022994 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL in Portuguese 10 Feb 94 p 6 PY1202022994 Sao Paulo GAZETA MERCANTIL Language: Portuguese Article Type:BFN [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi in Brasilia] [Text] Through a symbolic vote, the Brazilian Senate on 9 February approved the quadripartite agreement on comprehensive nuclear safeguards signed in December 1991 by Brazil, Argentina, the Brazilian-Argentine Agency for Accounting and Control (ABACC), and the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The treaty's approval has put an end to rising speculation in the international community about Brazil's real commitment to using nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in light of the fact that the bill was only approved after difficult discussions took place in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The German Government has conveyed satisfaction over the Senate's endorsement of the special inspections to be conducted by the IAEA, which will control the movement of nuclear materials to and from Brazilian facilities. In remarks to GAZETA MERCANTIL, a German Embassy source said: "It is a positive step, but we are still awaiting the approval of the amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty on nuclear nonproliferation in Latin America and the Caribbean." The Tlatelolco Treaty will be discussed after the Carnival celebrations. The source added: The nuclear issue will no longer be a problem for the visit Foreign Minister Celso Amorim is scheduled to make to Germany on 23 February. In recent months, Germany has expressed great interest in the approval of the nuclear agreements by the Brazilian Congress because a German law will only authorize international cooperation in sensitive technology with countries that are signatories of comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA. The deadline for the recipient country to meet this requirement expires late next year. Foreign Minister Amorim also expressed satisfaction with the Senate vote that, in his opinion, clears the way for developed countries to provide technological cooperation to Brazil. Amorim also noted that the quadripartite agreement is more important than the Tlatelolco amendments -- which have yet to be approved -- for the international community because the Tlatelolco Treaty, which bans nuclear weapons in Latin America, is applicable only to the region. Both Amorim and the German Embassy have expressed confidence that the Tlatelolco amendments will be approved in the next few weeks. Argentina, which is Brazil's partner in peaceful nuclear projects because they both set up ABACC, also has welcomed the agreement's approval. A Buenos Aires source said: "The image of the two countries, particularly on the nuclear issue, will improve." The Argentine Congress already had approved both the quadripartite agreement and the Tlatelolco amendments some time ago.
