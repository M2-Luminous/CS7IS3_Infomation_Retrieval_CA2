What is the situation in our province? [Liu Lida] Our province also has this situation. Judging from the situation of our province's inspection of the value-added tax special receipts, some problems have existed. The comparatively prominent ones are first, the forging and reselling of receipts. Shenyang and Fuxin have successively investigated and handled this kind of case. Second, the items to be filled in while writing the receipts are not complete; third, some people fail to correctly count the items to be filled in while writing the receipts; fourth, some people write false items in a real receipt which are manifested in arbitrarily writing the names of units or understating the value of items in the receipts and expanding the scope of items to be filled in the receipts. [Reporter] Recently, the State General Administration of Taxation, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, and the Ministry of Public Security jointly held a "nationwide telephone conference on launching a special struggle against the law-breaking criminal activities of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts," and decided to launch a special struggle against the law-breaking criminal activities of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts in the whole country. I think this is very necessary. [Liu Lida] It is very necessary to launch activities on dealing blows to the law-breaking criminal activities of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts. After the implementation of the new tax system, particularly since the use of value-added tax special receipts, receipts no long simply serve as a firsthand proof of the ordinary receipts in the past, as a proof of keeping accounts, and as a basis for tax checkup. More importantly, they serve as a proof for tax payments. The value-added tax special receipts serve as a "chain" holding all commodity circulation links together. When a receipt is written, it implies that this receipt can be served as an income tax payment. If problems occur in any link, this "chain" will break off and taxation will be unable to calculate accurately. In a written instruction on dealing blows to law-breaking criminal activities on forging and reselling receipts, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out: "Forging the value-added tax special receipts is extremely harmful (even more harmful than making counterfeit banknotes). If we do not put several persons to death (or sentence them to life imprisonment), perhaps, we will be unable to check this trend." [Reporter] Evidently, the value-added tax special receipts have played a role in tax reduction. This is not only the new distinguishing feature and crux of the value-added tax but also the direct reason for criminal elements to make a reckless move to forge, resell, steal, and write false value-added tax special receipts. [Liu Lida] Your analysis is correct. Just think. If we fail to manage the special receipts well, great losses of state taxation will surely be created and reform of the tax system will also be a failure. So, we should discard the past concept of managing ordinary receipts, further enhance understanding, regard the management of special receipts as an important means for guaranteeing the smooth implementation of reform of the tax system, and strengthen the sense of responsibility and urgency. [Reporter] At present, the law-breaking criminal activities of using receipts to engage in tax evasion and cheating have become a common nuisance in society. As far as our province is concerned, what measures should we take to check them resolutely? [Liu Lida] In line with this special struggle, our tax departments should continue to conduct checkups of the special receipts, unceasingly improve this system, go through the procedures carefully, and explore ways to check up receipts under the new situation. However, this problem involves many sectors, and most of these law-breaking criminal activities are usually carried out covertly. It will be hard to discover and solve them by relying only on the checkups of the tax departments. Therefore, the tax departments must maintain close coordination with the public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments under the guidance and support of the party and government leaders, take joint actions, and establish organs for organizing this special struggle. If the law-breaking criminal acts of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts discovered during the checkup of receipts constitute a crime, the people involved should be transferred to the judicial organs for punishment in an effort to publicize the legal system and to frighten the criminals. Meanwhile, we should pay special attention to receipt propaganda work, enhance the sense of legally using receipts in the whole society, let the broad masses of people understand the importance of managing receipts and the harmfulness of forging and reselling receipts. In addition, we should also pay attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of value-added tax payers, and make them voluntarily report the situation of the counterfoils of the value-added tax special receipts on time so that tax departments can accurately keep abreast of the situation in a timely manner. At present, the special struggle against the law-breaking criminal offenses of forging, reselling, and stealing receipts have been gradually carried out in all localities across the province. I believe that with the support of leaders at all levels and the coordination of the public security, judicial, and procuratorial departments, this work will surely attain its expected aim, the management of receipts will be unceasingly strengthened in our province, and a good environment for guaranteeing the smooth implementation of the new tax system will be created.
