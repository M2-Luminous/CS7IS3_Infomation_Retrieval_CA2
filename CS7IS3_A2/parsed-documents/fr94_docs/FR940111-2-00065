FR940111-2-00065 FR940111-2-00035 National Toxicology Program; Availability of Technical Report on Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of p-Nitrophenol The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of p-Nitrophenol used in the production of acetaminophen, methyl and ethyl parathion insecticides, fungicides, and dyestuffs. Eighteen-month toxicology and carcinogenesis studies were conducted by applying p-Nitrophenol in acetone to the intrascapular skin of groups of 60 Swiss-Webster mice of each sex. Doses of 0, 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg p-Nitrophenol were administered to mice 3 days per week for 78 weeks. Under the conditions of these 18-month dermal studies there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity 1 in male or female Swiss-Webster mice receiving 40, 80, or 160 mg/kg p-Nitrophenol. 1 The NTP uses five categories of evidence of carcinogenic activity observed in each animal study: Two categories for positive results (``clear evidence'' and ``some evidence''), one category for uncertain findings (``equivocal evidence''), one category for no observable effect (``no evidence''), and one category for studies that cannot be evaluated because of major flaws (``inadequate study''). Questions or comments about the Technical Report should be directed to Central Data Management at P.O. Box 12233, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709 or telephone (919) 541&hyph;3419. Copies of Toxicology and Carcinogenesis Studies of p-Nitrophenol (CAS No. 100&hyph;02&hyph;7) in Swiss-Webster Mice (Dermal Studies) (TR&hyph;417) are available without charge from Central Data Management, NIEHS, MD AO&hyph;01, P.O.
