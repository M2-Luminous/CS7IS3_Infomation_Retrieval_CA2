The Babil newspaper, run by President Saddam Husayn's eldest son 'Uday, said it was "desirable for the leaders of Iraq, Libya and Sudan to hold a summit meeting ... and adopt a common stance" to meet the challenges facing Arabs in the wake of the February 25 massacre, when a Jewish settler gunned down dozens of Moslem worshippers. Such an alliance was "necessary ... due to the complete inertia of the Arab League and its subservience to the wishes of traitors among the Arab leaders." Babil said "only armed struggle can lead to freedom," and called on "all those concerned about the future of Palestine to declare that the Palestinian autonomy accord died in Hebron."
