The mutant gene was then introduced into plasmid pLT21, constructed by recombination of plasmid pLT18 with phage M13LT2. pLT21, with the lymphotoxin gene controlled by tandem constitutive T7 coliphage promoters, was employed in the transformation of E. coli SG20050. Ultrasonication of the transformed E. coli cells and successive chromatography of the supernatant on DEAE-cellulose DE-52 and hydroxyapatite yielded 5.6 mg of the recombinant protein per 3 g of wet cells. Cytopathic activity of the preparation on L-929 murine fibroblasts was on the order of 5 x 10E7 U/mg protein. Figures 3; references 24: 9 Russian, 15 Western.
