New nameplates have been installed. Behind the appealing corporate names, however, the state remains the owner. While the fertile Hungarian soil failed to impress the anticipated investors, the state farms have been losing their assets continually and at a fast rate. Years ago, 121 state farms were being considered for privatization. The government decided at the time that 26 of the state farms would remain permanently state-owned. (Primarily the preservation and development of biological stocks were the justification for this decision.) The rest of the state farms were to be privatized. State-farm managers, many of whom have been replaced in the meantime, prepared plans for transforming the state farms into corporations, and the State Property Agency [AVU] decided that their transformation was to be completed by December 1992. That in itself would not have meant privatization, but even the simple changing of nameplates failed to take place. Experts were not surprised by the delay. For, according to the government's decision, the state farms were to be sold off in the course of so-called decentralized privatization. Simply stated, it meant that the state farms were to be split up into viable units, which would then be offered for sale. But there was no rush of prospective buyers. The primary reason for their lack of interest was that agriculture had been a declining branch of the economy for years, and therefore the new owners could not even hope to make a profit. Those who were the least bit confident of success were deterred by uncertainties regarding title to the land, and by the protracted settlement of compensation claims. The government quickly corrected the situation. The deadline for transforming state farms into corporations was extended until 30 June 1993. In a legal sense, this program has been a success in that the management of every state farm was obliged to prepare, by the end of December 1993, all the documents necessary for retroactive incorporation. The letterheads on the farms' stationery and the nameplates on the facades of the farms' office buildings attest to the state farms' transformation into corporations. But economic reality reveals something entirely different. Under decentralized privatization, 30 billion forints' [Ft] worth of assets were offered for sale, but only Ft15 billion worth have actually been transferred to new owners. Before the state farms' transformation into corporations, the book value of their assets totaled Ft93 billion, but only 47 percent of that amount is so-called subscribed capital. According to a report reflecting the situation at the end of March, 98 of the 121 state farms have been transformed into corporations, 16 are in liquidation, and seven are in the distribution-of-assets stage. Among the state farms that have been transformed into corporations, seven are owned by domestic entrepreneurs and two are owned by German investors. The state farms' combined total capital stock is Ft76 billion, of which about Ft5 billion is privately owned. Thus the state continues to hold most of the capital stock. The government has attempted once again to stimulate the farms' lagging privatization. The shares left in the AVU's portfolio are being put out to public tender; they can now be bought also for compensation notes; and enterprising agricultural workers also are able to buy shares. There are several reason why no rush to buy shares can be expected. The farmland's future remains uncertain because of the slow processing of compensation claims, and it would be very amateurish to start raising livestock without any land. Agricultural workers are being deterred from buying shares presumably because they know very well that they cannot expect any dividend payments in the near future, and their small percentage of equity is not enough even to guarantee them their jobs. To add to the contradictions, it is common knowledge that agriculture in our country is not a sector in which tycoons invest, and that the rate of return on invested capital is slow even under favorable economic conditions. The paucity of capital could be bridged with loans, but then only the investors' grandchildren could hope to realize the profit. The most spectacular contradiction in the privatization of state farms is that the decisionmakers were guided by political slogans, and they failed to take into consideration that investors count their forints.
