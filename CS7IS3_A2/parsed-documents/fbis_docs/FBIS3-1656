This is a meaningful thing. Today's forum is a meeting at which municipal leading persons and model workers held heart-to-heart talks. The model workers made many good opinions and suggestions. We will conscientiously accept their opinions and suggestions. The municipality's working class, particularly its model workers, has made great contributions. On behalf of the municipal party committee and government, I express my heartfelt thanks to the model workers and the working class in the municipality. Gao Dezhan said: The year 1994 is a key year to promote Tianjin's reform, opening up, and modernization. Therefore, all work of the municipality should be submitted to and serve the overall situation of grasping favorable opportunities to deepen reform, expand the scale of opening up, promote development, and maintain stability. We should speed up the setup of the socialist market economic system; maintain a sustained, fast, and sound development of the national economy; safeguard political stability; comprehensively promote social progress; and make key headway in various undertakings. Gao Dezhan stressed: To realize the 1994 work targets, we should grasp the following few tasks. First, the party and government leaders should think for the masses, do everything for the masses, and rely on the masses to do their work. It is necessary to deepen reform, develop production, improve management, increase economic results, and ceaselessly increase the income of the staff and workers. Enterprises with good economic achievements should create more real benefits for the staff and workers. The enterprises that have taken a turn for the better from the strained circumstances should solve more difficulties for their staff and workers. Second, we should enliven enterprises, particularly state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises. Only when enterprises are well enlivened will Tianjin be able to become prosperous. Only when enterprises are well developed will Tianjin be able to make developments. So, we must not only do concrete deeds for the masses but also positively do concrete deeds for enterprises. All departments and fronts should make contributions to enlivening enterprises. Third, we should foster the idea of relying on reform to promote development. Enterprises should exert great efforts to deepen reform. Fourth, we should persist in the principle of taking a two- hand approach and being sure that both hands are tough and accurately handle the relationship between reform, development, and stability. We should strengthen spiritual civilization, the ideological and political work, and the improvement of social order so as to create good conditions for reform, opening up, and economic development. In the new year, we should wholeheartedly rely on the working class, pool the joint efforts of all people of the municipality, and unite with the people to capture a bigger success in reform, opening up, and modernization.
