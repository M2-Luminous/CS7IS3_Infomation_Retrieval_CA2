FBIS4-58246 "drnes085_l_94007" FBIS-NES-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 ISRAEL Papers Comment on Agreement With PLO Papers Comment on Agreement With PLO TA0105132894 TA0105132894 BFN [Editorial Report] The 1 May editions of Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ and Tel Aviv HATZOFE, both in Hebrew, carry contrasting editorials on the agreement signed in Cairo on 28 April. The 800-word editorial on page B1 of HA'ARETZ, entitled "Removing the Obstacles," attributes the Cairo agreement "mainly to the prime minister's decision that the time has come to put an end to the recurring complications." The editorial goes on to say that it will be "impossible to divest the autonomy of its symbols," such as passports and stamps, "when it is applied to all the occupied territories, and the self-rule is bound to be recognized as a stage en route to full Palestinian independence." Referring to the economic agreement signed in Paris on 29 April, the editorial notes that "it reflects the premise that the State of Israel and the Palestinian self-rule have a de facto equal standing." The editorial concludes: None of the agreements should be seen as undermining Israel. Rather, they are a vehicle that will result in a stronger Israel. Nothing can fortify its security better than peace with the Palestinians and the Arab countries." The 1,100-word page 2 HATZOFE editorial, entitled "The Document of Capitulation," states: "Israel has surrendered every principle to which it adhered in the course of the protracted talks with the PLO." "Only a blind man can still insist that the agreement deals with `autonomy' in the spirit of the `Camp David' accords. No one with eyes in his head can ignore the government's policy of capitulation. Not only is this policy incapable of promoting peace in the region, on the contrary, there is every sign that we are witnessing the establishment of `a terrorist state' that will permanently threaten Israel's well-being and security." HATZOFE maintains that in view of the agreement, "it is one's duty to rally in a bid to prevent at the last moment the disgraceful capitulation which has no equal anywhere in the world." "Since the `capitulation agreement' contravenes the Oslo agreement, the prime minister is duty bound to submit the document again for the Knesset's approval. He must present both the open and clandestine documents, to enable the people's representatives to judge whether they support the capitulation agreement. "And as is well known, the majority of the Knesset members do not support the establishment of a Palestinian-PLO state in Eretz Yisra'el. The Jewish majority opposes capitulation." The editorial further argues: "The forced Knesset majority supposedly supporting the left-wing government represents a popular minority. Therefore, the government has no mandate to decide on issues fateful for the people and the State of Israel. "And if the prime minister does not understand this, the people must bravely make themselves heard, in order to force Rabin to resign and to make way for a national Jewish government capable of safeguarding the Jewish people's right to Eretz Yisra'el and of protecting the well-being and security of the State of Israel. "The perils, as we said, are great. We must not keep silent. Everything must be done to prevent the signing of the `agreement of capitulation' to the PLO. It is time to act!"
