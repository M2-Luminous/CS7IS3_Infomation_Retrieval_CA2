And that troops of the al-'Amaliqah Brigade -- who were wearing civilian clothes -- fled, returning to their camp after they had deployed on two axes: One in Zinjibar (capital of Abyan) to cut off the road to Aden, and one in Lawdar to cut off the road to the governorates of Hadhramaut and Shabwah President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, secretary general of the (northern) General People's Congress [GPC] -- has issued his orders to Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir (a northerner) to return the al-Wahdah Brigade to Hadhramaut from Abyan. He told him in a message sent to him in Aden: "I oblige you to comply in order to pave the way and create favorable conditions for starting the implementation of the Pledge and Accord Document and to protect unity and democracy and spare the nation sedition and infighting." The president blamed the defense minister and southern officials for the military movements, instructing the defense minister not to mobilize any force except after the approval of "the chief of staff (a northerner) and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces (the president)." A GPC source accused the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] of violating the rules of military movements and the military committee's decisions, namely by continuing to move the 30th Brigade from Shabwah to Abyan. But the defense minister considered the military committee's decision unilateral and decided to complete the process of moving the brigade. Although there are no confirmed figures about the number of victims, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT's information indicates that 700 to 800 have been killed or wounded. The information attributes these high figures to the nature of the guerrilla warfare dominating the operations and the sniper method used in the streets. Sources said that a force wearing civilian clothes comprising about three brigades from the militias belonging to the Yemeni Reform Grouping arrived in the area from the north and from al-Maraqishah camp to participate in the operations. While southern sources said that they had arrested an Algerian extremist among these, they pointed out that their participation in the operations and the al-'Amaliqah troops' wearing of civilian clothes was designed to drive a wedge between the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and the people of the governorates, who are known for their support for former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad. On the grounds that the al-Wahdah Brigade -- which comprises northern elements from the former National Front elements -- carried out reprisal operations in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents and prevented the occurrence of rapprochement between 'Ali Nasir and the present YSP leadership. The sources added that a large-scale deployment has taken place over the past two days in the northern border governorates, including Ta'izz, al-Bayda', and Ma'rib, and also Ibb Governorate, which is situated in the region but considered to be belong to the YSP by virtue of its support for the National front in the period before unity. Air traffic was banned over the al-'Amaliqah Brigade camp all day yesterday. Eyewitnesses said that the camp opened fire with light weapons at 0700 hrs on a southern Mig aircraft which had flown over it in a "provocative manner." But it failed to hit it because of the speed of the aircraft and the lack of high-capability antiaircraft weapons. But southern sources said that the aircraft which was fired on was an Ethiopian civilian plane. Sources said that Colonel Muhammad Salah, Yemeni deputy chief of staff and head of the military committee, arrived in al-'Amaliqah camp yesterday for the second time in three days in a new attempt to contain the confrontation.
