They said the only concrete possibility now is to continue the trial "come what may." The two executives discard the possibility of reaching agreement with the Clinton administration. During recent negotiations with the Chilean Foreign Ministry, the U.S. Administration offered grants and general benefits that do not compensate the damage suffered by that sector. They noted they have not accepted this solution. Ariztia said the judicial process involves about 2,200 producers and 108 export companies. He added that the private sector has invested more than $3 million in the legal process and that enough resources are left to carry on for at least one more year. Bown said the private fruit producers and exporters have demanded an indemnity of $212 million, while some shipping lines like the Sudamericana and importers in the United States want $230 million.
