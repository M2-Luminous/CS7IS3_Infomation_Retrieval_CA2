It intends to revive communism according to Marx, Engels, and Lenin but with the assistance of the king's "strong hand." Tonyo Zhelev, the party's leader, declared himself in support of restoring the monarchy in Bulgaria. According to him, the key cabinet seats, such as the Ministries of Internal Affairs, Defense, and Finance, could be entrusted to the sons of Simeon Coburg-Gotha. The BRSP is trying to rally all unemployed and desperate people in the country and to struggle against greed for money and for equal rights and fraternity, he declared. The leader of the new party, which has 57 members from Stara Zagora and the neighboring villages, hopes that his party will be legally registered by May 1994.
