That was the opinion reached yesterday by the participants in a session of the Russian Federation Government Presidium which approved as a whole the draft federal program for assisting the employment of the Russian federation population for 1994. Presenting the draft program, Fedor Prokopov, leader of the Federal Employment Service, noted that its operation will extend mainly to able bodied citizens who have work but are at risk of losing it and to unemployed registered at the state employment service organs. Providing information on the employment situation in 1994, Fedor Prokopov stated that one of the most characteristic features of the labor market will be the large army of partly unemployed people who have for a long time been under threat of dismissal. In February this year alone 4,300 enterprises had long production stoppages and 428 enterprises stopped completely. These enterprises have expanded the practice of leave at the administration's initiative. Thus the threat of concealed unemployment developing into open unemployment is intensified. Over the course of 1994 possible "partial" unemployment is assessed at 5-8 million people. Fedor Prokopov also predicts that there will be an enhanced risk of citizens losing work -- the total number of layoffs of workers in 1994 will be 2.4-3.8 million. There will also be an increase in the supply of manpower on the labor market: The number of citizens who did not have work before or who lost it and are seeking work will be in excess of 12 million. As a result of the discrepancy between the supply and demand for manpower, the unsatisfied demand for jobs could be in excess of 6.1 million people, or 8.7 percent of the economically active population. It is expected that the numerical strength of the unemployed officially registered at the unemployment service will reach 3 million by the end of 1994. In the sphere of economic support for employment the government intends to curb the reduction of economically expedient and promising jobs and to promote the growth of investment activity, which creates new jobs, through the implementation of institutional transformations, selective structural policy, and the implementation of investment and other targeted programs. Funds for the implementation of the federal program will be earmarked from the state employment fund and will total 4 trillion rubles. After the draft's discussion at Viktor Chernomyrdin's suggestion it was decided to send the document for further work.
