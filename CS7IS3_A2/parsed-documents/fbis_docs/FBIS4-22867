Baranenko, V.S. Kirov, V.P. Kravchenko (Odessa Polytechnic University), V.A. Korovkin and N.A. Fridman (Rovno AES); received May 31,1993; UDC 621.184.25:621.181.192] [Abstract] Fourteen AES power units with VVER-1000 reactors are currently operated in CIS countries. Each reactor has four steam generators, and 35 of those have already failed, after being in operation for less than one-quarter of their service life. While steam generators abroad fail due to corrosion damage of heat-exchange tubes, failures at AESs with VVER-1000 are caused by cracks in output (``cold'') collectors. The work described in the article was aimed at finding causes of the cracks. Cartograms of damage at 23 steam generators that had been replaced at the Novovoronezh, Balakovo, Yuzhno Ukrayinskaya and Zaporozhye AESs were studied (there was no damage at the remaining AES. It was found that there was a certain regularity of crack location and pattern. It is concluded that the location of damages is determined by design features of the tube plate, on the one hand, and peculiarities of thermal and hydraulic processes in the steam generator, on the other. The damage is of fatigue type. Substantial thermal cyclicity, which affects the collector metal temperature, is caused by frequent PVD [expansion not given] shutoff.
