G. Petrov, Ye. S. Makhniyev and V. P. Semakin, Applied Mechanics Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Izhevsk; UDC 669.054.8;628.3] [Abstract] A high content of heavy metals in sewage is characteristic for all major industrial centers (data for Moscow, Riga, Ryazan, Izhevsk and Chelyabinsk are given). It is essential that these be removed and currently employed methods are inefficient and inadequate. A method is therefore proposed for the utilization of the sewage sediments with a high content of heavy metals using acid reagents (sulfuric and nitric acids). The optimum time and temperature regimes of the process are determined. The developed method, which was tested in large samples of sediment from various cities, makes it possible to eliminate 95-100% of all metals. The purified sediment, after the neutralization of residual acidity, is processed into organomineral fertilizer; a table gives the content of nutrients in comparison with some other organic fertilizers. Another table shows that the residual content of heavy metals in the purified sediment is below the norms stipulated for this type of fertilizers in other countries (United States, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland). The separated metals (such as zinc, nickel, copper and chromium) are relatively easily reworked into concentrates and are used in the preparation of construction materials which are of value in industry. Concentrates of chromium and nonferrous metals are then suitable as raw material in manufacturing processes. The resulting products, completely waste-free, are ecologically safe.
