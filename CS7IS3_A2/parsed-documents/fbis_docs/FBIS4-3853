At their working meeting, the two ministers will discuss urgent issues of mutual concern, including the implementation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's proposal to hold a high-level meeting to discuss Bosnian settlement with the participation of Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. Moreover, Kozyrev and Christopher also plan to consult some European powers and, if the need arises, representatives of the warring sides in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In a statement issued earlier on Monday, the ministry said that "active work of the special envoys to the former Yugoslavia and the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States and the European Union with the participation of the United Nations" must provide the basis for an upcoming high-level meeting on Bosnian solution. "We expect that the Bosnian sides and our partners in the settlement process will take an active part," the ministry said. It stressed that "despite the complexity of the situation, military measures must not overshadow the line for a political settlement."
