And not because incomes did not grow as one would have liked and as had been promised, that military pay was held up for months, and many benefits provided by legislation were frozen. Something else became clear as well: Given the financial crisis, none of the declared priorities of supporting the Armed Forces are going to be met. The situation cannot be relieved by threatening orders from above, bold red inscriptions on financial and economic documents, or other administrative-command methods. As a result, beginning in the second quarter of last year, the Army and Navy began to suffer shortages of the most essential items--fuels and food. And those who entrusted the solution of their problems to all manner of funds created to provide social protection to servicemen were bitterly disappointed. The money had gone down the drain, as they say, and with it their faith in any nongovernmental initiatives in this area. The question must now be posed in the following terms: Will the Russian Armed Forces survive under market economy conditions or not? The market system, as we know, has existed for more than a few decades. It would be strange to think that the world has not yet devised mechanisms to help servicemen adapt to its harsh terms and specific rules. One such mechanism is the creation of military-economic societies. Their prototype arose in Holland back in 1819. The Equipment Capital enabled officers to obtain equipment and supplies of the highest quality at modest prices. Late in the last century, military-economic societies began being created in many of the world's countries -- Germany, France, Japan, Portugal, Spain. In Russia, the charter of the first consumers union for St. Petersburg sailors, known as Thrift, was confirmed in 1880. The Economic Society of Guards Corps Officers arose in 1891 and was the largest up to that time. By 1915 such societies were functioning in the Kiev, Odessa, Kazan, and Moscow military districts and in many large garrisons. They provided their members with discounts on goods and services of up to eight percent off average prices. They did so by opening their own stores, warehouses, and repair shops and by concluding contracts with trading firms, book publishers and others companies under which society members received discounts and benefits. Some military-economic societies created mutual aid associations that supported the families of those who had perished or died of war injuries. The next stage in the development of the military-economic movement was the emergence of associations whose aim was to develop military sciences, equipment, and industry. The best known of them was an engineer officers group that was subsequently known as the Military Personnel Society and later the Military Science Enthusiasts Society. All the societies consisted of subscribers (for one-year periods or for life). In some places officers had share-holder rights. One could also point out that in 1894 all men of the czar's family -- 14 people in all -- were members of the Economic Society of Guards Corps Officers. Members and life-long subscribers received dividends from profits based on the shares they owned and enjoyed a cash premium in proportion to purchases made in the society. The latter benefit was also enjoyed by one-year subscribers. Many societies had a very large cash turnover. For example, the Guards Economic Society increased its turnover from 10.5 million rubles to 1899 to 23 million rubles in 1908. Three-quarters of this money came from trade and cash and securities transactions. How was initial capital acquired? From society members' shares and contributions, subscriber fees, loans and credits, profits from the societies' own activities, from interest earned on securities, deposits, and loans, and from voluntary contributions. It should be pointed out that considerable sums of money from centralized sources, as we would say today, were appropriated to support their activities. For example, the czar built several buildings, including the current Central Military Department Store, and donated them to the Moscow Military-Economic Society. Other facts also attest to the attention the state devoted to these structures. For example, the fact that military-economic societies were created with the consent and agreement of the government. The charters of all societies were approved by the defense minister or by one of his deputies. The defense minister was to be notified whenever a society ceased operations, after which an appropriate order was issued in the district concerned. And now it can be said that a revival of military-economic societies has finally begun in Russia. One such structure arose last year, thanks to the efforts of military and civilian economists, political scientists, and legal specialists; it was registered with the Russian Ministry of Justice on March 22 as the Military-Economic Society. This was followed by the creation of the Russian Economic Society of Reservists. The organizations' main goals and tasks have to do mainly with pooling the efforts of reserve servicemen and officers to protect their interests in the privatization process, improving their living conditions, promoting the country's economic recovery, and increasing the effectiveness of military reform and the conversion of military production. More than 50 regional organizations have been created in the past three months, just recently by the Air Defense Forces reserve officers at Sergiyev Posad, and preparations are being made for a founding conference at the Plesetsk space facility. Acquiring initial working capital is a serious problem for officer economic societies. For such large regional centers as Saratov-Conversion, which has an annual turnover of almost a billion rubles, that stage is already past. That society's members have found mutually advantageous forms of cooperation with local government agencies and with dozens of enterprises in neighboring oblasts, proposing modern technologies, deliveries on favorable terms, and interesting projects. Others are only just forming their operating capital. Membership dues, as a rule, range from the cost of a monthly food ration to 100,000 rubles. Some use monies from mutual aid funds. And officers at an aviation garrison in Tver Oblast contributed a million rubles each from the retirement benefits they received upon discharge. What are the resulting benefits for servicemen, workers, office employees, and those who have already been discharged into the reserves? Society members can buy consumer goods and food products at prices just seven to 10 percent above enterprises' release prices, while prices are marked up 29 percent for those who have not bought shares. That is still cheaper than in military stores, which have to maintain sizable staffs, warehouses, and other facilities and which in some areas have set prices that are even higher than those in commercial stores. Military-economic societies that have direct ties with suppliers pay only for the labor of the reserve officers and family members of the servicemen directly involved in the work. The new structures are not in a position to supplant military trade at the current stage, but they can already stimulate healthy competition in providing trade services to garrisons. The Russian Economic Society of Reservists already has land allocations in a number of parts of the country, has concluded agreements with leading construction and design organizations, and is prepared to start building apartments for reserve officers. Several multi-unit apartment buildings are now ready for tenants. The apartment prices will be 10 to 12 percent below the Defense Ministry's cost, and oversight will be more reliable, since the society members who lack apartments have an interest in this. The next move is up to the government, which has promised to appropriate sizable amounts of money to local administrations for this purpose; it will be important to ensure that the funds are not wasted the way they were last year. Military-economic societies have also asked the government to eliminate the unequal situation of servicemen vis-a-vis labor collective members in voucher privatization. The gist of their proposals is that reserve servicemen and officers be allowed to buy surplus Defense Ministry property and real estate at 1991 prices and that reserve officer economic societies be allowed to operate as (confidential) trusts or lease on favorable terms various repair enterprises, shops, and workshops, as well as to lease equipment and other materials. The Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of Mineral Resources, in conjunction with the Military-Economic Society, is currently devising programs to reclaim lands vacated by the Armed Forces and to use them as farmland. There is no question that many of these efforts could be slowed or blocked if military-economic societies fail to receive psychological and material support from the government and the Defense Ministry. One would like to believe that this won't happen, that the more than 150-year experience of similar organizations in many European countries will be taken into account (societies are currently operating successfully in Germany, Italy, Turkey, and other countries) and that the basis already established in our country will be revived in a new form. But this does not mean leaving people to deal with their problems on their own; we must simply foster conditions that will make it possible to use the enormous potential of servicemen, and above all reservists, in efforts to solve the most urgent social problems.
