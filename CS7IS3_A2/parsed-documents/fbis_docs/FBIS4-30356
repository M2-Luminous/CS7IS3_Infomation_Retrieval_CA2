[Matsuoka] I regret the Hata cabinet resigning en masse at a time when political reform is on the verge of completion. If the House of Representatives is dissolved, political reform will disappear. We were really worried that the Hata cabinet would be voted out of power in the Diet. Political reform should be completed, and a host of domestic and foreign issues should be tackled. The people do not hope for the dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of general elections. I would like to express my heartfelt respect for Mr. Hata's decision on the general resignation of his cabinet. [NHK] The dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of general elections have been avoided. What does the Japan New Party [JNP] think of their avoidance? [Matsuoka] As you know, political reform was initiated by the Hosokawa cabinet and the implementation of political reform has been a task for the JNP. If the House of Representatives were dissolved, political reform would disappear. The enactment of a bill on demarcating the current constituencies will complete the political reform. The JNP welcomes the prime minister's decision to resign with his cabinet en masse. [NHK] Who do you think is desirable to be the next prime minister? [Matsuoka] The next prime minister should continue to push for reforms. The next prime minister should practice politics for improvement of the people's livelihood and pursue clean politics. The next prime minister should rally political forces to overcome the present difficult time. This is what our party thinks. As a partner in the ruling coalition, our party will advocate the need to hold the ruling coalition parties together at the meeting of representatives from the ruling coalition parties. The ruling coalition parties have 180 seats in the House of Representatives, and I believe that the will of 180 legislators cannot be ignored in running the Diet. The ruling coalition parties intend to unite in the future. They have affirmed their intentions to work together to resolve various problems involving the people's livelihood and push for reforms.
