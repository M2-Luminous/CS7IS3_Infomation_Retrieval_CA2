He stated that "the current Dniester leadership has exhausted all its possibilities: it can be changed through anticipate elections in the presence of observers of international organizations." Lebed insists that such elections be held at all management levels. In his opinion, a referendum on the confidence to president Igor Smirnov should be held. Lebed stated that the Tiraspol leaders have no future as "they quarreled with everyone: their friends did not come at power in Russia and they destroyed the economy." Commenting on the terrorist act against prosecutor Luchik, Lebed alleged that the attempt could have been framed by certain Tiraspol officials. "The assassin will not be traced out because he is among us," stated Lobed. He mentioned that everyone points to Bergman to deceive the public. He also stated that Dniester's entry into the Union of the Unrecognized Countries along with Abkhazia, Crimea and other republics will condemn Tiraspol to an eternal unrecognition. Referring to his relations with the Moldovan leadership, General Lebed pointed out that "as long as Mr. Snegur who instigated the fratricidal war is at power I have nothing to talk with him regardless of how much I should be provoked to do this." According to him, the only Moldovan official with whom he discussed was Varnia mayor Cornescu. Lebed discussed with him the fate of the military subunit located near this village.
