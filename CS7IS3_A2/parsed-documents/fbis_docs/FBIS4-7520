[Erceg] How would you interpret your removal from all functions in the party, and the no-confidence vote of your party colleagues from the deputy caucus of the House of Districts? [Manolic] This is in complete accord with the policy conducted by President Tudjman. My political views do not coincide with his views, both regarding Croatian policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina and regarding the functioning of the civic state and the way he leads the party. These three issues are dominant in my disagreement with Tudjman's policy, and that is the reason why the party is initiating these disciplinary and administrative proceedings against me. The Rules of Procedure Must Be Observed [Erceg] After rejecting the belated placing on the agenda of the HDZ deputies' request for your removal from the post of chairman of the House of Districts, you also mentioned the significant political implications that could arise as a result of removing the House of Districts chairman in such a roundabout way? What implications did you have in mind? [Manolic] The issue in question is the observance of the established rules of procedure of the Croatian Parliament, in accordance with which all sessions need to be conducted. You cannot allow someone to place something on the agenda by circumventing the rules of procedure on one occasion, and then denying this right to someone else on another occasion. Therefore, the rules of procedure must be conscientiously observed when establishing the agenda and any changes to it in the course of the session. [Erceg] How would you assess the events that took place at the session of the HDZ's Presidency? Namely, there is rumor that in addition to pressure on you to resign, the removal of several other people was also discussed? Among them are Greguric, Mesic, and Valentic? [Manolic] I do not know whether they were discussed in some other of the party's bodies and forums, but at the HDZ's Presidency session no other names were discussed apart from the ones whose dismissal is already public. [Erceg] The differences you mentioned as existing between yourself and President Tudjman have been evident for some time. Why is it, however, that it is precisely at this moment and in such a way that these differences within the party are being addressed? [Manolic] You know that I have been condemned for three interviews -- in GLOBUS of 14 January, in FERAL TRIBUNE, and the latest interview in DANAS, in which I -- as early as January -- said that Croatian policy in Bosnia was wrong. Namely, I believe that the beginning of the war between the Croats and the Muslims was an unreasonable act. The consequences of this war are terrible, particularly for the Croatian people because they are the smallest ethnic group in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and they have surely had the greatest number of victims. I have believed from the very beginning that this policy was not a good one, that it did not take into account the interests of the Croatian people as a whole. Ways and opinions regarding the protection of Croatian interests in the region of Herzegovina -- where 98 percent of the population is Croatian -- are one thing, but the position of the Croats is entirely different in places where there are less of them, where they are just a minor ethnic group. The Washington Agreement has strengthened precisely this position, that is, the position that peace with the Muslims should realize the principle of maintenance of Bosnia-Herzegovina as an independent and sovereign federation of three constituent nations. The International Implications of the Dismissal [Erceg] Since President Tudjman has signed the Washington Agreement which endorses your current policy, this means that you are on the same side. Where, then, do the conflicts regarding policy in Bosnia-Herzegovina between you and President Tudjman come in? [Manolic] This is precisely the absurdity that precipitates crucial questions. Is this move of Tudjman's a knife in the back of the Washington Agreement, executed by only one signatory? Does this mean that there is no desire to realize this agreement? The removal from political life of those who strived for such solutions before the agreement was signed lessens the chances for its realization and on the other hand presents a chance for those who initiated the war option to proceed with it under new conditions after the agreement is implemented. This means that various reasons will be sought that will block the agreement and thwart its implementation. Therefore, this is essentially encouragement for the warmongers. [Erceg] Do you think that there will be international implications? [Manolic] The very fact that we are dealing with such an act means that it will have repercussions on the international scene. Namely, questions will be asked about the true intentions of the signatories if people, who from the very beginning opted for peace and cooperation with the Muslims in these areas, are removed from politics. [Erceg] It can be assumed that pressure on you to withdraw from all other functions will continue. It is well-known that you are the head of the State Commission for the Normalization of Relations with Serbs. How would your possible removal from this function affect current negotiations with the Serbs? [Manolic] I think that my removal would not reflect well on either the party or the policy we are conducting toward the Serbs. However, the decision is in the hands of President Tudjman who established the commission by decree and appointed me president. Therefore, he can also abolish it by decree. If this is thought out rationally, then I do not expect such a move, however, if irrationality and emotions prevail, then my removal is to be expected. HDZ Is Headed Toward Isolation [Erceg] We have come to the third reason for the conflict -- the way in which the party is led. What, in your opinion, is Tudjman's greatest failing in this respect? [Manolic] The very preparation of the Congress (the HDZ Congress) was unilateral, with the aim of disqualifying those people who had the proper attitude not only regarding Bosnia, but also regarding issues of denationalization and restructuring of the economy, as well as people who, in a democratic option, have embraced the HDZ as their party with all its ideological and political distinctions. You are aware that the HDZ is founded on the ideologies of Starcevic [Croatian politician, founder of the Croatian Party of Rights], Radic [prominent Croatian politician, founder of the Croatian Peasants' Party and staunch opponent of Belgrade centralism, assassinated in the Yugoslav Parliament in 1928], and antifascism, and that these three components are essential to the HDZ. Today, however, by stressing that the HDZ is a party, we are deviating from these components. For my part, I maintain that the HDZ is still a movement based on its primary principles, which unites various political currents on the Croatian political scene. [Erceg] What does the "dissolution" of these distinctions mean for the HDZ? [Manolic] The dissolution of these distinctions means that the HDZ is actually declining into a narrow party-ideological realm that will in any case -- considering the entire Croatian political realm -- limit the influence and activity of the party, which will then, of course, lead it into isolation. The Chaos of the Civic State [Erceg] To what extent is the conflict pertaining to the (non)functioning of the civic state -- which you mentioned earlier -- connected to the growing number of scandals that are becoming public? [Manolic] You will remember that I said in an interview that the results of the functioning of the civic state are catastrophic. Every day we are faced with violence, violation of rights and liberties, illegal and unlawful eviction from apartments. We still face the grimmest kind of drug trafficking and other forms of organized crime. When you compare these incidents with the number of such incidents that were prosecuted, you see how the civic state functions. And it is not by chance that the latest Bishops' Conference raised its voice against crime, violence, and similar occurrences that the civic state is supposed to solve. [Erceg] Can you be plain? Do you perhaps wish to say that there are currents in the party's leadership that are blocking the functioning of the civic state? [Manolic] Such a conclusion is self-evident. The civic state may not function from time to time, but if this persists, then chaos is imminent. If this happens, we no longer have a state, the essence of the state being measured by the degree to which it secures the rights and liberties of its citizens insofar as their personal status or resolving their material and other problems. I Do Not Feel Guilty [Erceg] Are you still a member of the HDZ? [Manolic] Yes, I still belong to the HDZ. You can be expelled, you can die, or you can resign from the HDZ. I refused to resign either from the party or the parliament, although my resignation was demanded. My resignation would mean that I admit to a certain amount of guilt, and I do not feel guilty because of two reasons. As far as the party is concerned, I do not feel at all guilty. As for the House of Districts, I led it in accordance with the Constitution and the Rules of Procedure, and I conducted policy in accordance with the policy of the HDZ. These are, therefore, the reasons why I will not resign and why I am demanding that the impeachment procedure be initiated in accordance with the Constitution and the Rules of Procedure. [Erceg] How do you see your future position in the party and the parliament? [Manolic] There are various possibilities: I may stay in the party and carry out my deputy duties, I may found my own party, or I may become an independent deputy. [Erceg] How realizable is the option of a new party? [Manolic] Everything, including this, depends on the development of the situation. If further complications arise and attempts to block the Washington Agreement continue; if the democratic institutions of the civic state do not begin functioning, then I think that we must build a policy -- together with all other democratic forces -- that will secure this process. [Erceg] Is the demand for your removal and the no-confidence vote of the HDZ deputy caucus evidence that you do not have their trust, or do you believe that this decision was imposed on your party colleagues "from above"? [Manolic] Party discipline in the HDZ is pretty strong. The HDZ holds the majority in both houses of the parliament, and it can make such decisions regardless of discipline. However, a great many deputies -- for reasons of pure opportunism --do not wish to defy this discipline and speak out against such decisions. Deviation From Tudjman's Line -- Expulsion From the Party [Erceg] Your opponents insist that you are completely isolated within the party. How do you assess your own "actions"? [Manolic] If this were accurate, then all these "administrative measures" would not be taken against me. Such measures are essentially a way of frightening the entire membership and creating a psychosis that makes it clear that unless you adhere to President Tudjman's line you can either leave the party or you know what awaits you. In that case you will be expelled. [Erceg] Who, in your opinion, has the greatest influence on President Tudjman's line? Who are these people? [Manolic] I believe that the president himself primarily creates this line. It is Tudjman and Tudjman again. [Erceg] Would you interpret the latest events as a definite rift in the HDZ? [Manolic] I think that conditions for a definite rift have been satisfied. It only remains to be seen whether they will be expressed organizationally or not. [Erceg] Does this mean early elections could be held? [Manolic] In order for early elections to take place, we must first have such a crisis in the parliament that it would dictate these elections. If the rift in the HDZ becomes "operational," it will mean a crisis in the parliament that could lead to early elections. However, I believe that at this point they would not be to anyone's advantage. [Erceg] Is this a definite parting of the ways between Tudjman and yourself? [Manolic] I believe that all this should not yet be taken as a definite parting of ways. I wish to reiterate that everything still depends on developments in the political realm. The political realm still exists, although it has become considerably narrower. [Erceg] If this is not a definite closing of doors in your relations, where do you see the maneuvering space for a "reconciliation" with Tudjman? [Manolic] You see, he too can change his position regarding certain problems. For example, we are sure to agree on the issue of denationalization because it is in the party program. You can block the denationalization process for a certain period of time, but this problem cannot remain unsolved forever. [Erceg] Can you agree with Tudjman on the way to lead the party? [Manolic] That is much less likely to happen. That would be possible only if we were to hold an extraordinary Congress that would not be prepared unilaterally, but according to a completely democratic procedure.
