FBIS4-63875 "drsov102cc_94009" FBIS-SOV-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 26 May ITAR-TASS Carries Press Review for 26 May LD2605070694 Moscow ITAR-TASS in English 0602 GMT 26 May 94 LD2605070694 Moscow ITAR-TASS English BFN ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] [Text] Moscow, May 26 (ITAR-TASS) -- The ROSSIISKIE VESTI newspaper singles out a report on the recent decrees by President Boris Yeltsin, repealing quotas and licences on exported goods and services. The newspaper notes that all firms and organisations operating on world markets will work on equal terms. Efficiency of their deals will be determined not by quotas set by beaurocrats but by demand and supply. The newspaper runs a commentary on whether Russia joins NATO's "Partnership for Peace" and on what conditions. Writing about the discussion of this issue in Brussels where Russian Defence Minister Pavel Grachev is now on a visit, ROSSIISKIE VESTI calls as justified a thesis that cooperation with industrialised nations is a priority question for Russia. "If we are invited to military cooperation," the newspaper notes, "may be it would be good to link this issue with opening European markets for Russian goods." The NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA newspaper carries an interview with Director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service Sergey Stepashin, which he gave on the eve of a meeting between Boris Yeltsin and the service's leadership (to be held on Thursday). Stepashin criticises "some newspapers, radio stations and TV companies" which have turned, in actual fact, into ordinary commercial firms. He calls on them to reject "good profits" if information suggested to them "smacks of bad taste or is supplied by shady people". Speaking of the "classic" presence of Western secret services in Russia, Stepashin expresses confidence that nobody plans to destroy Russia. However, "many do not want this huge state, when it takes to its feet, to become a rising political and economic competitor to Western countries". Writing about the Russian-Ukrainian Government talks on the Black Sea Fleet in Moscow, the same newspaper singles out a desire of the sides "not to declare simply agreement in the spirit of contacts between the presidents but to come to a real agreement". This means, the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA continues, that "politicians in Kiev start understanding the danger of protracting the fleet's crisis, since the fleet's problem, coupled with the political crisis in the Crimea as well as relations between Kiev and Simferopol, can turn into a dangerous detonator for aggravating the situation". Noting that the talks on the Black Sea Fleet are not over, the KRASNAYA ZVEZDA newspaper points to the need for greater caution in forecasting their results, since experience shows that the sides repeatedly came to an understanding on the Black Sea Fleet, which would be later interpreted in their own individual ways. "Let us hope that this will not be the case with the present talks," the daily says. The TRUD newspaper writes about growing unemployment in the Russian Federation. Referring to data from the Russian Labour Ministry, the newspaper notes that "real joblessness is assessed between two and six million people now". In this connection, the daily prints readers' letters demonstrating how national industry "dies away". One of them reads: Russia's only factory producing trolleybuses in the city of Engels works part-time. All grounds around the factory are packed with ready-made machines, since there are no purchasers. This is despite the fact that Russian cities are in dire need of new trolleybuses. This situation has developed due to the fact that the government stopped subsidies to public transport, and local authorities have no funds to replace old machines. The PRAVDA newspaper censures a television report on Wednesday that there is only one million jobless people in Russia. "The concealment of real data on unemployment," the newspaper notes, "can aggravate a social eruption brewing in Russia." Referring to information of the international labour organisation, PRAVDA writes that there are some seven million jobless in Russia, and the figure will rise to ten million by next december. The KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA newspaper writes about fires inflicting huge material damage on the country. According to the daily, "the quantity of damaged areas rose by 50 per cent last year as against the previous figure. Fires afflicted 15 million hectares in the forest and non-forest zones, destroying timber and other materials worth 110 billion roubles. Moreover, fire-fighting operations resulted in a damage worth 200 billion roubles. The St. Petersburg-based NEVSKOYE VREMYA newspaper informs its readers of a scandal which erupted at the end of a conference at the Svetlana Joint Stock Society, one of the largest in the city. The conference which discussed the results of a labour contract between the local and the management over the past year, lasted three days and ended in a no-confidence vote in the factory's managing director Vladimir Bashkatov who was accused of "red-tape and ducking talks with the trade union". If the manager is not sacked, it was announced that some workers will go on a hunger strike right at workshops.
