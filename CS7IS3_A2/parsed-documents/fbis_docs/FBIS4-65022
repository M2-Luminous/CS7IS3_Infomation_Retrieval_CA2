[passage omitted] We will start with the event of the day, the accession of Nelson Mandela to the presidency of the Republic of South Africa. In the past five years in the Elysee you have lived through an amazing acceleration of history; how do you react to what happened in Pretoria today? [Mitterrand] The events in Pretoria -- in South Africa, that is -- are among the most important and most symbolic of the whole history of the relations I would call -- very roughly, of course -- colonization and decolonization. A whole group of men and women who were used to thinking in a different way have abandoned any idea of racism, or at least of any application of a racist system. Apartheid was an abominable system. It took the courage and intelligence of a lot of leaders, especially of two of them -- the black African leader Nelson Mandela, and Frederik de Klerk, the white man -- to make a success of something that could scarcely be guessed at. I am very happy to think that it was here, in the Elysee, that Mandela and De Klerk met for the first time to dine. I had invited both of them so as to be able to contribute to bringing them closer together -- of course people other than me, and especially the two of them themselves have done most of the work. I got to know Mandela as soon as he came out of prison, where he had stayed about 27 years. He came to see me quite often; we often spoke on the phone. I have great esteem and respect for de Klerk. Today is a day of great happiness for me. We have enough painful things. There is some hope in the Middle East, timid and fragile to be sure, but hope nevertheless. And this success in South Africa. [Amar] So there is this hope for a better life, which is like a miracle in South Africa. Yesterday in north Africa, much further north.... [Mitterrand, interrupting] Which comes from the strength of will of a few men, their strength of will, the clarity of their intelligence, and their moral courage. That is not a miracle. [Amar] There is a danger of a return to obscurantism in north Africa, a danger which is costing French nationals dear. Two French religious figures were killed on Sunday [8 May]. What can France do, what should France do, first to protect French nationals? Are you asking all French people living in Algeria to return to France? [Mitterrand] That has been done. They have been advised to do this. We can only give advice. I think all the French people living in Algeria have been told that we, the government and I, want them to return to France to save their lives. If you want clear instructions, there they are. [Poivre d'Arvor] And in the face of the upsurge of intolerance, a number of people are worried about a massive influx of refugees to France. What should the country do in such a case? [Mitterrand] It all depends on the result of the struggle taking place now in Algeria. It is very difficult for a French person to say anything about it without taking extreme psychological precautions. We have special experience of Algeria, we were, after all, the country regarded as the colonizer, the colonial power, let's say. You can have different views about this. France was useful to Algeria, but the Algerians don't like us to say so, or to take a patronizing tone to give them advice in one direction or another. [Amar] May we have your view about what is happening there? The current government wants elections -- it said so recently; if these elections end up with a victory for the fundamentalists, are you not worried about the arrival of an Islamic republic very close to France? [Mitterrand] The Algerian people will do what they want to do. You cannot be a democrat here and question the concern of a people somewhere else to decide their fate themselves. Of course you can hope that they will be more enlightened and that the economic crisis affecting the Algerian people, as it affects many others, will not distort their judgement, that they won't simply react by rejecting those in government to give their votes to others who are promising a kind of society that -- in my view, at least -- is not a society of progress. [Poivre d'Arvor] But we can say that 32 years after the end of the Algerian war the country is adrift? [Mitterrand] Adrift is a strong word. But there is a civil war. A civil war; so this is, I hope, a provisional, though dramatic, conclusion. The country needs to find the right slogans, to find its basic truths. I don't myself think -- since you are asking my opinion -- that it is in fundamentalism, religious fundamentalism; that people should have a faith, that they practice it, that they respect it, that they want others to know about it and to understand it, is reasonable -- but by violence and death, no. [Amar] Violence and death, you say, violence and death in Bosnia. At present 11 French people, 11 aid workers of a French humanitarian organization, Premiere Urgence, are being held by the Serbs. In your opinion, Mr. President, are they prisoners or hostages? [Mitterrand] One can use whichever word one wishes. They are prisoners and they have the value of hostages. They can be used by those holding them as bargaining counters in exchange for this or that political concession or military concession. [Amar] And France does not have the means to bang its fist on the table. [Mitterrand] To bang its fist on the table, what does that mean? Does it mean for example to achieve what it is difficult to achieve in a country one does not know well, which has many natural defenses, which is hilly, and find these hostages or these prisoners -- they are both of these -- and free them? If this were to be the case, then I would not tell you: We are going to do it, but I do not think this would be the right action to take. We would be taking enormous risks with their lives, and I believe that negotiation is still possible. So, as far as banging our fist on the table is concerned, well I do not think so, I think that negotiation must be tried first. [Amar] This hostage-taking reveals much about the attitude of the Serbs. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe was quite pessimistic, speaking in the last few days, I believe it was Sunday. If a diplomatic solution does not come about, he suggested, we should perhaps envisage the withdrawal of the French troops of the UN peacekeeping force. [Mitterrand] On this matter I believe that Mr. Juppe -- naturally, we have discussed this problem together a great deal - Mr. Juppe was speaking above all to all of the countries which have something to say on the matter and can take some action concerning the situation in Bosnia. In other words, the Americans, the Russians, and all of the countries which make up the European Union [EU]. It was for these countries that his remarks were intended. If you do not want to launch serious negotiations among yourselves, and reach agreement [changes thought], there have been partial negotiations, the Europeans have achieved a result which one might have considered to be adequate a few months ago, but it failed. However, the Americans were not exactly involved in these discussions, and when the Americans became involved, then it was the Russians who were absent. As you know, people have different interests -- traditions, old alliances, play a part -- to the extent that we have not yet ever managed to bring together the three interested parties which are external to the local debate, the Russians, the Americans, and the EU, and it is for the French in particular to hold an international conference with these three big powers, under the aegis of the United Nations, with the warring parties, of course. The Russians and the Americans had agreed to discuss the matter in a month's time, although that is already two weeks ago now, and we, the French immediately said -- and Mr. Juppe was our spokesman, since he is the foreign minister -- things must move faster. I remember, I said eight days -- these eight days have already been exceeded, and this is yet more time lost for achieving a return to peace and sparing further victims. We, the French, are there and we are determined to see that this negotiation takes place, because only negotiation will succeed in restoring the necessary concord in this country. [words indistinct] I had not reached that stage yet. Excuse me if I am speaking at length, but the subject lends itself to that. If in fact our partners -- whether American, European and even Russian -- refuse to do this, then it means that they do not wish to give the United Nations the means to accomplish its mission, and France has the greatest number of UN soldiers -- by far -- we have about 10,000 men out there. So, if they really do not wish to do that, then we will have to say that we do not accept a situation in which we are risking the lives of our soldiers for nothing. [Amar] And on a larger scale, one rather has the impression that the United Nations, NATO, and the West as a whole are always lagging behind the pace of events to a certain extent, and that in the end the Bosnian Serbs are going to achieve what they wanted, in other words a real ethnic partition of the country. [Mitterrand] One may fear this, one cannot say that you are wrong, but one has to see what the map of the different ethnic groups -- Croats, Serbs, and one cannot say it is an ethnic group, but the Muslim community -- in Bosnia looked like, to see that the Serbs, who are above all farmers, like the Croats on their side, have already occupied the largest part of the land and that the Muslims were concentrated, are concentrated, in the towns, so what people call the ethnic partition in this case would be quite disastrous. One cannot recognize a principle of this kind, but the real local situation is such that one has to take into account the fact that the towns and the countryside are not inhabited by the same groups. [Amar] The Serbs there are generally spread beyond there. [Mitterrand] Nor do we wish to confine ourselves to a Muslim Bosnia in which each of the towns would be separated from its neighbor, with territories between these towns which would be hostile and in a state of latent war. So, the negotiators have to divide up on the ground the regions in which the Muslim Bosnians, the Serb Bosnians or the Croat Bosnians are in the majority. This is what the negotiators have done, and they have acted properly, but they have not succeeded because the consent of the interested parties is required, and so far this has not been obtained. [Amar] The international community managed to stop the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, and it was a spectacular and successful operation. The international community at first intervened effectively in Somalia. Why has it not managed to halt the terrible massacres that have taken place recently in Rwanda? [Mitterrand] Rwanda now. The situation is not the same. I don't want to make a speech about Iraq.... [Amar, interrupting] No, no. I am asking about Rwanda. [Mitterrand] [passage omitted] In Iraq there was a dictator with a strong army, in a country with a very clear structure, a very ancient and strong country, and once it had devoured Kuwait, Saudi Arabia would have been greatly threatened. How would Syria have resisted, how would Jordan have resisted -- all of them would have been dominated by Iraq. So then it would have become a power bordering on Israel. And you can see what sort of potentially explosive situation that would have been, what possibilities for conflict. If this had been in the time of the Soviet Union -- which still held solid not so long ago -- it could have meant a danger of total war. So you have to realize that precautions were taken there in the Middle East in the way that they were. As for Rwanda, things are different. On a human level they are of the same kind. [Poivre d'Arvor] There is talk of 200,000 dead. [Mitterrand] There is talk of 200,000 dead. If you remember, this was a former Belgian colony, and Belgium has done a good job, and as a European country, has kept a sort -- not of tutelage over it, but let's rather say a sort of preferential association with Rwanda. But since it is a francophone country, France has constantly been called in to help. And we sent soldiers there, both to help to protect our compatriots living in Rwanda, and at the same time to protect Belgians and all the European nationalities there, who asked us to -- and that is what we did. But we are not going to send an army to fight. It is not our job to fight everywhere, even when horror leaps into our faces. We don't have the means to do it, and our soldiers cannot be the international arbiters of the passions that today are shattering and tearing apart so many countries. But -- let's be positive -- we are at the disposal of the United Nations. It was the United Nations took charge of this problem, but which, faced with the violence of the fighting and killing of the two presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, and the advance of the opposition movement based in neighboring Uganda -- because of ethnic affinities -- the United Nations withdrew, and it is not for us to replace it. That is not our role. We are at its disposal. We are willing to be good soldiers of peace for the United Nations. We have to be asked; it has to be organized; there have to be others with us. [Amar] Mr. President, we can see, through this rapid review of the world situation, as this interview will last only one hour, that disorder is still prevailing, there is still fear and threats. At the moment when this fear and disorder still exist, you said a few days ago that France will not resume nuclear testing, neither today nor tomorrow? [Mitterrand] No, wait, let's be precise so things are very clear. In my speech the other day on France's nuclear defense and nuclear deterrence, I announced a decision. This was my decision and it was about stopping nuclear tests. I took this decision and I informed Mr. Bush, who was President of the United States then, Mr. Major who was already prime minister of Britain, and Mr. Yeltsin who is the head of state of Russia. They said yes to me, we will stop, we will accept what is a so-called moratorium, that is, we will not carry out nuclear tests during a certain period of time. At the end of this period, Mr. Clinton wrote to me saying he would like us to extend the moratorium, that is extend the period during which no nuclear tests are carried out. I said yes immediately, of course, because this was in accordance with my position. A second request has recently been made by Mr. Clinton, which is a good idea, and we are slowly heading toward the cessation of nuclear tests. [Poivre d'Arvor] And you added that nobody would do it after me. [Mitterrand] That is why I said let's be precise. Stopping nuclear tests is a decision, it was mine and one of my prerogatives, thus it will be implemented as long as I am here except when it might be modified because one of our partners has gone back on his word and resumed nuclear testing, which would undermine our nuclear deterrence. But on the other hand, when I added, and I was not joking because it was not a laughing matter, with somehow a personal manner, perhaps even with humor, considering the protests that greeted my decision [sentence as heard]. There are some people who want us to carry on with nuclear testing even when there is no need for it. I said to them this is just an expectation; first there was a decision, now this is an expectation. I was addressing -- I don't know who -- my successors perhaps. [Poivre d'Arvor] With those 800 guests, you did not seem to be joking, on the contrary, you seemed quite firm? [Mitterrand] No, I said it was an expectation. I said: You will not do it because this [issue] will involve so many political and diplomatic issues, security considerations and the fact that at the same time other nations, except the five nuclear powers, are prevented from possessing nuclear weapons. We say we don't want nuclear proliferation and at the same time we do the contrary. This discourse is hard to sustain. I think it is a good thing for all the people of the world if these nuclear tests, that is these pollution-prone explosions, do not multiply. [Amar] Mr. President, Edouard Balladur, the prime minister, expressed an opinion different from your own this morning. Francois Leotard said: These nuclear tests are necessary for technical reasons. Alain Juppe said: It is a major point of disagreement between the president of the republic and us. Can this major point of disagreement, to quote him, damage cohabitation until 1995? [Mitterrand] It is a major point of disagreement. I informed the prime minister, the defense minister, the foreign minister, of my decision. I said: There will be no more nuclear testing as long as I am president. Naturally, the day when I am no longer there, those who succeed me will be completely free and this decision will be entirely theirs. I would add as a prediction, hypothesis, diagnostic, that I would be very surprised if they were to do this, because the conditions are difficult [as heard]. Very good. So, Mr. Balladur said something which is quite true -- we have a disagreement, but in this case it is the president who takes the decision. Well, I acted in accordance with my rights. [Poivre d'Arvor] Right, we are going to talk about Europe now. [Amar] Just a quick word on the subject of defense, because it is important. You said something else. You said that if on the occasion of the debate in parliament on the military programming law an amendment is introduced by the deputies concerning the possible use of nuclear force.... [Mitterrand, interrupting] Amendments, yes. [Amar] Or amendments, concerning the possible use of nuclear force outside the country to settle a conflict abroad, you would appeal to the people, in what way would you do this? [Mitterrand] Because the decision is that of the president of the republic. Use of the atomic bomb, the atomic weapon first and foremost, is intended so that there will no war [as heard]. It is a deterrent weapon aimed at ensuring that war does not happen -- not to win it, because if one has a real force, as in France's case, one inspires so much fear, as a result of the destructive capacity of the nuclear bomb, that no one will make war on us. That is the doctrine and it absolutely must be preserved, but once one has said that, one has to be logical with oneself, it does not mean that one must stockpile weapons, make nuclear weapons, when one does not need more, or act in such a way that all the other countries rush to outdo one another and the world ends up going up in flames. [Amar] Does making an appeal to the people mean a referendum on this matter? [Mitterrand] This means that on such a serious matter, which I have attempted to define as quickly as I can, if parliament or the government were involved in a serious disagreement with me, yes, I would ask the people to settle the matter. [passage omitted] [Amar] There is a European country which has just changed its leaders, namely Italy. Silvio Berlusconi is the new prime minister. [Mitterrand] So I'm told. [Amar] If neofascist ministers are appointed in his government, how will you react? [Mitterrand] I think -- this is an embarrassing question, because the problem is embarrassing, but I think that the first right to be respected is that of a democratic people, a democratic regime -- which is the case in Italy. It is important to maintain the sovereignty of this people. It has given many votes to the neofascist party, which will probably be -- which may already be --represented in Mr. Berlusconi's government. [Poivre d'Arvor] This is happening right now because the prime minister is submitting his list to the president. [Mitterrand] Personally, I am not happy about it, but I acknowledge the Italians' right to choose, all the more so because the neofascist party does not have a majority and I don't think that this party can determine Italian politics. However, it will play a role, it is a pity. We must educate, advise, speak to the Italians in a friendly way. I believe that it would not make sense to say to them: We forbid. This is my feeling. Of course, if this party made enough progress to have a majority or to control Italian politics from afar, there would undoubtedly be some problems. [Poivre d'Arvor] You would not mind meeting some of these ministers, would you? [Mitterrand] Would I not mind? I do not feel at all [changes thought], we will see, I would be surprised if Mr. Berlusconi was ill-advised enough to appoint a neofascist as the foreign minister, for instance. I would be really surprised. If he did, he would make a major mistake, but, well, I would only meet the prime minister, namely Mr. Berlusconi.... [Poivre d'Arvor, interrupting] For whom you do not feel any special repulsion, do you? [Mitterand] I do not feel any repulsion. I feel neither attraction nor repulsion. Now that he is the prime minister of a friendly country, I will be very reserved in my remarks. However, as far as the foreign minister is concerned, it is essential that he should be a convinced democrat since he will have to build the Europe created by the Maastricht Treaty with us. [passage omitted] [Amar] How long do you think your successor should be at the Elysee, five years? Seven years? A two five-year term or a two seven-year term? I ask the question because Valery Giscard d'Estaing has relaunched the idea of a five-year presidential term. What is your opinion? [Mitterrand] Mr. Giscard d'Estaing is in favor of a five-year presidential term. He succeeded Mr. Pompidou who initiated a constitutional reform bill passed by the parliament. All that was necessary was to submit the issue to referendum but Mr. Giscard d'Estaing did not do it. [Poivre d'Arvor] But you could have done it yourself? [Mitterrand] Yes, I could have, yes I could have! I was not in favor of the five-year presidential term. Two years before the presidential elections of 1981, I was in favor of a system that seemed better to me but which I find difficult to defend today. I tell you this in confidence: I was in favor of a single seven-year presidential term. I feel embarrassed today. If my successor would like to do it, I think he would be right ro do so. [passage omitted]
