Ibrahim al-Yarabu, secretary general of the International Islamic Missionary Movement, told newsmen in Jakarta today that the NAM had responded to the matter by introducing a resolution that calls for lifting the economic sanctions, but the resolution had yet to be pursued. The NAM influence will be felt further if the resolution is implemented. The UN Security Council imposed the sanctions on Libya following the bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in December 1988 that killed 270 people. Ibrahim al-Yarabu's visit to Indonesia is the second for discussions on the sanctions.
