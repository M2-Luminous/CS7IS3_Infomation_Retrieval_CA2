According to a recent seminar in Hainan Province on the development of China's credit rating industry, demand for authoritative credit assessments and a reliable rating system is becoming increasingly urgent. However, officials and experts attending the seminar said many factors hinder the development of the budding industry. Among the obstacles to development are that: -- Many of the rating companies were launched by the People's Bank of China or other specialized banks, which makes it difficult for these companies to be independent when issuing ratings; -- Although the major business of rating companies is grading the credit of corporate bonds, the issuance of such bonds still remains a small trade and development of the bond market lags behind that of the stock market; -- Interest rates on corporate bonds have little relation to companies' credit worthiness because interest rates in China are set by the government, not the market. This reduces the value of a credit rating; -- The business of credit evaluation is essentially limited to bonds, stunting its development; -- A reliable management system and standard rating indices have not been established. China has no special organization to monitor the qualifications of rating companies; -- Asset evaluation is stealing the limelight while credit rating is neglected by both investors and the government; -- Some of the rating companies sprouting up across the country are unqualified. What China needs is not many new rating companies but national, even international, companies that are experienced and authoritative. Experts are calling for tightened management to ensure that the industry develops properly. The People's Bank of China should supervise the industry while an association of rating companies should be established, according to Shen Lizhong, a member of the Nanjin Credit Rating Committee. Shen also urged authorities to strictly examine the qualifications of companies. Meanwhile, experts say the rating companies must be independent of government, financial organizations, and enterprises and institutions that plan to issue bonds. And experts say interest rates of corporate bonds should be set according to credit grades. In addition, standard credit rating indices suitable for China should be established, according to You Liansheng, an expert from Shenyang. You also said the rating business should be expanded from appraising bond credit to evaluating the credit of enterprises. financial institutions, stocks and various capital projects.
