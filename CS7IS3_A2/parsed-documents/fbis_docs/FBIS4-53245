FBIS4-53245 "dreas096_c_94012" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 North Korea Japanese Group Protests Police Search of Chongnyon Japanese Group Protests Police Search of Chongnyon SK1805044494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0436 GMT 18 May 94 SK1805044494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 16 [date as received] (KNS-KCNA) -- The Japan committee for support to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea issued a statement May 13 in protest against police search of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon). The statement branded the recent search of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and its branch offices by 1,000 police in Osaka as an ill-boding high-handed act which shows the legal status of the Koreans in Japan is not guaranteed at all in Japan. "It is intolerable that unreasonable police repression was committed against the Koreans in Japan who should have enjoyed special protection by Japanese authorities for historical reasons," said the statement, urging the government to take measures to immediately revoke police search of Chongnyon. "Since the prime minister of Japan declared at the Diet that he repented of Japan's past invasion and colonial rule over Korea, the cabinet is committed to carry the repentance into practice under the eyes of the people," the statement said. "The Japanese Government must renounce the hostile policy toward the DPRK, stop inciting national chauvinism and remember that its task is not the military policy for imaginary `emergency in Korea' but normalisation of diplomatic relations between Japan and the DPRK." The statement called for extending throughout the nation the protest campaign against Japanese authorities' repression of Chongnyon and the Koreans in Japan.
