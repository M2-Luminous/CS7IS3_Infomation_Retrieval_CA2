Sources close to the two nations indicated that, as a central focus of Salinas' visit, he and Cuban President Fidel Castro will analyze bilateral political and economic relations and explore new actions to strengthen them. Another topic that is not excluded from the talks at the highest level between Cuba and Mexico is that of the Fourth Ibero-American summit in which the two presidents will participate in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 14 and 15 June. The Mexican president will arrive at 1115 (1515 GMT), and, after receiving honors befitting his office at Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, he will begin private talks with his Cuban counterpart. At the same time, the delegations of the two countries will also meet to examine ongoing bilateral cooperation and ways to promote economic cooperation projects that are in the negotiation stage and, if possible, to conclude them for their signature. Cuba and Mexico have been holding talks to establish joint enterprises in the telecommunications, energy, glass, and textile fields, among others. The delegation which will accompany the Mexican president also includes Commerce Under Secretary Herminio Blanco and Santiago Onate, chief of the president's advisers. This was reported by Mexican Ambassador to Cuba Carlos Tello Macias, who indicated that he must wait for official confirmation regarding the rest of the delegation. Before leaving for Colombia, Salinas de Gortari will meet with representatives of Mexicans living in Cuba and will hold a news conference.
