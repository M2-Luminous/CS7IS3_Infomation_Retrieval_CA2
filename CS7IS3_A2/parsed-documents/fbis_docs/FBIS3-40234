A long debate among experts early last year concluded that an HDTV system is both affordable and profitable for China, especially in the economically stronger east and coastal regions--but not immediately. Though most of China's 800 million TV viewers are still watching black-and-white sets, China's economic miracle in recent years promises that an increasing number of people will embrace the new technology, said Feng Jichun, an official with the State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC). Chinese family incomes are expected to increase sharply in the next few years. Meanwhile, production costs may reduce remarkably with technological improvement. The retail price of an HDTV receiver was 4.5 million Japanese yen ($40,500) when it first hit the market in December 1990. And in May 1993 it was 980,000 Japanese yen ($8,820) for a 32-inch receiver with built-in decoder. As American scientists develop a fully digital HDTV system, which is more advanced than the Japanese analogue one, the production cost of such HDTV receivers will drop to $1,000 by the turn of the century, according to some predictions. Though the predictions seem over-optimistic, it is sure that the new technology will cost less. But however promising the HDTV market, the investment needed to conquer it is too high to be acceptable for China. Japan and European Community countries have poured a total of $3.5 to $4 billion into HDTV research in the last 20 years. The U.S. is also expected to pour billions of dollars into developing its digital technology. Though China has focused on just a small part of the technological development, the scheduled research will still cost hundreds of millions of yuan, excluding that for industrial production of HDTV receivers, said Feng. As the country has much more important fields crying for funds, the government can hardly spare much to make the TV screen more attractive, Feng added. ``My lab currently cannot even afford a complete set of HDTV hardware,'' said Ma Changhua, director of the SSTC's HDTV research project. ``But the research must go on,'' he continued. ``If we stop, it will hand over a huge market to other countries and will cause a loss the country could hardly afford,'' he said. China's national television network has 614 stations, covering 81.3 per cent of its nearly 1.2 billion population. All the production, broadcasting and transmission equipment, plus the current 230 million TV sets and the TV set production lines, will be replaced by new ones for HDTV, he said, because so far HDTV is not compatible with the television now in use. Theoretically, it is possible to broadcast the digital HDTV programmes on current TV sets, but it would produce low-quality pictures. HDTV receivers would perform much better, Ma said. But all depends on the cost of technological development and the industrial production of such broadcasting facilities as well as the time it will take, he added. With dramatic technological development in communications, especially in satellite broadcasting, China can hardly remain an isolated island of bad quality colour TV in a world of HDTV, he added. In developed countries, industry plays the main role in HDTV development, but in China, both the government and the industry are short of cash. There are also some ``chicken-and-egg'' problems for the promotion of HDTV, Zheng Zhihang, a researcher with the HDTV Research Institute of the Shanghai Jiaotong University, said at an HDTV seminar held last year in Beijing. Consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until a wide variety of HDTV broadcasting is available; but broadcasters will hesitate to offer HDTV programmes until there are enough viewers to make it worthwhile. Meanwhile, consumers are unlikely to buy receivers until the cost comes down to acceptable levels; but manufacturers can't bring the cost down until millions of consumers purchase HDTVs.
