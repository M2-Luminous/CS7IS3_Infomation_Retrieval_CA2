[Dembri] We have undertaken to implement the resolutions of last January's national conference. We have indeed concentrated on the transitional institutions. The political dialogue is still in progress with an open mind and with all parties including those who have so far refused to participate (in the institutions). We are very hopeful that the circle of accord will be enlarged in the coming months. I should remind you here that the election process has been programmed for three years from now, but we would revive it even earlier if the circumstances allowed that. [Khashanah] There is an urgent U.S. call for dialogue with the Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] and for giving it a share in government. What do you say to that? [Dembri] We say that Algeria needs all its sons without exception. When we declare that we are for an open dialogue, that means that we do not exclude any political group or political figure if they accept the fundamental conditions, especially the republican regime, respect for the opposite opinion, partisan plurality, respect for the Algerian people's components and sanctities, and renunciation of violence as a means of gaining power or remaining in power. I believe that these conditions should be accepted by those who enter into a dialogue with us. [Khashanah] The gap between the U.S. and French positions is now common knowledge. How do you in Algeria view the two positions, especially the U.S. call for FIS participation in the government? [Dembri] We are now in a transitional stage paving the way for the resumption of the election process. After that it will be the people who will freely decide who is to the represent them in the future. The government's role is to organize this transitional period. As regards the dialogue, it is an open dialogue and it covers the horizons of the new Algerian society based on the rule of law, politial plurality, and respect for the components of the Algerian character. That is important because we in Algeria are Muslim Arabs. These are basic facts which nobody has a right to (claim to) monopolize in the political arena, because they apply to all the Algerians. It seems to me that there are numerous ways of loving Algeria but there is only one Algeria which should be united and uniting. [Khashanah] Should we expect an early release of FIS leaders as a step to build trust and pave the way for national reconciliation? [Dembri] In a democracy, everything is possible. [Khashanah] In the government's view, what are the possible grounds for reconciliation? [Dembri] There are the resolutions issued by the national conference. They have now been submitted to the [TNC].... [Khashanah] But some major forces such as the Liberation Front [FLN], the Socialist Forces Front [SFF], and the FIS have boycotted the conference, so how could the latter's resolutions form common grounds? [Dembri] The political forces you have mentioned did not reject the national conference resolutions, they wanted to add more points. How could they reject a republican regime, for instance? Nobody rejects that. And how could they object to political plurality, respect for the opposite opinion, and the rule of law? [Khashanah] The government recently announced that it had destroyed Saeed Mekhlouf's group and dealt a blow to the fundamentalist groups. Does this mean that the regular forces have regained the initiative? [Dembri] I am not acquainted with the security situation. [Khashanah] How do you interpret the emphatic U.S. call for a dialogue with FIS and the emphatic French rejection of such a dialogue? [Dembri] There are differences of opinion but we Algerians see ourselves as an Islamic Arab society and at the same time we adopt all the rules of the modern political game including respect for the law, individual and collective freedoms, and human rights. Algerian society should now discuss everything that would contribute to its renaissance and chart its future dimensions. We do not need a classification of the Algerian society that is done abroad. I believe that Algerian political groups are intelligent enough and able enough to discuss their own affairs without foreign interference. [Khashanah] Do you not believe that the economic agreements, especially the agreement with the "Paris Club" to reschedule public debts, would help reduce the deficit and calm the internal situation? [Dembri] After our agreement with the IMF and the recent agreement with the Paris Club and the rescheduling of debts, we initiated separate bilateral negotiations with each donor state. The problem we Algerians are facing in this connection is whether our handling of this file should be political or strictly technical. The volume of [trade] exchanges between Algeria and the industrial states confirms clearly that there is an imbalance there and we have been losing since independence and to this day. Between the years 1969 and 1989, that is in 20 years, Algeria got from the Western world $1.5 billion net but we paid the Western states in the same period $2.5-3 billion annually, or $50 to $60 billion over 20 years. So we ask: Which side contributed to the other's development, Algeria or the industrial states? I believe that the third world contributed to the development of the Western countries. [Khashanah] The Moroccan press has been criticizing Algeria's position on the Sahara. Has there been any change in the Algerian Government's handling of that file? [Dembri] There is a peace plan drawn up by the United Nations for the settlement of the Sahara problem. It has been decided to hold a free and impartial self-determination referendum as soon as possible. The UN peace plan is actually derived from the OAU's plan. We should now tackle the issues which precede the referendum and pave the way for its success such as the terms for the definition of identity, the number of voters, the provision of guarantees after the referendum, and the way of organizing the election campaign. There are many issues on which understanding is expected to be reached in direct talks between Morocco and the Polisario, the two parties to the conflict. Algeria's position is one favoring success of that plan but if, during the talks, a possibility emerged of an agreed political solution between the two parties to the conflict, then that would be up to them before anyone else. That would then require political intelligence from all parties. [Khashanah] Will Algerian-Moroccan relations improve after the coolness that has recently characterized them? [Dembri] We do not judge relations by press campaigns which have no solid basis. Morocco is dear to us. Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania have a role to play to strengthen our presence in this world. That is the main aim. The rest is secondary. There is much room for fruitful cooperation and integration between us. Algeria is working on building a pipeline that crosses Moroccan territory. Morocco will get a share equal to 30 percent of the gas carried through it to Europe. That proves Algeria's goodwill. [Khashanah] What is Algeria doing to reactivate the Arab Maghreb Union [AMU], having assumed its chairmanship? [Dembri] There is an extensive plan of action. Everyone appears to want to launch the Maghreb train. We have seen over the past years that the political will is ahead of the bureaucratic executive organs. If we review the results of the six summit conferences since the formation of the AMU, we would find that the leaders approved 30 agreements but only five of these agreements have entered the phase of implementation. That does not indicate a rejection of the march toward integration but it does indicate the existence of a gap and the reason for it is that the political will is ahead of bureaucratic practice, and that must be remedied. [Khashanah] President Zeroual recently sent envoys to the Gulf states. Their arrival there coincided with the escalation of the war in Yemen. What did the envoys carry? [Dembri] We always have talks with the Arab brothers on matters of common interest. On Arab and Islamic causes, Algeria is always eager to be at the forefront of the states searching for solutions and expressing absolute solidarity with its brothers. There is a tragedy in Yemen and it should be tackled in the appropriate manner, which is consultation and coordination with all parties. If the Arabs cannot put their own house in order, what is left for us in this world? [Khashanah] There was talk earlier of an Algerian initiative on behalf of the AMU to stop the war in Yemen. Is that still on? [Dembri] Yes, it is still on but we have asked the brothers in Yemen to stop the fighting before anything else. The Yemeni brothers could then find solutions with their intelligence and wisdom. [Khashanah] What is Algeria's position regarding the declaration of the "Democratic Republic of Yemen"? [Dembri] Yes, there was such a declaration but will it end the fighting and will the Yemeni people accept a continuation of the battles? We first of all call for a cease-fire to spare the Yemeni people's blood and then we can look for solutions. That is Algeria's position.
