Alioune Blondin Beye, UN special representative in Angola, is today expected to organize another face-to-face meeting between the Angolan delegations which are searching for peace. At the meeting the parties will once again discuss political issues connected with the formation of the national police. Of the 12 interrelated points, the national police formation is viewed as one of the most complicated issues in this second round of talks, because the end of the riot police -- the main cause of the present war -- depends on it. UNITA has already demanded the dissolution of the riot police. UNITA and the MPLA-PT have already reached agreement on half of the 12 main points presented by the mediators. Yesterday, Alioune Blondin Beye once again called on the two delegations from UNITA and the MPLA-PT to respect the game rules and the press blackout [preceding word in English]. Alioune Blondin Beye said there is a flight of information.
