A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman has advised that Dutch nationals wanting to leave Rwanda can join the evacuation of the Belgians. So the Dutch are talking about a real evacuation operation involving the collection of foreigners from Rwanda, whereas our government is speaking of a mission to protect our compatriots. Some 100 Dutch nationals live in Rwanda with 30 of them residing in Kigali. The Dutch Air Force sent a 230 plane [not further identified] to Rwanda this morning to help with the evacuation. This happened in consultation with the Belgian Government. The transport plane took off from Melsbroek with a mixed Dutch-Belgian crew. Germany, too, is preparing an evacuation operation. The German Foreign Ministry says that this will happen in cooperation with the Belgians and the French.
