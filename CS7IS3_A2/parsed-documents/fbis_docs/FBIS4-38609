This is $25 million less than planned by President Clinton's administration. According to the administration's proposals, Russia will receive a little less than one-half of the allocated sum. This is Washington's new policy; in previous years it has, on the contrary, alloted Russia first place in determining the proportion of aid to be assigned.
