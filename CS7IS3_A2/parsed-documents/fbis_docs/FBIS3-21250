Even today, work continues to achieve an aggregation of high-level functions, large memory, and a high degree of density. As a result, the number of element per chip has increased, and a demand for 3-dimensionality, which makes further miniaturization of elements and routing possible, intensifies. Moreover, from the standpoint of effective pricing, enlargement of wafer's aperture will be unavoidable. If such demands are to be met, the capabilities of manufacturing equipment used in each fabrication process of VLSI must be improved so that the present limitations can be overcome. Plasma etching equipment is one such piece of equipment. In order to improve capabilities of the existing RF plasma equipment characterized by a parallel flatboard, a method designed to adjust process conditions and RF circuits is tried out, while at the same time an effort to develop a non-conventional method designed to search for low pressure process conditions is being pursued. For this reason, it will be necessary to develop a means of generating plasma. At present, its applicability to plasma etching equipment by inductive coupling, such as ECR and magnetron-method discharge technology, and helicon wave [.sup]1)[/] and RFi discharge technologies,[.sup]2),3)[/] is being searched. This paper will report on the RFi discharge technology with some test results. Figure 1 shows a schematic diagram of a test equipment. Figure 1. Schematic Diagram of Test Equipment RF Plasma Generation by Inductive Coupling This means a plasma generated by the electrical field induced by the radio frequency (RF) currents impressed on electric circuits connected to RF electrical source. Hereinafter, for the sake of simplicity, it will be referred to as RF induction plasma. 1. Heating and Confining of Electrons The process of generating the plasma used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment involves ionization resulting from the collision of traveling free electrons, possessing energy greater than a certain appropriate value, with neutral particles. Since electrons are far smaller than neutral particles, their average distance of free traveling is longer, and under low pressure (mTorr level), even if they gain energy, collision does not occur, dissipating directly at the chamber wall surface, frequently not participating in ionization. Consequently, in order to generate plasmas efficiently, it will be necessary to confine free electrons into a chamber using some appropriate method. The methods of heating electrons currently known are: (1) one which uses inductive electrical field using a parallel flatboard-based electrical field; (2) a method which uses inductive electrical field based on coils; (3) ECR or helicon wave heating method which uses electromagnetic waves. In the case of ECR heating, since electronic energy in the magnetic field becomes discrete in the direction vertical to the magnetic field,[.sup]4)[/] it exhibits resonance characteristic possessing sharp peak when electrons are heated. In the direction parallel to the magnetic field, on the other hand, since electron energy is continuous, it is believed that heating by helicon waves is carried out with a sufficiently wide energy width. Moreover, confining free electrons is accomplished generally by use of the magnetic field; however, in the coil inductive electrical field, by inducing the concentric circle electrical field using the shape of coils, to some extent confining effect can be produced sometimes. 2. Generation of Inductive Plasma Generation Coils used in this testing are produced by changing the shape of the coils described in published reports[.sup]2),3)[/] to an approximately spiral form. We obtained distribution of degrees of intensity of electromagnetic fields using a numerical computation when the exterior of the coil is made GND potential and RF current is impressed. At a point located 35mm from the coil's surface, as shown in Figure 2, we noticed the presence of a strong electrical field at a midpoint between the interior coil and exterior coil. It is reasonable to suppose that centering around this portion, plasma will be generated and diffused to peripheral areas. Figure 2. Inductive Electromagnetic Fields by RF Moreover, since the electrical field is induced in a roughly concentric shape, electrons which acquired energy probably repeat rotating motions changing their directions periodically, thereby gradually enlarging radius and fade on the chamber wall surface unless collision with neutral particles or rebonding with ions occur. 3. Absorption of Electromagnetic Energy When outer magnetic fields are absent, a diffusion relation formula as shown in (1) can be established for the dissemination of electromagnetic waves present in the plasma[.sup]5)[/]: Equation _o_[.sup]2[/]=_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]+C[.sup]2[/]_k_[.sup] 2[/] (1) Here _o_ represents the angular velocity of electromagnetic waves, _o_[.sup]p[/] angular velocity of plasma vibrations, and C the velocity of light in a vacuum, and _k_ the wave number of electromagnetic waves. From equation (1), when plasma density increases and _o_[.sup]p[/] becomes larger, at a certain value, C[.sup]2[/]_o_[.sup]2[/]'s value becomes negative, clearly showing drastic attenuation of the electromagnetic waves. Their attenuation properties at that time is expressed in the following equation (2): Equation exp[-z/�] (2) however, �=C x (_o_[.sup]2[/][.sup]p[/]-_o_[.sup]2[/])[.sup]-1/2[/] (3) Equation (3) is known as the depth of penetration, showing a distance in which the strength of electromagnetic wave is attenuated to e[.sup]-1[/]. If the electron density of plasma is hypothesized as 5 x 10[.sup]11[/]/cm[.sup]-3[/], � is approximately 0.8cm and the distance to the wafer is below 1/7, the LSI circuits on the wafer are likely to be destroyed by inductive electromagnetic waves. Plasma Diffusion The RF inductive plasmas formed on the upper perimeters of the chamber are thought to be diffused to both electrodes. This is where the RF inductive plasmas differ from the parallel flatboard RF plasmas. In other words, plasmas are generated for the most part in accordance with the previously-mentioned electrical field strength distribution. It is conjectured that those in the radial direction fade when they come into contact with the wall surface while those in the Z direction fade on the wafer or suscepter surface. Based on the hypothesis that the plasma density is proportionate to the distribution of the strength of the inductive electrical fields, we have calculated numerical value of the state of diffusion. The result is shown in Figure 3. Assuming that the velocity of internal flow does not exist, we applied the diffusion equation shown as the equation (4).[.sup]6)[/] Figure 3. Plasma Diffusion Equation N(X,Y,Z) denotes plasma density, Q(X,Y,Z) the volume of plasma generated, and D a diffusion coefficient. For the Z-axial direction, we can expect a good uniform plasma with an appropriate diffusion length. Measurement of RF Inductive Plasma We observed several attributes of the RF inductive plasma using the Langmuir probe and the emission spectral measurement method. 1. Measurement by Langmuir Probe Observation state is as shown in Figure 1, and gas is Ar. For probe, we used a PMT product, Fast probe. Figure 4 shows the dependence of electron density N[.sup]e[/] and electron temperature T[.sup]e[/] on pressure. Figure 5 shows dependence of electron density N[.sup]e[/] and electron temperature T[.sup]e[/] on electric power. Moreover, Figure 6 shows the radial directional distribution of ion-saturated currents. We can see from it that as pressure drops, the degree of uniformity of the central zone becomes higher. Figure 4. Pressure Dependence of Electron Density and Figure 5. Power Dependence of Electron Density and Figure 6. Distribution of Ion-Saturated Current in Radial 2. Measurement by Emission Spectra We measured Ar's emission spectral pressure dependence using 1-150mTorr. Luminescence from the 1-2cm plasma on the susceptor is condensed and [spectralized] using a lens on the chamber-side wall. Normalized results based on the maximum intensity of each individual luminescent wavelength are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7. Pressure Dependence of Ar Luminescence In general, emissions from Ar radical exhibited a greater degree of intensity than those from ions. Moreover, the intensity of radical emissions, although differed, depending on transition, had a peak exceeding 10mTorr, and when pressure falls, its intensity also decreased monotonically. Luminescence from ions, on the other hand, increased monotonically when pressure is lowered, reaching the maximum level around 1mTorr. These results demonstrated that the lower the pressure, the higher the electron temperature will become. We let the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas flow and checked change in intensity in the range of 6-40mTorr for each type of luminescence. Its results are shown in Figure 8. In the direction of decreasing pressures, the emission of the CF[.sup]3[/] radical exhibited monotonic decrease while the CF radical ended up having the peak around 11mTorr. The luminescence of C.H.F radical, moreover, showed a substantial increase of approximately 10 times. Verification of its correlation with selectivity will be undertaken in the near future. Figure 8. Pressure Dependence of CHF[.sup]3[/] Characteristics of Oxide Film Etching Using Ar and CHF[.sup]3[/] gases, we performed the SiO[.sup]2[/] film etching to investigate several characteristics associated with it. 1. Uniformity As shown in Figure 9, a gas inlet was provided at two locations. When the Ar gas (100%) was used, the radial directional distribution of the plasma-ion-saturated currents on the wafer, as shown in Figure 6, was approximately uniform. The result of the sputter etching performed by impressing 400kHz bias on the susceptor is shown in Figure 9. Uneven etching speed might be caused by the side positioning of the electrode facing the susceptor. We used the wafer with a Si substrate on which thermal oxide film of 1 micron thickness was grown. Figure 9. Characteristics of Etching with Use of Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] gas, we performed the similar etching. Its result is shown in Figure 10. Etching is proceeding in a region spreading to peripheral area from the [orifura] part. This probably was due to the positional relationship among gas inductive inlet, susceptor, and exhaust outlet. Figure 11 shows the computed value of gas flow on the wafer. Because of the constraint of computing algorithms, although we used a somewhat higher pressure state (20mTorr 100mTorr) in our computation, the diagram constitutes a clear explanation of the etching result. Figure 10. Characteristics of Etching with Use of Figure 11. Distribution of the Velocity of Gas Judging from the result, it will be necessary to design the optimal positioning of a gas induction inlet, susceptor, and exhaust outlet in order to achieve etching at a uniform speed. 2. Etching Velocity Using the CHF[.sup]3[/] (100%) gas, we checked the etching velocity of an 8-inch oxide film wafer. Its result is shown in Figure 12. When we raised pressure by increasing the volume of a flow, we obtained a peak pressure at approximately 20mTorr, and anything above that number has reduced etching velocity. Since it is in the domain in which increase in plasma concentration occurs when pressure rises and since bias electric power is constant, we are yet to ascertain the cause for this, whether it is due to a decrease in per-ionic energy in the sheath or an increase in deposit on the oxide film surface. Figure 12. Pressure Dependence of Oxide Film Etching Figure 13. Etching Shape of Contact Hole Characteristics of Etching by Parallel Flat Electrode For etching process, RF plasma by a parallel flatboard electrode was used in the past. In early days, it was used in a high-pressure domain (number Torr). However, today, as circuits become increasingly minute, application of a low-pressure domain (a few 100mTorr) to etching process has become feasible. In the future, the question of whether both highly innovative new RF circuit technology and development of new process will be able to meet future demands for minute processing of 256MDRAM and 11GDRAM provides an interesting problem. 1. Structure The parallel flat electrode unit is a type of structure already well known and has survived into today, with a few improvements in the electrode peripheral area mechanisms, as well as in a method of supplying RF electrical power, so that it can deal with a low pressure process. 2. Plasma Characteristics Since the parallel flatboard electrode unit lacks the data measured directly by the Langmuir Probe, our description will be limited to that of the emission spectral characteristics. The foremost characteristic of the narrow-gap parallel flatboard Ar plasma is that ionic strength toward radical luminescence intensity is much greater than that of the RF inductive plasma. (Figure 14). Although it differs by wavelength, the ion/radical ratio of the parallel flatboard plasma for the most part is greater by two digits than that of the RF inductive plasma. This is due to higher electron temperature of the parallel flatboard type. With the inductive type, moreover, the number of ions decreases because of ionic recoupling occurring during transport of plasma. Figure 14. Ar Emission Spectrum 3. Oxide Film Etching Characteristics Figure 15 shows the pressure dependence when oxide film was etched using our company product ``TE5000S.'' We were able to obtain excellent results. Figure 15. Etching Characteristics of TE5000S Figure 16 [figure not reproduced] shows the result of etching BPS film contact holes measuring 0.33 microns in diameter. The figure shows good values obtained for etching velocity and selection ratio (against Si). Conclusion 1. RF Inductive Plasma Characteristics Although several types of structures can be suggested for the RF inductive plasma, depending on positional relationship of a coil and a chamber, this time, we used the type in which RF coil is installed facing the wafer to conduct a few of our tests. By using lower pressure (mTorr � few tens mTorr) than that used with the parallel flatboard electrode unit, we were able to verify the generation of plasma with sufficient level of density adequate for etching processing. Moreover, although this structure lacked the GND electrode facing the susceptor, we were able to verify excellent etching of oxide film in which current is designed to flow through the chamber side wall. 2. Problems Although the equipment operates with a pressure level lower than that of the existing parallel-flatboard-electrode-type equipment by one or two digits, because the plasma used is a diffusion plasma. We expect that, in terms of the emission spectral characteristics mentioned previously also, its electron temperature will be somewhat lower. When CHF[.sup]3[/] and CF[.sup]4[/] gases are used, it is natural to expect that each molecule's constituent ratio during the process will differ. Consequently, with respect to oxide film etching also, in order to obtain good results in selectivity involving resist and Si, as well as in microloading effect, an effort to develop a new process will become essential. Moreover, as mentioned previously, since uniformity in generated plasma exhibits pressure dependence, it appears that with the present structure, it is not easy to obtain a wide process window. In order to deal with this problem, perhaps coil part should be split so that each electrical power can be adjusted. If this should become feasible, then the distribution of plasma density can be controlled, easing pressure dependence. If we are to establish such a technology, we believe that it may be possible to use the RF inductive plasma effectively as a future etching device.
