Guided by its narrow partisan interests, for more than two years the BSP has been intriguing and creating tensions and uncertainty among the army's personnel thus destabilizing it," says a press release of the Presidency received at BTA. "Holding a majority in parliament, this political force determined the budget of the Bulgarian Army and now is shunning the problems arising in connection with the support of the armed forces, the maintenance of the combat readiness of their equipment and the continuation of the military reform," the press release says. "The leaders and the print media of the BSP have been grossly manipulating the public, telling blatant lies about the army's actual problems and the president's confidence in the military. Any insinuations about 'purges' in the army and some 'campaign launched to purge its officer cadre' are an outright attempt to intimidate the officers and win advantageous election positions," the document goes on to say. "It is irresponsible to try to seek solution to the problems of the military reform outside the Ministry of Defence and the Council of Ministers, shifting the responsibility for it entirely upon parliament and the president", the President's Press Office says in its release. "As it is in all other spheres of public life, the reform in the army faces some objective difficulties further aggravated by the general crisis in the country. The president of Bulgaria and the supreme commander in chief of its armed forces is convinced that the command of the Bulgarian Army will not yield to such political provocations and speculations and will be guided only by the interests of Bulgaria and its national security in all their activities," the press release says in conclusion.
