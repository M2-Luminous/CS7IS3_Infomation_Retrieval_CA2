"The Russian representative in the Security Council should use the right of the veto in case the issue of air operations of NATO (in Bosnia) is discussed", the Party of Russian Unity and Accord (PRES), headed by Sergey Shakhray, said in a statement circulated in the Duma on Friday. On Thursday Russia called for an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Bosnia. Air strikes on the conflicting sides in Bosnia are "inadmissible and extremely dangerous", PRES said in the statement, adding that the strikes will cause much more casualties than the mortar attack on Sarajevo market on Saturday which claimed at least 68 lives. "In the concrete conditions of Bosnia-Herzegovina air strikes cannot be either limited or selective. The tragedy in Sarajevo market will be multiplied in case of bombardments", the faction said. The direct involvement of NATO forces in combat actions will escalate violence which can spread to other countries and result in unpredictable consequences, the faction warned and said that it is only possible to ensure ground protection of UN humanitarian convoys in Bosnia.
