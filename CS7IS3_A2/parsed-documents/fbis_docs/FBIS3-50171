President Walesa expressed hope that, in spite of many internal problems, both countries "will draw closer and closer." According to the president, the future lies in a Europe of "open borders" and regional cooperation. "We would like no decisions concerning us to be made in our absence," Walesa underscored. According to the president, politicians of both countries are facing the task of opening up to greater economic cooperation. "I believe that we will manage to begin doing good and honest business, as it should be between neighbors." President Kovac said that the Slovak Republic considers friendship with Poland to be one of the main pillars for building its international position. Kovac underscored that, although every state in the Visegrad Group will conclude individual agreements with NATO on the Partnership for Peace program, a "group is the best instrument to contribute to our admission to NATO." To improve security in Europe, Kovac suggested regular contacts between the defense and internal affairs ministries of both countries.
