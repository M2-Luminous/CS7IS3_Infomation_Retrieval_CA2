The Cuban diplomat was interviewed by EFE before leaving the Angolan capital, where he was received by President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and high-ranking officials of the government, parliament, and the government's Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA). "Current contacts between Cuba and the United States are limited to immigration talks, which have not reached a stalemate; certain Coast Guard-border guard contacts; some joint operations against drug traffickers; and a telecommunications deal that is at a deadlock," Robaina said. Roberto Robaina emphasized that the new element in Cuban-U.S. relations "is that (President Bill) Clinton's administration has yet to use the aggressive language that characterized relations between the two countries during Republican administrations." "Even though that doesn't mean much, it is something that may surprise certain people," Robaina said, adding that, personally speaking, he would rather not become "overly enthusiastic." The Cuban foreign minister said he is frequently asked if, as head of Cuban diplomacy, he does not feel some frustration because some of Cuba's hopes have not been fulfilled -- meaning the normalization of relations and a suspension of the economic embargo imposed 30 years ago by Washington for ideological reasons -- with the arrival of the Clinton administration. Robaina said: "I feel no frustration whatsoever, because, personally speaking, I made no plans beyond what is happening and because I understand that the new U.S. Administration is not what it really wants to be." The Cuban diplomat thinks President Clinton is being subject to heavy pressure, above all from the most "reactionary" members of the Cuban community in the United States, who preclude any constructive steps toward Cuba. Without mentioning U.S. black leader Jesse Jackson's recent visit to Cuba, the Cuban minister, who is visiting Angola for the first time since he replaced Isidoro Malmierca in the post last year, admitted that "there are other nobler areas" where work can be done concerning the United States. He said the goal is to create an appropriate atmosphere to someday allow the emergence of much more important elements of the U.S. people and to encourage the normalization of relations between these two countries, which are separated by a mere 150 km of sea. Robaina said Latin America and Cuba are no longer a "priority" for the U.S. Administration, although he admitted that the situation could change given the complex international situation. The minister said Cuba is willing to talk about the normalization of relations if the United States does not come to the negotiating table with "conditions or stipulations," adding that no one in his country would accept "subordinate conditions." "We are prepared to discuss any topic (with the United States) because we believe anything can result if we talk about any given issue," Robaina said, but our "independence, sovereignty, and ability to state our own opinion" will not be on the negotiating table." The Cuban diplomat said negotiations concerning the normalization of relations "should not begin with the most complicated issues," because an appropriate atmosphere must first be created. Robaina said that Cuba believes that "nothing has been gained" by submission. "Life gave us the privilege of seeing that those who began by giving in were compelled to continue down that road, even when they had little left to give." Moreover, Robaina said that during his visit to Angola his hosts told him about the current peace talks in Lusaka between the government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) guerrilla forces. He said they also analyzed the possibilities of increasing cooperation between Luanda and Havana "on a new basis." Robaina, who has already visited Ghana, today traveled to Zimbabwe. He will later visit Zambia and Namibia. Over 350,000 Cubans went to Angola over a 15-year period as part of the so-called "internationalist missions." Cuba withdrew its troops from Angola after signing tripartite agreements in New York in 1988. The agreement did not bring about a normalization of relations with the United States, one of the guarantor countries.
