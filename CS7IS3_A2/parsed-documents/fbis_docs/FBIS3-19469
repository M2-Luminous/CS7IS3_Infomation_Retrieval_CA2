The oil pressure of the hydraulic system of the turbines failed at 1310 [1210 GMT] today, plant manager Klaus Distler announced in Biblis. As a result, the reactor was automatically shut down. The category N (normal) incident was reported to the nuclear supervisory authority in the Environment Ministry in Hesse. It was only a technical failure and did not affect safety, he pointed out. Distler stressed that the oil pressure normalized again within a short period. Once the cause of the failure is discovered, the reactor can operate again. The Hesse Environment Ministry announced that the approval of the nuclear supervisory authority is required to resume Block A operations. In addition, a report by the Rhenish-Westphalian Electricity Plant, which is responsible for the nuclear power plant, has been requested. Block A started operating on a trial basis at 0430 this morning. The precondition was approval by Hesse's Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Alliance 90/Greens) and by Federal Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic Union). Biblis A was shut down last December because of the annual revision. After a fire on 4 March, Fischer first banned a startup, but had to accept the decision by his Bonn counterpart, who favored a startup after a clarification of the cause of the fire.
