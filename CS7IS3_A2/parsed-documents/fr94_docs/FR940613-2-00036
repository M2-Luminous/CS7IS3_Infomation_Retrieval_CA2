FR940613-2-00036 FR940613-2-00022 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;273&hyph;000] Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation; Compliance Filing June 7, 1994. Take notice that Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) on June 1, 1994, tendered for filing a filing in compliance with the Commission's May 31, 1994 Order (Order) in this docket containing support for the reconciliation of transportation and exchange imbalances. Columbia states that the Order stated that ``[i]f Columbia intends to propose recovery of T&E imbalances during the nine-month close-out period [October 31, 1993 to July 31, 1994], Columbia should provide complete support for such a proposal.'' (Order, mimeo at p. 7). The nine-month close-out period is specified in section 39 (section 39) of the General Terms and Conditions of Columbia's FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1. On May 2, 1994, Columbia filed a request for rehearing of the Order in which, among other things, Columbia indicated that it would make the instant filing in connection with the Commission's statement regarding transportation and exchange imbalances. In this compliance filing, Columbia is also seeking a waiver of the nine-month close-out period in section 39 that ends July 31, 1994. Specifically, Columbia is requesting that the Commission extend the close-out period for an additional eight months to March 31, 1995. Columbia states that copies of the filing were served upon each of Columbia's former sales customers and interested State Commissions, and to each of the parties set forth on the Official Service List in these proceedings. Any person desiring to intervene or protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedures (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All such interventions or protests should be filed on or before June 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceedings. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's rules. Copies of Columbia's filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
