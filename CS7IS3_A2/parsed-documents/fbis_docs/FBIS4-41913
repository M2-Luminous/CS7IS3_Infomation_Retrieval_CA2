Tentative data indicate that 68.4 percent of the electorate (more than 25 million people) participated in the elections, and, consequently, the elections are valid. Final results regarding individual people are still being summarized, but it cannot be ruled out that there will be the second round of both presidential and local elections, but one can already discuss certain trends. First, the activity of those who came to more than 30,000 polling stations indicates that the people in Ukraine are still interested in renewing the power at all levels. Second, compared with the parliamentary elections, the activity of the people abated, even though its main pattern has remained: The voting was more active in the West, more passive in the south, and the center showed the "golden mean." As before, the capital added its "negative" touch -- less than 52 percent of the electorate voted in Kiev. Third, only final results will show which political forces and where prevailed, but it may already be asserted that the very fact of elections that have taken place indicates that, despite the possible sharp political regionalization (the "left wing" in the east and south and the "right wing" in the west), no one spoke against the existence of the Ukrainian state. The dissimilar political preferences are nothing but indications that there exist dissimilar visions of the approaches to building both the local and general state order. Therefore, the main task of official Kiev is to find such a model of state building as would balance out the political differences. This is precisely the case when the general state consensus must be based on values common to all people. For example, political confrontation must be abandoned for the sake of overcoming crisis phenomena and improving the standard of living of the people. There may be dissimilar roads to this in different areas. Yet another conspicuous (at least in words) characteristic of these elections was the fact that none of the presidential candidates spoke about excessive politicization. On the contrary, everyone spoke about the building of such an independent state, which must be underlain by a sound economy. At the polling stations in Kiev where Ukrainian presidential candidates spoke, we managed to record ideas of some of them about the main principles of our state's existence. We offer them for your attention. L. Kravchuk (on the main result of the election campaign and private ownership): "I visited many regions and became convinced that the people want to have their own state. It is true that the people disagree with leaders and their policy, but they are not against the statehood. Nor do they, incidentally, oppose private ownership, as some people maintain. If a citizen wants to have his private property, let him have it. It is only necessary to specify its status, rights of ownership, and the mechanism for its protection. There will be no democracy without [private] ownership. If a person is not free economically and if he cannot freely use his property or the results of his work, there will be no democratic development." I. Plyushch (on proposals with regard to a Slavic conference): "It cannot be done the way they want. It takes years to do such things, they must be allowed to ripen. We have not even ultimately divided the Union, but are already trying to create something else. We must bring the previous process to its logical completion, create a CIS market, and then, possibly, create something new. Radical measures are only proposed when one wants to do harm to someone." L. Kuchma (on Ukraine's future): "Ukraine needs new technologies and new equipment. Everything else is mere talk. Ukraine does not need philanthropic assistance. Europe and America must proceed from this and must determine what kind of Ukraine they want to see: economically strong or something else. "I was asked about my first steps in case I am elected president. I answer: Everybody must feel that a real master has appeared in Ukraine and that the situation, which prevails today, when nobody heeds others, must end." V. Lanovyy (on governing the state): "The main thing is to have local self-government so that those leaders who receive powers would be answerable. It is not so important whether these are left or right-wing forces. They have received their mandates and will be under the control of those people who elected them and may recall them. "I am in favor of having presidential representatives in the provinces, representatives who supervise the fulfillment of the general state legislation. However, in addition to that, we must constitutionally approve restrictions to the legislative powers of local councils. If there are no such restrictions, other regions may follow in the footsteps of the Crimea." Other leaders also care and will care about strengthening the Ukrainian state and, therefore, these elections have constituted yet another step toward crystallizing the Ukrainian political elite whose absence is anyone's talk.
