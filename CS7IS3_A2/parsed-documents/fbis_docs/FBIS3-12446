In a bid to explain away the savagery perpetrated at the Ibrahimi Mosque, Rabin contends that it is the enemies of peace who stand to benefit from the massacre. He chooses to forget that those with Arab blood on their hands are the ones who have been hampering every effort to advance the peace process since the Madrid conference. Rabin, who is shedding tears over peace, himself leads the opposition to disarming the settlers. This means that he condones their atrocities and even wants them to continue. The massacre that has sent shockwaves throughout the world has prompted the Arabs to suspend their participation in the bilateral talks. Not that they are thus terminating the peace efforts; they are, in effect, telling the sponsors of the peace process to wake up to their responsibilities. The first of these is to curb Zionist terror in the occupied Arab territories and south Lebanon, and then to persuade the Rabin government to relinquish its intransigent posture and embark on serious negotiations based on a real and clear commitment to vacating the entire occupied Arab territories in compliance with UN resolutions.
