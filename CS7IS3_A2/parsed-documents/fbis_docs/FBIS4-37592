FBIS4-37592 "drnes121bb_94001" FBIS-NES-94-121 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Inter-Arab Affairs League Chief on Yemen, Libyan-Western Crisis, Iraq League Chief on Yemen, Libyan-Western Crisis, Iraq NC2206184594 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1618 GMT 22 Jun 94 NC2206184594 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Cairo, 22 Jun (MENA) -- Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has renewed his call to the Yemeni belligerents to abide by the UN Security Council's cease-fire resolution to safeguard the lives of the Yemeni people and to enter into a constructive dialogue to promote security and stability for the fraternal Yemeni people. He expressed the Arab League's readiness to do its utmost to achieve this goal. In an interview with the weekly magazine AL-MUSAWWAR published today, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the fighting between brothers in Yemen has led to divisions and exacerbated the crisis. He expressed the hope that the two sides in Yemen will resume their dialogue as soon as possible. Asked whether South Yemen has submitted an application to the Arab League to become an independent member, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said: Yes, it did, but no action has been taken. The application is held in the General Secretariat until the Arab League Council holds its next meeting. Asked about the internationalization of the Yemeni crisis and the fact that some states prefer to refer Arab problems to the United Nations, the Arab League secretary general pointed out that North Yemen was the one that first objected to Arab League mediation, because, as the Yemeni officials said, this is an internal matter. He said that North Yemen objected not only to Arab League mediation but also to UN mediation. Regarding the Libyan-Western crisis and whether Libya has accepted the Arab League's proposal to conduct the trial of the suspects at the International Court of Justice in The Hague according to Scottish law and with Scottish judges, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid expressed his thanks to the Libyan leadership for accepting this delicate and sensitive political and legal situation. He noted in this regard that the recent Nonaligned Movement foreign ministers' conference in Cairo supported this initiative. He said that contacts have been held with UN Security Council member states and the European Union in this regard, and the atmosphere is completely suitable for discussing the means to achieve a peaceful settlement to this problem. He added that this will prevent an escalation of the Libyan-Western crisis in August, sparing the area further tension. He noted that a number of European countries who have interests in Libya do not want an escalation of the crisis and are ready to listen to Libya's views on the issue. Regarding the embargo on Iraq, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid expressed hopes that the embargo will be lifted and that the Iraqi people will enjoy freedom, security, and stability. He said that everything is in the hands of the Iraqi Government. It can ask the UN Security Council to lift the embargo after it implements the UN resolutions, including those concerning recognition of Kuwait's sovereignty, the border demarcation, compensation, and the prisoners. Regarding Israeli operations in Lebanon, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that what Israel has done and is doing against Lebanon is contrary to peace. He affirmed that Lebanon has the right to defend its territory and to demand the withdrawal of the Israeli forces. He added that if Israel really wants peace in the area, it must stop its actions and embark on serious and effective negotiations to avoid operations by the Lebanese resistance, which is defending itself and trying to end the occupation. This, he said, is a legitimate right that applies to Lebanon, Syria, and the Palestinians, just as it applied in the past to Egypt before the liberation of its national territory.
