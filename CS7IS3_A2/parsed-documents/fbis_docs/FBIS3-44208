The two Commonwealth delegates who arrived in the country to try and assist the government in quelling the situation, Dr. Moses Anafu and Mr. Max Gaylard, told the media that there was unanimous support from the political leaders to help in the ending of the hostilities. However, Mr. Gaylard did not rule out the fact that there was still a danger that further fighting might break out. As to what the Commonwealth would do if the situation worsened, resulting in the toppling of the government by force, Dr. Anafu said the Commonwealth would not hesitate to take harsh measures. They expressed optimism that their discussions with representatives of the two warring army factions would be fruitful and end the crisis.
