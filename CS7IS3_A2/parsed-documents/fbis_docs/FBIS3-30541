The Administration is made up of eight organizational units, four warehouses, and EAN [European Article Numbering] Slovakia, a budget-funded organization. The SSHR employs 200 people. As SSHR Chairman Peter Ryska stressed at a news conference yesterday, it is not necessary to keep the SSHR's existence and operations secret, as was the case until recently. Quite the contrary, citizens should know that there exists a state agency, whose objective it is, in cooperation with individual government departments (economy, health care, transportation, and so forth), to secure an adequate level of supplies in order to ensure the operation of the economy and to supply the population with vital basic provisions in extraordinary situations (natural disasters, epidemics, local conflicts, and the like). The state material reserves consist of several thousand items, among which are, for example, fuels, cereals, pharmaceuticals, staple foods, industrial raw materials, and nonferrous metals. Essential food reserves are generated so as to last 10 days and fuel reserves so as to last up to 40 days. As transpired from SSHR Chairman Peter Ryska's words, however, even this specific agency must today contend with a deficit, which amounts to 200 million korunas. With respect to some items, the SSHR's budget does not reach even 50 percent of the 1993 level. The SSHR regards as its priorities this year the approval of the bill on state material reserves and the passage of the law on mandatory reserves of oil, oil products, and the distribution system. The task for the next few years will be to follow the example of advanced countries and to transfer the burden for generating material reserves from the state to producers and retailers and, with respect to specific reserves, such as staple foods, for example, to the population.
