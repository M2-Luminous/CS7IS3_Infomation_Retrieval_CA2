It is by coming here that you understand." [French Senate Chairman] Rene Monory thinks that the French -- particularly their politicians -- are not sufficiently aware of what is happening in China and in the "little dragons." "The French political world is introspective," he remarked in the plane taking us to China. "You have to travel to gauge things. Politicians do not travel." Gauging things... It is true that present-day China in ferment, where the Senate speaker has just spent a week, provides unsuspected prospects for the French who are facing economic stagnation -- or minimum expansion. China, whose GNP increased by 13 percent last year, has experienced a prodigious explosion in economic activity over the past 15 years, particularly in the "special economic areas." And this explosion is reflected on the ground in a prodigious growth in factories and skyscrapers. The Senate speaker, China's official guest, was primarily tasked with a diplomatic mission: To contribute to the improvement in relations between France and China. And through that to work to ensure that the visit which Edouard Balladur makes to this country in early April takes place in the best possible conditions. The conversations which Mr. Monory has had with his Chinese hosts suggest that the situation is being clarified, and that the prime minister's visit will be profitable. The Senate speaker was received in Beijing not only by Qiao Shi, speaker of the National People's Congress, but also by Premier Li Peng who gave a dinner in his honor, by Vice President Rong Yiren, and by the deputy foreign trade minister and the chairman of the equivalent of the CNPF [National Council of French Employers]. In a country where signs and symbols are extremely important and where custom dictates that a speaker of a foreign assembly is only received by his counterpart, this hospitality stands out. Heady Pace of Expansion Li Peng said: "We hope that Mr. Balladur's visit will be a complete success," and Vice President Rong Yiren judged this forthcoming visit as "very important" for the development of relations between the two countries. "We are in favor of constantly promoting relations between the two countries," the Chinese vice president told the Senate speaker. "I hope that the period of uncertainty will be forgotten, and that we will return to the atmosphere of friendship which has reigned between us for 30 years," Mr. Monory replied. Franco-Chinese relations had a close shave: The case of the contract for the sale of Mirage planes to Taiwan is only slowly being accepted. Not one of the leaders with whom the Senate speaker met failed to stress the "problems" and "vicissitudes" which these relations have experienced over recent years. The Canton consulate general, opened in 1991, had to be closed the following year at the request of the Chinese, and the RATP [Independent Paris Transport System] lost the Canton subway deal. However, the Chinese leaders wanted nothing more than to respond to the French desire to reopen dialogue, if only to diversify their partners, which, moreover, they like to see in competition with each other, and to benefit from our know-how. The rapprochement brought about at Mr. Balladur's initiative resulted in the communique jointly issued on 12 January in which France pledged in particular not to sell any more arms to Taiwan. It is in this atmosphere that the Senate speaker's visit was made, a few weeks after that of Alain Peyrefitte who was also tasked with strengthening ties. Mr. Monory had been invited a year ago by the National People's Congress. The visit had been postponed several times at the premier's request. To prevent the Senate speaker from being rebuffed and to ensure that his visit effectively formed part of the reconciliation started, the publication of the joint communique had to be awaited. Mr. Monory vaunted the excellence of French technology in a number of spheres to the Chinese officials: transportation, the nuclear industry, aeronautics, and so forth. "We have the best high-speed train in the world," he said, for instance, to Qiao Chi between the sizzling beef and the soft turtle stew. According to him, the only way in which our country can return to growth is to find outlets for its industries in this region of the world in which a good part of the world's economic growth is concentrated. French enterprises -- for instance Mr. Monory visited the Peugeot factory -- are participating in Chinese development by joint ventures, which are often very effective but of which we have far fewer than the Germans. The stages of his visit merely confirmed this idea in him. Shanghai, an urban jumble all blended together, in which slums doomed to disappear mingle with houses bearing the nostalgic charm of the former concessions, and brand new skyscrapers, and in which the municipality has undertaken to build in 10 years an area similar to but bigger than the Paris Defense area in the new Pudong district. Canton, then Shenzen, a city of 3 million inhabitants which has emerged from nowhere in about 10 years. Finally Hong Kong, a replica of Manhattan, which has no reason to envy its model, which is destined to rejoin China in three years' time while maintaining its economic status. The Senate speaker is a little more enthusiastic than the Chinese themselves about their future: "How long do you think you will need to catch up with us? Will it take 15 years, 20 years?" he asked Qiao Shi. "A century," the chairman of the People's Congress replied. But for a Chinese that is a relatively short prospect given the scale of China's history.
