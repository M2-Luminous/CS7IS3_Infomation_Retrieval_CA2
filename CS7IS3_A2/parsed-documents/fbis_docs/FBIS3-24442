[Dorofeyev] We are coming to the end of the first quarter of 1994. But as far as I know, a draft budget has not even been examined at sessions of your State Duma committee. [Zadornov] The country is "crawling" into the second quarter without an approved budget. Six weeks have been set aside for the review procedure in the Federal Assembly's lower chamber, but you should add another two weeks to enable the Federation Council and the president to carry out the same work. Which means that, even in the most favorable conditions, a draft budget cannot be approved before the end of May. But this is the most optimistic scenario. As you know from press reports, the draft budget is the object of much fierce fighting within the Russian Government. The story of 1992-1993 is being repeated, when a delay in submitting this extremely important document for the country to parliament meant that it had to be examined in double-quick time, which subsequently resulted in major amendments to and disruption of all the work that was required both to prepare and to implement the draft budget. [Dorofeyev] This seems to be yet another negative tradition in post-Soviet Russia. What is its primary cause? [Zadornov] Ignorance on the part of the executive of the law on the budget structure and the budget process in the Russian Federation. Some may retort that last year's budget and this year's were submitted to parliament behind schedule owing to objective factors of our internal political life. But there is nothing more pernicious than ignorance of the law in the name of day-to-day expediency. Unfortunately, precedents such as these become implanted in the mentality of state figures and are transformed into negative habits. [Dorofeyev] In other countries the budget is the basis of everything. What about our country? [Zadornov] The budget should also play the same role in Russia. Since there are no more state plans, there is only an economic forecast for the current year prepared by the government. The budget is therefore a fundamental document which determines the country's economic policy. In my view, the lack of a draft budget at the proper time is in many ways indicative of the fact that the present government also lacks a considered and consistent policy. [Dorofeyev] Let us assume that you are not familiar with the main points of the future budget. But in your view, what should the fundamental principle of this document be? [Zadornov] First of all I would like to get an answer to a question that is fundamental in my view: What is the government's current policy? I would like the draft budget to shed light on the overall approach to economic policy and I would certainly like it to envision groundwork for the future. For example, priorities in the structural restructuring of industry and priority social programs. In order to make it clear which sectors or groups of enterprises are known to be unprofitable and likely to go bankrupt. As a result of this, we can realistically anticipate how much unemployment to expect and how much money the government will need to spend in order to alleviate the negative consequences of these processes. Second, I would like the present budget to be realistic. Just look at the budget transformations we witnessed in 1992 and 1993. Initially a very tough budget was approved. At the same time it was stated that inflation would be between 3 and 5 percent by the end of the year. But already by the following month, and two months later at the most, the government itself started to ignore the budget it had approved. And then we had a chain reaction on our hands. What disturbs me most in the draft of the present budget? The promise that yet again we will witness 3-5 percent inflation by the end of the year. I would prefer to see a slightly larger budget deficit in the draft, provided there are specific indications that it is required to implement social programs. [Dorofeyev] Does it not seem to you that the budget deficit is a bit of a bugbear? America lives with a budget deficit. [Zadornov] Not just the United States. Last year the British budget deficit amounted to almost 9 percent of GDP. The Italian and French deficits are at least 5 percent of GDP. Although countries which have expressed a desire to join the European Currency Union have been presented with the condition that they must limit the size of their current budget deficit. With the exception of two or three states, no country in West Europe can be said to belong in this category. Because a budget deficit is a big problem for any state and it cannot be resolved in a year. [Dorofeyev] On 3 March we were shown a government session on television. A number of fat volumes were lying on the premier's table. The newsreader announced that the draft budget had basically been approved by the government. And then the press flashed reports that the Ministry of Defense, the agrarian lobby, and many others were unhappy with the agreed budget. [Zadornov] You know, in any country the budget is a document that cannot please everyone. Because there will always be differences of opinion between the budget planners and the demands, submissions, and proposals of ministries, departments, and social groups. The latter group always asks for more whereas the former allocates less. But the fact that the draft budget had basically been approved by the government 3 March demonstrates something quite different: Nobody in the government was able to suggest any serious, comprehensive alternatives to the agreed version of the budget. Even though the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defense, in particular the State Committee for the Defense Sectors of Industry, have major differences of opinion about this draft of the budget. But I am interested in the position of the government chairman as the conductor of economic policy as a whole. The financial element is undoubtedly important, and the size of the planned budget deficit and the inflation rate are equally important indicators which act as guidelines. But they should be factored into the very economic policy which provides answers to the questions: What will the country live on for the specific year in question? On export sectors? Which ones exactly? How will income be distributed? How big will the Army be and how will Army cutbacks be implemented? How will we begin to implement the mine closure program, for example, which the government has planned to carry out before the year 2000? You must understand that I am using a few examples to demonstrate that this document should contain answers to issues relating to the development of the economy as a whole and the development of its most important sectors, while at the same time it should enshrine mechanisms for redistributing financial and labor resources. In other words, the budget should not be approached from rigid positions. [Dorofeyev] If you had to work on the draft, what guiding principles would you use to agree on an acceptable budget for the country? [Zadornov] In the current year, unfortunately, there is little that can be changed. But if I were to take part in preparing next year's budget, I would put the accent on cutting expenditures, which is an important objective in itself, and on relieving tax pressure. It is already clear that we have already completely exhausted the policy which has been pursued over the past two years, that of increasing the tax scale and beefing up the ruthless penalties for late payment of taxes. We must therefore avoid any abrupt changes in course and switch gradually and carefully to a policy of reducing the tax burden. I would reduce the tax on profit, for example, if profits were to be used for investment purposes. A second aspect of this problem is the fact that some enterprises, particularly those engaged in foreign economic activity, have avoided paying taxes. It is unlikely that administrative or fiscal measures will achieve anything in this instance. We apparently require some sort of social contract between the State Taxation Service, the Ministry of Finance, and the tax police -- basically, between government as a whole and business. I think that directors of major enterprises and businessmen have a very good idea about the tax threshold which would be acceptable to them in the present circumstances. If we agree to this threshold, or even to a figure slightly above it, then I believe that by cutting taxes we would gain rather than lose because the total volume of revenue would increase. Finally, the problem of the regions. Some of them have special tax arrangements whereby they do not consider it incumbent upon them to pay federal taxes. The whole tax-break system is far from sound. Tax breaks as a whole represent colossal sums. Someone has to make the political decision to make all components of the Federation equal in terms of budget and taxation arrangements. All should pay taxes into the federal budget and pay them on equal terms. [Dorofeyev] Let us come back to the "94 budget." This budget stipulates, for example, that only 0.3 percent of GDP has been earmarked for cultural needs, and a slightly larger sum is to be spent on science. Is this right? [Zadornov] No. But this is a problem of priorities. I believe that culture, science, and education form one of these priorities. This is the foundation of the country's future. Our "Yabloko" [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin] bloc would also add children's health care to the list. Here too, we believe, these priorities should not be dependent on overall shortfalls in revenue; they should be protected by specific statute. [Dorofeyev] But who will determine the priority approach and how? [Zadornov] This is a question of state policy. It is the state's business to formulate clear and lucid criteria and a procedure which enables these criteria to be discussed in society and the appropriate state organs. Incidentally, in discussing the draft budget our committee intends to listen to and take account of the opinion of all committees and commissions. We do not have much time, but we will hold fairly wide-ranging parliamentary hearings into this problem.
