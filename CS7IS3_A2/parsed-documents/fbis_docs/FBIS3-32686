Del Valle said that Guatemala's intention is for the maximum institution on world trade to voice its opinion on the legality or illegality of the U.S. ruling with regard to the import of this product. The agriculture minister indicated that the United States has forced the large cigarette companies to purchase 75 percent of their tobacco needs from U.S. producers, thus violating a GATT regulation. That measure, he noted, implies that the nation's import of tobacco would be limited to 25 percent of consumption. This is the reason it was decided to file the suit before the GATT so it may in turn issue its opinion as to whether this measure is in keeping with its mechanisms or not. Gonzalez said that nations in Latin American, including Brazil, that have been adversely affected by the U.S. measures also joined in the suit. The foreign trade minister said that Guatemala maintains close contact with these nations to set up a structure similar to the one organized for the banana case, that is, to unite Latin American positions in this regard. In another turn of events, the foreign trade minister said that the meeting slated for 7-8 February between Mexico and the Central American Northern Triangle [El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras] has been postponed until a latter date that could be 21 February. Gonzalez indicated that the reason for suspension of the meeting was that the Group of Three (Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela) did not reach an agreement. This situation forced the Mexicans to request the meeting to be delayed to analyze its current position. To conclude, Gonzalez said that Guatemala's position is to gain better access for our products in the Mexican market, as a series of difficulties have been registered with merchandise such as carton boxes, lamina [not further specified], and sugar.
