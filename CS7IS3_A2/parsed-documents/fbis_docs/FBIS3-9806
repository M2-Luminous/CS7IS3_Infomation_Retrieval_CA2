Kiraly, parliamentary deputy and chairman of the Hungarian Interest Party, by Laszlo Danyi; place and date not given: "The Hungarian Democratic Forum Is A Big Wooden Trojan Horse"] [Text] Parliamentary Deputy Izabella B. Kiraly is the chairwoman of the Hungarian Interest Party [MEP], founded on 7 September 1993. Her young party -- which characterizes itself as a national, conservative, Christian, democratic, and pragmatic party -- differs from Istvan Csurka's Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP] not only through the one letter in their acronym but also because, unlike the MIEP, the MEP does not think in terms of restoring St. Stephen's Hungary, but it regards the beginning of a Hungarian presence of a much older time. The MEP does not relate to the Jews' identity problems, and it supports the just efforts of the international Gypsy king to create, like the Jews, their own homeland, Romanistan, in the Danube Delta. [Danyi] When did you leave the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF]? [Kiraly] I do not remember exactly. [Danyi] When did you first feel that that was the end regarding the MDF? [Kiraly] I already suspected for a considerable time that the MDF was a big wooden Trojan horse, in other words, it no longer spoke about the things that it used to at the beginning, and it was not carrying out its promises. The great protest of the government forces came in the wake of the Trianon Meeting held on 4 June 1993 and my parliamentary speech on the Hungarian-Ukrainian basic treaty, in which I urged a peaceful reunification of the Carpathian Basin. Then I fell victim to ethnic cleansing. I also know that these events can be traced back to the demonstration held in Kossuth Square on 23 October 1992, in which President Arpad Goncz was not allowed to deliver his speech, a demonstration at which I was not present because I was delivering a speech at Corvinter. [Danyi] How did you get into contact with the young people called fascists in the "Evening Balance" program on Hungarian Television? [Kiraly] These youngsters came to me around 26 October 1992 to protest against this label. [Danyi] You are slowly turning into the Hungarian skinheads' defending matron? Do you accept this role with pride? [Kiraly] The situation is not as complex as it looks. This labelling is aimed at discrediting us politically. When the civilized West was burning witches, our King Kalman Konyves said the following: "There are no witches!" Now I say the same: There are no skinheads. [Danyi] But there are skinheads. [Kiraly] There were women in Kalman Konyves's time who claimed to be witches. Do you understand? They could not be witches; at most, they were healing soothsayers. In my opinion, there are unsolved problems. For example, the degenerate actions in Rostock drew my attention to the fact that, for years, the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] had failed to recognize that its liberal immigration policy had not been serving the interests of the German people. They actually provoked the youngsters' brutal acts. I generally regard the skinheads' movement as some kind of self- justice to counterbalance an administration of justice that does not work adequately. The approach that there can only government justice and right is unacceptable. [Danyi] In your opinion, how many skinheads are there in Hungary today? [Kiraly] Look, we can speak about such a movement, but we should also examine whom we can call skinheads. If a shaven head is the basic criterion, then Matyas Rakosi, Gyorgy Gado, and Janos Kis can also be listed as skinheads. One should not start from the outside appearance, because there are youngsters who have bald heads and leather jackets with boots merely because of fashion. Instead, one should argue with their ideas. Does anyone know what these people think about refugees and immigration? The way I see it, with their appearance, these youngsters protest against the old regime. They are justified in wondering why the red star is still there on top of Szabadsag Square in Budapest. [Danyi] Let me repeat my question: What is the approximate number of Hungarian skinheads? [Kiraly] I know of many organizations, but they can no longer be regarded as independent. I think that there are a lot of youngsters with national feelings in this country both in the Independent Smallholders' Party [FKGP] and the MIEP, but there are relatively few of them in an organized framework. At the same time, it is a fact that, out of the 19 founders of the MEP, there were six bald youngsters. It is outrageous how little the police know about these people; the police simply have no real information about them. I do not know how their undercover people work. This is why I was surprised at the exaggerated police supervision of the festivities on 15 March. [Danyi] What about the more than 100 skinheads arrested in Szeged on the eve of our national day? [Kiraly] I can imagine that, because the buses carrying people from Miskolc and Eger to the meeting in Budapest on 15 March were halted and the passengers were checked and frisked for almost two hours. There is no need for such preventative measures in a democracy. [Danyi] Among others, you have also been invited to Moscow by Zhirinovskiy. Have you accepted the invitation? [Kiraly] Yes.
