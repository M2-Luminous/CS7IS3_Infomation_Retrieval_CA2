Under the Chinese constitution, all mineral resources belong to the State. The fee will be levied on all 9,000 State and 250,000 collective mining enterprises as well as foreign-funded and private mining operators. Each mining business will have to pay an average of less than 4 percent of its sales income from mineral products as a fee. Such a ratio, far lower than royalties abroad, treat foreign investors the same as domestic firms, according to Fu Mingke, deputy head of Mineral Development Management Bureau. The bulk of the levy will be channelled to geological surveys and exploration work that are now stymied by a severe lack of investment, said a senior official with the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources. The remainder will flow into general State revenue. About 2-3 billion yuan ($230-344 million) a year is expected to be raised from the levy. The State Council is reviewing detailed rules on the levy presented by the ministry, said Fu. "The levy measures will come into force in the first half of this year," Fu said. He did not give a specific date. The levy is aimed to help develop the State's economic resources. The government's annual spending on geological surveys and exploration work is about 8 billion yuan ($919 million), far below what is needed to detect new mineral deposits and guarantee stable mining production. In China, about 95 per cent of the energy and 80 percent of industrial raw materials come from non-renewable mineral resources. The rules favour those with a higher mining recovery rate. They will be charged less to inspire more efficient and rational mining development. Presently, enterprises and individuals which exploit minerals only pay small part of their income in resource tax. Many enterprises and individuals exploit mineral resources with inefficient mining practices or methods which damage the environment. This causes severe waste and loss of precious resources. "The new measures are in line with the international norms," Fu said adding that almost all foreign countries charge mining firms a royalty. The ministry prepared a draft of the rules in 1987, but met strong protest from mining firms allegedly unable to bear the financial burden owing to low State prices or mineral products. "The time is ripe now. China's market economy has freed up the price of most minerals, including oil, coal and iron," Fu said. Another consideration is that overseas investors involved in Chinese mines -- once an area forbidden to them -- should be charged with the fee.
