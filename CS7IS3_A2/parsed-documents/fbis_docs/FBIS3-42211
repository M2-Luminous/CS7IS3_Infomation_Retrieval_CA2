A cultural association representing Algeria's original Berber inhabitants, from whom the RCD draws its support, blamed the "odious crime" on "terrorists" in a statement. Tigziri was the first national official of a political party to be murdered since armed Islamic fundamentalists began waging a guerrilla war against the state two years ago. Numerous intellectuals have been assassinated as part of a campaign of fear. The attackers slit Tigziri's throat as he was heading for his car outside the building in Bach Djarah, one of the strongholds of Islamic fundamentalism in the region around the capital. Formerly a senior civil servant at the Ministry of Labour, Tigziri had been economics spokesman for the RCD, led by Said Sadi. Tigziri, 42, was married and had no children. [passage omitted]
