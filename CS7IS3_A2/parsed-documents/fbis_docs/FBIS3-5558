Yi Chol, North Korea's ambassador to Geneva, told the conference that the South Korean Government is a "military regime disguised in the mask of a civilian regime." Seoul retains fascist laws, Yi said, apparently referring to the national security law which prohibits any unauthorized contact with North Koreans. Yi reminded that even U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has stated as Washington's official position that he wants to see this law repealed. South and North Korea signed an historic agreement in 1991 on reconciliation and agreement, Yi said, pointing out that Seoul should remain faithful to this accord. Yi's statements came in reaction to Seoul's protest a day earlier charging that human rights in North Korea are infringed, that individuals are kidnapped or go missing and that individual freedoms are ignored.
