Beginning in 1996, the system of guaranteed rice procurement prices will be changed, whereby only the year's first rice crop will be procured. Instead of growing a second crop, farmers will be encouraged to grow green manure or let the land lay fallow. The government will make up the price difference or offer farmers subsidies for fallow land. The Council of Agriculture stressed that this change in the guaranteed rice procurement price is necessary to soften the impact on agriculture of our country's accession to GATT. The council also noted that it hopes farmers' interests will not be affected by this change. Shen Wei-Kuo has filed the following report: [Begin Wei-kuo recording] The Council of Agriculture convened a meeting on rice procurement and marketing on 13 January. (Fu Le-yeh), head of the Agriculture and Food Grain Department, noted that beginning in 1996 the present system of guaranteed rice procurement prices will be changed, whereby only the first rice crop will be procured. As regards the second crop, the government will encourage farmers to grow green manure to enrich the soil or let the land lay fallow. The government will provide a subsidy of NT [New Taiwan] $27,000 yuan for every hectare of fallow land. If the farmers want to grow a second crop of rice instead of switching to food grain, then the government will continue procuring the rice in an appropriate manner and help them adapt. [passage omitted] (Fu Le-yeh) stressed that balancing production and consumption as well as maintaining self-sufficiency remains the government rice policy. The rice acreage will still be 400,000 hectares, and the annual output target will still be 1.6 million metric tons [end recording].
