A spokesman of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda had indicated late this morning that the installation of the transitional institutions was still scheduled despite the assassination of Mr. Gatabazi, who was shot dead close to his house. The installation of these institutions should have taken place in early January, under the terms of the peace accord signed last August after three years of civil war.
