The stepped-up measures are aimed at stabilizing operations of the dairy and livestock industries based on the agreement at the conclusion of the Uruguay Round trade talks in December. Of the total, 34.9 billion yen will be applied to the dairy industry and 48.2 billion yen will go to livestock farmers. For the dairy industry, 14.6 billion yen will be used to streamline dairy business management by paying farmers 2 yen per kilogram of milk production. This measure is to continue from fiscal 1993. The government will pay an additional 1 yen per kilogram to dairy farmers as an emergency subsidy to compensate for damaged pastures due to bad weather in 1993. In the end result, despite the 1 yen cut in the government-guaranteed price of milk for fiscal 1994, farmers' revenue from milk production will be unchanged from the previous year. The government sets its guaranteed producer prices for milk every year. When market prices for milk fall below the minimum level, the government buys up stocks to prevent further price declines.
