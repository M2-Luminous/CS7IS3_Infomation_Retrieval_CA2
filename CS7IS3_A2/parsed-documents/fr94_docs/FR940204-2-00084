FR940204-2-00084 FR940204-2-00059 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY [FEMA&hyph;1008&hyph;DR] California; Amendment to Notice of a Major Disaster Declaration AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice amends the notice of a major disaster for the State of California, (FEMA&hyph;1008&hyph;DR), dated January 17, 1994, and related determinations. EFFECTIVE DATE: January 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Pauline C. Campbell, Response and Recovery Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3606. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated January 25, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements concerning Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq .), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows: I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks on January 17, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude that special cost-sharing conditions are warranted under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'') for the Public Assistance program. Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total eligible costs, except for direct Federal assistance costs for emergency work, which are authorized at 100 percent Federal funding until January 25, 1994. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance costs. This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs. Please notify the Governor of the State of California and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my major disaster declaration.
