The one-day meeting will review the conflicts in Angola, Somalia, Liberia and Burundi where renewed fighting in Bujumbura, the capital has claimed many lives. Cameroon, which is a member of the 11-nation OAU organ for conflict resolution, is being represented at the meeting by its foreign minister, Ferdinand Leopold Oyono, who reiterated his government's position that the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the peninsula was a pre-requisite for negotiations. "It is only through such a withdrawal that Cameroon could consider the possibility of a summit" between the Nigerian leader, Gen. Sani Abacha and President Paul Biya, Oyono told the organ. He however stressed that Cameroon remained open to any concerted initiatives likely to facilitate the search for a durable and peaceful resolution to the conflict. The Nigerian Government in a memorandum sent to the OAU Secretariat, called on the organ to encourage ongoing bilateral initiatives and implore both countries to agree on an early date for the summit between the leaders of the two countries and "seriously commit themselves to the resolution of the dispute through the current peace initiatives". Nigeria referred to the "intensive bilateral efforts" of President Eyadema of Togo and Husni Mubarak of Egypt to resolve the dispute, saying "both leaders have almost concluded arrangements for a summit of the leaders of Cameroon and Nigeria at a neutral venue to be agreed upon soon".
