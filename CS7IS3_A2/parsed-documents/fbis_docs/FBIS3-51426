This was announced this morning by Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella following the meeting among Presidents Carlos Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in the Mirador Hotel. Taking the opportunity of the presence of the Bolivian president, the Argentine and Paraguayan presidents invited him to help them find solutions for the Pilcomayo problems. Di Tella said that these floods cause considerable ecological damage. He added that in order to solve these problems the three countries will seek financing from international financial institutions. The Argentine minister said that during 1994 Argentina and Paraguay will try to solve the problems created by this river exclusively in their countries, but in 1995 the works and studies will have to be carried out jointly among the three countries. Argentina and Paraguay last year had serious incidents as a result of the poor construction of two relief channels on both sides of the river in Formosa Province. The issue was solved when the two governments decided to leave aside these faulty channels and to begin new works to solve the problem of the floods.
