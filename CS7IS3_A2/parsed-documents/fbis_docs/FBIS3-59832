Although these talks are not being held in one room, the work that is being done while these talks are being held is similar to holding a general conference. Key figures in Hizballah have been exchanging working papers and proposals about a specific subject, namely Hizballah and the coming stage. The same sources add that the discussion about the working papers, which are being exchanged is focusing on what Hizballah should do to overcome the critical deadlines that it will have to face in the coming stage, that is, in the post-settlement stage. The dominant tendency in the party is advising the party and telling it that to avoid becoming a victim of this coming stage, it needs to adapt its intellectual, political, and security concerns to the coming stage. In this regard that tendency is setting forth the following proposals: First, a condition is to be created whereby Hizballah would open its doors to the various Lebanese parties and sects so as to prevent anyone from isolating the party on political or even on security matters. To achieve that, broad national slogans will have to be set forth, and these slogans will have to be beyond the religious or the sectarian. Second, a solution to the challenge facing the party is to be found in case continuing the resistance can no longer be justified. It is the opinion of this tendency that letting the resistance slogan live on is a matter that touches upon the party's strategy and involves the party's strength and its continued momentum. Accordingly, dropping the resistance slogan for any reason whatsoever would weaken the party's political propositions and undermine the continued rise of its popularity among the ordinary classes. To put it briefly, Hizballah would turn into a ritual-practicing religious society, and the financial red tape within the party would grow. Over the medium term Hizballah would be exposed to the danger of financial scandals coming to light. [In this regard] Hizballah would experience something like that that the Islamic condition in Egypt experienced during the eighties. In this regard this tendency is suggesting that the party will have to accept that resistance operations, which are launched from Lebanon, be frozen after the settlement, provided the party maintains its commitment to the resistance slogan. And yet, the party will have to do this according to a new strategy based on putting Hizballah's resistance against Israel in the hands of Hamas, thereby involving Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] in coordinating, planning, and carrying out certain kinds of security operations. It is the opinion of this tendency that this strategy would spare the party [the ordeal] of appearing to be alone and vulnerable in rejecting the settlement. This tendency also associates the resistance, which it sees as equivalent to distinct political survival, with the survival of the Islamic, Palestinian resistance.
