Deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) expressed appreciation of Premier Li Peng's call for border areas to open wider in his government work report delivered at an NPC session Thursday [10 March]. Shao Qihui, provincial governor of Heilongjiang, which borders on Russia, said the opening of border areas has brought a historical development opportunity to the province located in the northeast Asia economic region. Heilongjiang shares a 3,000-km-plus border with Russia. Since the adoption of the open policy, border trade has boomed between Heilongjiang and Russia, he said. Last year, Heilongjiang-Russian border trade reached 2.6 billion Swiss francs, two-thirds of China's total border trade with Russia of that year, Shao said. To further open up, the governor said, Heilongjiang will speed up the construction of an international trade route network, with priority given to completing railways and highways that go from the provincial capital of Harbin to Russia via the province's major border cities. The province will also open up land-sea and river-sea transport routes and air routes to Europe and America. Heilongjiang will also look for new markets and take an active part in economic cooperation in the northeast Asia economic region. Shao said the province will encourage cities along the border to establish friendly and long-term cooperative ties with corresponding areas and cities in Russia. Priority will also be gradually shifted to Sino-foreign economic and technical cooperation from traditional barter trade, the governor said.
