FR940407-1-00050 FR940407-1-00012 (b) ``Beta.'' The value of ``beta'' used in applying the CAPM should, in principle, be that which is expected in the future. The ``beta'' actually used in the practical application of the model is, however, more commonly calculated on the basis of historical data. ``Beta'' could be calculated by applying regression analysis, using historical price and dividend data for the regulated firm under consideration, in order to measure the variability of the return on the regulated firm's common stock relative to that of the market. The usual practice, however, is to use the ``betas'' published by an investment firm such as Value Line. Value Line ``betas'' are derived from a regression analysis between weekly percent changes in the price of a company's common stock and the weekly percent changes in the New York Stock Exchange Composite Indices over a period of five years. 35 Provided that the regulated firm's market risk is not expected to change appreciably in the future, ``betas'' based on historical data are appropriate for estimating the cost of common-stock equity. Therefore, the Commission's proposed rule specifies the use of Value Line's most current ``betas'' in implementing the CAPM. 35 Value Line publishes adjusted ``betas.'' The adjustment recognizes the tendency of ``betas'' to move toward one. (The market index by definition has a value identically equal to one.) There are two justifications for making such an adjustment: (1) Empirical studies demonstrate that ``betas'' tend to move toward one over time, and (2) the average ``beta'' is known to be one, and adjusting an estimated ``beta'' toward one is, therefore, an appropriate use of existing information. (c) Market Return. The third input required by the CAPM is an estimate of the expected return on the stock market. One broad approach is to estimate the expected return on the market directly. One such technique is to apply a DCF analysis to a broad market index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. A second broad approach is the historically derived risk premium method, which involves two steps: (1) The arithmetic average difference between the actual annual returns realized in the past on the overall stock market and the risk-free rate is calculated, 36 and (2) this historical differential is added to the currently prevailing yield on the risk-free security. The resulting sum is a measure of the return on the market. The rationale for this method is that investors anticipate that common stocks will yield a higher return than the return on lower risk, fixed income securities, and the additional return on the common stocks is expected to be approximately equal to what it was in the past. The Commission's proposed rule stipulates the use of the historically derived risk premium method because it is relatively easy to apply, and its data requirements are relatively light compared to methods designed to measure the expected market return directly. 36 The arithmetic mean, not the geometric mean, should be used, since the quantity desired is the rate of return investors expect over the next year for the random annual rate of return on the market. The arithmetic mean is the unbiased measure of the expected value of repeated observations of a random variable.
