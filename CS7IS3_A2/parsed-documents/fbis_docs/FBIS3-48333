The officials of the governing body of farming cooperatives nationwide said Sato's successor will be chosen at its general meeting on March 4. But sources close to the organization said selection of the new president may hit a snag, as the group is split over the government's decision on a partial opening of the nation's rice market under the Uruguay Round of global trade talks sponsored by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The organization will hold a meeting on February 16 to select candidates for the presidency, the officials said.
