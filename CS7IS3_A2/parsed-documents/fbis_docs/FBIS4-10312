The Brazilian delegation, within working subgroup No. 7, expressed the Brazilian Government's decision of "not yielding on this issue" because its interests "are non-negotiable." Mercosur also has run into other difficulties in its integration march, like the establishment of a common foreign tariff for third-country imports, an issue that remains unsolved after one year of negotiations. The fast development of free trade zones in Uruguayan territory, which has attracted many investors from industrialized countries, has become an issue of constant concern, especially for Brazil, which fears the competition of East Asian countries within Mercosur's borders. The latest negotiations have been suspended, hoping for "a high-level political decision" to shed light on this problem. This issue now must be directly resolved by the presidents of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, who in January postponed their decision on the common tariff system. In the Uruguayan city of Colonia, the presidents on 26 January committed themselves to establishing a tariff before July, after ordering a number of additional technical negotiations. The free trade zone issue also must be resolved in July. Concerning these two controversial issues, the main Mercosur partners have taken different sides. While Argentine, along with Uruguay and Paraguay, promotes a low tariff to avoid dependence on Brazilian technology, the Brazilian Government pursues the idea of protecting industries and endorses a high tariff that will make imports from third countries less competitive. Concerning the free trade zone problem, Argentina and Brazil have allied themselves and are forming a common front against their weakest partners: Uruguay and Paraguay. The uncertain situation involving the future of Mercosur's free trade zones has had international repercussions and negative reports for investors are circulating in the developed nations. The Uruguayan newspaper EL TELEGRAFO, published in the city of Paysandu, 380 km northwest of Montevideo, publishes today an "exclusive report" drawn up by a Rotterdam consulting group. This "exclusive report" reviews the services potential in the River Plate basin. The report notes: "Despite the substantial incentives and benefits that the free trade zones offer to foreign investors, there are certain uncertainties regarding their future." The report notes that it would not be positive for capital outside Mercosur to introduce raw materials from other nations and industrialize them in the regional free trade zones. According to EL TELEGRAFO, the Brazilians do not accept these products because "they would destroy Brazilian industry at the root of their business within Mercosur." Pursuant to this new reality, Foreign Minister Sergio Abreu has told Uruguayan journalists that his country "will defend its free trade zones at any cost."
