The program includes conditions such as 1) sale of right to principal and interest to investors; 2) absence of right by investors to demand repayment; and 3) assumption by investors of any risk associated with failure of borrower to repay loan. The program differs from past programs to attain liquidity of such assets in that the liquidity can be established without the consent of the borrower because the investors will not possess the right to seek direct repayment of the loan. Private-sector financial institutions exercise a strong desire to reduce assets for the purpose of enhancing net worth and reduce risks associated with fluctuating interest rates and it appears that they will begin in earnest to attain greater liquidity through the new program by the end of the current fiscal year. Under the new program, banks will sell the right to receive principle and interest on loans to investors, but assume responsibility to collect principle and interest from borrowers and make payments to investors. Banks will charge a fee for the collection services. The contracts to be concluded between banks and investors will provide that the investor assumes the risk in the event a borrower defaults on a loan and that the investor will forfeit the right to demand repayment from the debtor. The contract will also provide that when the borrower defaults because of bankruptcy, banks will endeavor to recover principal to the degree feasible. City banks played a central role in preparing a report which covers the details of the new program. The new program, in contrast to the former "loan transfer program" wherein loans were resold to attain liquidity of such assets, carries the major difference of not granting investors the right to seek repayment in the event of a default. However, fees payable by investors will be set at lower levels. Since investors will not have the right to demand repayment, borrowers are not faced with the risk of being asked by purchasers of the loans for repayment. This means that banks will not be required to obtain the consent of borrowers for resale of the loans. In Japan, it was difficult to obtain the consent of borrowers for the transfer of loans, but the new program provides for immediate liquidity of loan instruments. Under the new program, banks transfer default risks to investors and loan principal and interest payments become the property of investors.
