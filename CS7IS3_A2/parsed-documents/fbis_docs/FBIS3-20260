Ciller described the local elections as a victory for the TPP. She stressed that the people indicated that they want the rightist parties to unite and also showed under which party they want these parties to unite. Addressing a TPP Assembly group meeting, Ciller pointed out that contrary to expectations, the elections were held in a peaceful atmosphere and that the people protected their democracy once again. She said that this made her very happy, adding that she is proud to be fulfilling the promises she made to the nation. Another important result of the elections, she said, is the fact that the TPP emerged as the party in the nation's heart. [Begin Ciller recording] There is another message the people gave us through these elections. We must open are ears wide to hear this message well. The message says that the rightist parties must unite. [applause] The people have also indicated under what party they want these parties to unite. We must heed the strong voice of the people. Our people have also made it clear that they do not want certain things. They do not want injustice. They do not want lack of solutions, they took a stand against the opposition because it does not offer any solutions. Nor do our people want us -- who have been in power only for seven to eight months -- to pay for the bill of the economic problems that have been going on for the past 10 years. [end recording] Prime Minister Ciller stressed that the elections showed that the TPP which is the guarantee of stability, tranquillity, unity, and faith, is the leading rightist party. She added that this unity will add great strength to the country in solving the existing problems. She said: The mission which the TPP will follow from now on will make it come to power on its own.
