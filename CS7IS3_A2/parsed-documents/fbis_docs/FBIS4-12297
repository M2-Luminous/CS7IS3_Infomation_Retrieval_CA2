UN reports indicate that the Serb forces have advanced 10 km in the area, but UN officials still say that Gorazde is not facing a serious threat. Meanwhile, the Islamic Republic of Iran has called for speedy action by the United Nations to prevent the fall of Gorazde and the massacre of its innocent inhabitants. In a letter to the United Nations, our country's foreign affairs minister has also made reference to the fact that Gorazde was earlier declared a safe area. The letter, furthermore, cautions against the occurrence of yet another tragedy in Bosnia. The Islamic countries have also started a series of diplomatic initiatives in the United Nations with the aim of inducing the Security Council to pass a resolution to prevent the fall of Gorazde.
