Their names are as follows: Mithad Emini (born 1945), Hasan Agushi (1960), Resmi Ejupi (1948), Selam Elmazi (1948), Shinazi Redjepi (1954), Husein Haskaj (1951), Burim Murtezani (1964), Akif Demiri (1941), Abdiselam Arslani (1946), and Eugen Cami. According to the charges, Emini, Agushi, Ejupi, Elmazi, and Redjepi created a hostile association in October and November 1991 under the name "Headquarters for National Defense." Together with Haskaj, Arslani, Murtezani, Demiri, and Cami, they undertook a number of actions last November with the aim of using violence against the state order of the Republic of Macedonia. The accusation stated that, in the course of October and November 1991, the accused Hasan, Ejupi, Elmazi, Cami, and Redjepi had meetings in the house of Elmazi in Gostivar, and also in the PDP [Party for Democratic Prosperity] offices, where it was decided to create paramilitary formations on the initiative of Mithad Emini and Hasan Agushi. A body called "Headquarters for National Defense" was designated as in command. They also decided to provide technical equipment, and personal data of those who were meant to join those formations, as well as to determine the positions of the top leadership of the Headquarters. Mithad Emini was elected commander of the Headquarters, Resmi Ejupi was his deputy, Selam Elmazi was in charge of military issues, Shinasi Redjepi of the police, and Hasan Agushi was appointed military counselor. During December 1991 and January the next year the accused Agushi and Redjepi contacted Emini, who informed them about financial assistance, and they decided to supply themselves with computers from Switzerland with the help of the accused Elmazi and Murtezani. The computers, as the charges said, were meant for the preparation of programs on paramilitary formations, which would be exclusively composed of Albanians living on the territory of Macedonia. After the group had provided the computers (PC 486/33 -- HD 200 color and PC 286 -- HD 80 without a keyboard), they assembled them in Demiri's house in the village of Cegrane, where they created a computer center in which Agushi worked, while Murtezani was appointed the headquarters' courier. In July 1992 the programs were thoroughly prepared in this center, and information gathered for the creation of the paramilitary army. "The Main Headquarters" was coded "777" and two battalions were formed for the Kumanovo district under the code "444455," three battalions for Skopje coded "333344" and "366," as well as two detachments coded "303" and "404." Three battalions for Tetovo district coded "222," "233," and "244" were created, as well as two detachments coded "102" and "202." There were also three battalions for Gostivar under the codes "122," "133," and "377," and two detachments coded "210" and "206," as well as a base coded "888." One battalion was planned for the Struga district under the code "111" and one battalion for Debar coded "555." Of course, commands were also appointed for these paramilitary formations. Elmazi and Ejupi were appointed in the "Secretariat for National Defense and Territorial Autonomy -- ILIRIDA" in April 1992. Later on, stamps for the Headquarters of National Defense in the Armed Forces of the Albanians and of the Main Headquarter "777" were prepared, as well as for the Cair district (in Skopje) under the code "333." Toward the end of 1992 they prepared the "Rule Book of the System of National Defense," which was meant only for the Albanians, including active officers in the Macedonian Army, who were supposed to form a government and other bodies of government and state institutions in conflict conditions. In September 1991, at the initiative of Mithad Emini, as well as in December of the same year, this time in agreement with Agushi, Husein Haskaj, an administrator for operations and education in the District Headquarters of the Territorial Unit of Cair at the Macedonian Defense Ministry, was appointed commander of the battalion of the paramilitary army in Cair district, for which he got a code and received orders from Agushi. After that he started undertaking hostile activities against the Macedonian Army and Macedonian Interior Ministry, which he did not abandon after July 1993, when he was appointed to the Macedonian Defense Ministry. Haskaj started gathering information on 1,300 subjects to military conscription -- Albanians from "his own" battalion -- personal names, birthdates, addresses, ranks, and so on, and also couriers were appointed for contacts with the headquarters in Gostivar. In January 1992 Haskaj received a blank application for the "mobilization plan" from his headquarters. He prompted the plan the next month with information on persons who could take part in the mobilization, by determining the junctures, the links, and the mobilization areas, planned to be completed in a period of nine hours. That was meant to prevent mobilization and create conditions to break up the 14th Infantry Brigade, as well as other commands and units of the Macedonian Army. He delivered this document to the headquarters in Gostivar. Later on Haskaj made an analysis concerning the morale, the organization, and armament of the Macedonian Army and the Macedonian police, for which he prepared a written paper on 30 March 1993 entitled "Assessments on the Enemy" (number T 08-3), which he sent to the headquarters. In this document Haskaj characterized the Macedonian Army, the Macedonian Interior Ministry, the police, and the Macedonian orthodox people, as an "enemy." According to the accusation, he sent a written request on 6 July 1993 -- he was then the commander of the Cair district battalion -- that he himself typed, with his signature (request n. SO 7-5), in which he asked for the formation of a paramilitary independent unit for the village of Ljuboten (Skopje). This unit was supposed to be active outside the framework of the Macedonian Army, and he requested technical resources from his headquarters. The accusation further stated that in February 1992 they provided via Shinasi Redjepi and on the orders of Mithad Emini a large amount of hard currency, including 95,000 Swiss francs, and Arslani and Ejupi provided 200 automatic rifles of Chinese origin from Albania. Moreover, they had organized the transport of these goods together with Eugen Cami to Gostivar. The arms were distributed, and 85 rifles were given to Redjep Shinasi, 25 of which were confiscated by the police in November. The charges stated that Hasan Agushi created a "courier center" in December 1992 and January 1993, with the code "201." The accord was that each courier should deliver the mail to Gostivar, it was further delivered to Demiri's house in the village of Cegrane, and the whole course was reported periodically. At the same time, Agushi had begun in December 1992 the appointment of the personnel for the courier center, among which, by order no. 012-15, prepared on 20 December, was the commander of the shooting squad and the Albanian military forces (code "210"), Arton Imeraj. With a special order (4-07) of 11 January 1993 the new spot for courier link was appointed as the tea-shop "Besa" in Gostivar. Only two months later, on 20 and 21 March last year, all the commanders were informed with a special order about the "problem" of the Albanians and the "Slavs," which, according to them, had to be solved in an armed battle, and it suggested that the commanders of the military units should make a weekly (also more frequent) analysis of the Macedonian Army and the Interior Ministry. It was also suggested that the possible contacts with Headquarters (777) had to be made each Saturday, between 0900 and 1800 at Akif Demiri's. The reports on the needs of the Headquarters of the Albanian (para)military forces were prepared in June and July, in which there was information on the "enemy," that is, the technical means, the directions, and the numerical data of the Macedonian Army and Interior Ministry units. To that purpose they had prepared precise reports from 13 to 28 July, as well as a report under the code name of "Mehmedi 210." The charges accuse the 10 persons of: associating with the aim of hostile activities according to Article 136, Paragraph 1, and Article 144 -- attacking the constitutional order of the Republic of Macedonia, by the Criminal Statute of the Republic of Macedonia. Moreover, the accused have engaged the following as their defense counsels: Gjuran Dema, Savo Kocarev, Mahmut Jusufi, Naim Selmani, and Numan Limani, the last of which will defend four of the accused (Murtezani, Haskaj, Cami, and Arslani), and attorney Dusko Apostolski is also expected to join these next Monday.
