Violent fighting has resumed in Kigali. [Unidentified correspondent] The cease-fire announced by the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] came into force on Monday at midnight. The RPF has accused the Army of violently bombing its positions yesterday afternoon. There was heavy fighting in Kigali last night. The RPF bombed the airport because the Rwandan Army has introduced large-caliber guns there, while the RPF and the United Nations wants this airport to become a neutral zone. The Army has promised to withdraw the guns, and General Dallaire, the commander of UN troops, is expected to try to negotiate a fresh cease-fire. Fighting continued this morning, but with less intensity. However, it seems that the Army is still slaughtering opposition members. The International Red Cross is trying to evacuate to Zaire those who are threatened, including 5,000 people who have found refuge in a stadium in Cyangugu, in the southwest of Rwanda. A team of 15 Red Cross officers is doing its utmost to give assistance to the wounded in Kigali, but three wounded women being helped by the Red Cross were finished off by the Army as recently as last Sunday.
