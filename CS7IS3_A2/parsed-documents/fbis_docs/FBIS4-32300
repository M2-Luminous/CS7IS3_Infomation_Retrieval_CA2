These days, the government is negotiating with the IMF regarding the standby loan, and the preliminary agreement regarding the granting of the loan (letter of intent) should be signed by the end of this week. This was mentioned yesterday at a short briefing at the time of the consultation of economic ministers by B. Schmoegnerova, deputy prime minister. The negotiations were participated in also by a mission from the World Bank, under the leadership of Vice President M. Bruno, which is paying a working visit to Slovakia. As noted by E. Zirnansky, press secretary of the Ministry of Finance, the loan will be made up of several draws, and its total value will be approximately $100-120 million. According to him, the World Bank is considering increasing the overall volume of credits for the Slovak Republic to approximately $700 million in the next two to four years. As noted by Schmoegnerova, sector loans are being worked out to help complete housing construction projects within the framework of the KBV [Complex Housing Construction], to restructure the labor market, and rebuild forestry. P. Koncos, minister of agriculture, added that the loan to improve and renew the forests is expected to make a contribution toward preventing unprocessed logs from being exported from Slovakia and should assist in having the maximum amount of timber processed in the lumber and furniture industry in Slovakia. The loan for completion of complex housing construction (KBV) is supposed to be made available by the World Bank to the Slovak Republic this year. "Experts from the World Bank and the Ministry of Transportation, Communications, and Public Works (MDSVP) have already visited 30-34 localities where the use of loan funds is being contemplated. This will be a question of municipal housing; the conditions for granting the loan are technical in nature," the deputy prime minister said in response to a question by SME. After a year of using subsidies in a program to reduce the consumption of fuels and energy in apartment buildings and apartments, the Ministry of Economics is submitting modifications for this program to the government. "This year, subsidies should continue to be used also for interest-free loans for periods of three years. The budget includes 100 million Slovak korunas [Sk] for projects designed to improve heat and insulation characteristics, the regulation of heat-generating facilities, the reconstruction of thermal resources, the installation of measuring and regulating equipment, and the reduction of consumption of electric energy. These projects, which could cost as much as Sk3 million, will be gathered by the MDSVP and our ministry until the end of July," said A. Oparty, state secretary of the Ministry of Economics. Conditions for announcing projects will be published by the government once they are approved. Another of the points discussed by the economic ministers was also the proposal to amend the law on consumer taxes. The government will discuss this proposal today.
