The seven shudents who visited the embassies on June 23 to seek for asylum are Florencio Anunciacio Fernandes (22), Veofirio Coasta Oliveira (23), Jose Manuel De Oliveira Sousa (24), Mateuscito Ximenes (23), Ventura Valentim (25), Clementino Farias (27) and Oscar Goncalvessja Silva (20). The university students left Indonesia at 2.30 p.m. by Singapore Airlines at the Portuguese Government's expense. Last August, the Indonesian Government allowed 28 East Timorese to leave for Portugal for reunion with their relatives. Twenty two others are still waiting for permission to go to Portugal.
