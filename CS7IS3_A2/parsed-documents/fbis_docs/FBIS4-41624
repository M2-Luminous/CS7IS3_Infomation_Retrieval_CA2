The Crimea became the last region he visited in the course of his tour of Ukraine as a presidential candidate. The Ukrainian ex-prime minister, who, according to the results of some public opinion polls, is the second most popular politician after President Kravchuk, had meetings with electors at industrial enterprises and farms and held talks with senior officials from the Crimean Government. Speaking at a press conference, Kuchma said that he liked the reforms which are being worked out in the Crimea. He expressed confidence that the Crimea could not be brought back to its previous state, that of one of Ukraine's regions. When tackling controversial problems, it is necessary to take into consideration the real situation, the characteristic features of each particular region, he said. In his opinion, talks between Ukraine and the Crimea should be on the same level as between Russia and Tatarstan.
