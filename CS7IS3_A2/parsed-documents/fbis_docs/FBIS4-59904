Mr. Head of government; members of the government; Mr. Chairman of the Maghreban Consultative Council; their excellencies, members of the Diplomatic Corps; ladies and gentlemen. I would like to start by expressing my happiness and satisfaction at being present here with you at this ceremony in which we are inaugurating the Transitional National Council. The setting up of the Transitional National Council is the realization of one of the main decisions taken at the Conference of National Concord; the conference that gave the country the platform for defining the aims of the transitional period. On this occasion, it is appropriate that I should reiterate my firm conviction to work for the realization of the aims of this platform. I would also not want to miss this opportunity to applaud you, O members of the Transitional National Council, and applaud other parties, organizations and institutions that you are representing, for your sense of responsibility by answering the call of duty in order to serve the higher interest of the nation. Furthermore, through this patriotic commitment of yours, you have responded positively to the call of the nation and consolidated, thanks to your stance, the legitimate aspirations of our people that Algeria will surely successfully surmount the current difficulties. The Transitional National Council, which forms one of the necessary foundations to complete this decisive stage fruitfully, is also considered an important instrument for carrying out the program to get our country out of the crisis, and realizing democracy in the framework of respect for the deep-rooted values of the Algerian people. With the acceptance by all of us of the leadership of the transitional stage, we will have responded to the call of the people, and I am persuaded that, with the help and grace of God, we will be able to pool efforts to realize all the objectives mentioned in the national consensus platform agreed a few months ago, particularly those pertaining to the organizing of free and democratic elections that give substance to the options of the nation in all freedom. The national people's army, which adheres to the Constitution, will be a guarantor for any political solution in this framework. The setting up of the Transitional National Council, which comes after the installation of the National Economic and Social Council, confirms the principal feature of the approach we have chosen to deal with the problems experienced by our country. This approach consists of political and social consultation, especially as the current situation makes it necessary for all the patriots who are concerned for the country's stability to fully mobilize themselves so as to make the transitional phase successful and get the country out of its plight. Your council is a tangible expression of the mobilization of all those who believe in the potential of the country and are working to bring national political life back to normal. I am convinced that you will be working in this direction in total belief and conviction. Gentlemen, ladies: The track of democratic edification that we started is a demand that emanates from the depths of society. We strive to entrench it, not as a method dictated by circumstances but because we are convinced that, thanks to pluralist democracy, it enables us to provide a qualitative mutation for our country that will permit it to resume its ambitious project of economic and social development. In this respect, I should like to make clear that by edifying democracy we will endeavor to strengthen political society, and at the same time entrench civil society. Because each of them has its own particular role and specific function in society -- they complete each other, and we do not want to see any of them as an alternative to the other. Here lies the theme of our efforts aimed at launching a political dialogue in a legal framework and for a specific objective. The framework of the dialogue should fall within the context of respect for the Constitution and the law and the rejection of violence, which perpetrators and those who have been conniving with them have been wantonly carrying out against the nation. The aim of such a dialogue is, however, to unite the efforts and to bring together the resources of our nation in order to realize the aims of the transitional period as stipulated by the platform of the National Concord Conference. This is the framework and the aim of a dialogue, which should be a constructive one, open to all those who are prepared to put the interests and the unity of the Algerian people before any other consideration. This dialogue should not be, however, based upon particular partisan choices, rather it should be focused upon the nation's great problems, which have been awaiting urgent solutions. Our call for a dialogue without excluding anyone stemmed from our deep conviction that it is the best means that will allow us to unite all national forces, which have nothing to do with extremism and other imported ideas, regardless of their origin. However, I would like to point out here today in front of you that my endeavor -- which I initiated last March within the framework of reviving the political dialogue -- was not properly understood by a number of parties. Therefore, every one must define his position in all clarity in accordance with the specified framework and objective, and away from any of the calculations or maneuvers that have become known to domestic public opinion. Concerning the state, I affirm here that it will be bearing without hesitation, and with all determination, all its commitments to leading the transitional stage. In this respect, the restoration of stability in the country and the preservation of the security of individuals and property are top of the priorities. Furthermore, the state will continue the realization of these objectives without a pause until violence and terrorism are definitively eliminated from our society. I would also like to greet and praise our national people's armed forces, security forces, cadres, men of culture, and all the citizens who are standing courageously in the face of the enemies of our homeland. We will eliminate violence and terrorism in our society within the framework of law. This is our will and determination. Ladies and gentlemen, the Transitional National Council must above all be vigilant in respecting the Constitution and the platform of national consensus. It also constitutes an arena for consultation and democratic debate on the main issues of the nation. There is no doubt that it will be the best place for reinforcing the exercise of pluralism and democracy demanded by all. Ladies and gentlemen, the importance of the challenge and the weight of the responsibility falling upon you to make this institution successful in carrying out its tasks is self-evident. There is no doubt that the cross-section of people who make up your council will, thanks to their attributes and capabilities, know how to live up to the legitimate aspirations of our people. Ladies and gentlemen, we have emphasized time and time again that we desire to continue the structural reforms of the national economy and to establish the market economy system. These reforms are such as to allow our country to exploit its national resources in a rational manner; it will lead to a renewed respect for work and effort and will open up the way for our creative energy. We are convinced that this endeavor will in fact respond to the new requirements of the development of our country, and the changes currently marking the world economy. Likewise, the market economy we are seeking, and about which many economic and social partners are asking questions, we want it to be built on consultation and social justice . Effectively, there will be a participation of economic entrepreneurs, social partners and experts in the laying down of the major orientations of the national economy, and in assessing the work undertaken in the field. At the same time, the state will ensure that the burdens caused by economic reforms are equitably borne, and with all vigilance the state will also ensure that social justice prevails and national solidarity is promoted. It is also self-evident that the state will continue to perform its' role as an active element in national economic development. Thus, and thus alone we can control the new course that the national economy has embarked on, to make it produce the hoped for results and minimize as much as possible the negative consequences that might appear. No doubt you are aware that our economy is at a cross-roads. It is also easy for you to realize the significant role of your institutions to tackle the new challenges that are awaiting our country. The responsibility lies on the shoulders of your council to be keen on the principles of modernity, progress, social justice and national solidarity, which will all remain the firm basis of the eternal November revolution. Every effort is being deployed to ensure a patriotic training based upon new methods aimed at promoting all Algerians and particularly young people who are the true wealth. More chances of employment should be given to young people. Thanks to the continuous effort in the field of training, young people should regain the position that is theirs on the path of development. At the same time, the younger generations will play an increasingly bigger role in the running of the nation's affairs. This is a new fact that is reflected in reality through the membership of your council. As regards our community abroad and as I have previously stressed, it will receive a special focus in whatever action we undertake for the benefit of our homeland and people. The state will ensure the protection of our community abroad, it will also make all the necessary arrangements to allow it to consolidate solidarity among its ranks and to fully take part in national development, in which it has a role to play. Ladies and gentlemen: Algeria will work at international level to consolidate its relations of good-neighborliness with fraternal countries and to revive the process of the building of the Arab Maghreb, which it views as a historical and strategic aim in the region. It will continue, with the same spirit, its endeavor to clean up the political atmosphere in the Arab arena and bring about solidarity in the African continent. At the same time we would like to reiterate our determination to bolster and consolidate relations of cooperation and integration with Mediterranean countries. Algeria will naturally continue to show an interest in the expansion of its cooperation with the European Union and the rest of the foreign partners based upon mutual respect and reciprocity. Ladies and gentlemen: I have already affirmed my conviction in a strong and an ambitious Algeria that is able to face up to the challenges and to mobilize all its resources in a bid to make a real break with all negative methods and behavior. However, we would like such a change to be comprehensive, in which all patriotic political, economic, social, and cultural forces would take part in a program that would unite all Algerians and would bring as many benefits as possible to our citizens from our country's real resources. I am persuaded that, thanks to the joining of your efforts with those of the government, this option will gradually turn into tangible realities, and open the road to the realization of the objectives we have set for ourselves, i.e. serving the people and the supreme interests of the homeland alone. We will thereby be building a solid foundation with the hope and trust that will be resurrected in our countryside and towns, and thereby we will be preserving the heritage of the martyrs of the eternal November revolution. Finally, I officially announce the installation in its functions of the National Transitional Council. I wish you success in your tasks and sincere endeavors to get Algeria out of its' crisis. Glory and eternal life to our loyal martyrs. Long live Algeria. May the peace and mercy of God be upon you.
