The talks in Brussels were adjourned until Saturday [26 March] when the 12 foreign ministers, including Britain's Douglas Hurd, will meet in Ioannina, Greece, in a renewed bid to heal the rift. But today, Mr Hurd emerged from the meeting insisting that the talks had not collapsed and that Britain remained "at the heart of Europe." The crisis hinges on the number of votes needed to block European decisions once the European Union [EU] is enlarged from 12 to 16 next January with the addition of Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria. The refusal by Britain and Spain to adapt the voting rules has triggered the current stand-off which leaves Britain ominously isolated and has become a major distraction for the Conservative Party in the run up to Euro elections in June. At present EU nations have to muster a total of 23 votes out of the 76 available to block a contentious proposal which means at least three of the 12 member states must vote together against any proposition. The new proposals increase the total votes to 90 with the four new members and seek to raise the number needed for a veto to 27. Mr Hurd had arrived in Brussels saying he was not seeking to "torpedo" enlargement plans but would not be "hustled" into any agreement which was not in British interests.
