Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee added that the SADF had made contingency plans to deal with any possible violence from this quarter. Their strong warnings follow the announcement by the Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] on Thursday [10 February] that it would not participate in the forthcoming elections. CP [Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said that, while the Afrikaner Volksfront still wanted to attain its volkstaat [homeland] through peaceful means, the right-wing front would be putting "pressure on the election in various ways." Briefing journalists in Bloemfontein, Mr. de Klerk said: "I have no doubt about the basic loyalty of the security forces that, should any plans to disrupt the election come to fruition, contingency plans are ready. "We will not and cannot allow minorities in South Africa to undermine the election process and to disrupt or derail that which clearly has the support of the majority of South Africans." Mr. de Klerk warned that violent actions aimed at derailing the election would be countered with strong government action. "If staying out means becoming involved in violence, we will act firmly within the framework of the law," he said. Right-wing suggestions that a large section of the security forces would support a rebellion against the election were inaccurate. "I believe the security forces have a proud track record of being loyal to the state ... of being non-partisan. I really don't think in any way there is a serious threat within the security forces," Mr. de Klerk said. Elaborating on contingency plans, Mr. Coetsee said that the SADF had repossessed a large number of weapons issued to private citizens. "Any weapons which have been issued for official use and which have been abused will summarily be withdrawn -- as a matter of fact we have already withdrawn a large number," he said. Disciplinary steps would be taken against any member of the defence force who abused his position for political ends. "The defence force has tightened up measures concerning the security of its bases and installations and to safeguard its armaments," Mr. Coetsee said. "The defence force has launched a special communications plan to keep its members abreast of developments in the security and military field." Subversion of the principle that the defence force serves the elected government of the day could lead to chaos and anarchy, he added. Police spokesman Major Louis le Roux has confirmed special measures to secure police stations against political threat, reports Dirk van Heerden. He declined to give details, but said a strategy had to be planned by station commanders and regional police chiefs. The SAP [South African Police] was confident it could control any campaign against police stations. Task forces would be made available to stations under threat. Major le Roux said the SAP was also confident it could control dissident policemen.
