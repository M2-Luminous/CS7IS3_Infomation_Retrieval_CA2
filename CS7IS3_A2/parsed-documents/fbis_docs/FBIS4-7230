The report said that during the current fishing season, the Vietnamese have arrogantly prohibited our Cambodian people from fishing in this area. The Vietnamese aggressors have killed many Cambodians who went fishing in this area. The Cambodian people have time and again complained to the authorities in this region but to no avail, because these authorities who are lackeys of the Vietnamese think only of serving their Vietnamese masters. Therefore, the people say that their only alternative is to settle the Vietnamese acts of aggression and expansion along Tonle Sap Lake by themselves.
