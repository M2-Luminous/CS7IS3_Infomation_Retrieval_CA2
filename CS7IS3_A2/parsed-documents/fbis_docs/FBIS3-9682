Gorazde correspondent Enes Musovic reports that "an artillery attack at Mijanovici, from the direction of Miljane, is still in progress. The chetniks still do not believe that they cannot take another inch of the Gorazde free territory, although they are using the most destructive mortar shells, tanks, Pragas, and other deadly weapons. New groups of chetniks have reached Kozara, Ogorjevac, Duge, and Praca. The reconnaissance units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army East Bosnian Operative Group have noticed that the chetniks are mining the railroad line in [name indistinct] on the Rogatica-Ilidza road. They have also noticed a large concentration of aggressor's forces in this area.

Correspondent Velid Djindo reports on the situation in Olovo and says that "this morning's gunfire announced another fierce day of war.

We have no information about the consequences of the aggressor's attacks." The studio announcer reads a report by the 1st Corps Information Service and says that "the aggressor today violated the cease-fire in the Sarajevo area. There were small arms' provocations from Nedzarici, from the direction of the Bosut barracks. The enemy snipers were particularly active, which resulted in the wounding of two members of our Army in Hladivode and Stupsko Brdo. The 1st Corps troops did not respond to these provocations."
