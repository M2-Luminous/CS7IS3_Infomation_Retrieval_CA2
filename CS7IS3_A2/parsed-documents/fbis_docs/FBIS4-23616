Muriel Pomponne has the details: [Pomponne] Yes, at about 1600 yesterday, Etienne Tshisekedi was taken in for questioning by members of the Special Presidential Division, when he was travelling by car with three bodyguards and a driver on the N'Sele road, in the suburbs of Kinshasa. According to the representative of the UDPS [Union for Democracy and Social Progress], Etienne Tshisekedi's party, the four men were kidnapped and taken to (Kibomongo) camp, 60 km from Kinshasa. The version given by Kibomongo camp's commander Colonel (Nsang Kiti Kumingama) is different: He claims that Mr. Tshisekedi was driving round inside the military area. He also says that weapons were found inside the car: one Uzi, one pistol, one grenade, and two cartridge clips are said to have been seized. To the supporters of Etienne Tshisekedi, it was all a plot. In any case the former Zairean prime minister was questioned by soldiers and released late in the evening. But the UDPS says that the three people accompanying him are still being held. Etienne Tshisekedi repeated to our AFP colleague that he had been the victim of a plot, but refused to make any other statement. The affair happened the day before another test of strength between the opposition and the presidential group, since the presidential group intends to elect a new prime minister today.
