It had been proposed to find "Atlantida" on the territory of the vast Totskiy Firing Range in the Southern Urals. But in April the Duma enacted a special decree, "proposing" to President Yeltsin that he cancel or transfer abroad the joint peacekeeping Russo-American exercises. On the threshold of signing the Treaty of Public Consent, the president shared the fears of the Duma members and ordered the interested departments to reconsider the need for the exercises and the time for holding them. However, among the country's highest military leadership the politicians' actions caused irritation. If the peacekeeping exercises at the Totskiy Firing Range actually threaten Russia's national interests, then, as a result, the Russian generals who agreed to conducting the exercise automatically fall into the category of traitors. And, naturally, the generals did not like that. In the discussion concerning the Totskiy exercises, Russia's higher and higher military leadership acted as a single front. Defense Minister General Pavel Grachev: "The attempt is being made to disrupt the peacekeeping exercises, but if we want to remove the image of the enemy and to proceed toward partnership, the exercises must be conducted." Chief of General Staff General Kolesnikov: "Public opinion is being specially heated up by people who do not know, or who pretend not to know, what a command post exercise is." However, the influence of the Ministry of Defense in the Duma, the Kremlin, and the White House is limited. Therefore no one has yet made any intelligible decision concerning whether to conduct the exercises, and, if so, where and when. The American partners are also perplexed. Last week 3rd Division commander General Holder was supposed to arrive in Moscow (with a delegation), in order to carry out the final coordination of the exercise details, but our military men were forced to "recommend the cancellation of the trip," inasmuch as, properly speaking, there was not yet anything to coordinate. On 27 May General Schroeder, deputy commander of U.S. troops in Europe and the chief coordinator of the exercises on the American side, met on his own initiative with Colonel-General Eduard Vorobyev, who is responsible for the exercises on the Russian side, in the hope of ascertaining at least something definite. But General Vorobyev was able only to express the hope that the exercises would indeed by held, perhaps even in August-September of this year. In the autumn or winter it will be difficult for American infantry to survive in Totskiy. In the opinion of the military, 15 September is the extreme date for holding exercises in 1994. At the same time the proposal to conduct Russo-American exercises in the United States or on neutral territory will, obviously, be "brought down" in one form or another. Our generals will scarcely agree to expend the limited funds in the defense budget to transfer troops to conduct a symbolic operation. During the next few weeks Russian politicians will have to make the final decision about whether or not to hold the exercises this summer. Incidentally, an official representative of the U. S. Defense Department expressed to a SEGODNYA correspondent his satisfaction with the work that has already been done: in the course of preparation for the exercises, the military of the two countries have been able to prepare a joint manual for the holding of peacekeeping operations, which may prove to be useful in the future.
