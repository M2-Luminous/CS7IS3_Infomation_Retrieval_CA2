Lamberto Dini as treasury minister: sweet revenge. The former general manager of the Bank of Italy should indeed be feeling great satisfaction these days. For 14 years--from 1979 to 1993--with Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in the governor's chair, Dini never had any actual power--despite his nominal position as number two at the central bank--other than the ability to pursue his studies and present scholarly reports at conferences. For 14 years Ciampi kept tight rein over all delegated powers, even over the operation of the motor pool. The final blow came one year ago, when the governor became prime minister and appointed Antonio Fazio as his successor, bypassing Dini within the internal hierarchy of the bank and thereby breaking with the traditional practice of promoting the general manager. In short, the "ostracism" that the guru of leftist economists, Paolo Sylos Labini, boasts of having practiced against free marketeers for several decades at the universities is something that the 63-year-old Dini, a lifelong free marketeer, had experienced personally for almost 15 years at the Bank of Italy--until Wednesday 11 May, when he took the oath as treasury minister in the Berlusconi administration. That morning, for the first time, all the newspapers treated Dini with great kindness, including those--such as LA REPUBBLICA--that had been attacking him for years. The foreign press--for which Dini represents not merely the only recognizable face among the economic ministers but also the most prestigious--were downright extravagant in their praise. The FINANCIAL TIMES defined him as "well known internationally," and the WALL STREET JOURNAL added that he is "well respected." In wishing him well, Henning Christophersen, vice president of the EU [European Union], cited Dini's talent as a "skillful negotiator." It is an encouraging send-off for a mission that is not an easy one: defending not only the lira but also--at the same time--the credibility of the new government's economic policy in the area of foreign relations. It is no accident that Dini is better known and more highly regarded abroad than in Italy. When he was appointed general manager of the central bank in 1979 he was almost unknown in Rome, for until that time he had always worked in Washington with the IMF, of which he had become one of the central directors. He is a technical expert who was trained as a free marketeer and imbued with American economic culture, which consists of few constraints and much pragmatism. Even his hobbies were those of the average American: photography and American football (he was a big fan of the Washington Redskins, and even now, when in the United States, he goes to the stadium to watch them). When--in the aftermath of certain legal events--replacements were sought for Paolo Baffi and Mario Sarcinelli, the initial candidates were Ciampi for bank governor and Sergio Siglienti for general manager; Ciampi was supported by the then treasury minister Filippo Maria Pandolfi, and Dini by the left wing of the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and by the then prime minister Francesco Cossiga. But Industry Minister Toni Bisaglia, the strong man of the Dorotea [rightist] faction of the DC, dug in his heels and vetoed Siglienti. Why? At the instigation of a young colleague, Vittorio Barattieri, Bisaglia had met Dini and was captivated by him, to the point that he judged him to be the right man for Via Nazionale [Bank of Italy headquarters]. In the end, Bisaglia got his way. After Bisaglia left the scene, it was alleged that Dini had the protection of Giulio Andreotti initially and of Bettino Craxi later. The mere mention of this allegation, however, seems to annoy the new treasury minister. To be sure, Andreotti had made his acquaintance: it was in 1976, when as a director of the IMF Dini negotiated a standby [preceding word in English] loan of $500 million with the government in Rome, which was at the time headed by Andreotti. The loan was of vital importance for Italy, which had almost exhausted its currency reserves. Dini also worked closely with Craxi in 1985, at the G-7 summit in Tokyo at which time the Italian delegation, headed by the Socialist leader, requested and obtained the expansion of the political G-5, which until then had excluded Italy and Canada. The document in question was drafted by Dini himself, who discussed the most sensitive clauses with his close friend, U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker. Other than these instances of collaboration, however, it is hard to find any indications of a close political relationship between Dini and those who for years had been cited as his protectors. The fact is that for years Dini had been isolated--and not infrequently disparaged--until Berlusconi rediscovered him. Basically, the two men have more than one trait in common: they believe in a free-market economy, and throughout their respective careers they were subjected to harassment and opposition but emerged victorious. The challenge that now awaits Dini is one of those impossible tasks: to put the government's accounts in order. The fear is that the Ciampi administration left behind a deficit larger than had been announced. For this reason, Dini's first move will be a careful reassessment of the true dimensions of the public debt. As for the future, there will be no more maneuvering. The idea of drafting the 1995 budget in advance is making headway with two objectives in mind: to stabilize the ratio between the public debt and the GDP, on the one hand, and to prevent--at any cost--the initial symptoms of recovery from rekindling inflation.
