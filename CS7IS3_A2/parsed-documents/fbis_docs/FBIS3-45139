The Baohe Coal Mine is a county-run, state-owned coal mine under Jidong County's jurisdiction. The No. 1 Pit is one with a high concentration of gas, with an annual production capacity of 120,000 tonnes and approximately 1,000 workers and staff. At 1904 on 11 October 1993, the mine's control center discovered an interruption in power supply, and shortly afterward an explosion was heard from the pit's entrance, and yellow smoke billowed out; consequently all 70 workers on that shift were killed in the accident. Based on the investigation, evidence obtained, analysis, and appraisal of relevant experts of the case fact-finding group, it was verified that there had been an extraordinarily big explosion involving coal dust. The direct cause was that during work to expand the right 10-degree upward-sloping work face, a fan stopped working and resulted in an accumulation of gas; when explosives were used to widen the work face, a short circuit caused a spark that finally brought about a gas explosion. In addition, the confusion in production safety and technological control of the Baohe Coal Mine was also a cause. The ventilation system in the first section of No. 1 Pit was suffering from a serious leak; in the second section there was a serious lack of ventilation. Arrangements at the work face were confused, and overlapped each other; consequently, when the accident took place, the whole pit was involved. The concentration of gas in the pit exceeded the limit for four consecutive days on 8, 9, 10, and 11 October. The gas monitor on duty on the shift at the right 10-degree upward-sloping work face possessed no certificate, while in blasting, the system of "three checks for each blast" was not adhered to. Some self-rescue equipment was not provided and some was not used according to the rules and regulations. As a result, when the accident took place, miners in the pit could not rescue themselves. Another gas explosion took place in the very same pit on 2 January 1991, killing 53 and injuring 12. The provincial, city, and county labor administration mine security supervising organizations carried out a special check of the said mine toward the end of 1991, and a notice on the supervision opinions was issued; however, they were not implemented. In the wake of the recent accident, the State Council, Heilongjiang Provincial CPC Committee and Government, the Ministry of Labor, the All-China Federation of Workers' Trade Unions, and the Ministry of Coal Industry have paid great attention to and shown great concern about it. The provincial and city governments as well as related departments promptly organized a joint investigation. While verifying the causes of the accident, in order to draw a lesson and further implement the "Mining Safety Act," the penalty of an administrative warning was meted out to the Jixi vice mayor in charge of industry and a Jidong County vice governor; an administrative demerit was meted out to the county coal bureau director and chief engineer; a major administrative demerit was meted out to Wang Binwu [3769 3521 2976], deputy director of the Baohe Mine in charge of electrical machinery; the administrative penalty of removal from office was meted out to Baohe Mine director Yin Dianjia [1438 3031 3094], and in addition it was suggested that a corresponding penalty be given within the party; and the administrative penalty of removal from office was meted out to Baohe Mine deputy director Han Guohua [7281 0948 5478], who was in charge of production, technology, ventilation, and safety work, Sun Yishu [1327 5030 2579], ventilation section chief, and Wu Xiuwang [0702 4423 4986], deputy pit director, who was in charge of production safety in No. 1 Pit, while their cases would be submitted to supervision organizations for investigation. Regarding No. 1 Pit director Yang Zhongcheng [2799 1813 6134] and Liu Chunsheng [0491 2504 3932], safety monitor on duty who was absent during the shift, their cases were filed and submitted to supervision organizations for examination.
