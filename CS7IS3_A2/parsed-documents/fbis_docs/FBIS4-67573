The conclusion was contained in an ecological report by an expert commission from Russia's ministry for environmental protection (Minprirody) on proposals for the further operation of the Komsomolets and on ways to minimize the emission of radioactive substances from nuclear warheads on board into the environment. Interfax received the information from the Minprirody press center Thursday. The ecological report said that at worst the dose which any human being could receive from the emission of plutonium would be far lower than the permissible yearly intake of plutonium by the human body. That conclusion can be backed up by a comparison of the plutonium content in nuclear warheads on board the Komsomolets (around 400 Curie) and the amount of plutonium in the Irish Sea, into which British nuclear enterprises had emitted a total of 2000 Curie without noticeable pollution being recorded in the fishing waters. However, given the intensity of efforts to localize the source of radiation at comparatively low cost, the expert commission approved further projects for work on board the Komsomolets. The outer slits in the vessel's bow would, it said, be closed to eliminate the possibility of corrosive plutonium leaking from the torpedo installations in the future.
