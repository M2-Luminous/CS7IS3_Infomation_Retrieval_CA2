"Negotiations are under way to remove the last and small obstacle to the proposed pact," Le, who assumed his post on May 19, said. Le, a former Hanoi vice mayor, said he expects trade and economic exchanges between his country and Taiwan, especially in tourism and agricultural and technological cooperation, will continue to increase. Taiwan is currently the largest source of foreign investment in Vietnam, having pumped US$1.5 billion into the country as of the end of last month. Both nations earlier this year signed an investment- guarantee agreement. The Vietnam Economic and Cultural Office was set up in Taipei early last year, with Dao Duc Chinh, a former Foreign Ministry official, as acting director. He is now serving as Le's deputy. Le refused to comment on the possibility that Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet might visit Taiwan. Vo, while taking part in the annual conference of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Kuala Lumpur earlier this week said he would be willing to visit Taiwan if invited. Le, however, said many obstacles would have to be removed before Vo could visit, given the absence of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
