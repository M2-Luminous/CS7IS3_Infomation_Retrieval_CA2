The Red Cross is hoping to obtain a formal UN ban on the development and production of laser weapons. They are silent and invisible weapons. A person does not know that a laser is being aimed at him and has no time to prepare himself and somehow protect himself. Laser weapons are an object of desire for all armies' generals. Several attempts to provide themselves with the combat lasers featured in science fiction novels have been dashed against the immutable laws of physics. In order to make a laser beam capable of burning through something it must be focused: This is impossible at long distances because of the law of diffraction. But it is also impossible to kill enemy soldiers or destroy his armored vehicles at short distances using modern lasers. So far lasers have found a use in high-precision weapons guidance systems. According to information available to the Red Cross, a new generation of lasers could soon enter Western armies' arsenals. At a 1km radius such a weapon, Red Cross specialists claim, could permanently blind a person. One of the aims is to blind aircrew. The Geneva committee also fears that portable and easy-to-use combat lasers could fall into the hands of terrorists. The demand to stop the development of laser weapons will make life difficult not only for the United States but also for Russia, which has overtaken the West in the development of lasers for terrestrial and space use. Millions of what were then noninflationary rubles went on attempts to develop lasers to destroy satellites and ballistic missiles in space. Tracked laser guns were developed by the "Luch" central design bureau and then the "Astrofizika" science and production association, which was led by Nikolay Ustinov, son of Dmitriy Ustinov, Central Committee secretary for the military industry and later defense minister. In 20 years 200 million rubles were spent and a dozen vulnerable tracked monsters which had no chance on the battlefield were constructed. Under Gorbachev work to improve the monster was halted. According to IZVESTIYA reports work was recently resumed. Possibly the generals are unable to abandon their long-standing dream. Maybe physics research is not standing still and there will be new opportunities to decrease the dimensions of combat lasers and make them cheaper. Their task is to disable the enemy's optical guidance instruments and blind operators. When enemy positions are illuminated by a laser beam the electronic optical guidance systems (of an aircraft, missile launcher, tank, artillery piece, or firearm) will themselves focus this beam and be disabled. If at this moment the operator is looking through the guidance instrument's eyepiece he will lose his sight.
