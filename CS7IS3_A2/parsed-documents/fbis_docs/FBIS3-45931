At the party to be staged during the traditional holiday next month, a repertoire which lauds the ongoing reform and opening or reflects traditional culture or serious arts will be emphasized, Zeng Qinghuai, planner of the show from the Cultural Ministry, said here today. However, the event will leave room for a few pop singers. And a piece written by a Taiwanese composer will be sung. The programs are aimed to help promoting serious culture while promoting artistic forms which can be received by ordinary people. In recent years China's cultural market has been hit by growing pop arts while traditional and classical arts have fallen into a slump. More television cameras have been lured away for commercial singers from Hong Kong and Taiwan. This has triggered conflicting opinions among the fans. Some complained that their rights to watch various artistic programs were denied, according to Zeng. Since last year, Chinese leaders have repeatedly urged supporting traditional and serious arts, and letting the arts serve the people and socialism. The ministry's evening party, which will be broadcast on state television, will give a potential audience of 600 million a chance to enjoy symphonic music, ballet, acrobatics and traditional opera. But almost at the same time, another more famous evening party will be organized and televised by the same TV station. It will feature a more popular repertoire and is viewed as regular family fare during every Spring Festival. These events may revive people by providing them with a healthy and vivid cultural atmosphere, the Cultural Ministry hopes. And they set a "right tune" for the Chinese arts this year, experts said. "The evening party is not mere entertainment. It shows our policy, the achievements and prospects of the field, as well as the whole reform and opening process in the country," Zeng said.
