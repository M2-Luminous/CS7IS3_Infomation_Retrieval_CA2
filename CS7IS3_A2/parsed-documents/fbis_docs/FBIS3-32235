Deputy Foreign Secretary Andres Rozental said Mexicans find this attempt to cast judgment and besmirch our country's reputation to be unacceptable. He added that the move is apparently stems from the resentment of some people who do not like the fact that Mexico maintains normal relations with Cuba or who may be upset by the approval of NAFTA. It must be made very clear, according to the official, that the implementation of NAFTA grants no one outside of Mexico the right to judge matters that are solely up to the Mexicans to resolve. We have never accepted, nor will we accept, the exercise of trusteeships over our sovereignty, Rozental stated.
