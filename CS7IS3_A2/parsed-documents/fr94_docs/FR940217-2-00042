FR940217-2-00042 FR940217-2-00025 Office of Hearings and Appeals Issuance of Decisions and Orders During the Week of November 8 Through November 12, 1993 During the week of November 8 through November 12, 1993, the decisions and orders summarized below were issued with respect to applications for other relief filed with the Office of Hearings and Appeals of the Department of Energy. The following summary also contains a list of submissions that were dismissed by the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Appeal The Gazette Newspapers, 11/9/93, LFA&hyph;0156 The Gazette Newspapers filed an Appeal from a determination issued by the DOE Office of Naval Reactors (Naval Reactors) in response to a request for information filed by the Gazette under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The Gazette had requested certain radiological documents that were withheld by Naval Reactors as classified. In considering the Appeal, the DOE found that Naval Reactors properly withheld the requested documents as classified under Executive Order 12356. Accordingly, the Appeal was denied. Refund Applications Shell Oil Company/Brown Construction Company, 11/9/93, RR315&hyph;5 The DOE issued a Decision and Order denying a Motion for Reconsideration filed in the Shell Oil Company special refund proceeding by Resource Refunds, Inc. (RRI), on behalf of Brown Construction Company (Brown). The RRI Motion sought reversal of a decision to deny the Brown Application for Refund in the Shell proceeding because the Application was filed after the April 1, 1992 final filing deadline in this proceeding. RRI demonstrated that the late filing was the result of it's own error and was not at all the fault of Brown. The DOE concluded that while RRI's error may have left it responsible for the loss of Brown's potential refund, the agent's mishandling of the Brown's Application did not justify reopening the Shell proceeding. Accordingly, the Motion for Reconsideration filed by RRI on behalf of Brown was denied. Texaco Inc./Airport Texaco, 11/12/93, RF321&hyph;19277 The DOE issued a Decision and Order concerning an Application for Refund filed by Mr. Ben Story in the Texaco Inc. special refund proceeding on behalf of Airport Texaco, a service station located at 7770 Airport Boulevard in Mobile, Alabama. In the Application, Mr. Story indicated that he owned and operated Airport Texaco from March 1978 through March 1984. However, the DOE had previously granted an Application for Refund filed by John Locklier based upon purchases by the service station during the period at the 7770 Airport Boulevard address. In support of his Application, Mr. Locklier had provided Texaco invoices, accounting documents, cancelled checks, and copies of tax forms which established that he operated Airport Texaco from February 1976 through December 1980. Mr. Story also provided a statement from the State of Alabama Department of Revenue attesting to Mr. Story's payment of withholding tax, as reflected on W&hyph;2 forms, for the period from March 1978 through 1982. However, according to this statement, Mr. Story paid withholding tax at Airport Texaco only in 1980 and 1981. Because W&hyph;2 forms are filed by employees and are based on their earnings, the DOE determined that this evidence could not be taken as proof that Mr. Story was the owner and operator of Airport Texaco. Mr. Story could produce no further documentation to substantiate his claim, and in the absence of a convincing demonstration that he was the owner and operator of Airport Texaco during the refund period, his Application for Refund was denied.
