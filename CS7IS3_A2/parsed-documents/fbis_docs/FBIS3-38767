She insisted that if it is decided to intervene in Bosnia, it is necessary to "make sure -- using threats if necessary -- that the Russians do not take action." With regard to the appropriateness of a military intervention, she noted that she was not a military expert, but that she listened to what was being said and trusted the decisions of her government. In this respect, she remarked that there is a real risk of remaining stuck in this part of the world, which was, she added, "the only region of Europe the Germans failed to subdue" during World War II. As for her wish to see Prime Minister Edouard Balladur elected president of the republic, she indicated that all she had been saying was that she believed Mr. Balladur would make a good president, and not that he must run for office.
