Li Ruihuan, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee and chairman of the CPPCC National Committee, spoke at the gathering. He said: Fundamental changes have taken place in China's intellectual and scientific and technological circles in comparison with more than a decade ago. These changes should be attributed to the leadership of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in guiding the party to correct the mistake of taking class struggle as the key link and in setting the guideline of making economic construction the center of the party's work, as well as to his important theses -- "intellectuals are a part of the working class" and "science and technology constitute a primary productive force." Li Ruihuan said: The current situation in China's intellectual and scientific and technological circles is generally good, though there are some problems. The solution to these problems lies in leaders' keen attention and the nation's economic capability, and requires a better understanding and earnest implementation of these two important theses of Comrade Deng Xiaoping in actual work. It is hoped that the relevant departments and scientific and technology circles will work in concert in studying ways to implement the thesis that "science and technology constitutes a primary productive force," drawing on successful foreign experiences and formulating policies for combining science and technology with the development of production and enabling them to promote each other, thereby imbuing vigor and vitality into the undertaking of science and technology. On behalf of the State Council, State Councillor Song Jian paid high tribute and extended warm regards to science and technology workers across the country. He said: The "Decision on Some Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, has laid an important policy for deepening the reform of the science and technology management system. The implementation of the policy of "holding fast to one end and leaving the whole field open" -- that is, while redoubling research efforts in basic science and for the development of new and high technology, it is necessary to give free rein to research, development, and business activities of organizations engaged in developing technology or providing scientific and technical services -- and the establishment of a new science and technology management system will surely give a strong impetus to the strategy of "relying on science and technology in economic construction and gearing scientific and technology work to the needs of economic construction." Song Jian continued: In the coming year, both central and local governments and enterprises should invest more in the development of science and technology. Party committees and governments at all levels and various sectors of the community should further improve the working and living conditions of scientists, show concern for the growth of young scientists, and train a contingent of academic and technology vanguards who will lead the country in the march toward the world's advanced science in the next century. Zhu Guangya, chairman of the CPPCC Science and Technology Committee and chairman of the China Association for Science and Technology, reviewed the country's brilliant achievements in science and technology over the past year. He said the Science and Technology Committee and the Association for Science and Technology will continue to do everything possible to serve scientists and technology personnel affiliated with the association. Wu Jieping, vice chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, and scientists Ye Danian, Bai Chunli, Feng Shunshan, Lai Luhua, and He Zuoxiu also spoke at the gathering. They made a number of suggestions for accelerating the development of science and technology and bringing into better play the scientists' role. Comrades Lie Jieqiong, Ye Xuanping, Wu Xueqian, Hong Xuezhi, Hu Sheng, Qian Zhengying, and Sun Fuling were present at the gathering.
