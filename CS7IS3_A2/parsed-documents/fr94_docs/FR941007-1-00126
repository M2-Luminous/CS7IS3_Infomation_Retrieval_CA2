FR941007-1-00126 FR941007-1-00009 Supplemental instructions for collection of data in connection with small business and small farm loans A. Format Beginning July 1, 1995, financial institutions required to report small business and small farm loan registers are to collect information on the racial, ethnic, and gender make-up of applicants or borrowers in connection with small business and small farm loans. If you take a written application, you should list questions regarding the percent of minority and gender ownership on your loan application form or on a separate form completed by the applicant in conjunction with an application. If you do not take a written application, you should request the information at an appropriate time during the application or origination process; you must request the information for each loan you originate even if you did not take a written application. If you neither take a written application nor originate the loan, you do not have to request the information. See the sample form for recommended format and language. This information is to be maintained in the institution's in-house loan files. This information is not to be reported to the agency, but is to be used to complete the small business and small farm loan register. B. Procedures 1. You must ask for this information, but cannot require the applicant or borrower to provide it. You may not consider whether or not an applicant or borrower has provided this information in making your decision whether to extend credit or in setting the terms of credit. 2. If the applicant or borrower chooses not to provide the information, note this fact on the form. 3. Inform the applicant or borrower that the Federal government is requesting this information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that prohibit lenders from discriminating on these bases.
