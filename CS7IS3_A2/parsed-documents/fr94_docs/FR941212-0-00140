FR941212-0-00140 FR941212-0-00019 (4) Burial expenses. If a soldier dies from injuries received and is buried at Government expense, the installation Mortuary Affairs Office completes DD Form 2063 and itemizes expense data on this form. While burial expenses are not ``medical care'' within the meaning of the FMCRA or 10 U.S.C. 1095, many insurance policies provide for the payment of such expenses. Claims offices may assert a demand for burial expenses incurred by the Government if the insurance contract provides for payment of such expenses and state law recognizes the United States as a third party beneficiary of the contract. Claims personnel should, however, be extra sensitive to the possibility that the insurance proceeds might be inadequate and should consider waiving or compromising the Government's claim in appropriate cases to avoid undue hardship to the deceased injured party's next of kin. ยง536.226 Relations with the injured party. (a) Claims personnel will advise the injured party and/or his attorney that_ (1) The United States has a right to recover the reasonable value of medical care that has been furnished or will be furnished in the future. (2) The injured party is required to cooperate with the United States by providing a complete statement of the facts and circumstances surrounding the injury, information about any legal action brought against any prospective defendant, and information about and copies of any insurance policies. (3) The injured party should not execute a release or settle any claims without notifying the RJA. (4) The injured party may consult with a legal assistance attorney if he or she is otherwise entitled to legal assistance. (b) Claims personnel should attempt to coordinate action to collect the claim of the United States with the injured party's action to collect his or her own claim against a tortfeasor or insurer. (1) The RJA may enter into a written agreement with the injured party's attorney to assert the Government's claim and to include it as an item of special damages if the injured party sues. The agreement must state that the Government will not pay counsel fees, and that the attorney will not compute his fee based on the Government's portion of any recovery. The agreement must also state that the Government must be consulted regarding any potential compromise and must agree to any settlement. (2) The RJA should coordinate with the injured party's attorney to ensure that any request for compromise or waiver of the Government's claim is considered as far in advance of settlement as is practical.
