For the last four years, drug abuse has remained stable in Greece--according to official police records quoted in an annual United Nations report on narcotics. The number of drug-related deaths increased from 66 in 1990 to 79 in 1991 and 1992 but dipped to 70 in 1993. During the same period, the number of people taken to court over drugs varied from 3,000 to 3,500 people. Production and consumption of hashish made up the lion's share of drug convictions in this country, though cocaine offences are growing steadily. Crack, however--hugely popular in countries like the United States--remains largely unknown throughout Greece, unlike illegally obtained tranquilizers, 17 kilos of which were confiscated last year. Tranquilizers are one of the top addictions. 1991 remains the best recent year for the narcotics squad, that confiscated 84 kilos of hard drugs (heroin and cocaine), compared to 150 kilos in 1990, 1992 and 1993 combined. Internationally, the UN report found that narcotics had taken root in all societies, regardless of the cultural and economic situation. The report warned that both the financial power and political influence of drug cartels were on the increase, with drug-trafficking gangs often dividing the products and spoils among them. The report also said amphetamines are severely affecting the Scandinavian countries and that the use of ecstasy has increased dramatically throughout Europe. The drug is now a leading cause of night-time road accidents. Based on data given by 140 countries, the report estimates that 1994 will see an increase in the demand of codeine-based drugs and morphine. In Europe, the use of methadone, as a heroin substitute, is expected to rise.
