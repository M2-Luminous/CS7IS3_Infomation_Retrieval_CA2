He became politically known after he instituted criminal proceedings against Gorbachev, General Secretary of the then-ruling CPSU, for which he was dismissed from the Procurator's Office. He is now Chairman of the State Duma Security Committee. At the editorial office's request Viktor Ivanovich shares his thoughts on the plans and prospects for the work of this most important section of the new parliament: [Ilyukhin] Many people are troubled by my party membership: How come a communist has been elected to such a responsible post in a legislative organ of a democratic state? But I do not see that this interferes in any way with a collegial organ's fruitful work. Incidentally, all three of my deputies belong to different parties which society also regards equivocally. Viktor Pimenovich Mironov represents "Russia's Choice," Sergey Semenovich Boskholov the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and Nina Viktorovna Krivelskaya the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. They are all first-class jurists and professionals in the best sense of the word. From the very first steps in our joint work we have set aside our party bias and sought a common language and mutual understanding. The committee has a total of 20 members and the volume of work is enormous. It is encouraging that the other committee members are also highly qualified jurists. We have expert lawyers, people with experience of working in courts and internal affairs organs, and attorneys with a wealth of practical experience. At our very first session we found out that a collective of like minds is forming and that everyone is concerned about one thing: The lack of a clear concept of the country's national security, thought out in the finest detail. So first of all we will be working hard to elaborate one. Not an easy task, because we are faced with a whole range of interconnected problems which are difficult to solve. Taking national security to mean first of all the consolidation of a state's territorial integrity and unity, we are singling out four main facets. They are borders, customs, federal security services including border troops, and, of course, economic security. All this needs to be clearly enshrined in legislation. The next set of pressing problems is legal support for the fight against crime on the basis of a long-term, wide-ranging program which includes scientific substantiation, finances, cadre policy, and many other things. The implementation of this program is also directly linked with the direct protection of the person and his individuality, which we are wont to talk about a lot but which we in fact push into the background. So an urgent change of emphasis from words to deeds is needed. Incidentally, what is required in this respect is a review of the state of emergency legislation, which must also protect people first and foremost and not be reduced to sharing out authority. Finally, the fourth set is an expert criminological assessment of all draft laws passing through the Duma, irrespective of who has prepared them. It is up to us to detect all the flaws in legislative acts which could substantially complicate the criminogenic situation in the country. Of course, the committee will not be able to cope with this volume of work alone. We plan to bring in expert specialists and scientific subdivisions of practical experts. Discussion papers are already available. We are finding good understanding in other Duma committees. At the very first session we defined our priority tasks. They include finalizing work on the Law on Combating Corruption. The attention to this question is easily explained: The crime rate is increasing, there is a tidal wave of illegal acts, and bribery and mercenary string-pulling have corroded the entire state executive mechanism, including the law-enforcement organs. This retards any healthy transformations in Russia. Mafia clans are already dictating their policy not only at the neighborhood level but also in entire cities and oblasts, and in some places they are even taking control of legislators' activities. This will continue as long as an official at any level is dependent on his boss' will and whim. He must obey only the law and must serve it faithfully and truly. The law had already been prepared by our predecessors and adopted by the Supreme Soviet, but it was not signed by the president. In my view, the reason is not the shortcomings it undoubtedly contains but the struggle between several schools of law, whose representatives were unable to agree among themselves but were able to persuade the president to postpone the law's adoption. Through the efforts of two committees -- ours and the one on legislation and judicial reform -- we have already held a first hearing on the law and we will soon be submitting it for consideration at a Duma session sitting. It cannot be postponed any longer. Two other draft laws are next in line -- "On the State Protection of Judges and Employees of Law-Enforcement and Control Organs" and "On the Protection of Witnesses, Victims, and Other People Assisting in Legal Proceedings." They brook no delay either. Because judges and MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] employees are being murdered, witnesses and victims are being intimidated, and their families are being kept in fear. How can a judge or court official who is besieged, totally dependent, and lacking life's essentials be objective? What is the use of a militiaman who does not feel that he is backed up by state protection? How can the evidence of a witness be relied on if, outside the precincts of the court, he is not protected from the criminals he is accusing? We predict that these laws will not have an easy passage through the Duma. Not because deputies do not understand their importance and timeliness but because some legislators will think that the state cannot afford them at the moment. Nevertheless, this expenditure must be made if we seriously intend to fight crime and really protect people. The committee has extensive plans. We have a great deal to do to improve the criminal and criminal-procedure codes and we will be taking part in the drafting of laws on the Prosecutor's Office, the legal profession, the Constitutional Court, and many other things. I want to single out especially the upcoming work to legislatively enshrine the new status of the Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. This is a difficult question which will certainly provoke many disputes and disagreements. In my opinion, the president exceeded his powers by disbanding the Security Ministry. The new Constitution does not give him the right to autonomously destroy and reform institutions of state authority. In place of what is, especially now, a vitally essential part of the law-enforcement system yet another presidential special service has been formed. There are too many of them as it is. Something similar can be observed with the MVD. Essentially the enforcement structures are being removed from Prosecutor's Office oversight and judicial and parliamentary control, and levers of authoritarian power are being strengthened. During its reorganization the FCS lost its investigation apparatus. This is a blow to its capability. The shield remains but the sword has been taken away. I grant that some people will not agree with me, but I will defend my opinion both inside and outside committee sessions. A considerable number of these complex debates lie ahead of us. Just take the question of borders. It is no longer possible to put up with the large-meshed sieve into which they have now turned. But to construct new ones will require at least five to seven years of intensive work and expenditure equal to twice or three times Russia's annual budget (without drinking, eating, or spending a cent on anything else). There is one solution: To agree with our close neighbors on a single external CIS border. They cannot protect it by themselves -- as eloquently demonstrated by Tajikistan's experience. That means that we must form joint border troops -- which requires an interstate accord. We must not shy away from each other but act hand in hand. What is of help here is both our historical experience and the recognition of the prospect of the inevitable unification of the collapsed Union on a new basis. West Europe's experience indicates the same: Strength through unification. Most of our countries' inhabitants think the same: Because they were cut for real when they were separated, borders were drawn through families and futures. In my opinion, the only obstacle now is leaders' political ambitions. I by no means want to switch the conversation about our committee's plans to the political plane. But when national security is being discussed there is no escaping politics. Our committee does not consider itself to be exceeding its powers in putting forward some urgent demands and recommendations to the Federal Assembly, the country's government, and the Russian president. In particular, in order to achieve our national security the country's and the Foreign Ministry's leaders must urgently agree with all CIS countries that the latter will not wholly or partly join any military bloc opposing Russia. And I believe that a strict demand should be put to our Baltic neighbors: One of the mandatory conditions for the withdrawal of our troops from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is a pledge on their part not to join any military bloc with other states and not to allow foreign military bases to be located on their territory. So, the tasks facing our committee are complex and crucial, just like the concept of security itself.
