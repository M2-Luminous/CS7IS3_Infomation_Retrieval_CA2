In a statement he issued today, the al-Azhar shaykh called on Islamic governments and peoples to unite and back the efforts Egypt and some Islamic states are making at the United Nations to deter the treacherous aggression, return the lands the Serbs usurped to their Muslim owners, and lift the arms embargo so that the Bosnian people can defend themselves against an enemy equipped with the most modern mass destruction weapons taken from the former Yugoslavia and some other governments. The al-Azhar grand shaykh expressed his pain and deep concern at the crimes being committed against Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the desecration of sanctities; and the killing of old men, women and children. These crimes conflict with the UN charter, the Declaration of Human Rights, basic ethical values, and the human bonds that link the people of the earth together, the statement said. Jad-al-Haqq remarked that it is regrettable that this unjustified aggression should involve Muslims, although they are entitled to live according to their creeds and canons that recognize others' right to live according to their own creed. Islam reiterates that "there will be no coercion in religion," [Koranic verse] he said. Concluding his statement, Shaykh Jad-al-Haqq prayed to Allah to guide mankind to the right course and preserve Muslim blood, land, and lives in Bosnia-Herzegovina and everywhere in the world.
