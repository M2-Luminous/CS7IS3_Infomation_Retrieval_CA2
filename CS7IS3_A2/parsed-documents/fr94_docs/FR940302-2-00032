SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The U.S. Department of Energy issued on December 16, 1993 this draft report and an accompanying documentation summary under the authority provided by the Department of Energy Organization Act. The draft report is the result of over a year-long effort on behalf of staff representing DOE's various subdivisions reflecting diverse expertise and knowledge. The report examines the possible need for expanding the nation's energy infrastructure, and issues related to that potential growth, based on projections of energy supply and demand developed by the Energy Information Administration, with the goal of developing appropriate policy direction for the Department. The agenda for each stakeholder meeting will cover topics such as siting needs, siting problems and constraints, the ideas presented in the draft report, and constructive roles for the Department of Energy and other federal agencies in improving energy facility siting processes. The meetings will be structured to elicit individual views, not to reach consensus. Members of the general public are invited to observe the meetings and offer comment during a portion of the agenda, within space and time constraints. The views expressed at the meetings will be considered in preparing the final report. Issued in Washington, DC, on February 24, 1994. Abraham E. Haspel, Acting Assistant Secretary for Policy, Planning and Program Evaluation. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4739 Filed 3&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
