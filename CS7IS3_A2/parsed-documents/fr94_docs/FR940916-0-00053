FR940916-0-00053 FR940916-0-00016 Paragraph (a), Actual Cost basis, was amended in the interim final rule to include reference to AST/MST and to add new paragraphs (14) and (15) which, respectively, disallow payments for early equipment delivery or non-capitalizable pre-delivery expenses for such technology. Paragraph (b), Actual Cost items, sets forth the items which comprise Actual Cost. One commenter advised that the citations to the Act in paragraph (a) should be corrected to ``Section 1104A(b)(2) or 1104B(b)(2)'' and ``Section 1103(A)(a)(5)''. With regard to paragraph (b), Inclusion of owner furnished equipment in Actual Cost Determination, one commenter stated that it is appropriate to include as part of Actual Cost items the cost of owner supplied facilities that are part of AST/MST, such as land, buildings, drydocks, piers, etc., and the cost of upgrading, renovating, refurbishing, and relocating such facilities. The rationale is that such items play a role in construction of AST/MST that is as important as owner-furnished equipment in the construction of a vessel and that the value assigned to such items should be fair market value or a percentage thereof. Several shipyards commented that, to the extent that the regulations do not follow Cost Accounting Standard 404 relating to tangible capital assets constructed by a contractor for its own use, they should be amended to do so in order to permit the inclusion of indirect costs in the calculation of Actual Cost, i.e., general and administrative expense when in-house construction requires planning, supervisory, or other significant effort by officers or other personnel whose salaries are charged to G&A expenses. With respect to new paragraph (b)(14), some commenters urged that the concept of including payments for early delivery of a Vessel or AST/MST should be reconsidered since there is clear economic value in many cases for receiving early delivery, and speed in producing the end result should be encouraged and not discouraged. This is especially true when the need is considered for U.S. shipyards to accelerate their delivery schedules to compete more effectively with foreign yards. MARAD Response: The references in paragraph (a) will be corrected to read ``section 1104A(b)(2) or 1104B(b)(2)'' and ``section 1103A(a)(5),'' respectively. Extending the Guarantee to land, buildings, and other preexisting facilities is not accepted, as MARAD has limited resources to finance the AST/MST vessel projects. Moreover, as a general practice, MARAD has disallowed the inclusion of indirect costs in the calculation of Actual Cost. MARAD's appropriated funds are available for the direct costs of constructing the asset; the inclusion of indirect costs carries with it the potential for unjustified inflation of the Actual Cost to the detriment of the taxpayer and the program. MARAD has not financed the payment of premiums for early delivery of Vessels because these costs do not add to the value of the collateral and, in any event, the value of the premium should be recoverable by the shipowner as profit arising from its operations. Consistent with the amendments to sections 298.11(a), concerning U.S. construction, and 298.13(a)(2)(i) with respect to Actual Cost, MARAD has also adopted a specific, explicit exclusion of the cost of such foreign components of the hull and superstructure, and the cost of their foreign assembly, in a new paragraph (c)(16) of section 298.21. Section 298.23 ␣Refinancing The section was amended in the interim final rule to provide that refinancing of Title XI debt only shall be permitted for AST/MST. One commenter noted that the refinancing limitation with respect to technology is not imposed by statute and that refinancing of recently incurred debt should be allowed. Several shipyards commented that the provision regarding technology is too restrictive because it would preclude the refinancing of a ``bridge loan'' incurred prior to the receipt of Title XI financing. MARAD Response: MARAD is of the opinion that it is not sound policy to use a Government Guarantee to refinance existing shipyard debt. As a matter of administrative discretion, MARAD has decided to use its limited funds for the development and use of new technology by U.S. shipyards not previously privately financed and for Vessel projects. On the other hand, the refinancing of Title XI debt at a lower interest rate benefits all participants, thereby reducing the government's exposure under the guaranteed obligations. To clarify, however, that the whole of section 298.23 applies to the refinancing of AST/MST, the final rule has been amended by inserting the words ``or Advanced or Modern Shipbuilding Technology'', where appropriate, in section 298.23. Section 298.31 ␣Mortgage Paragraph (a), In general, was amended in the interim final rule to include a provision for evidence of the Secretary's security interest in AST/MST, which may be a form of security other than a Mortgage. That paragraph also requires, with respect to a foreign Mortgage for Eligible Export Vessels, that to ensure the validity and worldwide enforceability of such Mortgages, the Secretary will require the Obligor to obtain satisfactory legal opinions from foreign counsel. One commenter stated that it is not clear whether a security interest that is not a Mortgage can be used as satisfactory evidence for the Secretary. The commenter suggested that MARAD specifically provide for the use of security interests, in addition to Mortgages, in its program for Eligible Export Vessels. The commenter argued that MARAD should specifically allow this type of transaction and should not rely on the ``Exemptions'' provision in the regulations to permit other financing structures.
