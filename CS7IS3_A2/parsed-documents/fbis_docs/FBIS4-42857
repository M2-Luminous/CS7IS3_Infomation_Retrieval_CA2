While the latter exerted tight control over the party during his tenure as PSD secretary general, Nogueira has been able to create his own "enormous network of dependencies," which could nevertheless change as soon as this "retinue" would "no longer be fed." At the ideological level, Dias Loureiro embodies liberal, free market principles, while Nogueira represents social democracy. Between the two stand the technocrats, who carefully remain equidistant from both and tabulate the losses in the conflict. According to Mestrinho, Dias Loureiro has dropped out of the race to succeed Prime Minister Cavaco Silva, for he knows that the next PSD leader will be only "transitory" and prefers to wait. While he holds "strong" trump cards in his attempt to prevent Nogueira's rise, he is beginning to pay more attention to "cold and calculating" Minister of Foreign Affairs Durao Barroso, whose career in achieving his high position has been "autonomous," Mestrinho asserted. According to the results of a May Catholic University/O INDEPENDENTE poll (no further details) published in the 20 May Lisbon weekly O INDEPENDENTE, Durao Barroso is the most popular minister in the Cavaco Silva government. For his part, Nogueira is aware that despite his ability to secure the succession to Cavaco Silva, he can only do so by remaining in the government, and will never be able to claim, as Cavaco Silva has, that "I am the party," Mestrinho asserted. His ascension will depend on negotiations with other PSD "barons" eager for action after years of "forced domestication." Mestrinho then commented on other possible successors to Cavaco Silva. Former Prime Minister Francisco Pinto Balsemao is one, but he is only interested in the presidency, and thus depends on Cavaco Silva. Rui Machete is another; however, he was already PS leader in the past, and "criminals never return to the scene of the crime." Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Joao de Deus Pinheiro, now a European Union (EU) commissioner, is often mentioned because of his openness to dialogue and the ability to negotiate with the various party factions. Two other names to remember, Mestrinho added, are Minister of Public Works Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral, a key member of the government with high visibility because of the large-scale building of roads and bridges, and former Minister of Agriculture Cardoso e Cunha, a member of the PSD national political commission now in charge of Expo-98, a project that will bring changes to half of Lisbon.
