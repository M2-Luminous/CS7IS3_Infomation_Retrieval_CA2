Duties on imported goods may serve several purposes. First of all, there is basic protectionism, that is, the protection of domestic manufacturers against competition from foreign companies. Second, the fiscal aim, or the strengthening of the income part of the state budget. Third, by regulating the flow of commodities into the country, you can strengthen its balance of payments and the national currency rate. Some people in Russia believe that high tariffs can be used to protect consumers' interests within the country. First of all, something about protectionism. The main rule is that you cannot simultaneously protect all sectors by means of tariffs (this can be achieved only by completely closing the borders, with entirely predictable consequences). You can only protect individual, relatively small industries. Let us suppose that a decision is adopted to raise tariffs on the import of automobiles, automobile spare parts, and machine tools. Does the Volga Motor Vehicle Plant gain something? Can it successfully compete even on the domestic market against imported output? The answer is by no means obvious. The price of imported automobiles will go up to some extent. This will be followed by the price of domestic automobiles, but the plant's profit as a whole may fall because of the simultaneous increase in the cost of production connected with the acquisition of more expensive equipment and spare parts. You can draw one conclusion from this simple example: Which of the enterprises are protected is unknown, but on the other hand, it is clear who has lost -- all the country's automobile manufacturers. The introduction of duties on machines and equipment may have even more serious consequences (particularly loud appeals are being made by lobbyists to introduce such duties). A high tariff will be an obstacle to importing state-of-the-art equipment, and Russian manufacturers will be forced to use old and obsolescent machines. This will make all potential exporters uncompetitive, because they will be working with old equipment. The second rule is that, if raised duties of a protectionist nature are implemented, then this should only be on consumer goods. Now something about the fiscal role of duties on imports. Despite popular opinion, the overwhelming majority of budget income from this type of tax depends not only on the rate of the tax itself but also on how easy it is to collect. Furthermore, importers seek and often find a possibility of completely avoiding or significantly reducing payments. The idea of re-grading, as old as the whole command system itself, is in operation here: One commodity is imported, but another is declared, and it is not the state treasury that gains, but individual interested parties. Hopes that higher import tariffs may have a favorable effect on the balance of payments and the rate of exchange are also illusory. In theory, the demand for foreign currency will most likely fall, which may help maintain a stable exchange rate. But stabilizing the exchange rate by reducing imports is using the worst of all the possible methods. First of all, an increase in exports could have a far more significant favorable effect on the exchange rate and its stabilization (the abolition of export quotas in 1994 would make it possible to increase exports by $18 billion). And second, successful macroeconomic stabilization would ensure a stable rate of exchange in the long term. But after all, the exchange rate is not an end in itself. And although the historical experience of countries which have suffered high inflation and hyperinflation shows graphically that the stabilization of the currency rate was always a constituent element of a successful policy of curbing inflation, the experience of summer 1993 testifies that the stability of the ruble against the dollar has not led to a reduction in internal inflation or an improvement in any other macroeconomic indicators. In conclusion, the thesis about the protection of the Russian consumers' interests. You have to start with the fact that the actual approach is wrong in principle. The rights of the consumer may best be protected by a system of no import duties. In 1990 the Polish peasants, who are a powerful and well-organized force in the country, demanded that the government maintain high duties on the import of milk and dairy products. More or less in the same way as Russian manufacturers are now complaining that Russia will suffer from lower tariffs, they stated that the unrestricted import of milk into Poland would lead to a significant reduction in agricultural production and increase unemployment. The reformers' government stood firm and refused to compromise. The beginning of open competition against foreign milk was a really difficult time for the Polish farmers, as Polish milk was literally going sour after a few days, whereas European milk could keep for far longer. But in the end they were able to significantly improve the quality and saleability of the product, and they were victorious. West Europe is now being forced to protect itself against Polish dairy expansion. It is obvious who was the winner in this story -- the Polish consumers, who received good-quality milk, and the Polish producers, trading with Europe. Russia differs from Poland in that here it is not only the peasants who are well organized. Russia has the most effective system in the world for lobbying decisions being adopted by the government. Enterprises relate to industrial ministries, and their interests are protected in the government by the ministers. Only the poor consumer is left unprotected. If the government is led by the industrial ministries and raises the rates on imported output, the Russian consumer will continue to drive automobiles which are eternally lagging behind Western models, work using outdated equipment, and drink sour milk.
