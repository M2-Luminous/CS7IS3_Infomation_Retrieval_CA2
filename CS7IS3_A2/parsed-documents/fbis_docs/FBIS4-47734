For weeks now, bitter fighting has been going on between factions within ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and today, there are further reports of fresh fighting between Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces and Roosevelt Johnson's Krahn fighters on the road to ULIMO headquarters at Tubmanburg. From Monrovia, Nii Nartey Allison telexed this report: The fighting intensified there along the Clay-Tubmanburg Highway. Villagers fleeing the war zone said that both Krahns and Mandingos are targeting elements of the Gola and Vai ethnic groups, the original inhabitants of Bomi County. We are not part of their war, but we are the ones dying innocently, said Francis Ramsoa, a Gola. The situation has caused a further movement of villagers into displaced camps in the Po River community, 20 km northwest of Monrovia. They said fighters on the two opposing sides were breaking down doors and windows and burning down houses of civilians suspected of supporting either side. According to the villagers, hundreds of others, mostly old people, were left behind in the frenzy to flee. I don't know what has happened to my father. He could not run and the bullets were sounding closer. So, I ran, leaving him behind, (Wusu Williams) explained, sobbing in tears. She said fighters of both sides had instituted forced conscription and were compelling villagers to carry looted items on their heads. If you refuse, you are shot at on the spot, she added. Aid workers said about 150 panic-stricken villagers arrived on Saturday [30 April] alone in (Kamara) village which is already swarming with 2,000 refugees, mainly women, children, and the elderly. Reports from several sources in the capital said further clashes were continuing between the two sides to control the ambushed village, a town 30 miles northwest of Monrovia. The field commander of Alhaji Koromah's Mandingo forces, Mohamed Duguya, in a statement on Saturday, ordered all civilians to leave the area and called for the withdrawal of African peacekeeping troops deployed in the area.
