These options include a rise in the consumption tax rate, a new tax on returns from gambling and a cut in tax-free corporate reserves set aside for bad loans, they said. These tax increase proposals will be detailed in a report to be presented by the Tax Commission to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa by the end of June, they said. In an interim report submitted last November, the Tax Commission proposed raising the consumption tax rate, but stopped short of making a proposal on how much. The sources said the final report may offer three proposals on the size of the tax rate increase -- "big," "medium," and "small." The issue of how to finance income tax cuts and how to reform the tax system in the face of the aging of Japan's population have been in the spotlight for months as Hosokawa failed to sell a plan to introduce a new welfare tax.
