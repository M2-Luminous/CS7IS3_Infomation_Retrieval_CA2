The Estonian Foreign Ministry has emphasized this in a statement. The document notes that of 10,500 retired Russian military men here, 6,000 are under 60 years of age; over 1,000 are under 50; and 360 men are as young as 35 to 45. Vasiliy Svirin, the leader of the Russian talks delegation, said at a news conference yesterday that the majority of the retired servicemen are elderly people who must be allowed to end their days in peace. As is known, Russia is refusing to conclude a troop withdrawal agreement if no agreement is signed simultaneously on social guarantees for the retired military men. The Estonian Foreign Ministry notes that Svirin's claim about the retired servicemen's age is not accurate. A typical retired serviceman living in Estonia is a former counterintelligence officer or a paratrooper, aged 36-46, the Foreign Ministry declares in its statement. The Foreign Ministry stresses that Russian military presence in any form at all is very dangerous for Estonian security. Russian retired servicemen not only generate anxiety for the local population but have also close links with criminal elements, the statement says. The Foreign Ministry adds that despite these circumstances Estonia has introduced a procedure whereby retired servicemen can apply for residence permits. As the issue is very important from the point of view of state security, Estonian officials must process each case on an individual basis. This is what the statement says, according to BNS.
