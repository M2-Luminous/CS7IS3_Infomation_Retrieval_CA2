Part 211 is revised to read as follows: Sec. 211.101␣Purpose 211.102␣Definitions 211.103␣Administration of preference. Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1302. §211.101 Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to define veterans' preference and the administration of preference in Federal employment. (5 U.S.C. 2108) §211.102 Definitions. For the purposes of preference in Federal employment the following definitions apply: (a) Veteran means a person who was separated with an honorable discharge or under honorable conditions from active duty in the armed forces performed_ (1) In a war; or, (2) In a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized; or, (3) During the period beginning April 28, 1952, and ending July 1, 1955; or, (4) For more than 180 consecutive days, other than for training, any part of which occurred during the period beginning February 1, 1955, and ending October 14, 1976. (b) Disabled veteran means a person who was separated under honorable conditions from active duty in the armed forces performed at any time and who has established the present existence of a service-connected disability or is receiving compensation, disability retirement benefits, or pensions because of a public statute administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs or a military department. (c) Preference eligible means veterans, spouses, widows, or mothers who meet the definition of ``preference eligible'' in 5 U.S.C. 2108. Preference eligibles are entitled to have 5 or 10 points added to their earned score on a civil service examination (see 5 U.S.C. 3309). They are also accorded a higher retention standing in the event of a reduction in force (see 5 U.S.C. 3502). Preference does not apply, however, to inservice placement actions such as promotions. (d) Armed forces means the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. (e) Uniformed services means the armed forces, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (f) Active duty or active military duty means full-time duty with military pay and allowances in the armed forces, except for training or for determining physical fitness and except for service in the Reserves or National Guard. (g) Separated under honorable conditions means either an honorable or a general discharge from the armed forces. The Department of Defense is responsible for administering and defining military discharges. §211.103 Administration of preference. Agencies are responsible for making all preference determinations except for preference based on a common law marriage. Such a claim should be referred to OPM's General Counsel for decision. PART 230_ORGANIZATION OF THE GOVERNMENT FOR PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 2. The authority citation for Part 230 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 1302, 3301, 3302; E.O. 10577, 3 CFR 1954&hyph;1958 Comp., p. 218; sec. 230.402 also issued under 5 U.S.C. 1104. 3. In §230.402, paragraphs (a) through (h) are redesignated as paragraphs (b) through (i), respectively; a new paragraph (a) is added; and newly redesignated paragraph (b) is revised to read as follows: §230.402 Agency authority to make emergency-indefinite appointments in a national emergency. (a) When a national emergency exists_ (1) Definition. A national emergency must meet all of the following conditions: (i) It was declared by the President or Congress. (ii) It involves a danger to the United States' safety, security, or stability that results from specified circumstances or conditions and that is national in scope. (iii) It requires a national program specifically intended to combat the threat to national safety, security, or stability. (2) Termination of a national emergency. A national emergency no longer exists if it is officially terminated by the President or Congress, or if the specific circumstances, conditions, or program cited in the original declaration are terminated or corrected. (b) Basic authority. Agencies may make emergency-indefinite appointments without OPM approval during any national emergency as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. The head of an agency with a defense-related mission may request OPM's approval to make emergency-indefinite appointments without a declared national emergency when the President has authorized the call-up of some portion of the military reserves for some military purpose. The request must demonstrate that normal hiring procedures cannot meet surge employment requirements and that use of emergency-indefinite appointments is necessary for economy and efficiency. Except as provided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, agencies must make emergency-indefinite appointments from appropriate registers of eligibles as long as there are available eligibles. * * * * *
