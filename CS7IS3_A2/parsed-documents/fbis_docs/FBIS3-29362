Regarding this, the ROK Defense Ministry, the department in charge of the exercise, is taking a prudent attitude. The Team Spirit exercise is a large-scale military mobile exercise that has been staged every year since 1976 and has played a major role in weakening North Korea's will for war. Ever since the United States won the Gulf war by mobilizing ultramodern weapons, North Korea bears in mind that the odds are in favor of the United States in case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula. Furthermore, North Korea, terming the Team Spirit exercise as a war exercise for northward invasion, is learned to have been greatly menaced by the exercise, and assumed emergency alert posture while the annual exercise was conducted. Such being the case, the MND maintains that the question on calling off the exercise is certain to be an effective bargaining chip for resolution of the nuclear issue. The MND assumes a stance that North Korea's acceptance of nuclear inspection cannot be seen as the resolution of the nuclear issue but, at best, a return to the situation before it announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Its reason is that there are other problems that need to be solved, including the inspection of undeclared sites, to prove its nonpossession of nuclear weapons. In a nutshell, the MND thinks the time is not ripe to discuss the issue at the present stage, The MND sees that the suspension of this year's Team Spirit can only be discussed when IAEA inspections are actually carried out in North Korea and the exchange of North-South special envoys gets good results. Only when these demands are met, the MND maintains, should there be the ROK-U.S. joint announcement on the suspension of the Team Spirit exercise, along with the agenda for the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. The MND has also made clear that an expression of the will to suspend the exercise does not correspond to the suspension of the exercise. This means that it will announce the skipping of this year's exercise only when tangible achievements are seen in IAEA nuclear inspections and the exchange of special envoys. Judging that IAEA inspection will take at least two weeks. The MND notes that if North Korea shows a sincerity in negotiations for North-South mutual nuclear inspections and the third round of high-level talks with the United States during this period, it may announce the suspension of this year's exercise. Before the final decision is made, chances are high that its intention to call off Team Spirit may be expressed through a government-level channel toward the end of February or early March, however, this is eligible to change during the negotiating process with the North. Taking into account that North Korea has employed a foot-dragging tactic in negotiating inspection-related issues until now, the MND predicts that North Korea is much likely to express its intention to receive nuclear inspections before the IAEA Board of Governors' Meeting slated for 21 February for the moment and then delay inspections of undeclared sites to the extent that Team Spirit cannot be conducted. This is what the MND is concerned about. In this perspective, the MND position is that the question on whether to cancel the exercise or not is effective in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue and that it should be used as a final bargaining chip to the maximum until North Korea clears its attitude. It was learned that the MND is discussing with the United States whether or not the ROK may make the final decision on suspending or conducting the Team Spirit exercise, at least this year, instead of sharing the decision with the United States.
