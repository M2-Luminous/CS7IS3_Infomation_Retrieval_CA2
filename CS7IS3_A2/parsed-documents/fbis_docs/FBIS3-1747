If they are equipped with production and management conditions as well as management ability, all urban residents, peasants, herdsmen, personnel of enterprises and institutions who are on leave without pay, resigned, and retired, demobilized and retired military personnel; this year's graduates from universities, colleges, and secondary specialized schools; personnel who are retired or retired with honor; as well as surplus personnel who are separated from party and government organizations, enterprises, and institutions during the course of their organizational reform and the change of operating mechanisms can apply for permission to engage in individual and privately-owned business. Cadres of party and government organizations (not including those who are clearly stipulated by the state) are encouraged to lead the operation (ling ban 7325 6586) of or setting up of (chuang ban 0482 6586) economic entities of a privately-owned nature within a set period. Such economic entities will be disconnected from the organizations when conditions are ripe. Workers and staff members of state-owned enterprises and the state's institutions are permitted to engage in business activities during their spare time or take a concurrent job or work as an assistant at individual industrial and commercial households as well as at privately-owned enterprises. State-owned enterprise workers and staff members who are waiting for job assignments because the production of their units is suspended or half-suspended, can apply, with a certificate issued by their former unit, for permission to engage in individual business on a temporary basis or set up privately-owned enterprise. They also can work for privately-owned enterprises. After their former enterprises resume production, they can return to their former units. Law enforcement personnel of public security, industrial and commercial administration, taxation, auditing, supervision, and other units are not allowed to engage in individual and privately- owned business if they still are not disconnected from their organizations. 2. The time period in which demobilized military cadres and surplus personnel of the state's organizations whose jobs have not yet been rearranged run privately-owned enterprises or work in privately-owned enterprises can be added to the length of their service at their former units; for graduates from universities, colleges, and secondary specialized schools as well as youths waiting job assignment -- those persons whose job assignments should be arranged by the state but are not yet assigned to work in a particular unit, if they work in privately-owned enterprises of their own or in privately-owned enterprises, the time period in which they work for such enterprises can be added to the length of their service at the state's units where they are assigned to work later; if enterprise workers and staff members engage in individual or privately owned business during the period in which the production of their units is suspended or half-suspended, their length of service in this period can be added to the former one. 3. Scientific and technological personnel who are on leave without pay, resigned, and retired can set up scientific, technological, development, consultation, and service businesses. On-the-job scientific and technological personnel can hold a concurrent job at individual industrial and commercial households as well as privately-owned enterprises to engage in technological development, new product development, technological training, consultation services, and other activities allowed by the state's policies. In terms of appraising and rewarding the scientific and technological results as well as developing new products, people-run organizations for scientific and technological development, consultation, and services, which have been approved by scientific and technological administrations, enjoy equal treatment as scientific research units owned by the whole people. 4. To engage in individual business, the applicant should bring his own identification card and application form and apply for registration directly with the local industrial and commercial administration. To apply for a privately owned enterprise license, the applicant should follow the relevant regulations of the state and the autonomous region. 5. The registered funds of individual industrial and commercial households shall be approved in accordance with the amounts recorded on application forms. There is no need to provide credit certificates. 6. County-level industrial and commercial administrations can authorize industrial and commercial administrative offices to issue temporary business licenses for individual industrial and commercial households; county-level industrial and commercial administrations in remote and poverty-stricken areas can authorize industrial and commercial administrative offices to issue business licenses for individual industrial and commercial households. 7. The business scope and management of individual and privately-owned economic sectors shall be further relaxed. Except for those trades and commodities which the state laws and regulations prohibit management of by individual industrial and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises, they are allowed to manage all other trades and commodities. The style for managing trades and commodities which are allowed to be managed by individual and privately owned businesses shall be completely free. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises may form economic associations of various forms embracing different regions, trades, and ownership systems; and they may buy shares from each other. Privately owned enterprises may contract, lease, merge with, or purchase state-owned and collective enterprises. 8. With approval from the competent authority, individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises may set up private schools, kindergartens, hospitals, and clinics. Except for the category of mines prohibited by the state or the autonomous regional people's government for exploitation, individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises may apply for the exploitation of small amounts of mineral ores and establishment of small mining enterprises. 9. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises may transport means of production or subsistence or farm and sideline products for sale over long distances to meet market demands; they should be encouraged to carry out comprehensive mobile business activities in remote farming and pastoral areas and poor areas; and they should also be encouraged and supported to engage in commodity wholesale businesses. To actively encourage individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises to develop tertiary industries, registration formalities should be simplified and sped up with regard to application for setting up businesses in commerce, food catering, service, repairing, consultation, communications, and long-distance transportation and sale. 10. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises should be supported in setting up joint and cooperative ventures with foreign investors and in engaging in processing with materials and samples or assembling of parts and components provided by foreign clients and in compensation trade. They may engage in mutual trade with border residents. In line with the policy of inducing investment from abroad and developing lateral ties at home, the competent authority should treat individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises the same way as state-owned enterprises, and should examine and approve their application for the establishment of the "three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises" within the time limit. Those that have received the approval and are issued the "PRC license for the three kinds of foreign-funded enterprises" are entitled to preferential treatment in absorbing foreign capital as prescribed in the relevant state and regional policies. A "business license of enterprise legal entity" should be issued to privately owned enterprises that have set up wholly funded or partnership businesses abroad so their legal status can be established. 11. When peasants and herdsmen in poor remote areas apply for the establishment of individual and privately-owned economic undertakings, the industry and commerce administration may, in accordance with the principle of "opening up first and regulating later," file the application on record and allow them to begin business activities without obtaining a license and paying fees and to complete the registration after the conditions are ripe. Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall be given to individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises for a given period after they set up factories or stores for productive operations in farming and pastoral areas in accordance with the relevant regulations. Preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption shall be given to individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises that set up productive undertakings in remote farming and pastoral areas, especially in townships and villages below the county level. 12. Privately owned enterprises that meet the quota of employing handicapped people shall be given tax reduction or exemption as deemed appropriate by tax offices; and the industry and commerce administration may reduce or exempt administrative fees on them. Revenues from tax reduction and exemption for privately owned enterprises should be used for expanding the scale of production. 13. With approval from the science and technology and planning and economic commissions at the same level and with the certification of tax offices, individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises shall be given preferential treatment in tax reduction and exemption during a given period of time in their trial development and production of new products. 14. The administrative departments of industry and commerce, taxation, commodity prices, public security, urban construction and environmental protection, science and technology, and public health should actively provide guidance and consultation regarding laws, regulations, policies, information, and science and technology; and they should exercise administration within the scope of their functions prescribed by the law to create a favorable social environment for the healthy development of individual and private economic sectors. 15. The lawful rights and interests of individual and private economic sectors shall be protected by law. Except under circumstances allowed by the state laws and statutes and the regulations of the regional people's government, no unit or individual shall be allowed to arbitrarily collect fees and donations from and impose fines on individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises. When fees are collected, it is necessary to show the "fee collection license" issued by the commodity price department, publicize the reason and standard for fee collection, and use the uniform voucher. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises have the right to refuse to pay illegal fees, and to report and complain to the government and relevant departments. 16. Except for the industry and commerce administration, no unit or individual shall be allowed to seize or revoke the business license of individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises. Units and personnel concerned should bear legal and economic responsibilities for economic and other damage done to individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises as a result of illegal seizure or revoking of their business license. 17. Land used by individual industrial and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises for business operations or factory construction should be incorporated into the overall plan of urban construction. The urban construction department should arrange appropriate buisness venues for individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises that are to be dismantled and relocated under urban construction plans. When the dismantling and relocation is approved by a people's government at and above the county level, the construction units and individuals should bear the dismantling and relocation expenses according to the relevant regulations. No unit or individual shall be allowed to occupy business venues which have been approved by the competent authority for use by individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises. Units and individuals that occupy such venues shall be responsible for economic damage caused by the occupation. 18. Staff members of state administrative organs shall not violate the lawful rights and interests of individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises. Violators shall be given administrative disciplinary action and economic penalties by the competent authority, depending on the degree of seriousness; those who cause economic damage shall be ordered to make compensation, and those who violate criminal law shall be turned over to the judicial organ and be affixed with criminal responsibilities. 19. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises shall use the uniform voucher which is printed by the taxation department and which does not indicate the nature of ownership. No unit shall be allowed to reject the voucher as receipt for expense. 20. To harness the enthusiasm of individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises in donating funds to schools, education departments at all levels should allow schools to accept children of individual industrial and commercial households and owners and employees of private enterprises from both inside and outside the locality. 21. Qualified individual industrial and commercial households and owners and employees of private enterprises may apply to join the CPC, the Communist Youth League, and the Army; to go to a school of higher grade; to be recruited as cadres or workers; and to be elected as model workers, people's congress deputies, and members of the people's political consultative conference. Outstanding individuals with meritorious service may be recommended to leading posts. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately run enterprises that have made outstanding contributions to the regional economic development and have delivered more than 50,000 yuan in taxes annually may apply to governments at various levels for transfer from agricultural to nonagricultural households. 22. Governments at all levels should strengthen leadership over associations of self-employed workers; actively create conditions for solving practical problems related to personnel, budget, and office venue; and bring into full play the role of associations in self-education, self-management, and self-service. 23. Banking institutions at all levels should actively provide quality service for business activities pursued by individual industrial and commercial households and privately-owned enterprises. When they apply to banks and credit cooperatives for loans to meet operational needs, banking institutions and credit cooperatives at all levels should treat them in the same manner as state and collective enterprises and should support them with loans according to the state credit policies. 24. Industry and commerce administrative departments at all levels should step up coordination with relevant departments in assisting individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises to solve problems related to loans, business venues, product appraisal and exportation, evaluation and employment of specialized technical personnel, and overseas commercial activities. 25. Industry and commerce administrative departments and associations of self-employed workers at various levels should strengthen ideological and political education and education on the legal system and on professional ethnics among individual industrial and commercial households and owners and employees of privately owned enterprises so they can foster a correct operational concept and style, conscientiously safeguard the interests of consumers, and become managers with a sense of morality and ideals and observe the law and discipline. 26. Individual industrial and commercial households and privately owned enterprises should strictly abide by and enforce state laws, statutes, and policy regulations; and engage in lawful operations and civilized service. Manufacturing and marketing of fake and shoddy goods, fraudulent transactions, speculation and monopoly, and other lawbreaking activities that undermine the lawful rights and interests of consumers shall be dealt with resolutely. 27. Those who print, broadcast, sell, or engage in the rental of reactionary and pornographic books, magazines, pictures, and audio-visual products shall, in accordance with the relevant state laws and regulations, be given a fine depending on the degree of seriousness and have unlawful income confiscated; and those who violate the criminal law shall be affixed with criminal responsibilities according to the law. 28. The Regional Administration for Industry and Commerce is authorized to interprete these regulations. 29. These regulations enter into force upon promulgation. Previous regulations that contravene these regulations shall be rescinded and replaced with these regulations.
