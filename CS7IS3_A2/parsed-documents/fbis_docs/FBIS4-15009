The conversation touched on the consolidation of democratic forces, the threat of fascism, and the task of improving the legislative base for the continuation of reforms. The writer Alla Gerber, who took part in the meeting, shared her impressions of the exchange of opinions, in an interview with ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI's correspondent. She said that the Russian president gives the impression of being a perfectly healthy and calm person who responds sensitively to his interlocutor and knows how to listen and to hear. "Boris Nikolayevich came out against the creation of any kind of presidential party," Alla Gerber stressed, "but promised to support the democrats and the party of which `Russia's Choice' is the initiator...." In the opinion of the writer and deputy, in the regions there is great interest in Gaydar's emerging party, but people have certain misgivings about victorious communists being in power. Developing the topic under discussion, the "Russia's Choice" representatives advised Boris Yeltsin to address the Russians more often, to participate in democratic actions more actively, and to define more clearly and precisely both his own positions and those of his entourage. "The unclear, unspecific nature of certain pronouncements and actions by the presidential team is confusing people's perception of Boris Yeltsin's intentions and his allies," Alla Gerber said. The problem of legal backup for further Russian reforms was touched on. The cornerstone of this, in the general opinion, should be the urgent adoption of laws on joint-stock companies, securities, and stock exchanges. It goes without saying that the "Russia's Choice" delegation proposed tougher legal norms regarding the kindling of interethnic hostility and fascist propaganda. The delegation called on the president to take the threat of fascism in Russia seriously and to act openly and resolutely in this regard. Boris Yeltsin expressed approval for the "Russia's Choice" initiative on holding parliamentary hearings in the near future on the danger of fascism in Russia. It was the mutual opinion that the discussion took place in a calm and constructive atmosphere and demonstrated yet again that one old friend is better than two new ones. The president promised the legislators that he would hold similar meetings with deputies from the other parliamentary factions in the State Duma. Whether the meeting will be the starting gun for a new rallying of democrats, time will tell. But one thing is clear today: Rumors that Boris Yeltsin has lost the political initiative were patently exaggerated. And suggestions that he intends to run in the next presidential elections once again as leader of all democrats are apparently not without foundation.
