The Government's follow-up to the Rio Earth Summit, an environmental action plan for the next 20 years, runs to four documents -- nearly 600 pages, announced by nine ministers in the surroundings of Inigo Jones's Banqueting House in Whitehall. The most controversial chapter of Britain's Sustainable Development Strategy, on transport, says that ``costs of travel, particularly costs of road travel, may well have to rise to reflect environmental costs and to affect levels of future demand for transport.'' Mr. Major, launching the strategy, said: ``Sometimes quite painful political action may be necessary to meet environmental objectives.'' He admitted he ``did not expect to see people dancing in the street'' at the thought of road pricing. He said that Britain's imposition of VAT on heating and lighting, higher fuel prices and commitment to road pricing had already gone further than most other countries, but denied these would impose an intolerable burden on the economy. An expansion of nuclear power might be necessary to meet future environmental commitments, he hinted. Alongside the overall environmental strategy, Mr. Major introduced the following documents: -- The UK Climate Change Programme -- sets out in detail how Britain intends to meet its commitments to freeze carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000. The document shows for the first time that Britain will achieve a reduction in all gases that cause global warming -- including methane and CFCs -- of five percent. It commits Britain to setting targets after 2000 but not what they will be. -- The Biodiversity Action Plan -- sets out 59 specific commitments to protecting wildlife and local distinctiveness. -- The Forestry Action Plan -- shows how Britain will increase forest cover. Mr. Major announced a new panel of five ``wise men'' who will advise him and monitor progress on ``green issues,'' chaired by Sir Crispin Tickell, warden of Green College, Oxford, an unofficial adviser at Downing Street. The others are Lord Alexander of Weedon, chairman of National Westminster Bank, Lord Selborne, chairman of the Government's statutory conservation watchdog, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Sir John Houghton, chairman of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, and Dr. Anne Mclaren, vice-president of the Royal Society. Mr. Gummer, Environment Secretary, announced that the Government would be setting up a Round Table on Sustainable Development which would bring together industry, local authorities and environmentalists to discuss environmental policies. The Government also intended to stimulate a new ``citizen's environmental initiative'' in consultation with local authorities, churches and community groups. Mr. Major's initiative received a chorus of criticism from Opposition MPs and environmental groups. Mr. Chris Smith, Labour spokesman for environmental protection, said the four reports contained ``no vision and few firm commitments to action.'' The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Simon Hughes said the key Strategy document was ``full of `coulds,' `ifs' and `maybes' when what the country needs is `whys,'`whats' and `whens.''' The Green Party complained the Government ``lacked the courage of its convictions'' and the World Wide Fund for Nature described the announcement as ``a lost opportunity.'' -- An entire protected meadow famous for butterflies will be destroyed as part of a project by British Coal to extract three million tons of coal from an open-cast site. West Glamorgan county council yesterday approved an application to develop open-cast mining on 800 acres of hillside above Glynneath, West Glamorgan, over nine years which will create about 140 jobs.
