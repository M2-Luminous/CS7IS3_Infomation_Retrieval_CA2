FBIS4-29620 "dreas118_m_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 18 Jun 1994 Thailand Meeting Held To Discuss US Forum Agenda Meeting Held To Discuss US Forum Agenda BK1906072694 Bangkok THE NATION in English 18 Jun 94 pp B1, B2 BK1906072694 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [By Chirawat Na Thalang and Chiwamon Kanoksin] [Text] A group of Thai businessmen will fly to the United States in the middle of next month to talk with their American counterparts on the setting up of the U.S.-Thai Business Council, which is being established to allow businessmen from the two countries to exchange views on how to promote future cooperation. In preparation for the upcoming meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Amnuai Wirawan yesterday called a meeting with local businessmen, including Dr Olan Chaiprawat president of Siam Commerciai Bank, and Chatri Sophonphanit, executive chairman of Bangkok Bank Ltd, at Government House to discuss the agenda which the Thai delegation should raise at the upcoming meeting with the Americans. The U.S.-Thai Business Council was initiated at a meeting between President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Chuan Likphai late last year, ahead of the Seattle Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. The two leaders agreed that Thailand and the United States should have a forum to provide a discussion table for businessmen from the two countries to exchange views on how to promote bilateral activities. So far, the bilateral talks between Thailand and the United States have been dominated by the issue of conflicts such as intellectual property protection and human rights, instead of how to seriously promote activities in business and trade. An official from the U.S. Embassy said that the discussions will cover areas of interest to both sides. The agenda might include the outcome of the recently agreed Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks. He did not rule out the possibility that they might discuss how to liberalize trade in services. The council would consist of high-level economic officials and representatives of the private sector. After the meeting, Amnuai told the press that Bangkok and Washington have agreed to upgrade the existing Thai-U.S. Leadership Council to become the planned U.S.-Thai Business Council by promoting the participation of both private and public sectors. M.R. Kasemsamoson Kasemsri, former permanent secretary to the Foreign Ministry and Thai chairman of the U.S. Thai Leadership Council, also proposed that the planned joint council should function under the supervision of the governments of the two sides, with about 30-50 business representatives. The council should be convened once a year and the chairmanship will be rotated. Moreover, the council should get active participation by the Board of Trade, Thai Bankers' Association and the Federation of Thai Industries. Yesterday's meeting also assigned a committee, comprising M.R. Kasemsamoson from the state sector, and two representatives from the private sector to draft the agenda for next month's discussion, according to Chatri Sophonphanit. Chatri added that the Thai delegation might have an opportunity to meet with U.S. Vice President Al Gore, but he declined to say who will represent the Thai delegation. Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchapak was scheduled to go to the United States this month, but the schedule was postponed.
