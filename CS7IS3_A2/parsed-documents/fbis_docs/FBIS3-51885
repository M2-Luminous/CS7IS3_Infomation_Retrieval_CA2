Velasquez to representatives of the Chambers of Deputies and Senate following the announcement of the start of a new period of Venezuelan National Congress regular sessions at the Sol del Peru Room of the Miraflores Presidential Palace in Caracas -- live] [Text] Mr. Senate President and President of the National Congress; Mr. President of the Chamber of Deputies and Vice President of the National Congress; Dr. Felipe Montilla, president of the Senate Commission; Messrs. Senators; Dr. Pedro Tabata Guzman, president of the Chamber of Deputies Commission; Messrs. Deputies; Messrs. Ministers: I would be lying if I denied the deep emotion I felt when listening to this morning's television debate. I saw in the debate that a new chapter in Venezuelan democracy was opening. All this time I have focused my efforts on fulfilling my duty to democracy, Venezuela, and the National Congress, which has given me enormous responsibility. With his usual extraordinary voice, Dr. Felipe Montilla reminded me of the origin of that mandate and described the historic national climate of those hours. When I was sworn in I told my fellow members of parliament -- where I have spent most of my life as a politician during this democratic stage -- that a political storm had led me here and that at any moment the crisis could oust me, but my personal and political ethics would not be discredited. I wanted to fulfill the mandate and I wanted to avoid an interruption in the country's democracy, a process to which the country was committed. I was sure that more important than the painful conflict that brought us together was the Venezuelan willingness to live in freedom. I was also sure of the powers of the democratic process of perfection and correction. A dictatorship would have been unable to face the crises that the Venezuelan democratic system faced throughout 1992-93. It was a series of political, military, and social factors and it was within a climate of exacerbation, and for many, a climate of defeat and disorientation. However, above that atmosphere stood Venezuelan society's resolve, which had been tested during that process and is open to the admission of new political and social forces which are gradually appearing in an increasingly developing Venezuela. Contrary to other Latin American countries, where traditional parties have attempted to close ranks and exclude the new forces emerging from development itself from political debate and democratic and legal participation, Venezuelan democracy has opened up this participation, allowing new challenges for the country to be stated from their platforms. In a process currently criticized by many as frustrating, this democracy has accomplished that which certain people were determined to achieve since 1936. From exile, the founding leaders of the democratic process pointed out the need to have a school in each village, a high school in each town, and a university in every state capital, so that through learning we could change the traditional education system and, therefore, change the system whereby the country was ruled by a very small group. Democracy has allowed this magnificent opening whereby each region designates its governor and every community its mayor. Democracy has gradually led to the growing participation of civilian society. There have been mistakes, failings, corruption and influence peddling, but complaints, lawsuits and democratic society's watchfulness have corrected those defects and created a critical awareness among Venezuelans in response to those negative attitudes. This had to be protected; the democratic process could not be interrupted because to do so would hinder Venezuelan society's end-of-century plans. If my administration was hesitant and weak, it is because democracy is hesitant and weak. It is hesitant because to make a decision it must consult with all of the sectors; it is weak because it must accept [the will of those sectors], but its weakness is ironclad; it does not break. Only authoritarian regimes can boast a strength that translates into arbitrariness and the will of one person against the community. When I see the accusations that have been leveled against Congress and against political activity in Venezuela, perhaps because I am a researcher of history and have participated in lengthy episodes, I can only look back at the political activity of this century to see how the political strength of congress, the political parties, the news media, and the opposition have gradually undermined the bad habits, cunning, and hindrances that blocked the development of Venezuelan society for almost two centuries. This is a society on the move because it has the watchfulness of democracy through the parliament, through the constant denunciations and complaints by the media. It is preferable to have exaggerations than silence. Venezuelan democracy is the fruit of a painful experience because what was attained in the end was what successive generations since the 19th century and until the sixties of this century wanted to have, to live with liberty and dignity. Messrs. Senators and Deputies, you will start legislative sessions at a very difficult time in national life, because the threats facing the country are not traditional conspiracies or attempts to frustrate the process but problems such as the country's fiscal situation. To fulfill the mandate of the Congress of the Special Powers Law, I, together with the Council of Minister and with the attendance of the most renown lawyers of the country, assumed the responsibility of promulgating the laws that the Congress pointed out to me, including tax laws, because it is necessary to say that in light of the demands of development, social demands, the state's commitments, the income from petroleum today is not capable, as it was in the recent past, of fulfilling those demands. Those demands are now on the government's table. Tax collection is necessary. It will not be done through the taxes we promulgated with the Special Powers Law but, as one of the new parliament's immediate tasks, it must undertake a study of the fiscal paths that would allow the state to immediately tend to the problems, its own administrative problems as well as the social problems that have been pointed out; the problems related to the salaries and the cost of living. On the other hand, it is indispensable -- I confirmed this need in its real dimensions -- to deal with the social problem, the poverty problem, because there can be no perfect political democracy if the wood worm of social disaster, which is created by poverty, is at the base of that democracy. As far as I am concerned, this has been an extraordinary watch tower, an observatory, as well as an information bureau. This is the case because just as I was able to establish a dialogue here with the political parties, I have also been able to meet with the economic sectors, other sectors of the population and other social sectors that allowed me to have a good idea of the Venezuelan social crisis. The best way to reaffirm democracy, ensure that it can extend to the next century and ensure sustained growth is by finding solutions to the fiscal, social, and poverty problems in Venezuela. I truthfully say.... [pauses] I am aware that it is inappropriate to use certain words especially during addresses such as this one, but I am going to do it anyway because I am addressing persons who were my parliamentary companions for so many years. I want to say that I am ending my term quite content. I am content because I have been able to witness the arrival here at the Sol del Peru Room, of those legitimate representatives of the new political and national country that you represent. This means that Venezuelan democracy has been able to pass through a dark tunnel which opened the way to all sorts of sneak attacks, and every dishonest conduct imaginable aimed at preventing the country from progressing. Your presence here on this 23 January 1994 is evidence of democracy's strength. Your presence here and the incorporation of the new political organizations, the presence of new parliamentarians and the parliamentary youths, is the best evidence of a new year. Venezuela's destiny is in your hands because, as has already been said by the presidents of the great commissions, we have arrived at a moment of understanding. I was telling the president-elect that when he is preparing to announce his programs, he should first ensure a national agreement. It is indispensable that we reach a national agreement in Venezuela. Problems are so serious and there is so little time, that truce and understanding are indispensable. It is not a matter of distributing public posts, ministries or embassies. That makes no sense whatsoever. I am referring to an agreement about the country's fundamental problems, the solution of which can wait no longer. The voice of every sector must be heard. As legitimate representatives of the country's regions and opinions, the national agreement must find in each of you its champions and guarantors. In concluding this address, I would like to deeply thank Senator Montilla for his generous words and offer that I will be able to return as always, as if it were my home. Thank you. Good evening.
