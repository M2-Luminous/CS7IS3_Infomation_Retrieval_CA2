It included carnival, and although the government worked every carnival day, more than half of the country was absent from normal work during carnival. As we mark our first month, I feel obliged to report to the country the main aspects of the tasks we must carry out and the measures we have adopted to face the situation. I will not tire my compatriots -- the inhabitants of Venezuela -- by listing all the bad things we have encountered. I can only say that the situation was worse than we had imagined. The country must realize that there have been many difficulties but it must also be aware that from the very beginning we assumed the firm determination of taking on these responsibilities. Bringing order at home is a priority that is very difficult to achieve when the home involved is large and complex and when it is in disarray, as is currently the case in Venezuela. We are making great efforts to bring order at home. In all sectors of public administration we have even had to resort to partial restrictions of economic guarantees. The way this measure was welcomed shows that the country understands the situation we are facing. This measure was issued urgently to stop confusion about the value-added tax, VAT; to stop applying the VAT at the consumer level until we established new taxes as part of a fairer fiscal reform that will place the heaviest burden of public expenses on segments of the population that are better suited to endure them. I wish to reaffirm that the suspension of such guarantees did not seek to establish foreign exchange controls or decree a maxi-devaluation or any other similar measures that I categorically rejected during my inauguration as president of the Republic. I wish to add that the powers that the Executive Branch assumed after having restricted economic guarantees will be exercised with moderation and responsibly only when they are strictly necessary to seek economic stability, which is an important goal that we must pursue. Upon my reaching the government, the most urgent problem we found was the fiscal deficit. Perhaps it is not the most important one. The country has many more serious problems, but this is indeed the most urgent. It calls for immediate actions [obligaciones de immediatismo] that somewhat make us lose our perspectives of primary medium- and long-term goals. It is essential that we deal with the fiscal deficit not only to allow the state to continue to operate and exist, but also to tackle the disease of inflation, which is a major disease that is undermining all social segments, especially the poorest. This situation could worsen if there is no solution to the fiscal deficit problem. We started by cutting spending. It is so difficult to deal with a budget of 1.4 trillion bolivares and find out that many expenses are fixed, that they cannot be changed -- for example, our foreign debt commitments. Other expenses cannot be cut due to humanitarian, social, or justice reasons. That is the case of salaries because real salaries actually decrease, and in general, they prove to be insufficient for most public sector servants. There are other expenditures that create social conditions.... [pauses] making reductions almost impossible to face. And then there are other expenditures in public sector entities that are not under the control of the Executive Branch. At any rate, the effort made this week has for the time being entailed a reduction of 105.858 billion bolivares that in some way contributes to lowering the deficit and, most of all, provides a big example, because we are beginning by cutting the presidency's spending to be able to have -- as we do -- the moral authority to ask all sectors and all who receive benefits from the Treasury to make their share of sacrifice. If all of us are not ready to do what is indispensable, the situation would be irreparable. As for fiscal revenue, we now have the problem of collection. We have evidence that most taxes levied in Venezuela based on current laws are not collected for reasons of incompetence, corruption, or technical deficiencies, and many other kinds of deficiencies regarding the tax collection system. That is why we ordered the creation of an autonomous service for managing and controlling taxes, as it exists in other countries that have had the same experience and that provided us with instructions and indications that have served us in good stead in facing this issue. We firmly hope we will be able to increase revenues substantially and this will be a major step toward lowering the fiscal deficit. However, we also have to increase revenues, mostly because we are determined -- and we have proved it and are reaffirming it -- to eliminate the VAT at the retail level, as it is a very heavy burden and a source of corruption that according to some could become similar to the experience with Recadi [Differential Exchange System]. We are, therefore, going to replace this tax with fairer taxes that fall on those who can pay. The tax on luxury items, for example, starts at 10 percent, we add another 10 percent, and another 10 percent later, based on the nature of the luxury items that are purchased and that do not correspond to the country's difficult situation. This is a tax on wholesales, and it is selective. It serves to place the State's need to obtain revenues to meet its needs on fairer grounds. The amendment on the income tax, which will go up to 34 percent, and which is an effort we are requiring -- and is required in other countries because developed countries have a very high income tax. [sentence as heard] We are going to do away with the excuse that tax payers often had to say: I do not pay taxes because they are stolen. We now have the guarantee that the tax money will not be stolen but will be administered with utmost seriousness because the struggle against corruption is a fundamental objective of this government. We are not going to yield or fail in any way. For that reason, the taxes that are collected will be taxes for public spending and the service of the community. The tax on banking debits, which will be a necessity this year because the income tax will not be collected this year but the next, is a temporary tax until 31 December 1994, as has happened in other countries of the world. The finance minister will submit this bill to the Chamber of Deputies, which he has asked to receive him next week to submit the carefully drafted bills. With regard to these bills, we hope the representatives of the blocs that comprise the Legislative Branch will be receptive to them as most of them have pledged to be. This fiscal deficit problem, however, got more complicated with the Banco Latino disaster, which represents the tailspin of the moral crisis Venezuela has experienced in moral, economic, and every other respect. The Banco Latino case is very serious and the large number of Venezuelans and foreigners victimized by that institution's incorrect and criminal operations is really amazing and a source of deep pain. The government has not been indifferent to this at all. From the very beginning, it has adopted every possible measure and procedure. We even asked the Senate to ratify, in keeping with the new Banking Law, the appointment of the new bank superintendent and the new Deposit Guarantee Fund, Fogade, president and we are confidently awaiting their ratification. We appointed an Intervention Board, which all parties involved in this problem have welcomed with great respect and enthusiasm, I would say. I learned that the Intervention Board has already made preliminary studies, and therefore, it is ready to start revitalizing Banco Latino in approximately 30 days, when it will be fully operational. We chose to revitalize it rather than liquidate it because, based on precedents in Venezuela and elsewhere, liquidation is completely negative. Therefore, this is a clear path to ensuring that those who have interests, deposits, and their livelihoods in Banco Latino will find a way to transform their rights [derechos] into stock or assets [pertenencias] in an establishment that will be revitalized and reconfigured, and well-managed. The pressure needed to get debtors to pay up is already being applied. By the way, there must be a collaboration by all the branches in public power, which we have had. Congress is issuing an emergency law and the executive branch has voiced its views, some of which have been accepted. We hope this step, taken by Congress, will be fully satisfactory. At any rate, we are willing to do whatever is necessary to ensure that it will be truly efficient. The Judicial Branch has also played a role. We are waiting for the official who knows about the Banco Latino case and who, according to the bill, would be the only person to intervene in this matter -- we have many good references of her -- to announce her decisions. The government will not point out the culprits, however, the culprits that the Judicial Branch designate, will be punished. We will place all the state's power at the service of justice to ensure, if warranted, the establishment of penal punishments and civilian punishments determined by the tribunals, as well as precautionary measures that are indispensable to recovering, as soon as possible, the money lost in the Banco Latino cataclysm. We are, therefore, perfectly willing to offer our decided support, without any distinctions, to provisions issued by the Judicial Branch on this matter. I must say that the Central Bank of Venezuela has helped us face the crisis. It has helped by doing perhaps a little more than what is normally expected from this institution. I think, I am convinced that the country, all interested parties, the depositors, checking account holders, and those who had trust funds and interests at Banco Latino can rest assured we are doing everything we can to overcome this terrible situation in the most satisfactory manner possible. Of course, the Banco Latino cataclysm, as I called it, has influenced the financial system in general. The concern of the government and all public sector organizations has been to prevent similar situations from occurring at other banks to which we gave, are giving, want to give, and will give all the necessary protection to prevent the disaster that a financial system catastrophe would entail for the country. Fortunately, Venezuelans have been very prudent, and amid the uneasiness, anguish, and desperation that many feel, the actions taken have built trust and created hope in the institutions and systems that make up the Venezuelan economy. This is all part of the economic policy. A medium- and long-term economic policy has already started to materialize in the tax reforms and, as we had said, its main concern will be centered on the people and the struggle against poverty. Although we have been unable to implement measures to produce effective results immediately, the fact that we suspended a tax that was going to have direct negative effects on the grass-roots sectors and that we have presented Congress with a proposal for a tax system -- the weight of which falls on the privileged sectors -- clearly shows the path we aim to take. Our concern is, of course, to fight the scourge of inflation and, to this end, our efforts to remedy the fiscal deficit are fundamental. To the extent possible, we do not want to reduce social expenses. The subsidies that are currently being paid will be maintained; the government's main obligations in the struggle against poverty will not only be maintained but we will attempt to increase them. We will implement a persistent policy to support grass-roots neighborhoods so that they can have running water, housing, and necessary comforts of a modern life. Of course, it is an ambitious, extensive program which will have to start at the beginning but, I am sure, it will be received with faith, confidence, and satisfaction by the Venezuelan grass-roots sectors. This economic policy becomes a commitment of solidarity. We cannot carry it out if we do not obtain a fundamental agreement among all the sectors. We have begun talks with businessmen, farmers, small and medium-size industrial producers, and workers to try to achieve a number of aspirations that have to be obtained through consensus. The development minister has announced the negotiation he carried out with commercial sectors to avoid the unrestrained hikes of prices, which are already pretty high. We have, however, had to decree a special measure, postponing price control with regard to medicine, which is one of the most delicate, serious, and acute aspects of the current situation. Thus, we are optimistic in the sense that the country's receptivity encourages us to believe that there is confidence in the future. We still have to go through a very difficult stage. Currently, we cannot increase investments as we would like to. We plan to encourage private investment by offering stability and by effectively controlling inflation, which is one of the most significant obstacles any investor can encounter. In light of this, we are motivated by a commitment of togetherness which fills us with faith and confidence. We have encountered numerous problems and I would briefly like to state that with respect to the military officers indicted as a result of the events that took place on 4 February and 27 November 1992, these individuals have received the treatment that was announced from the beginning. The disposition to dismiss the charges against all of them is still in effect. Now, I would like to clearly state that I believe that those officers who adopted an unquestionably political position and are members of political groups should decide not to rejoin the Armed Forces. The Constitution says that the Armed Forces are apolitical as well as nondeliberating entities and I am willing to respect and ensure this principle. As commander in chief of the Armed Forces, I would not commit the blunder of authorizing a political group that is organized and active in the political arena to enter into the Armed Forces. Instead, I open the way for it to participate in civilian life and exercise all the rights that the rest of the citizens have. I think the most honorable thing for an officer who is passing from military to civilian life would be to do so at his own request. I have not wanted to resort to other mechanisms that would not provide them with an honorable discharge as they have the right to demand and as befits them because of their own conscience, rank, and military situation. Therefore, I am willing to continue granting stays of proceedings. Some, perhaps many officers may be able to return to service because their particular case perfectly well authorizes them to do so. But I really ask those who are involved in political activity, and who are not hiding this but are publicly showing this, to admit that the most honorable and advisable thing for them and for everyone would be to have them request, by their own decision, their return to civilian life. To conclude, I want to state that the decentralization process that began in the last few years will be continued by my administration, but it will be decentralization not disintegration. The national government is willing to maintain the best relations with the state governors and municipal mayors, but it is also ready to exercise and maintain the prerogatives that the Constitution gives it. Those prerogatives are in no way for the benefit of the national government but for the fulfillment of the serious responsibility it has to the country. I tell my fellow countrymen that I reiterate my faith in my country, that I reiterate my faith in my people, that I reiterate my confidence in them, and that I am always ready to clearly and frankly tell them the truth. We are not going to conceal anything. We are going to listen to all complaints. We have begun a process of dialogue. I received and spoke with the Banco Latino demonstrators who came to the doors of Miraflores. I have begun a dialogue with the university rectors to bring about a solution of the pending problems. We have begun a dialogue with the political parties represented in Congress and I also hope it will be productive. This dialogue shows a willingness to achieve what I mentioned earlier: the commitment to solidarity. The problem belongs to everyone. Everyone has an obligation. We all have to make an effort. We all have to make a sacrifice and I am sure we are going to do so and we can all, in solidarity, give a good account to the Venezuelan people. Good evening.
