The session was attended by managers of departments and organizations, the Crimean Council of Ministers, oblast administrations, and the Kiev and Sevastopol city administrations. Participants in the session discussed the observance of border and customs regulations, and the implementation of presidential and governmental decrees concerning these issues. A resolution was adopted outlining ways to resolve current problems. The session also approved the employment program for 1994. The aim of the program is to implement concrete measures granting productive employment and efficient social care for those categories of citizens unable to compete as equals on the job market. A concept for forming special free economic zones was approved in general. The concept will provide a methodological basis for adopting resolutions and drafting necessary documents stipulating concrete free economic zones. Participants discussed a draft national program for eliminating the aftermath of the Chernobyl accident and providing social care for citizens in 1994-1995, as well as up to the year 2000. The document was forwarded on for completion. The government approved and decided to submit for ratification a draft presidential decree on forming a single system of privatization organs in Ukraine. The participants considered the issue of adopting a new payment system for municipal services and rent, as well as special purpose compensation for certain strata of society. Propositions suggested by the State Committee for Housing and Municipal Services stipulate that the share of people's payments toward the general cost of municipal services will gradually be increased by reducing subsidies for municipal enterprises.
