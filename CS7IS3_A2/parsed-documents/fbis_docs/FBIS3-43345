Mr Kriel said in a statement there had been a "major breakthrough" in the police investigation and the matter should now be taken up by the Transitional Executive Council (TEC) "as a matter of urgency". "Investigations have established a direct link between the perpertrators of the Heidelberg tavern atrocity and the territory of the Transkei. Furthermore, these investigations have also established that the Heidelberg tavern and other attacks could indeed have been planned and executed from the Transkei," Mr Kriel said. The minister said ballistic tests had confirnmed that the weapons used in the Heidelberg attack and the weapons used in the St James Church massacre were identical. Gunmen burst into the tavern last Thursday night, killing three women and a man. In the St James Church attack early last year, armed attackers killed 12 people, including several Russian sailors. Transkei military ruler Maj-Gen Bantu Holomisa has said he is prepared to hand over suspected attackers if the South African authorities can identify them. Mr Kriel said on Wednesday: "Investigations have reached the stage where a joint investigation between the South African Police [SAP] and Transkei Police be considered a top priority. This would include the formation of a joint SAP/Transkei Police investigation team as rapidly as possible and the SA Police is ready to implement this." South Africa last year sent soldiers into Transkei to pursue suspects in several attacks in South Africa. The soldiers attacked a home of a Pan-Africanist Congress member, killing four youths. The incident sparked a political and diplomatic row in which South Africa's ambassador to the homeland was expelled. In his statement on Wednesday, Mr Kriel said: "Intensive investigations have resulted in a major breakthrough by the SA Police which now makes it essential that this matter be taken up as a matter of urgency by the Transitional Executive Council. It is a matter of extreme urgency that the TEC...Give advice on how to deal with the problem of dealing with suspects who take refuge in independent states. Speedy action is vital if the perpertrators are to be brought to justice without delay. It would be obstructive for the Transkei to insist on adhering strictly to a rigid and formal process of extradition in these areas."
