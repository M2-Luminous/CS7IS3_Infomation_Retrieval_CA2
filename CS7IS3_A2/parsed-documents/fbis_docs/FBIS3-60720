Igor Dirkatck, an influential member of the Parliamentary Defence Committee, told AFP that Ukraine ``must seek to obtain the codes enabling it to control the nuclear missiles stationed on its territory to meet the threat to its security represented by Zhirinovskiy.'' ``Zhirinovskiy and the Communist Party want to restore the Soviet empire and bring Russia back to its pre-1917 frontiers,'' he charged. Ukraine possesses 130 strategic SS-19 multiple-warhead missiles, mostly obsolete according to experts, along with 46 modern SS-24 missiles. Though declaring its long-term intention to become a non-nuclear state, ratifying the START-I treaty on nuclear disarmament signed in July 1991 by the United States and the Soviet Union, it has so far refused to give up the SS-24s. Ukrainian leaders have said previously that they could obtain the nuclear codes ``but had no wish to.'' [passage omitted] Earlier, parliamentary foreign affairs spokesman Dmitri Pavlichko said that Sunday's vote showed Russia was ``far from being a democracy'' and that Ukraine was right in hesitating to give up its nuclear arsenal. ``I hope that after these elections the (international) community will better understand Ukraine's positions with regard to disarmanent.'' The Russians have ``shown their irresponsibility,'' he commented. And Ukrainian Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said he was concerned over the vote by sailors of the Black Sea fleet who voted 19 percent in favour of Zhirinovskiy's party compared with 11.5 percent for Russia's Choice, the party headed by Deputy Prime Minister Yegor Gaydar and which strongly backs President Boris Yeltsin and his reform program. ``That must push us on to resolving the question of sharing out this fleet between Ukraine and Russia,'' he said. ``The forces who voted for Zhirinovskiy are on our territory.''
