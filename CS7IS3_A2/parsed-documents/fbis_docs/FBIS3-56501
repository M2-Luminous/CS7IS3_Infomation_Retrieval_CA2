The Union in Support of the Republic of the Crimea [Soyuz za Pidtrymku Respubliky Krym], the Communist Party of the Crimea, the Republican Party of the Crimea, and the People's Party of the Crimea [Narodna Partiya Krymu] are part of it. The initiators of setting up the bloc have stated that it is not ruled out that other parties and organizations of the republic will join it too. Yuriy Komov [name as received], a member of the political council of the Union in Support of the Republic of the Crimea and people's deputy of the Crimea, has stated that the association's main task is to act as a united front against the current "party of power" in the Crimea and Mykola Bahrov, its leader. "We are not rejecting Bahrov as a person," Yuriy Komov emphasized, "but the policy that he is conducting on the principle `divide and rule' -- a policy of advancing on people's backs." In their speeches the leaders of parties accused the speaker of betraying the interests of the (Communist) party and of plagiarism ("he has collected in his program the cream of the election programs of his rivals"); the opinion was expressed that Mykola Bahrov bears personal responsibility for the poverty-stricken economic state of the Crimea. Fedir Volchan [name as received], a member of the republican committee of the People's Party of the Crimea, noted that the bloc that has been set up is not a provisional attempt, but an attempt calculated for the future to shape relations between the parties of the Crimea after the elections. In his opinion, the actions of the government and the Central Electoral Commission, which has become Bahrov's "doormat" during preparations for elections of the president of the Crimea, indicate their readiness to agree to falsifying the voting results.
