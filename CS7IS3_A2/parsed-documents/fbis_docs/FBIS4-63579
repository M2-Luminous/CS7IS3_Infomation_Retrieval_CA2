Both in the past, in the years of military confrontation between East and West, and now, when Europe and the world are in a strategically uncertain situation, these organs' decisions have had an enormous influence on the level of security on the continent. It is hard to recall a representative of a nonmember country ever taking part in these sessions. This time, NATO ministers will be addressed by their Russian colleague Pavel Grachev. According to an opinion voiced during a special briefing at the U.S. Defense Department, the Russian Federation defense minister's speech is of enormous interest to NATO ministers. And that interest is pragmatic rather than idle. NATO believes that a clearer understanding of Russia's military-political goals and priorities will make it possible to overcome a not very pleasant state of uncertainty. This uncertainty has arisen because all of a sudden Moscow sharply put the brakes on its accession to NATO's "Partnership for Peace" program. And it provided an excuse for people to talk about a kind of Russian haughtiness toward those states which had already joined the program. Yet somehow what is being lost sight of is the fact that the "Partnership" program itself is only just being set up. The idea of a "partnership" open to all was a compromise in a difficult situation for NATO. When, on the one hand, a number of East European states stated their willingness to immediately join NATO on the pretext of the "threat from the East." And, on the other, Moscow resolutely opposed this prospect, rightly seeing it as a selfish attempt to revive military confrontation in Europe. The idea was then transformed into a collection of the most general principles. Essentially "Partnership for Peace" is now just a way to ease the European states' mutual fears until such time as it is possible to elaborate an integrated and universally acceptable approach to safeguarding security on the European Continent. And this search does not end with the "Partnership" program. We need only mention the French plan for stability in Europe, and the proposal from the FRG and the Netherlands to strengthen the CSCE's peacekeeping role. Finally, we cannot fail to recall the Russian idea of galvanizing the North Atlantic Cooperation Council as the core of a future security structure. But, in parallel with this quest, there has been in recent months a rush by some 20 East European countries and former Soviet republics to join the "Partnership." And their joining looks like more of a symbolic act. Russia has already recovered from its desire to collect the mere symbols of unity with the West. It now wants serious work in the sphere of strengthening pan-European stability. That is why the Russian Federation defense minister insists that setting out the provisions of the Russian military doctrine is of even greater importance than presenting to NATO the parameters and directions devised in Moscow for political and military cooperation with this organization. After all, in this context these parameters will no longer look like claims for a special status of relationship with NATO. This status should simply correspond in the most natural way to the status of a nuclear power responsible for the verification and nonproliferation regimes, and to Russia's approaches toward safeguarding its own and the world's security. It seems as though NATO has not yet reached a general decision about just how to deal with the Russian approach. It is constantly reiterating that partnership, as U.S. Ambassador to Russia Pickering aptly put it, is a kind of "smorgasbord" open to everyone. Everyone can take the dish they want. In other words, each state determines the parameters of cooperation itself. But, after all, somebody has to act as the cook, supplying certain dishes and monitoring their quality.... A Pentagon spokesmen stated that Russia's special role could be marked by a special statement or declaration. The FRG defense minister considers it realistic for Russia to take part in the NATO Council decisionmaking process, primarily when it is a question of pan-European security and global strategic issues. At the same time, NATO is insisting that Russia should not have the right of veto or any other additional privileges. But the main privilege on which Moscow is insisting is a partnership with NATO for the sake of peace, not just for the sake of partnership.
