He said that the United States is not worthy of playing any humanitarian role. At a ceremony held by Hizballah in al-Ghubayrah in Beirut, he said that the United States shows concern only about the seven Israeli soldiers, but Shaykh 'Abd-al-Karim 'Ubayd, hundreds of Lebanese detainees kidnapped from their homes in organized terrorist operations, and thousands of Palestinians detained in jails in occupied Palestine do not move the feelings of the United States or Christopher.
