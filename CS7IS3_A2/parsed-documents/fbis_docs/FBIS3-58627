The Free Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] no longer appreciates you as a guest speaker. Do you now want to gain a foothold in Germany with the help of your friend Manfred Brunner? [Haider] I was never popular as a guest speaker with the FDP. I am still popular with the grass roots. I will also participate in some events in the foreseeable future, in order to signal that the FDP leadership is ill advised and there is apparently no consensus with its grass roots. [FOCUS] Do you believe Mr. Brunner's movement will be able to create such grass roots? [Haider] First of all, it is important that his party exists. I also believe his chances in the European elections are not bad. And if it is desired, I will be absolutely prepared to support him. [FOCUS] In what form? [Haider] I do not yet have a clear idea. It will also depend on what he is really going to make of his group. It probably has to be seriously discussed to what extent his "citizens" movement is a party that can be regarded as a possible sister party. Of course, we do not have the intention -- as the FPOe or with Brunner's party -- to establish branches throughout Europe. It is my wish that Manfred Brunner will establish something like an independent Freedom Party of Germany. There is a voters' potential of at least 15 percent. In my opinion, Germany needs a liberal power, something like the FPOe in Austria. After all, the FDP has become a leftist party. And the Republikaner do not offer anything either. It is simply not enough to take the problem of "foreigners" and to say: "This is our issue." [FOCUS] But you also have a preference for harping on it. [Haider] Foreigners were the main issue in our petition for a referendum in 1993.... [FOCUS] ....which did not meet with sufficient agreement. [Haider] At any rate, it was one of the most successful petitions for a referendum in the Austrian Second Republic. And now the main issue is the reform of the state as whole, by which the political system is to be overcome. [FOCUS] It is also one reason you are regarded as an extreme-right politician. How do you deal with this reproach? [Haider] With my party, I am simply a special Austrian model. I protest against being compared with anyone. At any rate, we, the FPOe as a whole, are a compromise between a liberal and a national position. [FOCUS] You want to establish a Third Republic in Austria. How do you envisage it? [Haider] We need a new constitution, from which the systems of chambers and associations as a pillar of the constitution disappear.... [FOCUS] ....and with what do you want to replace it? [Haider] The citizen. [FOCUS] This is too vague for us. Who is "the citizen?" [Haider] Our political system in Austria does not know the citizen at all. We have a state of chambers, associations, and parties, and the citizen is, so to speak, the raw material that is supplied for the functioning of these chambers and associations. This involves a considerable loss of freedom. That is why we have the barbarism of the ideological terror of party politics and a mediatized freedom of the citizens. For example, these are two elements that are no longer supposed to exist in a Third Republic. [FOCUS] Nevertheless, you are encouraging the following suspicion: "It is true that Haider is now saying that the citizen's will is decisive -- but what if he is in power?" Can you dispel the misgivings that your Third Republic will not be a parliamentary democracy? [Haider] This argumentation is inappropriate. You invalidate the rules between government and opposition if you simply impute to the opposition the statement that "in reality you want something completely different!" It speaks in my favor that as governor of a province during a limited period I showed that we take promises seriously. In the two years in which I was responsible for affairs in Carinthia, an incredibly large number of reform steps were taken in this direction. [FOCUS] What are the FPOe's conditions for Austria to join the European Union? [Haider] The first point is adopting the transit treaty we have with the European Community. Second, we want to change over to extensive agriculture and support our farmers with direct payments. In this way, we can save a lot of money that is already spent today on marketing the surplus. Third, in the field of real estate transactions, we are thinking of the Danish model: five years of residence in Austria, then the opportunity to acquire land. [FOCUS] Your phrases create the impression that you are the stronghold against the immigration of millions? [Haider] We are not afraid of the immigration of Sicilians who want to open pizzerias everywhere here. The problem is the Eastern European region, the Asiatic region, and North Africa. We will be confronted with large migration movements from there. Today nobody says any longer: "We must have open borders!" We have reeducated the people in the government parties. [FOCUS] You? Not inherent necessities? [Haider] We reeducated them. [FOCUS] The Germans, too? [Haider] I am not responsible for Germany. I am responsible for Austria. [FOCUS] The word "German" features largely in your vocabulary. Do you want to go "home into the Reich" with Austria? [Haider] We as Austrians do not want the anschluss. We work hard enough ourselves, so we can be arrogant enough to say: We do not necessarily need you. You need us. The national complex in Germany and the Germans' self-hatred for their own people are so great that we do not particularly wish to participate in it. We prefer to go our own way.
