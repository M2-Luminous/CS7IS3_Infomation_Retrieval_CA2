The sources said that the brigade's commander, Colonel 'Abdallah 'Ali Shulayl, had left the camp to finalize some matters. In his absence a decision was issued, appointing Colonel Taymas as his replacement. It is worth mentioning that both officers come from Abyan Governorate (in the south). The 5th Brigade is also one of the military units belonging to former President 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, whose elements emigrated to the north in the wake of the 13 January 1986 incidents. The sources said that Col. 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar, commander of the 1st tank Division and the Yemeni president's half brother, is behind the replacement process, because of his fear of possible contacts between the brigade and Socialist Party leaders, while northern units (loyal to the General People's Congress) see 'Ali Nasir's forces as "friendly units." Observers believe that the decision to replace the 5th Brigade's commander is an attempt to foment sedition among the sons of Abyan Governorate, to which President 'Ali Nasir belong. But it has resulted in nothing except skirmishes between the brigade's personnel and the tank battalion belonging to the 1st Division, which is stationed in the same camp. As a result, one of the brigade's soldiers was wounded. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has learned that a military committee comprised of Col. 'Abdallah 'Ali 'Ulaywah, Col. 'Abd-Rabbuh Mansur, and Commander Muzahim went to Sanaa to the 5th Brigade's command to discuss the issue. They discovered that another military delegation had arrived from Aden. An argument took place between the "committee" and the "delegation." It ended up with an agreement to freeze the situation and keep Col. Sulayl in his position, after the brigade's personnel warned against replacing their commander "covertly." They stressed that any decision in this connection should come from Yemeni Defense Minister Staff Brigadier General Haytham Qasim Tahir. Tribal sources in the 'Umran area have said that the people of the area sympathize with the 5th Brigade's personnel and command, because they are performing their duty in an area deprived of services, even though they are exposed to an undeclared blockade from the military supply organ. Some people describe them as "third-rate military men" -- which has caused them to support Defense Minister Brig. Gen. Haytham and consider him their leader in the circumstances of the blockade they are experiencing. In another development, officials in Sanaa have confirmed the occurrence of a clash between a group of tribesmen who wanted to seize a convoy of [cooking] gas tankers that were heading for the capital and the police forces guarding them. Despite the intensity of the exchange of fire, the authorities have not revealed the number of victims.
