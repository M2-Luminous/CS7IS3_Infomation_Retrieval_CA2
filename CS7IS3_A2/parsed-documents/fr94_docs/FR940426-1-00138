Section 641.309 is restructured and provisions for assessment and reassessment of enrollees are added consistent with section 502(b)(1)(N) of the OAA, as added by section 501(2)(C) of the 1992 Act. 10. Section 641.310 is amended to incorporate the information on community assignments under a single heading and transfers former (e) which is now addressed under §641.308(c). 11.
