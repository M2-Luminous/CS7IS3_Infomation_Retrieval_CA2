According to the Mexican newspaper LA JORNADA, it received a telephone call on 8 January from an alleged EZLN member who said the rebel group was not involved in the terrorist attacks in Michoacan, Puebla, and Acapulco. Nevertheless, the caller said it is very probable that the rebel movement, which began the armed uprising in Chiapas on 1 January, "will detonate explosive devices in the Mexican capital." The alleged EZLN member said that the civilian population of Mexico City need not be alarmed, "because we will warn the police 30 minutes in advance before the explosions." Many newspaper reports attributed the attack in Acapulco and in the Plaza Universidad Shopping Center in Mexico City on 8 January to the extremist Revolutionary Workers Clandestine People's Union Party-Poor People's Party (Procup-PDLP). According to these reports, members of the extremist party claimed responsibility for the attacks in several telephone calls in which they said the actions were "to demand that the government stop the repression against the EZLN members" and in support of the insurrectional movement. LA JORNADA also published a secret report composed by the Chiapas government, in which it is said that there are 42 communities in the state in the conflict zone that are described as "high risk" and 13 others in which a special vigilance must be established, "because they are highly belligerent." The document stated that Chiapas is experiencing "the most dramatic situation of poverty in its history, because the large government investments have not been sufficient in comparison to the region's needs." According to LA JORNADA, the document described one by one the main problems faced by the people of Chiapas, such as poverty, illiteracy, a lack of loans, drug trafficking, low wages, and others, which make "the region fertile ground for the growth of discontent, on which the armed group has capitalized." The document also proposed 10 points to resolve the crisis, including forgiving the coffee growers and cattle growers' debt, having officials respect human dignity, creating subregional attention centers, and better definition of agrarian policies. After recounting that the first signs of guerrillas were detected in Chiapas 30 years ago, the document read that "the emergence of the armed group should not surprise us, because since 1973 the existence of centers for guerrilla military training and for the recovery of Guatemalan guerrilla wounded was already known."
