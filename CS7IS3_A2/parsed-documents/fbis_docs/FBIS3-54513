First of all I thank all the brothers and sisters for the patriotic spirit they have shown and I thank you for enabling this conference to approve the platform for national consensus which we consider to be in fact a program of action which can be adopted during the transitional period. We consider that this platform which has been approved today is in reality the result of a collective endeavor in which all the quarters which have worked with the National Dialogue Commission have participated, regardless of whether they participated in the conference, boycotted it, or withdrew from it. Since it was set up, the Commission has tried with all its force to secure the participation of all parties in the dialogue and not to exclude anybody apart from the party which excludes itself. Also from the outset, it has endeavored and made all efforts to bring views closer, to get everybody to work with all sincerity toward implementing the contents of the platform for national consensus, and for all to try to give priority to the supreme interest of the nation so that Algeria can get out of the crisis from which it is suffering as soon as possible. Brothers and sisters, we call on all members of Algerian society to show a patriotic spirit and wisdom and place Algeria's interest above any other consideration. I will not miss the opportunity also to thank all the brothers and sisters who have worked assiduously in preparing this conference. May God's peace, mercy, and blessings be upon you. [applause] I officially announce the end of the conference. [National anthem played]
