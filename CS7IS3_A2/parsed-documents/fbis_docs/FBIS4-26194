The morbidity rate of stomach cancer is among the highest of all types of cancer. Advanced-stage stomach tumors cannot be removed surgically, and chemotherapy is the only way to ease pain. Since the early 1980s hospitals all over the world have administered infusions of chemicals through arteries. But under such treatment only about 25 percent of the victims can live one year. Iodized oil is a kind of embolism agent. When it is infused into the stomach artery it can selectively deposit itself into and around the small blood vessels of the tumor, and cut the blood supply to it. Thus, it kills or inhibits the expansion of cancer cells. However, it will not reduce the growth of healthy cells. According to Wang Xiaolin, one of the staff physicians at the hospital, the chemicals carried by the iodized oil can stay on permanently to kill tumor cells, and hopefully cure the cancer. Experts have appraised the therapy as a safe, simple and effective one.
