Production of the processing industries declined by 7.7 percent in 1993. Ifo expects a 5-percent real increase in export sales. Domestic sales, on the other hand, are expected to go up only slightly. Positive stimuli by investments and stock cycles are clearly weakened by an increase in imports and declining private consumption. This was evident in the low domestic orders at the end of last year. Forecasts for the major sectors of industry indicate differing results. Ifo expects a 1 to 2-percent decline (1993: minus 5.8 percent) in production of electrical goods, a 4 to 5-percent decrease (minus 11.4 percent) in the textile industry, and an 8-percent decline (minus 9.9 percent) in the clothing industry. West German mechanical engineering, which has lost approximately one-fifth of its production since 1990 (1993: minus 11.7 percent), can expect a slight increase of approximately 1 percent in 1994. The electrical industry's capital goods sector will increase by some 3 percent (1993: minus 7.7 percent), which is partly a result of major supplies to eastern Germany. In Ifo's view, production of pickup trucks and trucks, which declined by 25 percent in 1993, could stagnate even with foreign demand slightly increasing. Production of sedans and station wagons is, however, likely to increase by 5 percent, in spite of domestic supplies slightly declining (1993: minus 19.5 percent). Due to stronger impulses from the domestic market, the chemical industry can expect production to increase by at least 3 percent in 1994 (1993: minus 2.2 percent). Since steel consumption is going up again, the iron and steel producing industry is expected to increase by some 2 percent (1993: minus 7 percent).
