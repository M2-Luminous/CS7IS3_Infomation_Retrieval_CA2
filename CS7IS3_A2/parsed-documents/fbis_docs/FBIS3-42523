Varotsos, International Center for the Environment and Remote Sensing imeni Nansen, St. Petersburg; Applied Physics Faculty, Athens University; UDC 558.88.042.4:551.534] [Abstract] Nimbus-7 TOMS data collected daily over a 13-year period (January 1979 to January 1992) was used to analyze total ozone variability over St. Petersburg. Average monthly total-ozone values were subjected to Fourier analysis in order to calculate the amplitude, phase, and relative contribution of each of the three first harmonics to the overall total-ozone variability. The principal conclusion reached by the researchers is that heterogenous chemical reactions result in a modification of the usual chemical processes in the Arctic circumpolar vortex, which in turn enhances total-ozone depletion of anthropogenic origin. The effect is also seen in the middle latitudes as a result of the movement of air masses from the polar latitudes when the circumpolar vortex breaks down. A negative gradient obtains for active chlorine away from the pole, and the movement to the middle latitudes stimulates processes that destroy ozone. Figures 3, references 21: 4 Russian, 17 Western.
