Renamo said the demobilization of troops from both sides will start simultaneously and in line with a set timetable. The demobilization should have begun two days ago, but the United Nations did not submit a list of names of Renamo soldiers waiting to be demobilized. Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative to Mozambique, Mr. Aldo Ajello, has reaffirmed that Mozambique's first multiparty elections will only be held if troops from both sides are demobilized. He dismissed earlier reports that the United Nations might allow the elections to take place even if the Mozambican Government and Renamo still have their respective armies.
