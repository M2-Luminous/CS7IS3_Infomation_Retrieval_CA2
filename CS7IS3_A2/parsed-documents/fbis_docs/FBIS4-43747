Executive Bureau Elections Favor Tsokhatzopoulos According to Stavros Liyeros, writing in the 22 May Athens daily I KATHIMERINI, the election of the PASOK executive bureau members indicates that Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou's power over the party is "fully established." The election also confirmed the role of Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, PASOK secretary general, as "interpreter of Papandreou's will." According to Liyeros, a new balance of power is shaping within the party, with a "dividing line" between those allied with Papandreou and others who function as the "opposition." The former, led by Tsokhatzopoulos, include those PASOK factions nicknamed the "Italian group," the "Yennimatas group," the "Arsenis group," as well as top officials such as Chamber of Deputies President Apostolos Kaklamanis, Minister of Environment Kostas Laliotis, and PASOK official Stefanos Tzoumakas. On the opposition side stand the "Simitis group," the faction under the influence of PASOK luminary Vaso Papandreou, and Alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Thodhoros Pangalos, who is following an "autonomous" course. These developments are important because of the ongoing struggle to succeed Papandreou, who, it is now apparent, will run for the presidency in 1995, Liyeros wrote. According to Liyeros, Tsokhatzopoulos is thought to hold most of the trump cards in a succession race because of his power over the party apparatus. However, many party officials, including some Papandreou allies, do not consider him fit for the prime ministership, even if they accept him as party leader, Liyeros noted. Tsokhatzopoulos aides are spreading the rumor that, if Papandreou decides to run for the presidency, he will support his "trusted lieutenant" to succeed him, since this would allow the prime minister to maintain his influence over the party. However, other party sources cited by Liyeros believe that papandreou will favor a transitional, consensus-based leadership. According to Liyeros, many younger party officials, joined by would-be "heirs-apparent" aware they have no chance of being chosen, are positioning themselves for such a solution. Tsokhatzopoulos' biggest problem, Liyeros continued, will be dealing with Pangalos, who will intensify his "guerrilla" warfare within the party, having already stated he "will not spare his criticism" if the new executive bureau, of which he is not a member, proves "inefficient." Tsokhatzopoulos will have to confront pangalos without the support of the Papandreou-allied groups, Liyeros noted, since these are worried about the secretary general's increasing power and would not oppose a Pangalos attempt to "whittle it down." Laliotis Support of Tsokhatzopoulos Discussed In a reference to the so-called troika of PASOK's early days--composed of the late Yiorgos Yennimatas, Akis Tsokhatzopoulos, and Kostas Laliotis--I.K. Pretenderis, writing in the 22 May Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, cited a number of political observers as convinced that Tsokhatzopoulos would not have realized his goals at the party's third congress without enlisting Laliotis' support. A number of PASOK officials believe that, in return for his support in the Papandreou succession race, Tsokhatzopoulos promised Laliotis the post of secretary general. However, Pretenderis questioned Laliotis' motives for clashing with the "modernizing tendency" with which he has recently identified himself in the party and cited some observers as attributing it to his deteriorating relationship with "modernizer" Vaso Papandreou, whom he did not support in the race for the executive bureau. Another explanation, according to Pretenderis, is Laliotis' estimation that Papandreou will be succeeded by "short-time" leaders, of whom Tsokhatzopoulos is but the first. A third explanation rests on the argument for a "legitimate succession," which would designate Tsokhatzopoulos as the immediate successor followed by the third member of the "historical leadership," Laliotis himself.
