He excluded Cuba from that invitation considering that Cuba does not meet the democratic requirements Washington has set for the rest of the area countries. So there will be a meeting without Cuba, the rebel member of the community. Curiously, the call for a summit ignores the OAS, which because of its nature and purposes should be the one to promote such a summit, and ignoring them calls attention to a certain degree of speed and improvisation. It has been said that the meeting will be on democracy, cooperation, and economy. In my opinion, this is an effort aimed at intruding in Iberio-American summit meetings or, at least, reducing the possibility of these summits working for unity and regional cooperation. There is no doubt the Miami meeting has untrustworthy objectives. The United States tried to get invited to the first summit meeting of Ibero-American presidents in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1991. It did not achieve its objective but it maintained its desire to be kept officially informed of what was discussed there. I do not know if it tried to do the same at the other summits, in Spain and Brazil. The White House has diminished the importance of what the Ibero-American chiefs of state said. What is clear is that the current call is aimed at reducing the significance of this movement, which will hold its fourth summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, in June. Once again Washington is marshalling its ability to try to divide our people with plans and projects that have nothing to do with our regional problems. We have been fooled for decades with dreams about development and well-being. Now, on the threshold of the 21st century, we are being told the same stories we were told last century to try and keep us separated. U.S. economic and military power has always obstructed Latin America's fair aspirations for unity. At the Guadalajara summit, President Fidel Castro expressed caution about the so-far useless efforts to become an economically powerful and politically united community in spite of our huge resources and talent.
