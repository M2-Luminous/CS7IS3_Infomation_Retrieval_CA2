They added that the government will not back down from continuing the controversial municipal tax plan. The AMPE [Association of Peruvian Municipalities] representatives also attended the meeting with the Budget Commission and reiterated that Legislative Decree No. 776 is unconstitutional and violates municipal laws because it reduces local government revenues substantially. However, although Bustamante and Camet invited the mayors to a meeting on 17 January, they showed no willingness to reform the plan. On the contrary, they justified it. [Begin Bustamante recording] As mentioned many times before, by implementing this law, we seek the following: first, to simplify and modernize the municipal tax system; second, to guarantee, in one way or another, taxpayer stability regarding rates and taxes; third, it has a very clear decentralization effect; and fourth, it has a very clear distribution effect. [end recording] Meanwhile, Camet said that although Congress is fully empowered to amend the decree, the government believes it is excellent because it increases municipal revenues, thus hinting that there will be no looking back. [Begin recording] [Camet] This is an excellent reform to the municipal tax system based, as the prime minister said, on the redistribution of revenues collected by the central government to the districts. This redistribution will give more to those who have less. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. Minister, please allow me. There is a lot of controversy because the government claims that there will be greater revenues while municipalities claim that there will be less. You handle figures; could you tell us exactly how many millions [currency not specified] were channeled to district and provincial municipalities under the previous law and how many millions they will receive from now on? [Camet] Tax collection, as one of your fellow journalists said, will increase to 610 million [currency not specified]. Thus, all district municipalities will receive more in 1994 than they received in 1993. [end recording]
