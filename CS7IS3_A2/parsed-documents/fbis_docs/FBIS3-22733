This was stated today by Viktor Fetisov, director of the leading enterprise of the national atomic industry -- the Mayak chemical combine. He was commenting on a media report that the enterprise had accepted for reprocessing the whole batch of enriched uranium from the research reactor in Iraq as planned. We succeeded in winning the competition for effecting the project for rendering services to the IAEA, the Mayak chief said. It was a question of transporting from Iraq and reprocessing the nuclear fuel from the research reactor in fulfillment of the decisions of the UN Security Council resolution. In this connection, relevant instructions were taken from the Russian Government. This work is to our advantage since it makes it possible to take up unused production capacity and provide work for highly qualified staff.
