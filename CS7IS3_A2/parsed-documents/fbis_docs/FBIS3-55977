The enemy, who launched three attacks during the day, suffered considerable losses in men and material and had to withdraw. Our brave soldiers have brought to naught every Armenian offensive in Agdamskiy and Beylagan rayons. The high command of the Armenian Armed Forces, whose attacks towards Beylagan and Terter were defeated, is now working to exacerbate the situation on our republic's northwestern borders. The settlements in our republic's Tauzskiy, Kazakhskiy, and Kedabekskiy rayons came under unceasing long-range artillery shelling at 1830 on 11 January from Armenia's Berd, Idzhevanskiy, and Krasnoselskiy rayons. Our army units took countermeasures to silence the ferocious enemy.
