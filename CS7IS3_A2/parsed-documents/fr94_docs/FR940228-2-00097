FR940228-2-00097 FR940228-2-00059 (g) The aggregate fair market value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the stock with respect to which options are exercisable for the first time by an individual in any calendar year may not exceed $100,000. (h) Stock acquired upon exercise of options may not be sold for two years from the grant date or one year from the exercise date, whichever is later. (i) Options may be exercised by the optionee only if the optionee was an employee or officer of applicant during the entire period commencing with the grant date and ending three months prior to the exercise date, unless termination of employment is caused by death or disability, in which case the option may be exercised within one year following termination of employment. 12. The Plan does not provide for the grant of stock appreciation rights. The Plan does permit the exercise price of an option to be paid in cash or by tendering previously acquired shares of stock, valued at the fair market value as determined by the Compensation Committee. In placing a fair market value on previously acquired shares of applicant's common stock, applicant will use the same standards as are used in determining the fair market value at the time of the grant of the option. 13. The Compensation Committee may determine in its sole discretion that an adjustment in the number or kind of shares reserved for issuance under the Plan but not yet covered by options or of the stock then subject to options is necessary, or that an adjustment in the option price in each stock option agreement is necessary because of a change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of stock of applicant (or of any stock or other securities into which such shares of stock shall have been changed or for which it shall have been exchanged), whether through reorganization, recapitalization, stock split, combination of shares, merger or consolidation, or any other change in the number or kind of outstanding shares of stock. 14. Applicant also has a profit sharing plan qualified under section 401(a) of the Code, which is intended to provide a source of retirement income for employees. In accordance with the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, applicant's profit sharing plan does not discriminate in favor of shareholders, officers, and highly compensated employees as to coverage, benefits, contributions, or otherwise. Applicant to date has not contributed the maximum permissible amount in any year. The Plan is not a substitute for a profit-sharing plan qualified under section 401(a), as it is intended to provide incentive compensation and does not establish a source of income for an employee's retirement years. Applicant's Legal Conclusions 1. Section 18(d) prohibits any registered management investment company from issuing warrants or rights to subscribe to or purchase its securities except those issued ratably to a class of security holders with an exercise period of up to 120 days, or in exchange for warrants in connection with a reorganization. The issuance of stock options by applicant to its employees would not satisfy these statutory exceptions. 2. The issuance of stock options to applicant's employees also would be prohibited under section 23. Section 23(a) generally prevents a registered closed-end investment company from issuing any of its securities for services or for property other than cash or securities. Because the issuance of stock options by applicant may constitute the issuance of securities for services, absent exemptive relief, it would be prohibited by section 23(a). Section 23(b) prohibits the sale by a closed-end investment company of any stock of which it is the issuer at a price below current net asset value, except with the consent of a majority of its common stockholders at the time of issuance or under certain other enumerated circumstances. If the net asset value of applicant's common stock were to increase following the grant of an option, the option exercise price may be less than the net asset value of a share of applicant's common stock on the date of exercise. Furthermore, section 23(c) generally prohibits the purchase by a registered closed-end investment company of any securities of which it is the issuer. Thus, to the extent that payment for stock options with previously acquired shares of applicant's common stock is considered to be a purchase by applicant of its own securities, section 23(c) would prohibit the transaction. 3. Section 17(d) and rule 17d&hyph;1(a) thereunder also prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company from participating in, or offering a transaction in connection with, any joint enterprise or other joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan in which the registered company is a participant unless an order permitting the transaction has been granted by the SEC. Paragraph (c) of rule 17d&hyph;1 includes stock option plans in the definition of joint enterprise, joint arrangement or profit-sharing plan prohibited by section 17(d). These provisions therefore may prohibit any stock option plan absent an order from the SEC.
