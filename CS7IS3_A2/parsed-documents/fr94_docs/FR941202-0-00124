FR941202-0-00124 FR941202-0-00012 Available Data In addition to the public comments to the rulemaking, the Department considered the following drug testing data in the regulated industries, the Department's civilian workforce, and the U.S. Coast Guard military personnel. The data do not include refusals to be tested. The operating administration data reflect phase-in of random testing from 25 percent to 50 percent unless otherwise noted.

The study compared four railroads testing at 50 percent (control group) with four railroads testing at 25 percent (experimental group). The positive rate for the control group when the study was initiated was 1.1 percent; for the experimental group it was 0.89 percent. In the first year (July 1991 through June 1992), the control group positive rate was 0.90 percent, the experimental group's was 0.87 percent. For the period July 1992 through June 1993, these groups had positive rates of 0.80 percent and 0.94 percent, respectively. During the third year, the experimental rate was 0.86 percent and the control rate was 0.77 percent. The three-year totals were 0.89 percent for the experimentals and 0.82 percent for the controls. Motor Carriers The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991 (P.L. 102&hyph;143, Title V, Section 5) required FHWA to conduct a demonstration project to study the feasibility of random roadside alcohol and controlled substances testing. It was partly designed to ``serve as a test of, and establish a record on, the effectiveness of state-administered testing in detecting individuals, such as independent owner-operators and independent drivers, who might otherwise avoid detection though the carrier-administered testing directed by the [Omnibus Act].'' S. Rep. 102&hyph;54, p. 34. The pilot program was administered under the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program (MCSAP), which is a federal grant program that assists states in enforcing motor vehicle safety laws and regulations. The pilot program sampled drivers holding commercial drivers licenses operating only on interstate highways and major state roads.
