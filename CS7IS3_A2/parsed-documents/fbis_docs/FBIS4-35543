The minister of state for external affairs, Mr. R.L. Bhatia, told the meeting in Cairo that New Delhi has always been ready for the dialogue with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue but there has been little response from Islamabad. In a strongly worded response to a Pakistani demand for intervention by NAM [Non-Aligned Movement] in the issue, Mr. Bhatia said: Pakistan is inflicting enormous suffering on the people of New Delhi through state sponsored terrorism. He asserted that Kashmir is and will always remain an integral part of India. Mr. Bhatia reminded the meeting of the ruling by the NAM chairman Indonesia that bilateral disputes should not be discussed at the NAM meeting. He said: Any moves going against the ruling can only weaken the movement.
