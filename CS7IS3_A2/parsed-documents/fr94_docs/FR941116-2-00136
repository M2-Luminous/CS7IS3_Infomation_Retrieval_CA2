FR941116-2-00136 FR941116-2-00096 Facilities Submissions must provide a full description of existing buildings, including a building site layout, square footage, age, and general condition of each structure. Included in the description must be a discussion of its current or previous use; the number of years unoccupied, if appropriate; and the condition of sub-systems such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, plumbing, and electrical. Any building documents, such as blueprints, should be available for review when a site inspection is conducted by the Department. Documentation in the nature of photographs of the property and/or facilities must be submitted as well. In addition, a videotaped presentation of the site may be provided. The proposal must identify the extent to which hazardous materials such as asbestos, PCB, and underground storage tanks are present at the site or, if appropriate, confirm that contaminants do not exist. The results of any environmental assessment for the proposed site, if one has been done, must be provided. The proposal must address the availability and proximity of utilities to the proposed site, including electrical, water, gas, and sanitary sewer and runoff connections. It must also describe whether the water and sewer utilities for existing buildings are connected to the municipal system or operated separately. A statement on current zoning classification and any zoning restrictions for the proposed site must also be included. Use of the site as a Job Corps center should be compatible with surrounding local land use and also with local zoning ordinances. Confirmation must be provided as to whether or not any buildings at the site are on a Federal or State Historical Preservation Register. The proposal must also describe the available acreage at the site, and the nature of the surrounding environment including whether it is commercial, industrial, light industrial, rural, or residential. In some instances, proposed sites may be part of a substantially larger acreage which has or contemplates having other uses. This type of joint-use situation may or may not be compatible with providing a quality training environment for young women and men. Finally , the proposal must address the cost of acquiring the site, which may involve transferring the site to the government at no cost, entering into a low-cost long-term lease agreement or arranging for a negotiated purchase price based on a fair market appraisal.
