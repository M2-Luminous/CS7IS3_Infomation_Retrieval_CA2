By 8:30 early in the morning at the Andingmennei street deposit outlet of the Industrial and Commercial Bank, more than 60 people had queued up to buy the treasury bonds, which were first issued today. That was seen at almost all outlets in Beijing selling the bonds. Just a few days ago, many Beijing residents queued up at the same outlets to buy stocks issued by four large companies. "My wife came here even at 6:30 in the morning, and I have come to take her place so that she could have her breakfast," said an old worker in the line at Andingmennei street. A salesman at the bank who was making preparations for bond sales said that people have kept asking about the new bonds. One person had turned in more than one million yuan worth of bonds issued before in exchange for the new ones early in the morning. The "old in exchange for the new" business -- returning old bonds for new with higher interest rates -- seems to be the favorite. Within two hours, some 3.50 million yuan worth of bonds had sold out at the Dongsi outlet of the Beijing branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. And most bonds were sold via the new business. Officials said that the bank deposits of urban and rural residents have risen steadily since the beginning of this year, topping 62.3 billion yuan by the end of February. However, they said that the three-year-term bonds were not selling as well as the two-year-term bonds.
