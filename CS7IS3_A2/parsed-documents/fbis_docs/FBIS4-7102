Some ruling coalition parties made moves to organize their parliamentary group just before a new cabinet was about to be formed and reacting against their moves, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] broke away from the coalition. The formation of a new cabinet was deferred until after 26 April. The moves by some ruling coalition parties and the SDPJ's isolation are likely to further precipitate a realignment of the established political parties in the future. Some ruling coalition parties abruptly formed a parliamentary group called "Kaishin" with the aim of leaving the SDPJ out in the cold, although the SDPJ shored up the coalition framework for the Hosokawa government and the formation of such a parliamentary group would change qualitatively and greatly the character of a new coalition government to be led by Mr. Hata. The Hosokawa government managed to stay in power for eight months while showing from time to time the fragility of its coalition. The Hosokawa government was able to resolve such pending issues as the enactment of the Political Reform Law and the liberalization of rice imports thanks to broad public support. Disgusted by nearly 40 years of rule by governments of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and angered by a series of cases of political corruption under the LDP government, the people had hoped for new and fresh politics. The emergence of the fresh-imaged Prime Minister Hosokawa, who distinguished himself from other politicians, and the common platform of a change of government and political reform combined to give cohesive force and impetus to the Hosokawa government. The Hosokawa government was inaugurated amid public blessings. What about the Hata government? There is no doubt that the people feel friendly toward Prime Minister Hata who is an ordinary person and a man of common sense. Nonetheless, the people have come to look coolly at the coalition government. An attempt to change the current coalition framework by forcibly ousting the SDPJ from the coalition gives us the impression that the attempt is a result of a high-handed political tactic employed by Mr. Ichiro Ozawa who is known as the kingmaker of the Hata government. The people pinned high hopes on the Hosokawa government to push forward political reform, because such political parties as the Japan New Party and Sakigake [Harbinger], which distanced themselves from conventional politics, succeeded in rallying broad-ranging political forces while acting as an intermediary. The Hosokawa government suffered a delay in decisionmaking because of intragovernment disagreement, but the interparty check-and-balance process enhanced to some extent the transparency of decisionmaking and the functions of the coalition government. If the SDPJ were pressed to change itself so as to act according to realpolitik, it would be a plus for the party. Shinseito-Led Hata Government For the Hata government, which will take charge of politics after enactment of the Political Reform Law, there is no longer such a major domestic agenda as the political reform which held the ruling coalition parties together and made it possible for the Hosokawa government to enjoy broad public support. The showdown between Shinseito and the SDPJ, which first surfaced following their disagreement over the national welfare tax and a reshuffle of the Hosokawa cabinet and then intensified in choosing a successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa, resulted in ousting the SDPJ from the coalition. The political situation is now entering a new phase. Prime Minister Hata has publicly said he would continue to pursue reform policies. The breakaway of Sakigake from the coalition and the isolation of the SDPJ will lead to a change in the character of the Hata government as a reformist government. The expressions of "the rooting out of political corruption" and "the thorough establishment of political ethics" are not found in the basic policies for a new coalition government. Mr. Ichiro Ozawa, affiliated with Shinseito, took the lead in forming a new coalition government. The basic policies for a new coalition government include what Shinseito has advocated. We have no choice but to be concerned about the political tactics and structure that put the management of the political situation in the hands of a specific senior politician and keep the public in the dark about the decisionmaking process. The Hata government is seeking its reform policies not in political reform and administrative reform, but in the establishment of political leadership. For the time being, the Hata government will have to deal with the reform of the current tax system, security, and the situation on the Korean peninsula. We want to point out once again that the establishment of political leadership is not simply a synonym for an arbitrary imposition of the leaders' wishes from above. Political leadership means the leadership of politics over the way things are done within a bureaucracy. To that end, politics must stand on broad public support and take charge of stressing the interests of the public over the interests of government ministries and agencies that are perpetuated by bureaucratic sectionalism. If political leaders have a high sense of ethics and deep insight, then the political leadership will be guaranteed. What we hope is that Prime Minister Hata, a man of common sense, will establish a political leadership based upon the sense of the citizens. Another thing that concerns us in connection with the inauguration of the Hata government, which is expected to be under Shinseito's thumb, is its relationship with the LDP, the opposition party. It is a matter of course that the coalition government, which came to power on the platform of rallying political forces to end LDP domination, sees the LDP as its major political rival. The coalition partners have been trying to split the LDP and keep it out of power in line with their major strategic goal, but such a strategic goal is not in tune with the present political situation. Responsibility of the LDP as an Opposition Force Essentially, political parties must be formed, realigned, and merged in accordance with their policies and lines. The structure has been built whereby the established political parties have been pitted against each other and split into ruling and opposition parties primarily on the basis of their past deep-seated grudge relationship built upon the so-called "pro-Ozawa" and "anti-Ozawa theory." The policy distortion exposed by a big fuss over "Watanabe's breakaway from the LDP" and the strange political structure built upon the "pro-Ozawa" and the "anti-Ozawa theory" represents Japan's warped politics. We see the Hata government as one emerging from the process of realigning the established political parties, with the aforementioned political situation taken into consideration. It is necessary to rally political forces again and promote the realignment of political parties primarily on the basis of policies. If the political parties fail to do so, as seen in the history of giving birth to the Hata government, the political parties' goals will be only to cling to power, defend their organizations, and increase the seeds of future intraparty splits and confrontation. The Hata government is increasingly led by Shinseito. If the Hata government, which formed the parliamentary group, has the ability to play a pivotal role in pushing for a full-fledged realignment of the established political parties in the near future, it is urgently necessary to rally political forces to counter the Hata government. Promoting a political system in the name of national unity and a national salvation cabinet is not a desirable tendency for present day politics which recognizes the existence of diverse opinions. The inauguration of the Hata government makes it a most important task for the LDP to reform and regenerate itself as a political force to counter the Hata government. This is also true for the SDPJ which broke away from the coalition government.
