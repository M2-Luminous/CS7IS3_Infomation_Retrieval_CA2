It is at a good level and it is important to keep our relations at this level at least. There are a lot of problems of mutual interest which we can resolve together," Lieutenant General Janos Deak, commander of the Hungarian Army and General Staff Chief, told BTA. Gen. Deak is leading a Hungarian military delegation on a two-day visit to Bulgaria paid under the Bulgarian-Hungarian programme for cooperation in the military field. The programme for military cooperation between Bulgaria and Hungary should be expanded, Army General Lyuben Petrov, chief of the General Staff of the Bulgarian Army, and Gen. Janos Deak agreed at their meeting today. "The consensus of the Hungarian Parliament on the Army Act adopted in 1993 has opened a possibility for the active restructuring of the armed forces in that country and Bulgaria can learn a lot from Hungary's experience in this respect," Gen. Petrov told BTA. It is planned to expand joint activities mainly in the exchange of information and experience in carrying out the reform and restructuring of the armed forces and in providing supplies for the armies under the conditions of a market economy. According to Gen. Petrov, it is the sides' shared opinion that the Balkans are an area arousing concern among the European and the regional communities. Bulgarian-Hungarian military cooperation was also discussed at the meeting which the Hungarian guest had with Deputy Minister of Defence Grigor Khandzhiev. The problems of relations between the military and civil army leaderships were considered at the meeting of Gen. Deak and Parliamentary National Security Committee Chairman Nikolay Slatinski. The sides exchanged experience on the legislative solution to army problems. "The Bulgarian Parliament may not pass the defence and armed forces legislation because many keep talking about early elections, and it will take another two months to finalize the bill," BTA was told by Mr. Slatinski. He shared his positive impression from the pragmatic approach applied by the Hungarian Defence Ministry in resolving the economic problems under the conditions of transition to a market economy. "As NATO's Partnership for Peace plan is still at a stage of political solutions, it has no& been discussed in detail," the Bulgarian parliamentarian said. He stressed that integration within Europe should not be achieved at the expense of the Central and East European countries' bilateral relations. "A kind of 'rivalry' observed at international forums gives rise to prejudice in this respect sometimes," Mr. Slatinski said. "Defence Minister Valentin Aleksandrov's idea of expanding military contacts among the Danubian countries has not become state policy yet," he stated. Mr. Slatinksi believes that the idea was developed by the political scientist, diplomat and historian Valentin Aleksandrov rather than Valentin Aleksandrov the defence minister. The idea of expanding the Danubian countries' military contacts was discussed by Defence Minister Aleksandrov and his Hungarian counterpart Lajos Fur in Sofia in March 1993. At the time the two defence ministers confirmed the sides' shared desire for the promotion of bilateral military cooperation at all levels. A joint declaration was signed on the advancement of military ties in the spirit of the cooperation agreement concluded between the Bulgarian and Hungarian Defence Ministries in Sofia in 1991. The agreement built on the political declaration on bilateral relations which President Zhelyu Zhelev of Bulgaria and President Arpad Goncz of Hungary had signed in Budapest the previous month. The agreement is an expression of the desire for cooperation based on mutual respect and aimed at confidence building, which would help establish an European collective security system. It makes provisions for coordination of the activity of the two countries' Defence Ministries in the implementation of the United Nations resolutions concerning peacekeeping and of their activity within the framework of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe process. The bilateral documents map out the fields of future joint work on the problems of security policies, development of the armies and their staff structure, modernization in the military and technological field, defence economy and financial support of the armies, etc.
