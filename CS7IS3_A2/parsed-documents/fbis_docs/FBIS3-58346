According to the figures from the Wiesbaden-based office, GDP for the whole of Germany decreased in real terms by 1.3 percent on 1992. The fall in GDP in western Germany was 1.9 percent and in eastern Germany GDP grew by 6.3 percent. GDP in money terms amounted to over 3.1 trillion German marks [DM] of which western Germany accounts for a substantial 91 percent and eastern Germany for almost 9 percent. In a statement issued today on these figures, Rexrodt pointed out that the average figures conceal the slight recovery which set in during the course of the year following the slump in the spring. The noticeable slowdown in price increases in all important demand areas is also pleasing as is the fact that growth in eastern Germany has broadened its base. Not only is the construction sector expanding there, but signs of improvement in the manufacturing sector are also increasing. However, despite strong GDP growth in eastern Germany for the second year, there can be no talk yet of a self-sustaining upswing in the east. The gap between demand and income, on the one hand, and production, on the other hand, still has to be covered by transfers from western Germany. The economics minister announced that the Federal Government will soon set out in detail, in its annual economic report, how it expects the economy to perform in 1994.
