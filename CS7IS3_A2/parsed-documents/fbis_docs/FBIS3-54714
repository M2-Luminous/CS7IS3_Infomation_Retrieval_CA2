The situation alerted both people here in Ukraine and experts abroad, people everywhere. National-minded Ukrainian patriots asserted that Ukraine is finally stripping in front of Washington and Moscow. People abroad also reacted by shrugging their shoulders: Why did Ukraine start with the most modern nuclear missiles, and why do it when the well-known SS-19 missiles pose a greater environmental danger than the SS-24's? As you see, people everywhere, in Ukraine and abroad, are asking why. Would you try answering these questions? [Tarasyuk] Thank you. Indeed there are many questions, and I will try to explain. In my opinion, it is in Ukraine's interests to convince our partners and friends that nuclear arms deployed on the Ukrainian territory -- operationally controlled from outside Ukraine, by the way -- cannot be used against them. Proceeding from this, and also taking account of the Ukrainian Supreme Council's instructions on the need to ensure effective technical control over the nonuse of nuclear arms deployed on Ukrainian territory, our state's government is working on the so-called deactivation of strategic missile systems. Deactivation applies first and foremost to missile systems or nuclear warhead-carrying systems whose service life under guarantee is about to expire. The essence of deactivation is removing warheads, storing them in Ukraine at a significant distance from missile systems, and also essentially reducing the combat readiness of these systems. I should add that it is not only SS-24 missiles -- which are more sophisticated, as you correctly pointed out -- that are subject to deactivation, but the SS-19 missile systems as well. This work is being carried out concurrently. This especially concerns SS-19 missiles, whose condition will soon pose a serious threat to Ukraine itself, and which we cannot service without Russia's help. These measures are being taken to reduce the nuclear and environmental danger, and also to show the world community that Ukraine has no plans whatsoever to resort to nuclear blackmail in relation to any country, and that it is eager to reduce nuclear confrontation and increase confidence-building measures. Finally, I would like to stress that these steps are not identical with the process of reduction in compliance with the START-I Treaty. Meanwhile, intensive talks are being held with a number of states, primarily nuclear states, with the aim of creating preconditions for the treaty to come into force. [Marynenko] Thank you. One more thing in connection with the above problem. Credible sources have disclosed that there are plans to deactivate three more SS-24 missiles before the end of the year. Can you please deny or confirm this. [Tarasyuk] I will neither deny nor confirm this report. I have provided information which confirms the grounds for this work to be carried out. As for how many missile systems have been deactivated to date, and how many will be deactivated tomorrow, that much I am not prepared to tell you. [Marynenko] One more thing. You are probably familiar with the speech by people's deputy Mykola Porovskyy at the Supreme Council. This deputy linked the deactivation of SS-24 missiles with the fact that servicemen of the 43d Army failed to swear loyalty to Ukraine. Does this mean that it is a free-for-all? [Tarasyuk] I would like to stress once again that the decision to deactivate missile systems was made in Ukraine, irrespective of the men servicing missile systems, the servicemen of the 43d Missile Unit. Therefore, I do not think there is any ground for concern about this. [Marynenko] Is the deactivation of SS-24 missiles a direct result of the ratification of the START-I treaty by Ukraine's parliament? [Tarasyuk] It is not a result, but a temporary measure taken to remove the concern existing in the world, first of all in the United States, over a threat facing its territory. Naturally, it is not a one-sided process. By carrying out the deactivation -- I stress this yet again -- we are not taking any measures related to the compliance with the START treaty because these processes are in no way equivalent. However, by so doing we are reducing nuclear confrontation, the combat readiness of these nuclear systems is being curtailed, and we are thus making it clear that we have no aggressive intentions whatsoever and, moreover, we do not control these missile systems. Thus, we are sending yet another signal of Ukraine's peace-loving attitude and, in addition to this, proclaiming that, by following this path, we are defusing additional tension caused by keeping these missile systems on alert, since they consume a very large amount of electric power. I think this is another point for our state to consider today. [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, you know that following Ukraine's early start in deactivating strategic missiles, there have been new attempts to put pressure on Ukraine. What has been done is not enough, it was said, all types of missiles must be deactivated, and this must be done overnight, immediately, with complete elimination. You know very well that such insinuations have been made. And again, for some reason, nobody is taking account of either our capability or our interests. Your comments, please. [Tarasyuk] I will not comment on this. If you mean official reports, I know of no reports of any state demanding immediate deactivation. There is nothing like that. This process cannot be carried out overnight; it requires time, and it also requires certain material and human input. As for the compensation for this process, as you know, a framework agreement was signed recently between the United States and Ukraine, which will make it possible, as soon as it takes effect, to start the process of using the first part of the money allocated for the nuclear arms elimination in accordance with the Nunn-Lugar provision -- that is, $175 billion. [Marynenko] Mr. Tarasyuk, I am sure you know about the U.S. Senate resolution concerning ratification of the START-I Treaty. As a diplomat you know that the treaty has more depth and foresight. Although it stresses the mandatory status of Article 5 of the Lisbon Protocol, it allows for the possibility of delay in eliminating nuclear arms. But once Ukraine ratified START-I, they start saying the elimination has to be immediate. Your opinion, please. [Tarasyuk] I assume you mean the U.S. Senate resolution concerning the START Treaty. Indeed, it is a sizeable document containing many provisions, including provisions under which the United States ratified the treaty and the Lisbon Protocol in full. As for the ratification of this treaty by the Ukrainian Supreme Council, everybody knows that this ratification will come into force provided certain conditions are met. I will mention three of the major conditions: financial aid for the process of nuclear arms elimination; reliable guarantees of Ukraine's national security on the part of nuclear states; and third, compensation for not only strategic nuclear warheads but also nuclear warheads in the tactical nuclear weapons withdrawn from Ukraine as far back as last year. The government is now working on this very issue so as to create conditions which would allow the Supreme Council to remove its objections concerning the force of this ratification, and to exchange instruments of ratification; only then will the treaty take effect. From that time on, Ukraine will assume the obligations which, of course, it must abide by. [Marynenko] Esteemed Borys Tarasyuk, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, as you well know, Russia became the new partner for the United States in Eastern Europe. International observers realize -- of course, as a diplomat you also realize -- that backing just one partner is no policy; it constitutes unbalanced tactics in international terms. These tactics can lead to complicated consequences. Still, one can understand the old U.S. tradition of backing the strongest partner. But for some reason, the United States to this day does not wish to see Ukraine as an important factor of the European process, as an extremely important international security zone, owing to Ukraine's special position in Eastern Europe. Do you think this current foreign policy of the U.S. Administration with regard to Ukraine is rather blindsighted? [Tarasyuk] You have touched upon a very serious issue. Regarding our attitude to relations between the United States and Russia, we cannot, of course, be either pleased or displeased. The relationship between the United States and Russia is their affair. We should not give our appraisal of these relations. At the same time, you are right to say that we should not put up with the tendency to view relations with Ukraine through the prism of relations with Russia, as used to be the case and sometimes still is. That should indeed concern us, and we have voiced this concern to our partners more than once. I do not think we can now say that the United States does not regard Ukraine as a partner. In my opinion, the U.S. Administration has changed its approach toward relations with Ukraine. The United States does regard Ukraine as a serious partner. Moreover, it regards Ukraine as a guarantor of stability not only in Central and Eastern Europe but in Europe as a whole. Government officials in the United States are increasingly speaking of Ukraine is a serious partner. However, there is a certain gap between talk and action. So far, we have not bridged this gap. There is still a certain one-sidedness in relations between Ukraine and the United States, and this one-sidedness is marked by excessive emphasis on nuclear policy issues. We are extending efforts to rectify this one-sided approach to relations between our two states. This was discussed during several meetings between Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Christopher, and this has been the subject of numerous contacts between Ukraine and the United States at expert level. I think we will soon hear at least verbal denials that there is a one-sided emphasis in relations with Ukraine. A high-ranking delegation is currently preparing to visit the United States to discuss bilateral economic relations between our states. I think that if the negotiations are successful, this will indeed launch a new stage in relations between Ukraine and the United States involving more extensive areas of bilateral relations, and this will prove to all that the United States indeed sees Ukraine as a partner. [Marynenko] Thank you. To continue the theme of relations between Ukraine and the United States, it is common knowledge that the United States is one of the strongest, or rather, the strongest world power in terms of its economic and military potential. At the same time, although Ukraine has been independent for just two years, it is trying get closer to the United States, closer in terms of normal cooperation. You have just said that a Ukrainian delegation is seriously preparing for meetings in Washington at which a wide range of problems will be discussed, concerning, I think, not only nuclear arms and not only those wretched dollars Ukraine is allegedly trying to cadge from the United States for the elimination of nuclear arms, but fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation. Let us look at the U.S. position. You know U.S. President Clinton will soon pay an official visit to Moscow. At the same time he will visit half of Europe and so on. Ukraine is not included in Mr. Clinton's program. Naturally, we have no right to dictate the protocol and tell Mr. Clinton that he has to stop over in Ukraine. On the other hand, those who prepared this visit should have given the matter some thought, since there is a certain friction between the United States and Ukraine -- and I mean between the United States and Ukraine, not between Ukraine and the United States. Why not use the head of state's visit to Russia for at least a short meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk? Here, I think, we see a one-sided approach on the part of the U.S. Administration; here we see caution: Clinton is trying to consult with Russian President Boris Yeltsin before he receives the Ukrainian delegation. One can go on and on about the problem. What do you think as a diplomat? [Tarasyuk] You are quite right about the U.S. President's forthcoming visit to Europe. He will visit a number of European, and not only European, states. A total of four states will be visited, including Russia, Belarus, and the Czech Republic. I must say that a visit requires the consent of two parties, and if one of the parties does not deem it possible to visit, due to schedule complications, naturally you need to look for reasons. I can only express my personal ideas about this. You know that the United States was apprehensive about our Supreme Council's decision on the START I Treaty ratification and its attitude to the nuclear arms Non-Proliferation Treaty. However, I think this issue will soon be history. Top-level meetings between our presidents will take place, and it is only a question of time as to when and where. Whether Clinton will consult with Yeltsin on how to deal with Ukraine is hard to predict. I think there will be an exchange of views on the issue, but it is not for them to decide Ukraine's fate. Ukraine's fate is decided here, in Ukraine. [Marynenko] Esteemed Mr. Tarasyuk, according to a declassified CIA report, no country, except for China and Russia, possesses land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching U.S. territory. Tell us please why Washington raised such a fuss around nuclear arms deployed in Ukraine? [Tarasyuk] I know nothing about this secret [as heard] CIA report, but as far as I know from expert reports, there are intercontinental ballistic missiles in Ukraine capable of reaching U.S. territory, and this is a matter of special concern for the U.S. Government. It is actually SS-24 missiles that are capable of delivering warheads over such a distance. [Marynenko] I am sorry, again, here is something trivial but true. The button, that is, control over these nuclear arms and these SS-24 missiles, is in Moscow. Ukraine has no control over these arms and has no right to launch them. Excuse me, but why not put these claims to Russia as one of the nuclear states? Why put these claims to Ukraine? Moscow papers are publishing charts that show Ukraine's current nuclear potential allegedly several times larger than that of England, France, and China put together, etc., etc., etc. They emphasize how many nuclear facilities we have, how many warheads, etc., etc. For some reason one thing is ignored: It was not Ukraine as an independent state that built and maintained this huge nuclear potential, but that it is a part of the nuclear potential of the monster the former Soviet Union used to be. [Tarasyuk] It is absolutely true, Ukraine had and still has no operational control of the nuclear arms deployed on its territory. Ukraine cannot operate the launch of these missiles, and Ukraine does not seek such control, therefore, there are no grounds whatsoever to blame Ukraine for an allegedly posed threat. The so-called objectivity of the Moscow press, especially with relation to Ukraine, is all too familiar to us all. In this connection the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry press center issued a statement yesterday that emphasized the inadmissibility of the media of the Russian Ostankino television studios and Russian president's adviser (Migranyan) making such overtly provocative anti-Ukrainian remarks. Naturally, this is not conducive to the improvement of the atmosphere in the relations between our states; naturally, this does not improve the atmosphere for the settlement of these issues. But we must pay attention to the realities, and, whenever possible, expose false anti-Ukrainian campaigns in the media, especially concerning the fact that, as you said, Ukraine has no control over nuclear arms that, by a twist of fate, are based on its territory and in which the Ukrainian people invested a lot of labor, sweat, and money. They are based on our territory, and in order to make it clear that Ukraine does not threaten anyone, Ukraine has embarked on the process of deactivating, dismantling, and reducing the combat readiness of these missile systems. By this we shall prove our really peace-loving nature and show the entire world that it is not Ukraine that poses a threat. [Marynenko] Thank you, Mr. Tarasyuk, for your sincere opinion on the above problem. But let us come down to earth and, as they say, dot the i's. I mean the nuclear arms problem. It is simple. Russia now wants to become the sole owner of nuclear arms in our region. They took away, and some say stole, our tactical weapons -- for which Ukraine has received not a kopeck so far -- they took away arms from Belarus, Kazakhstan, etc. And now, using all possible and impossible, official and unofficial, means of influence over the United States, Russia seeks to take away nuclear arms from Ukraine. Or is that only an assumption? What do you think? [Tarasyuk] Well, I cannot comment on what Russia seeks. But I would like to say that we must not repeat the same mistake made when tactical weapons were transferred to Russia for dismantling and destruction. [Marynenko] Excuse me, let us talk about Ukraine's stance. Ukraine trusted Russia and handed over tactical nuclear weapons so as to receive compensation. Confidence, as international observers say, worked, but it worked only on Ukraine's part. [filing to be resumed after 1000 GMT 3 Jan] [Marynenko] Borys Tarasyuk, you said that some countries have already agreed to help us financially. Could you name these countries which are ready to help Ukraine in the reduction of its nuclear potential? [Tarasyuk] Everybody knows now that the United States has made a decision, and not just in principle, but has already decided to grant the first part of this aid in the amount of $175 million. Financial and technical aid has also been offered by the governments of Germany, Japan, Great Britain, and a few other countries, but negotiations on this are continuing. [Marynenko] Thank you, and with your permission I will allow myself to quote an interview by mathematician Muhammed Siddik Afghan, president of the Science and Research Center for World Philosophy and Mathematics. He is talking about Ukraine and its nuclear arms. I quote: Ukraine needs to keep nuclear arms, the scientist says, so as not to wind up defenseless before the West which, talking of security, is not eager to disarm itself. A weak state will not receive proper aid, either, the scientist believes. In any case, arms can be sold, and this is huge money which can be used to help the country's economy. What do you think? [Tarasyuk] I must say that this scientist's conclusions happen to coincide with the stance of the Ukrainian parliament, the president and the government of Ukraine which insist that the cost of nuclear warheads which Ukraine will be handing over for their dismantling and destruction must be compensated. There are no differences on this. As for aid to weak states, experience proves that it is weak states which receive such aid. It would be difficult to imagine a strong, not only in military, but first of all in economic terms, state which receives aid from somebody. Aid is give to a weak state, of course, or to a state which has found itself in economic difficulties, which is the case with Ukraine. That is why, I think, having no working economy, an economy without clear outlines on the one hand, and at the same time seeking to keep nuclear arms, without either funds or specialists or capability to maintain them, would be illogical, and in this respect one may not agree with the scientist. [Marynenko] Allow me to quote one more fragment of the same interview on Ukraine by Muhammed Siddik Afghan. He is convinced that in 1995-96 Ukraine will see the beginning of economic stabilization, and by the year 2000 Ukraine will become one of the prosperous countries of the world community. The only way out of the crisis, according to the mathematician's calculations, lies in close mutual relations among the countries of the former Soviet Union. Let me remind you that Mukhammed Afghan was the one who predicted a speedy end to the political carreer of Yegor Ligachev, in particular; he foretold that Gorbachev would be the last president of the Soviet Union and calculated Ukraine's independence back in 1990. Such are the predictions of the well-known scientist and mathematician. But the problem under discussion, the topic of our conversation with Borys Tarasyuk, chairman of the national disarmament committee and deputy foreign minister of Ukraine, deals with nuclear weapons -- so, nuclear weapons and one of the last questions, if you don't mind. Mr. Tarasyuk, quite often they maintain here that Ukraine is striving for a nuclear-free status and this is being asserted at different levels. In your opinion, what formula of this status now meets Ukraine's national interests best of all? A difficult question, isn't it? [Tarasyuk] May I clarify this question, if you don't mind? Ukraine is striving for a nuclear-free status and what form of this status is the best today for Ukraine? [Marynenko] Yes, yes. What formula of this status can be the best and the most beneficial for us today? After all, we are an independent, sovereign state. [Tarasyuk] Well, the decision on achieving a nuclear-free status in the future was taken in 1990. We know the political conditions under which this decision was taken. Taking this decision the Supreme Council of Ukraine reflected the opinion of the people of Ukraine which at that time still remained a part of the former Soviet Union. At that time this decision was perceived with great enthusiasm, and not only in our country but far beyond its borders. Eventually, Ukraine obtained genuine independence and at present it is building its independent domestic and foreign policies. The issue on the nuclear-free status arises from time to time during the discussion of the main issues of the domestic and foreign policies in Ukraine's parliament. I cannot recall even a single decision by the Ukrainian parliament dealing with this issue which would not confirm and would not contain a confirmation of Ukraine's intention to achieve a nuclear-free status. The question is when to achieve this status, during which period of time and by which way. Strictly speaking, it is on this issue that all experts now work on. Precisely this is the biggest problem now facing our state. I would like to say that the achievement of a nuclear-free status, in my opinion, is a lasting process which will require great effort, and not only economic or financial effort, but it will also require a balanced approach which would take into account all technical, ecological problems and Ukraine's possibilities and, in my opinion, the term stipulated by the START-1 treaty, namely seven years, is, in our opinion, a realistic term for achieving such a status. [Marynenko] Thank you. We have a rather difficult conversation today and the topic under discussion is very serious: the issue of nuclear armaments. And the last question, if you don't mind. When the Supreme Council of Ukraine ratified START-1 experts in the West paid their attention not to this ratification, first and foremost, but to those reservations which were made by the Supreme Council during the ratification. So, they said that these reservations completely destroyed the ratification and Ukraine would never fulfil the START-1 treaty. What is your opinion? [Tarasyuk] If one pretends he is deaf and turns his deaf ear to what had been said by the Supreme Council of Ukraine, then, of course, one can abandon hopes for any positive result and hence for the validation of the treaty and hence for the implementation of this treaty not only by Ukraine but by all the states, would-be participants in this treaty, in the provisions of this treaty. This is why I believe that the logic and reasons behind the reservations made by the Supreme Council of Ukraine now receive ever growing understanding throughout the world. Many scientists and representatives of governments and political figures point to the validity of the reservations made by the Supreme Council of Ukraine. This validity, the logical nature of these reservations made our partners arrive at the idea that it is necessary to work jointly so as to reach agreement concerning the search for mutually acceptable decisions which would help to remove these reservations. This is exactly what our government and representatives of Russia and the USA now work on. I think there are all grounds to believe that we shall be able [to reach mutually acceptable agreements] under condition that there is a search for compromises, the compromises which would be made not at the expense of Ukraine but with regard to Ukraine's national interests, only under such conditions is it possible to reach mutually acceptable agreements which will help us in the cause of persuading the Supreme Council of Ukraine that the reservations are being fulfilled.
