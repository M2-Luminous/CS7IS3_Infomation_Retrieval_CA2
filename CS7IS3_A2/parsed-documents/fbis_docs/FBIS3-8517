[passage omitted] The commander of a 150-man Company C Light Dragoons reconnaissance unit said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy leaders to sign "a disclaimer saying they would take responsibility" for the aid trucks and personnel if they entered the Maglaj area. The disclaimer meant that Serb troops would not be responsible if something happened to the aid workers. The commander, who spoke to AFP on condition that he not be named, said the UNHCR officials refused to do this. He confirmed reports of recent fighting in the area and said that he had himself heard from Zepce the sounds of up to 10 shells a minute falling on Maglaj which has been under a Serb siege since June. This matches reports from the mainly Moslem government's Radio Sarajevo which has spoken of days over the past two weeks when up to 4,000 shells fell on Maglaj. Several UNHCR convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj. The one blocked Thursday left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia last week and has been stopped at Teslic for several days. [passage omitted] Maglaj has not received humanitarian aid by land since last October. It depends on NATO airdrops of food but UNHCR officials have said the situation there is desperate. UNHCR director for Bosnia Larry Hollingworth was Thursday north of Zepce trying to arrange for the convoy, Croatian military commander for the region Niko Jozinovic told AFP. He did not say exactly what Hollingworth was doing. UN officials said requests had been made to Bosnian Serb military leader General Ratko Mladic in Pale, near Sarajevo in central Bosnia, to give the convoy authorization for Maglaj. Jozinovic said his HVO forces, which have positions between Zepce and Maglaj, were not involved in the fighting. He said, however, that Serb troops did pass through territory held by the HVO. "It is necessary to put pressure on the Serb side to end this war," Jozinovic said. He said the Moslem-Croat ceasefire in effect in central and southern Bosnia was holding for the Maglaj area as well. "In the next 20 days, this war will stop," Jozinovic said through an interpreter. Elsewhere in northern Bosnia, mine-clearing operations by UNPROFOR continued at the Tuzla airbase to prepare it for international aid flights. The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runway was also being swept while Bosnian workers dismantled runway lighting. Wednesday night was extremely calm, a spokesman for UNPROFOR's Nordic battalion said, following the firing of three mortar bombs on the town of Tuzla by besieging Serb forces which killed a man and his young son. Another UNPROFOR officer said there had been sounds of shellfire and automatic weapons from the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army lines some eight kilometres (five miles) away. In Zagreb UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams said no date had yet been fixed for opening the airfield, closed since the beginning of the war nearly two years ago, under an agreement concluded with the Bosnian Serbs. "We still have no definite date," said Williams. "There are still questions about possible presence of liaison officers on the airport, from the Serbian side and the Bosnian side." On Wednesday UNPROFOR's military spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Jean Marcotte, said the UN would like to start aid flights within a week, though new equipment for the airport to operate them would have to be flown in first. "Requests for equipment assistance have already gone out. We are pleased with the response that we've met to that," Williams said.
