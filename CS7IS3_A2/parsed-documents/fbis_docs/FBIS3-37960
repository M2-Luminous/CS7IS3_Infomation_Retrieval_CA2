The funeral ceremony was attended by Chechen President General Dzhokhar Dudayev. Georgia's first popularly-elected president was buried on the territory of his residence in Groznyy, where he spent most of his political exile after being toppled in January 1992. Last autumn, Gamsakhurdia returned to western Georgia in a quest to restore his presidential status, but his supporters were ousted from Georgia by the Army, which stood loyal to the existing Tbilisi government of Eduard Shevardnadze. Gamsakhurdia then reportedly took his life after being cornered by his enemies in a west Georgian village. Last Thursday, Gamsakhurdia's body was exhumated and air-lifted to Groznyy from western Georgia, where it had been temporarily buried in a secret place under a village barn by his close lieutenants. It was reburied here in conformity with the will of his next of kin. As Gamsakhurdia's widow Manana put it, the funeral in Tbilisi "would be most likely used by his enemies in their political aims." So Gamsakhurdia was finally buried with full military honours and now rests in peace. But for how long? His relatives and supporters join in the hope that the time will come when the remnants of the president are buried with all due honours in his motherland.
