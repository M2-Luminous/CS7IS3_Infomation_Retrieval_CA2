Among topics discussed at the meeting of the seven Central European presidents on Friday [8 April] and Saturday would be "how today, at the end of the 20th century, we can build a new `amber road' for people, ideas and goods from the Adriatic along the Odra River to the Baltic," Walesa said. Walesa will be attending the meeting, to take place in the east Bohemian town of Litomysl, along with the presidents of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Slovenia. He hopes the two-day event will open new prospects for European unity and kick off debate on the matter, he said. The countries of the Visegrad Four -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary -- have justified the existence of the group, he said: They have rid themselves of foreign soldiers, they have established close ties with the European Union, signed the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) and joined the Partnership for Peace project. "It could be asked: What would have happened if there hadn't been the Visegrad group?" he said. When asked for his views on Polish-Czech relations, he said the two countries had many aims and activities in common and managed to conduct good neighborly cooperation. "On Good Friday half a million Czechs crossed the border at Tesin. It delights us that they have reason to come," he said. At the same time many bad facets and absurdities remain in bilateral relations, remnants of the former communist regimes. "People telephone across the border by means of an international exchange; in a number of border towns the communal network has been artificially divided by the border," Walesa said. Despite this "border regions are prospering and trade is picking up," he said. Besides cooperation in the border regions, Poland and the Czech Republic should in his opinion carry out more joint projects. "That is the task of governments, which are already working on it," he said. "The possibility of contacts between the peoples, momentous in our history, allows negative stereotypes of Czechs and Poles to be overcome. All this allows us to talk about a new page in our relations and in the history of uniting Europe," Walesa said.
