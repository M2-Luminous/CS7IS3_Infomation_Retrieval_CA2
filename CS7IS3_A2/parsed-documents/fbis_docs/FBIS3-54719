It is probably on the basis of this memo that the president said recently that Rukh simply does not exist in Ukraine as a mass public political movement. We turned to Vyachslav Chornovil, a deputy of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet, for an explanation. [Chornovil] This document, which classifies parties according to one principle -- their loyalty to the president -- said: Rukh's potential is not above zero, except for some of the republic's western oblasts. The president was given false information. Our party is the largest democratic organization in Ukraine: We have 51,000 members and 2 million supporters, plus another 50,000 from "Memorial," the Ukrainian Students Union, and other associated organizations. The number of our supporters is steadily growing. We should give the powers that be their due, however: They help Rukh increase its influence in people's minds. The republic ranks second in the inflationary race of sorts. Yugoslavia is first, but there is war there. As for us, we may go to a situation that was characteristic of the Weimar Republic: They sat down for lunch at a restaurant at one price, but had to pay at another. [Romm] Do you see the woes of independent Ukraine as ineluctable? [Chornovil] No, but only under a different leadership. Our state was proclaimed independent by a communist majority in parliament, which feared retaliation for its support for the State of Emergency Committee. At present that same party nomenklatura is still in power. It adopted our slogans about statehood, although it did not want any statehood. It talks about democracy, although it had put us in jail for those same words. It keeps discussing reform, although it does not pursue it. [Romm] Monetary reform is also a possibility. They say that the grivna will be introduced next January. [Chornovil] I have also heard these rumors. God forbid that they should actually introduce it. The grivna with zeros deleted will be able to hold out for some time, to show some stability to the voters before the elections. Then it will slide downward, like the karbovanets. The grivna should not be introduced before carrying out broad privatization, selling land, and doing many other things that will back up the money. We could leave inflation behind in a couple of months, reverse the slump in production within 12 to 18 months, and reach more or less decent living standards in 5 to 10 years. Rukh has a clear-cut program to that effect. [Romm] Ukrainian Supreme Council Deputy Larisa Skorik, your former associate in Rukh, said to the parliament that Rukh lives on money from "Gurvits, a Jew." [Chornovil] I know Eduard Gurvits, chairman of Odessa's Zhovtnevyy district soviet, from the latest presidential elections. He campaigned for me. But he has not given us a single kopeck either then or now. At the same time, entrepreneurs in various cities give us their backing in the hope of seeing actual reform. At our latest congress, an organization called Economic Rukh was born. [Romm] How do you assess Rukh's chances in the March elections for the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet? [Chornovil] They are not great on account of the current election law. If the law were similar to the Russian one, Rukh, as the most significant party, could have won up to 30 percent of seats. [Romm] The Russian law cleared the path for Zhirinovskiy, though. [Chornovil] Ukraine does not have its own Zhirinovskiy, although his embryos have emerged in the Ukrainian National Assembly. It is well known that Ukrainian National Self-Defense (UNSD) fighters fought in the Dniester Region and Georgia. It is mostly unexceptional persons who will become Ukraine's parliamentarians. The law allows workers collectives to nominate candidates. State ownership accounts for 95 percent of the total in Ukraine. This means that it is directors who will win deputy seats. [Romm] But Leonid Kravchuk is not sitting on his hands either, is he? [Chornovil] I know that he is hand-picking his own candidates in 200 electoral districts through his administration. The president needs them so that they will vote for canceling early presidential elections. The Central Electoral Commission is acting according to calls from Bankovskaya Street, where the president has his residence. Hence its decisions.
