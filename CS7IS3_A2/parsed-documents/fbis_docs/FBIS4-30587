The deadline for the government to secure a place to permanently store radioactive wastes from domestic nuclear power plants is fast approaching. But officials at the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) are finding themselves increasingly helpless in the face of strong resistance from local residents who fear their `backyards' might be contaminated. Analysts warn South Korea may have to suspend its nuclear power generation around 2001 should it fail to find a permanent storage by the end of next year. Considering atomic reactors account for nearly 40 percent of electricity consumption here, suspension of their operations would deal a hard blow to national economy. In Korea, where the first nuclear power plant was built in 1978, nine reactors are currently in operation, generating about 4,500 to 5,000 drums of radioactive waste annually. The mountains of waste, however, have been stored at provisional facilities inside nuclear power plants, raising problems regarding safety and capacity. The government, keenly aware that the temporary depots will be filled before 2001, has desperately searched since the late 1980s for a region willing to host a waste dump. Seven coastal towns had been designated as candidate sites and MOST promised to redevelop the finally selected town into a comprehensive science and research complex at a cost of 760 billion won. The ministry also offered to spend 3 billion won annually on improving the welfare of the concerned residents. But each time the government's efforts ended in failure in the face of angry protests from Nimby [not in my backyard] activists. In the latest incident, the ministry early this month had to scrap its plan to build a dump site in Uljin, North Kyongsang Province, after residents there staged violent street demonstrations. Waste from the nuclear power stations is classified into two kinds according to the degree of radioactivity. Used nuclear fuel and substances reprocessed from the used fuel are called highly radioactive wastes. As Korea strictly abides by IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] regulations, reprocessed wastes, like plutonium essential to making N-bombs, are not produced here. Low-grade radioactive wastes refer to almost all kinds of throwaway items used at the nuclear power stations, including operators' clothes, shoes, gloves, and tools. A total of 43,700 drums of low-grade wastes have been produced by the nine reactors through April, occupying over 55 percent of the existing temporary depots, whose aggregated maximum capacity is 79,900 drums, the Korea Electric Power Corp. (KEPCO) said. Depots of highly radioactive wastes were also filled up to 57 percent of capacity. KEPCO has recently expanded Kori's storage capacity by 23,000 drums and taken other emergency countermeasures. Nevertheless, one after another temporary depot will reach saturation between 1995 and 2001 -- Uljin Nuclear Power Station in 1995, Yonggwang in 1999, and Kori and Wolsong in 2001, respectively. Considering that it takes at least six to seven years to build a permanent storage facility, the selection process has to be finished by the end of next year. On the other hand, the fact that seven more reactors are currently under construction adds to the seriousness of the problem. Furthermore, the Nimby syndrome is likely to intensify with the advent of the provincial self-rule system next year. Despite a series of studies confirming the safety of preserved radioactive wastes, the public doubts hardly show signs of abating. A recent poll found that 52.5 percent of the people have negative image toward nuclear-related matters and nearly half mistakenly believe that reactors can suddenly explode just like an atomic bomb. Shortly after the survey, MOST officials started to call radioactive waste "nuclear byproducts" in its bid to dispel the negative image. As part of the government's last-ditch publicity efforts, Science and Technology Minister Kim Si-chung had a mini nuclear waste dump installed next to his office in Kwachon last December. MOST once considered building a permanent depot on an uninhabited island or in an abandoned mine, but such plans turned out to be ineffective. If the government fails to meet the deadline eventually, even the possibility of "exporting" the wastes should be explored, a MOST official laments.
