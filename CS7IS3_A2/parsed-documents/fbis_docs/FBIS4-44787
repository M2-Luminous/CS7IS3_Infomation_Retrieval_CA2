Ministers of the member states are supposed to announce their decisions between now and mid-February. The European Space Agency [ESA] failed to reach agreement, at the 31 January meeting of the agency council, on retroactive adjustments to all mandatory and optional member-state contributions to the Agency's programs. This annual adjustment exercise is needed in order to compensate, after the fact, for the inevitable fluctuation of exchange rates between the time that contribution levels were established and the date when member-state payments were actually converted (into ECU, or European Counting Units). It is precisely the conversion to European money that poses problems for several member states, owing to the major devaluation of their currencies last year against the ECU, ESA's sole currency of reference. At the earlier council meeting of 18 January, the Agency had set the end of the month as a deadline for resolving the question, in order to be able to effectively continue its general operations and launch the new manned flight programs (Columbus and MSTP [Manned Space Transport Program], which were approved after differences between Paris and Bonn were ironed out (Cf. A&C No. 1456). But on 31 January, the "compromise package developed by the Agency's governing council to attenuate the effects of currency exchange variations and the introduction of the ECU" turned out to have "gone beyond the mandate of certain delegations," says Roger Elaerts, ESA spokesman. Council president Pieter-Gael Winters of the Netherlands therefore decided to "submit the compromise proposal directly to the ministers of all member states for their approval," asking them to "respond before mid-February." And so the 13 member states (plus Finland and Canada, as associated states) were given further time in which to agree to this compromise, which requires additional contributions by the "rich countries" to compensate for the financial constraints weighing on the "poor countries." More precisely, France and Germany (which benefited from a favorable revaluation of their currencies against the devalued ones) must increase their financial participation in order to lighten the burden on the disadvantaged countries--that is, the countries disadvantaged by the devaluation--namely Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom. So much for the short term, i.e., adjustment of this year's contributions by means of the Agency's compromise, which if accepted will imply de facto adoption of all the juridical language authorizing the start-up of the new Columbus and MSTP programs. These programs, according to R. Elaerts, have already been almost fully subscribed since the previous ESA council meeting. At the same time, the Agency's compromise proposes a new financial mechanism for resolving the long-term problem of fluctuations in ECU exchange rates. The basic idea is to scrap the current system (of payment in national currencies subsequently converted into ECU at the Agency) in favor of direct payments to the Agency in ECU, thus shifting to ESA member states the onerous task of converting their national currencies into European money. It would obviously be desirable--now that Germany has agreed not to insist on equal parity with France in these programs--to have a quick resolution of the adjustment issue, which for several months now has impeded Agency operations, especially start-up of the manned flight programs. France for its part now plans to pay for one-fourth of the combined cost of the two programs--100 million UC [Counting Units] towards MSTP and 24 million UC towards Columbus, whose 1994-1995 budgets are 207 and 270 million UC respectively. Ariane Probe On 26 January Arianespace, in conjunction with ESA and CNES [National Center for Space Studies], established a commission of inquiry to "establish the causes of the failure of flight 63." The commission is chaired by Jean-Paul Herteman, deputy technical director of SNECMA [National Company for the Design and Building of Aircraft Engines] (France). Vice chairman of the commission will be Eric Slachmuylders of ESA. The other commission members are Karl-Helmut Dederra of DASA [German Aerospace] (Germany), Mauro Varetti of Fiat (Italy), Jean-Paul Bozet of the University of Liege (Belgium), and Michel Pons of CNES. The secretariat will consist of Messrs. Thevenot and Lemoigne of SEP [European Propulsion Company] (France). The team is supposed to "present its initial conclusions in mid-February" and "recommend measures to be taken to correct the flaws identified" as responsible for the premature shutdown of SEP's HM7B engine. Flight 63 was the fourth of six unsuccessful Arianes in which the cryogenic propulsion system has been implicated (Cf. A&C No. 1457).
