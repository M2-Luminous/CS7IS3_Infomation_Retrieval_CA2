It was the biggest haul of heroin this year. Witnesses said three policemen smashed the door and a window of a two-story 1940s house in Hendon, northwest London. A Turkish man and a Briton from Finsbury Park, north London, were arrested. The raid, by Customs officers, police from the South East Regional Crime Squad and armed Metropolitan officers, followed a nine-month surveillance operation. Customs said the quantity of the drug was unusually high but it was not known whether it indicated a rising trend in imports. "The suppliers usually import heroin in a fairly steady stream of amounts between 20 and 30 kg," a spokesman said. On Tuesday, Customs officials seized 65 kg of cannabis worth more than £200,000 from a Cypriot-registered ship, the Akron Issos, at Hollyhead, Anglesey. The vessel sailed from Jamaica.
