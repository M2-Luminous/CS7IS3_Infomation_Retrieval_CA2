As he is a public figure subject to criticism, and as he openly expressed views affecting the nation and individuals, I will now express my opinion of his behavior. In listening to Minister Lacayo it was obvious that his unconscious betrayed him several times. On this occasion I will mention only two such moments. In answering a question about the problem of property rights, Lacayo said that "property belongs to the one who has it" and added: "What can be done is confisc...(then he corrected himself) compensate..."people who have been unjustly affected. Obviously, the truth came out unintentionally: that his government is confiscating from many people unjustly hurt by the Sandinist regime in favor of the Sandinists. He also mentioned being struck on his "two faces" instead of saying his "two cheeks." Here another great truth also escaped from him unintentionally: the autocratic face he displays inside the government and the face of a democrat that he unsuccessfully tries to show in public. In this program we could see what the minister is and what he is not. We again saw the arrogant and defensive man who intellectualizes his contradiction-laden answers. We saw him try to justify his mistakes without actually admitting them and without expressing any regret. We heard him say there was progress when what there is is unemployment and extreme poverty, and that the violators of the government program (the "reactionaries") were the members of UNO [National Opposition Union] and not Lacayo himself. We heard him say that he relies more on what people like Jimmy Carter, the "chinos" [not further specified], and international bankers say than on what his own Nicaraguan compatriots say. He said Violeta Chamorro is in charge, but he is the one who makes the decisions, who lives in close contact with the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], and that he makes concessions to the FSLN so "governability will be feasible," but this is not a co-government. He said he wants democracy, but will be happy to keep the totalitarian Sandinist Constitution until 1997, and he repeated many other contradictions as well. It is very easy for the subconscious to betray a person full of contradictions and manipulation. That is what happened to Minister Lacayo on Carlos Briceno's program. Antonio Lacayo is trying to construct a false political "center" based on erroneous situational ethics. He is trying to concoct an agreement between kidnappers and their hostages, between executioners and prisoners, between looters and the looted, as if nothing had happened. He wants to impose a reconciliation with injustice. He wants people to pardon their aggressors without the aggressors repenting for their crimes and without returning what was stolen. And to top it all, he wants the aggressor to retain a license to continue committing crimes. This "center morality" which Lacayo advocates is downright immorality. Minister Lacayo cannot be unaware that there are basic laws of life or universal principles that operate independently of the individual. Everyone has these laws and/or principles imprinted on his conscience. This internal voice tells us if what we are doing at any given moment is right or wrong. The minister should try to listen to the voice of his conscience. He will have to pause for a moment so he can concentrate on it, and reflect and meditate on what it is saying to him. One impediment he might have is the insane level of activity that has overwhelmed him, along with his pro-Sandinist political and cultural conditioning. These obstacles deaden his sensitivity to heed the voice of his conscience and so to comprehend how out of step he is with life's basic laws. I congratulate Carlos Briceno for being able to put his finger on the sore spot and for his skill as an interviewer.
