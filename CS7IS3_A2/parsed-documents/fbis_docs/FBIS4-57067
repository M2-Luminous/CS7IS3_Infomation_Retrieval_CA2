This happened a few minutes ago in the Pan-American Room at the Education Secretariat. Here Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, representing the president, swore in Pescador Osuna, and highlighted the work of Fernando Solana Morales as education secretary. By the way, I do not wish Solana any luck in his new political life and we shall hear why.

We all know the very long list of public posts that Solana has filled ranging from National Company for Basic Commodities to several state secretariats. In a few more minutes, Solana will become a senate candidate for a political party in accordance with the new electoral laws. To avoid committing any electoral crime, I will simply say thank you without any praise. [end recording] [passage omitted]
