Basically, however, it was a period during which we learned a lot. For all of us, today is a very important day. If we learned anything from this joint effort to give Nicaragua the national army our people have desired this century, it is that we cannot take these steps and accomplish these goals unless we work responsibly and with a spirit of unity and reconciliation, despite the difficulties. I believe this was the most important thing we learned during the period [four-second break in reception] President Chamorro [3-second break in reception] the commanders here present have learned. Understanding is vital at this crucial time for Nicaragua's future; it is vital to eliminate the climate of conflict, it is vital to give ourselves an opportunity to show that we want to understand each other; we must show our good faith and our willingness to help Nicaragua. In that manner, we will bury once and for all the climate of mistrust that prevents us from taking the first step to build the national unity the majority of the Nicaraguan people so earnestly need. The Nicaraguan people are currently suffering the poverty resulting from more than a century of underdevelopment, backwardness, war, and misunderstandings. In sum, the Nicaraguan people have travelled down a very difficult path [words indistinct] at this time when other personalities such as Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, Pablo Antonio Cuadra, and I have been trying to find venues of understanding, when only a few months ago some of us were receiving pensions. I therefore believe these steps show that it is possible to get together and reach an understanding; to join efforts and attain specific results. This is what the Nicaraguan people expect from their leaders and authorities. Today, on behalf of the Sandinist People's Army [EPS] I want to say that soon, through the Code of Military Organization, Jurisdiction, and Social Welfare, the EPS will become the national army we all want. It will be an army that, based on the necessary constitutional amendments, will have a name consonant with the new phase, while its current name will be historically recorded as an example [word indistinct] of its fundamental and patriotic values. I believe that with the steps and actions we have taken we will truly help our fatherland move ahead. Thank you. [applause]
