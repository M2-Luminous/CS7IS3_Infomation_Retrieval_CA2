FR941205-1-00035 FR941205-1-00014 46 CFR Part 572 [Docket No. 94&hyph;31] Information Form and Post-Effective Reporting Requirements for Agreements Among Ocean Common Carriers Subject to the Shipping Act of 1984 AGENCY: Federal Maritime Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The Federal Maritime Commission proposes to amend its regulations governing the information submission requirements for agreements among ocean common carriers subject to the Shipping Act of 1984. The Commission proposes to replace the current information form that accompanies newly filed agreements with a new form applicable to certain kinds of agreements, which requires the submission of specific data on the agreement member lines' cargo carryings, revenue results and port service patterns before they entered into the agreement. In addition, the Commission proposes regulations that require the member lines of certain kinds of effective agreements to submit reports on their operations on a regular and ongoing basis, which would reflect the lines' cargo carryings, revenue results and port service patterns after they entered into the agreement. The application of the proposed rule to a particular agreement depends primarily on whether the agreement authorizes its carrier members to engage in certain activities, and secondarily on the carrier members' combined market share. An agreement that does not authorize any of the activities specified by the proposed rule would still be filed with the Commission, unless it qualifies for one of the Commission's existing filing exemptions, but would not have any information form or reporting obligations. The intent of the proposed rule is to provide the Commission with improved information on the impact of concerted carrier practices on the foreign commerce of the United States, and to facilitate the processing and monitoring of ocean carrier agreements under the standards of the Shipping Act of 1984.
