[Agoston] This visit took place at a time when we succeeded in taking a big step forward in starting a dialogue between the Democratic Union of Vojvodina Hungarians [VMDK] and the Serbian Government. This visit confirmed the achievement and made it public in an interstate sense as well. This visit is also important because it is becoming increasingly clear that the international community is actually helpless regarding the Yugoslav crisis. Under these circumstances, we must create the conditions for Hungary to have advantageous contacts with Serbia after the lifting of the embargo, particularly in the economic sphere. After all, we are talking about neighboring countries and the relations between neighbors are sensitive irrespective of the international situation. [Kepecs] Has this visit made the Serb policy legitimate, a policy condemned by the entire world? [Agoston] Under circumstances when the international community is completely helpless, the visit of the foreign minister of a neighboring country, a visit dealing mainly with practical issues, does not affect the legitimacy issue. Only the international community can efficiently declare everything that happened in the past years as legitimate or illegitimate. [Kepecs] But there are also Hungarian grievances involved here! At the talks, Milosevic said that his government would not tolerate a situation in which anyone has to leave his birthplace. In the meantime, many Hungarians in Croatia who were driven out by Serbs are still not able to return to their homes! [Agoston] All I can say to this is that this issue must be solved at interstate talks. We accept the fact that the Democratic Union of Croatian Hungarians is the authority to decide on this matter. As far as I know, they work efficiently on making it possible for the refugees to return to their homes. [Kepecs] Has Jeszenszky's visit changed anything on the situation of Hungarians who fled to Hungary from military conscription, people who still should not return home? [Agoston] According to the VMDK, no one should be put into a disadvantageous position or on trial for refusing to participate in the civil war as a citizen of small Yugoslavia. If the recent domestic policy changes continue, changes that are positive for us, we can hope that it will be declared in the form of a state act that everyone can return without fear of reprisals. [Kepecs] Mr. Agoston! Do you agree with the opinion according to which Serbia has come out as a victor in this civil war? [Agoston] From the very beginning, we have been saying that we do not want to interfere in the historic debate of these people. This is only natural in our situation and the events proved that our position was correct. Of course, we can have individual opinions but, as the chairman of the VMDK, I would not like to speak about this.
