SUMMARY: Notice is hereby given that the U.S. International Trade Commission has determined not to review the presiding administrative law judge's (ALJ's) initial determination (ID) in the above-captioned investigation terminating the investigation on the basis of a settlement agreement. By its own terms, the temporary limited exclusion order issued in this investigation expired with the termination of the investigation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jean Jackson, Esq., Office of the General Counsel, U.S. International Trade Commission, telephone 202&hyph;205&hyph;3104. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On October 4, 1993, Space Systems/Loral, Inc. (SSL) filed a complaint and a motion for temporary relief with the Commission alleging violations of section 337 in the importation, the sale for importation, and the sale within the United States after importation of certain dielectric miniature microwave filters and multiplexers containing same. SSL's complaint alleged infringement of claims 1, 3, 7&hyph;11, and 14 of U.S. Letters Patent 4,489,293 (the '293 patent). The motion for temporary relief was limited to claims 1 and 14 of the '293 patent. The Commission instituted an investigation into the allegations of SSL's complaint, provisionally accepted SSL's motion for temporary relief, and published a notice to that effect in the Federal Register . 58 FR 60877&hyph;78 (November 18, 1993). The notice named Com Dev Ltd. (Com Dev) of Ontario, Canada as the only respondent. On March 17, 1994, the ALJ issued an ID finding that there was reason to believe that there is a violation of section 337 in the importation, sale for importation, or sale in the United States after importation of the accused miniature microwave filters. The Commission determined to modify the ID in one minor respect, and to affirm the ID in all other respects. On April 18, 1994, the Commission, having determined that temporary relief was warranted issued a limited temporary exclusion order directed against Com Dev. 59 FR 19210 (April 22, 1994). This action is taken under the authority of section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, 19 U.S.C. ยง1337, and ยง210.53(h) of the Commission's Interim Rules of Practice and Procedure, 19 CFR 210.53(h).
