Ahtisaari spent most of his time today in talks with Lennart Meri, his Estonian colleague. According to the Estonian political leadership, some light can be discerned in the talks with the Russians, to the extent that Estonia believes it will be able to solve the problem of the Russian soldiers with Russia bilaterally. This optimism is a consequence of talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev a few days ago and of the fact that Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin is due in Estonia next week. According to Lennart Meri, it would now seem that a mediator is not needed. Meri has also told this to President Ahtisaari. Meri said that Ahtisaari had, however, made a beautiful symbolic gesture by telling the Estonians that he can always offer the negotiators premises, light, and food, if they so wish. But according to Meri, Estonia will return to the mediation task after the last day of August at the earliest, if the troops of the former Soviet Army have not left Estonia by then. Ahtisaari's visit has taken place so far in a warm atmosphere. An Estonian daily even wrote that a new Ahtisaari era is beginning in Finnish-Estonian relations.
