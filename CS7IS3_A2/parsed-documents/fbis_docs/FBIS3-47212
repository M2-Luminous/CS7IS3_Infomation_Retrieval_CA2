The draft, obtained Monday [10 January] by KYODO NEWS SERVICE, said the step will be implemented from April "as much as possible" for public works projects sponsored by the central government and 85 public corporations, including the Japan Highway Public Corporation. Under the current system, only designated contractors are allowed to participate in bidding for most public works projects, a practice which has drawn much fire from the United States. Although the draft action program failed to specify the scale of projects which are subject to open bidding, it indicated that the minimum scale is 850 million yen if they are state-ordered. But the draft did not come up with a clear answer to a U.S. request for bringing down the size of projects sponsored by local governments which will be put to open bidding. The Japanese Government has proposed the threshold be 2.85 billion yen. The draft action program was submitted to a meeting of four concerned cabinet ministers earlier in the day before being reported to Prime Minister Morihiro hosokawa. It will be approved at a cabinet meeting on January 18, which will fulfill a Japanese pledge made last October to hammer out such a program early this year. The pledge was made in a bid to avert yet another trade row with the U.S., which has threatened to retaliate if Japan fails to take steps to increase foreign access to its construction market by October 31. The Japanese move helped soften the U.S. stance, persuading it to extend the original deadline to January 20. The draft plan has been worked out mostly on the basis of recommendations made late December by a government advisory body. As to public works projects concerning designing and consulting services, areas in which the U.S. has shown particular interest, the plan calls for the introduction of a half-open bidding system under which contractors selected in advance for their technological and other abilities will be qualified to place tenders. Government sources said designing and consulting works which will be covered by the plan will be worth 85 million yen or more. To prevent rigging and other types of malpractice, the program proposed the drafting by the Fair Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's antitrust watchdog, of guidelines on bidding by the coming summer. Under the plan, a cabinet-affiliated body will deal with complaints about bidding procedures and results. The program, however, failed to touch upon a proposal to halt preferential treatment as agreed bilaterally in 1988 for U.S. contractors in bidding for Japan's major public works projects. The sources said the failure to deal with the problem is due to differences in opinion among government officials.
