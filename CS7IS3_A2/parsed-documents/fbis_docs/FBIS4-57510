Orlando Lugo Fonte, president of the National Association of Small Farmers of Cuba, said in a speech at the Orlando Pantoja Agriculture-Livestock Cadres School in the outskirts of the capital that the main topics to be discussed are quality and increased production in agriculture. Fonte noted that those attending the meeting will take note of a report, experiences in which limitations in fertilizers, pesticides, and other raw materials to obtain good harvests have been overcome, reported on by the national Radio Reloj station. Those present make up the most productive sectors of Cuba in key areas that obtain convertible foreign exchange, such as sugarcane, citrus fruits, and coffee. The meeting was chaired by Jose Ramon Machado Ventura, member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba; Alfredo Jordan, minister of agriculture; and Nelson Torres, sugar industry minister. The agrarian reform was promulgated on 17 May 1959 by the foremost leader of the Cuban revolution, Fidel Castro, during a ceremony held in the Sierra Maestra, the principal range of mountains from where he lead the war of national liberation. The law modified the farm production structure, determining that areas encompassing over 400 hectares would become state patrimony and turning over land to thousands of bereft peasants.
