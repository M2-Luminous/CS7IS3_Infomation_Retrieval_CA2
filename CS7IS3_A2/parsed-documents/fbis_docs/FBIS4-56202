This meeting is the conclusion of an entire debate process on this issue and it will be in the hands of the ANPP deputies, as representatives of the Cuban people who elected them, to define the policies, the main paths of work that can be adopted to correct gradually the national economic imbalance. Just as planned [passage indistinct] of the issue at that moment and to take it up again in a special session, the delegates are better prepared in this instance and with the information obtained from a broad survey conducted by the union movement through the parliaments in the workplace process. Three million workers actively participated in over 80,000 workers assemblies between January and March 1994. Last December's ANPP discussion of these vital and controversial issues, which the mass media amply divulged to the people, was unprecedented and worthwhile. Even much more unprecedented is the fact that these issues were brought before millions of Cubans that discussed, frankly and openly, these issues and put forth ideas and proposals aimed at solving the complicated economic and financial problems that we face today. What place in the world can boast of having conducted a similar process? What parliament or parliamentarian can in addition to discussing and deciding on the matters that affect the whole of their population, also be aware of their people's opinions on these issues? I can go even further, which is worth noting the day before May Day, when hundreds of labor union representatives from all over the world have come to partake in the May Day celebrations and a number of them are invited to witness the debates of the ANPP: In what country are the workers or even their union leaders consulted on such crucial issues? What country or government would risk consulting their work force about such problems and ask for their opinions? In how many places have workers awakened to the news that those famous packages of measures had been implemented? In other words, neoliberal formulas to solve their financial woes at the cost of the more humble sectors. Tomorrow, when the ANPP deputies -- representing the people who elected them in true elections through secret and direct ballot with over 50 percent participation as regulated by law -- decide from their seat the policy to be followed to correct the financial situation, in a broad spectrum, a situation on which millions of Cubans have expressed our opinions, all of which have been taken into consideration, we will be taking one more step on the path chosen by a true majority of our people to resist and overcome the great obstacles we face and moving forward. What is decided at this meeting, it is good to repeat it, will not be a shock policy nor can we presume that all solutions will be popular although we hope they will have the understanding of the population. Absorbing the excess currency, as explained on other occasions, due to the drastic reduction of our capacity to import and the stiffening of the Yankee blockade, is an impossible task without a certain measure of sacrifice shared by all of us. Call it what you may: Increase in the price in some products, eliminating gratuities, establishing a tax system, reduction of subsidies to unprofitable enterprises thus reducing the budget deficit, and restraint and elimination of profitteering. In last December's ANPP meeting there was a favorable and broad consensus on these measures, the same as in the parliaments in the workplace. These measures are inevitable and needed to promote adequate conditions to be applied to our economy to subsequently solve the basic problems of the economy. We have started to work on this by implementing other important decisions; such as a reactivation of production, an increase in productivity, and improving economic efficiency. This will be done while preserving our accomplishments and, as Fidel said, safeguarding, above all, the interest of the people. This will be kept in mind, and the Revolution will not abandon anyone, this an indisputable principle. Tomorrow, when the ANPP special session commences, its deputies, invested with the highest responsibilities, will undertake their tasks as homage to Cuba's May Day, with the honor, sense of dignity, revolutionary and patriotic spirit of our working masses, their commitment to fight and save the Revolution and the accomplishments of socialism, and their amply proven political awareness.
