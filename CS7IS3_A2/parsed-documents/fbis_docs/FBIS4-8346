[Begin recording of unidentified speaker at the People's Assembly] As you have been informed, an incident occurred on the Albanian-Greek border on 10 April 1994 that ended in a tragic event -- two Albanian officers lost their lives, three others were wounded, and many others' lives were endangered. To honor the memory of the martyrs, these two youths who lost their lives in their prime, I invite you to stand up and honor their memory with a minute's silence. May their memory not be forgotten. The Foreign Affairs and Defense Commissions met yesterday to analyze this incident. They presented a draft statement to the People's Assembly, which, after being discussed in the presidency with the chairmen of the parliamentary groups, was later discussed in the parliamentary groups as well. I will now read this draft statement: The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania is deeply indignant over the unprecedented criminal act of 10 April that was committed by Greek terrorists against Albania's integrity and sovereignty. According to the official confirmation, at approximately 0230 a Greek terrorist unit of seven armed people dressed in Greek military uniforms entered Albanian territory near the Peshkepi village in the Gjirokaster district. Penetrating approximately 4 km, at a recruits training center two of them surprised and killed with an automatic weapon Arsen Llazar Gjini, an 18-year-old soldier from the village of Seman in the Fier district. After this act, four others entered the officers' dormitory while the officers were sleeping and opened fire on them. The 33-year-old head of training, Captain First Class Fatmir Sali Shehu, born in Tepelene and resident of Gjirokaster, was shot dead in this barbarous act. Three soldiers were wounded and many others' lives were endangered. While these inhuman acts were being committed, one of the terrorists shouted in Greek: This is for Vorio-Epir, do not think we have forgotten. After this act, the unit -- pursued by Albanian border guards -- left and crossed the Greek border. The direction of the pursuit proved that the unit came from the direction of the Greek post of Argjirohor. This was a premeditated act carried out by a criminal group, for which the Greek Government bears full responsibility. Such events on our border have been recurrent, despite the protests and careful stance maintained by our government. Under the present extremely tense situation in the Balkans, an escalation of such events endangers the progress of relations that exist between our two countries. Albania is a democratic country that respects all principles and known international norms in relations between states and is devoting every effort tries to creating a climate of understanding, peace, and equilibrium in the Balkans. However, such events run contrary to international and EC efforts for peace and stability. The People's Assembly of Albania asks the parliament of the Republic of Greece to see to it that the Greek Government bear responsibility for this act and condemn those responsible, as well as take serious measures to prevent a repetition of such events, which can cause unforeseen developments to the detriment of our bilateral relations and peace in the Balkans. We urge all international organizations to exert all their influence on the Greek parliament and Government for a rapid solution to this tense situation created by the Greek side. Deeply feeling the pain of the victims' families as a common Albanian pain, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania, the legitimate representative of the Albanian people, extends its deepest sympathy to them. By unanimously condemning and denouncing such a criminal act, the People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania asks that all Albanian citizens remain calm and mature in keeping with our people and the determination for the country's defense and the preservation of peace and good neighborliness. The People's Assembly of the Republic of Albania. [applause] Deputies, I invite you to approve this draft statement through a consensus. The statement, as I can see, is unanimously approved. [end recording] [Announcer] The People's Assembly will devote a whole plenary session to the discussion of this grave event at 1000 on 15 April, when Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi and Public Order Minister Agron Musaraj will address the deputies.
