Gen. Discua said the Armed Forces will attempt to submit the treaty for review by the Honduran Congress Defense Committee. The United States signed a military assistance treaty with Honduras in 1954 and, according to Discua, it currently benefits the United States. Discua referred specifically to the U.S. military base at Palmerola in the central department (province) of Comayagua, noting that it is important to examine whether it is appropriate to keep the base open in Honduras. U.S. assistance to Honduras has been reduced drastically in the past year, and according to Discua, U.S. assistance is conditional upon various situations and even includes sanctions.
