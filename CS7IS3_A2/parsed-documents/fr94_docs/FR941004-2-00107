A Federal Register notice published on January 27, 1994 (59 FR 3832), requested additional comments from the public on animal or plant species the United States was considering submitting as amendments to the Appendices. A Federal Register notice published on January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4096): (1) published the time and place for COP9; (2) announced a public meeting for February 22, 1994, to discuss the 31st meeting of the CITES Standing Committee; (3) detailed the provisional agenda of the COP; and (4) requested information and comments from the public on possible COP9 agenda items and resolutions that the United States might submit. A Federal Register notice published on September 1, 1994 (59 FR 45307), announced a public meeting to take place on September 14, 1994. A Federal Register notice published on September 6, 1994 (59 FR 46023), set forth summaries of proposed U.S. negotiating positions on species proposals that were submitted by other countries to amend the CITES Appendices and requested public comment on these proposals. A Federal Register notice published on September 7, 1994 (59 FR 46266), announced an additional public meeting to take place on September 16, 1994. The present notice complements the previous notices by setting forth proposed U.S. negotiating positions on other agenda items and resolutions for COP9, and requests public comments on these positions, which were also presented at the September 14 and 16 public meetings. Another Federal Register notice will also announce the proposed species amendments, resolutions, and agenda topics submitted by the United States. The Service's regulations governing this public process are found in Title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations §§23.31&hyph;23.39. Proposed Negotiating Positions In this notice, the Service summarizes proposed negotiating positions on agenda items and resolutions for COP9 (other than proposals to amend the Appendices, which are presented in the September 6, 1994, Federal Register notice discussed above). Numerals next to each agenda item correspond to the numbers used in the provisional agenda [COP9 Document 9.1 (revised)] received from the CITES Secretariat. However, documents for a number of the agenda items have not yet been received from the CITES Secretariat; they will be available on request from the Service after they have been received. A list of documents received to date were made available at the public meetings of September 14 and 16, 1994, and copies will be made available to the public on request. When information and comments on the agenda items were submitted in writing to the Service or received at the February 22, 1994 public meeting, they are included with the proposed negotiating position. Each proposed position includes a brief rationale explaining the basis of the position. The Service will endeavor to publish a Federal Register notice in October 1994 that details final negotiating positions on all issues pertaining to COP9, with the understanding that new information that becomes available during discussions at a COP can often lead to modifications in these positions. At COP9, the U.S. delegation will fully disclose all position changes and rationale explaining them. AGENDA (Provisional) I. Opening Ceremony by the Authorities of the United States of America The United States is arranging for a suitable ceremony in cooperation with the CITES Secretariat. Details of the ceremony will not be finalized until October, 1994. II. Welcoming Addresses The United States is arranging for welcoming addresses from appropriate officials in cooperation with the CITES Secretariat. III.
