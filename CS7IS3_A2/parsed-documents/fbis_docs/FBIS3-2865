This was disclosed by Geng Zhaojie, general manager of the China No. 1 Automotive Group, who is attending the ongoing session of the National People's Congress. "Red Flag" was first designed and produced in 1958 by the No.1 automotive plant in Changchun in northeast China's Jilin Province. Some years ago, the plant stopped producing the oversized, heavy limousine. Designing of a new model began in 1991 and was completed last year, Geng said. The new "Red Flag" is smaller than the old model, with two rows of seats instead of three, as was the case with the old model. Its body is shorter with an engine less than half the size of that for the old "Red Flag." The new model is also more fuel efficient with a high speed. The new "Red Flag" will be cheaper than "Audi," a German car being made by the same plant, Geng said.
