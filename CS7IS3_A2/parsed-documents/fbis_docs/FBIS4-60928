The authors of the articles are extremely reputable people and, in my opinion, their positions and their proposals must be taken into account by Ukraine's minister of defense and by President Kravchuk in their actions and decisions, as these people know the state of affairs and the situation in the Crimea best of all. Today, in the south of our fatherland and especially in Sevastopol, one can see the most intricate tangle of Ukrainian-Russian relations and contradictions. Let me remind you that, in many of its publications, UKRAYINSKA HAZETA foresaw this development of events in the Black Sea Fleet. More than once, our newspaper sounded the alarm that Ukraine's sea borders remain either totally defenseless or will, together with our armed forces, be occupied by our northern neighbor. Unfortunately, the leadership of the Ukrainian State thought differently. Nothing at all has been done by it to defend our sacred right to have our own navy and be a sea-faring power. On the contrary, everything was done in order to open channels for bringing this undertaking to naught. The most graphic example here is the removal from the post of Ukraine's defense minister of Colonel General Kostyantyn Morozov, who came out against the Massandra accords honestly, frankly, and openly. UKRAYINSKA HAZETA also wrote about this. To safeguard Ukrainian interests, General Morozov did not hesitate to disagree with the president, who was about to give Russia our entire Black Sea base. One can see now who was wrong. With the difference that General Morozov lost his post. Perhaps, our two supreme chief commanders [Kravchuk and Radetskyy] will pat attention to the hardships that the Ukrainian sailors are subjected to by the Russian "guests," more specifically, by the impudent masters of the situation." Nor do some politicians overseas pay attention to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. For example, at the beginning of April, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine W. Miller visited Sevastopol. For some reason, he rushed to meet with commander of the Black Sea Fleet Admiral Baltin -- Russia's plenipotentiary. This was confirmed to me by the Press Service of Ukraine's Naval Forces. It is also a surprising fact that nothing is known, neither there or in Kiev, about the objective, course, or results of the U.S. diplomat's visit. Who needs this game between two fires? I believe that this is interference on the part of a foreign state into our internal affairs. Living in our home and going to neighbors. This is the kind of independence we have. Everybody ignores us, and our own people seem to encourage such an attitude. It is on this matter that Vice Admiral Volodymyr Bezkorovaynyy and Rear Admiral Oleksiy Ryzhenko are sounding the alarm. It is to their credit that they risk their careers by caring about Ukraine's interests and tell us how our "sworn brothers," with whom we share the Black Sea, deceive us, and also demand that the leaders of our state return to Yalta Accords in dividing the Black Sea Fleet into Russian and Ukrainian parts. Unfortunately, very unfortunately, so it seems to me, their voices do not reach our president's ear, heart, or mind. Why does he keep silence and does not react to the cold-blooded injustice that the Russian military leaders perpetrate on our land? Today, Mr. Baltin only fulfills Russia's orders, introduces Russian symbols everywhere and dismisses, on various pretenses, those servicemen who have pledged allegiance to Ukraine.... Who is then the guest and who is the host? Who will defend Ukrainian sailors, expected to defend Ukraine? This is a paradox of an independent country. The country is dependent and it appears that so is its president. However, upon whom?
