The message says that as of now, Israel may participate in U.S. tenders and projects involving the launching of space satellites. The license includes access to American equipment and expertise. Until now, any such access was denied to our hi tech companies. This is a tangible expression of the United States' strong commitment to preserving Israel's qualitative edge, Clinton wrote in his letter, which was delivered by his team of advisers headed by Dennis Ross. It is estimated in Israel that the implementation of this decision will create many new jobs, most notably in the Israel Aircraft Industries, REFA'EL [Armament Development Authority], and the Israel Military Industries.
