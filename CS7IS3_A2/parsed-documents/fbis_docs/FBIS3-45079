However, the time limit was reached and the brook remained as stinking as before. Though a certain industrial and commercial inspection department makes great efforts in carrying out struggles against illegal hawkers, the latter continue to engage in swindling, cheating, and bullying. In the face of court decisions that have already taken effect, some plaintiffs still refuse to act accordingly. Though a ban has been explicitly imposed on businesses run by government organs, "renamed companies" still enjoy a flourishing business. Many departments follow the practice by which "policies are issued at higher levels while countermeasures are adopted at lower levels," and that "local policies and private treasuries can be found everywhere." All these are, in the terms of political science, different expressions of the loss of government authority. In today's China, the loss of government authority has posed a serious threat to the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and modernization drive. To counter such a situation, some leading comrades of local governments believe that safeguarding government authority, especially the authority of the central government, has become an urgent task at the present stage. Generally speaking, the loss of government authority takes the following three forms. The first form is refusal to act in accordance with the law. Law is a concentrated expression of government authority, and violations of the law mean a direct disregard of government authority. Punishment handed down to lawbreakers is a remedial measure to stop the loss of authority; yet if no punishment was given to violators of the law, or if the punishment is not heavy enough to prevent the reoccurrence of lawbreaking activities, government authority will suffer a net loss. The second form is failure to strictly enforce orders and prohibitions, which means that government policies cannot be carried out in an effective way. Policies of the government are an expression of the will of the government. Any deliberate delay, evasion, perfunctoriness, conclusion with nothing definite, ignorance, and intentional antagonism all mean violations and disrespect for government authority. The third form is the misrepresentation of government policies during the course of implementation. People who are in charge of implementation purposely distort the original meaning of government policies and make them more favorable to partial or individual interests. Under such circumstances, either government authority is retained in name but lost in reality, or part of government authority is retained while the rest is lost. The loss of government authority is a common political disease which is, in essence, refusal to act in accordance with the law and failure to strictly enforce orders and prohibitions. The consequences of this disease are more disastrous than the aftermath of having no policies and rules to follow. This is because this disease will dampen the efficiency of the administration; intensify contradictions between the government and citizens; weaken the ruling foundation of the government and the political recognition of the people; and finally lead to political splits, integration of the political power, and political turbulences in the society. Under such circumstances, what should we do to effectively check a huge loss of government authority? To answer this question, we should first find out the root causes leading to the loss of government authority. The source of loss of government authority, in the final analysis, can be traced along the following three lines: First, the deterrent force of decision makers. Whether or not government policies can be carried out is, to a great extent, determined by the deterrent force possessed by decisionmaking organs. It is from the following two aspects that such a deterrent is generated: The first aspect is the legal mandatory means adopted by government organs. This means that appropriate punishment should be handed down on those who refuse to show proper obedience. If decisionmaking organs fail to give appropriate punishment to those who refuse to show obedience, its deterrence force will disappear gradually. The second aspect is the legality of decision makers or, in other words, recognition of decision makers by those who are asked to show obedience. If people who are asked to show obedience do not consider the decision maker as the right person to represent their interest, the former will become rebellious and estranged from the latter; and when the right moment comes, they will disobey or violate the rules and regulations of the government. Second, the calculation of "cost-interest" by those who are asked to show obedience. During the course of implementing the policies and rules of the government, those who take political action generally have a sense for "cost-interest." If one is not punished for his disobedience of rules and regulations, or if his interests loss resulted from punishment for his disobedience is smaller than the interest he gains from his disobedience, he will tend to choose disobedience. On the contrary, if his interest loss resulted from punishment for his disobedience is bigger than what he gains from his disobedience of rules and regulations, he will often choose obedience. Third, the quality of policies. The quality of policies has a great bearing on whether or not policies can be implemented effectively. Generally speaking, we will find it hard to effectively carry out policies, rules, and regulations under the following four situations: 1) Incorrect policies. These incorrect policies will, beyond any doubt, cause damage to the interest of the whole. Therefore, though incorrect policies may be forced through, the results will be nothing but temporary. 2) Different policies drawn up by different decisionmaking departments. Facing different policies, rules, and regulations put forward by different organs on a same issue, subordinate organs will often find it hard to make a choice, for fear that they may follow one policy and lose sight of another. 3) The unpredictable changes in policies. If decisionmaking departments issue an order in the morning and rescind it in the evening, its subordinate organs will adopt a wait-and-see attitude instead of carrying the order through vigorously and speedily. 4) Conflicting policies. When policies, rules, and regulations are contradictory or inconsistent, subordinate organs will be at a loss as to what to do. A fundamental way of checking the loss of government authority is to enhance the legality and deterrent force of government departments through political structural reform and the building of clean administration, improve the quality of policies through democratization and scientification of policy decisions, and heighten the political recognition of citizens through effective political socialization.
