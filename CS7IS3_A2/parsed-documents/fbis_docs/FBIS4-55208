You will convey some of these signals. What signals can we expect in the near future? [Mitrova] We will indeed try to convey such signals, and Hungary is among our priorities. The Slovak Government adopted the law on population registration a few days ago, a law that makes it possible for national minority women to register their names without the Slovak ending "ova." I hope the Slovak Parliament will also adopt the law soon and that this will end the debate on this issue. I regard this as a really positive signal. I hope the issue of village and town names will also be solved soon. [Scipiades] What would you like to achieve as ambassador in Budapest? [Mitrova] I would like to contribute to the easing of tension prevailing between the two countries, a tension that seems to have already decreased slightly. I see possibilities for such an easing of tension. I think the most important thing for me is to create confidence. I would like very much to also receive positive signals from Hungary to our positive signals because this is very important for us to be able to come up with further positive steps. [passage omitted] [Scipiades] In your opinion, what effect could the Hungarian elections have on the Slovak election campaign or the elections themselves? [Mitrova] I very much hope that the Hungarian elections will only have positive effects. On both banks of the Danube, we came to the conclusion that there is no other solution but to seek and find a way adequate to both sides; otherwise, both sides will also hurt themselves. [passage omitted] [Scipiades] Do you see any possibility of opening consulates and some further border crossing points? [Mitrova] There are no serious obstacles whatsoever in gradually implementing these things. I cannot yet give you a concrete time, but these are natural things. [passage omitted]
