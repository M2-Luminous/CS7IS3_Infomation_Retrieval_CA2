In an interview with the Russian daily "SEVODNYA" (TODAY) issued on Thursday, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said that "I do not completely agree to Vitaliy Churkin," Yeltsin's special envoy in former Yugoslavia, who reportedly accused the Bosnian Serbs earlier this week of "duplicity" and of "abusing" Russian goodwill. Grachev stressed that the Bosnian Serbs had not launched any attacks on the Moslem-held town of Gorazde in the past "two days." He described it as "tactless" simply to charge them with violating ceasefire and launching attacks. The defense minister held both the Bosnian Serbs and Muslims responsible for the latest outburst of fighting and said air strikes were not the way to end the conflict. Regarding air strikes as highly dangerous, Grachev said 60,000 to 70,000 UN troops would have to be sent to Bosnia-Herzegovina to end the conflict by force, an option he said was out of the question since it would spark a large-scale war. According to the local press, both the Bosnian Serbs and Moslems forces renewed fighting in Gorazde on Wednesday only hours after the Serbs signed a truce with the UN to end their assault. After meeting with international mediators David Owen and Thovald Stoltenberg in Moscow on Wednesday evening, Foreign Minister Kozyrev told reporters that "Serbian attacks on civil cities, hospitals, Red Cross cites and UN observers in Gorazde cannot be justified." "They (Bosnian Serbs) violate the interests of Serbs themselves and Russia alike," the Russian foreign minister stated. He also stressed that Bosnian Serbs should understand that each step toward all-round halting of warfare will entail appropriate decisions on lifting sanctions. Both his and Churkin's remarks were seen as that Moscow had finally lost patience with the Bosnian Serbs, its traditional allies in the Balkans, over their continued attacks on Gorazde. However, Kozyrev stressed, Russia cannot agree with mounting air strikes by NATO (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization) forces, since this may only escalate tension in the region. Owen and Stoltenberg, co-chairmen of the Coordination Committee of the International Conference on Yugoslavia, arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for talks on Bosnian settlement. At a meeting of Russia's Security Council Wednesday, Yeltsin pointed out that force would not solve the conflict, noting: "Use of military force -- moreover delivering such strong air strikes -- without coordination in the UN Security Council is impermissible."
