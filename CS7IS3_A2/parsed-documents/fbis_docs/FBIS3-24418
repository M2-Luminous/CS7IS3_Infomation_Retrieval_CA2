Prior to his return to Tashkent, Mr. Karimov met with representatives of business circles and the Moscow intelligentsia at the Uzbek Embassy. The confidential discussion broadened the understanding of meeting participants of the current situation in Uzbekistan and of its leader. In particular, President Karimov stated... On Democracy and Democrats The Moscow newspapers are writing a great deal about Karimov allegedly using the bugaboo of fundamentalism to protect his authoritarianism and policies, about him being a reactionary. While at the same time they make no mention of the fact that in all of Central Asia it is only in Uzbekistan, in 1991, that presidential elections were held with alternative candidates in the running. I received 86 percent of the votes at that time, while Akayev and Nazarbayev got 98.5 percent. They are referred to as democrats, and I--as a postcommunist. When Akayev meets with Americans, he states that Kyrgyzstan is the bastion of democracy in Central Asia. Incidentally, had Karimov not gone to Kyrgyzstan on the eve of its referendum and supported Mr. Akayev, the latter would not have received 96 percent of the votes. Or consider what is going on in Turkmenistan. You see 15-meter statues of the leader with every step you take--the likes of which even Stalin did not permit himself. We have adopted a Constitution that underwent the most exacting expert review in many Western countries. Incidentally, the states of West Europe and America follow very closely what is going on in Uzbekistan. We have adopted laws on human rights, on citizenship, and on elections, that correspond to the norms of the democratic states. And we will attain the kind of democracy others only dream about. The fact that we are only able to do this some time after you have done it is a different matter. But I am a practical individual, a realist and pragmatic. I therefore often ask myself the question: Why inflict harm needlessly? Purely Personal I will admit that when they received me with full honors just now in Moscow and then transported me around the city in this grand "member-carrier," I did not feel good about it. Why so? After all, I have spent 40 years in Moscow and, like any visitor who walks, I know it perhaps even better than you. Before, when I was an economist and later minister of finance, I used to come here at least twice a month on official business with the Gosplan [State Planning Committee] and the Ministry of Finance. I would run all around the capital then with my briefcase, and each time would drop in without fail at Children's World. Usually I tried to arrive when the store opened, when there were fewer people, and would spend an hour or two here. I was familiar with all five floors of the store and knew what was sold in each department. After all, I have two little girls and I used to bring them everything from here... On Independence After the Soviet Union collapsed and we became sovereign, there was a period of giddiness with us, of euphoria. All of a sudden we all felt quite independent. In certain cases this independence turned into a fetish and people began to fashion grand plans around it. But life is cruel and it quickly demonstrated to us that simply declaring independence was not sufficient to achieve it. What is the point of sovereignty if our children will not live normal lives under it? Recently at an international forum in Davos, I sat next to Mrs. Bhutto, Mr. Demirel, Nazarbayev, and my friend the Turkmen leader--I forgot his name. Mrs. Bhutto, a strong personality, of course, compared to us, brilliantly rattles off English (I feel insecure in that I do not know foreign languages, though I did study English, German, and French in my time). So she began talking about the fact that since there is no Iron Curtain now and the Central Asian republics are open, we finally have the opportunity to make contacts with one another, integrate, etc. When I was in Islamabad I learned that many people there are starting to think that Pakistan will now be the leader in the region. It is very important, therefore, for us to feel that we have something behind us that will impart to us power and might. For Uzbekistan this pillar is Russia. He who believes that Russia can be written off is mistaken. We in Uzbekistan realize that Russia is a great power in every sense of the word. On Reforms I am an advocate of the reforms Russia is carrying out, and I fully support them. But we have different methods of attaining these objectives. Under our conditions, radical reforms are unworkable. Tell me, do we have the right, when 50 percent of the population of Uzbekistan are children, who cannot feed themselves, to tear everything down to its foundation and then, as the revolutionary song goes--"We will build a new world, our own world"? If we followed this course in Central Asia, you would see an explosion worse than what has occurred in Karabakh. You in Russia have gotten too carried away by these reforms and, as a result of their forced implementation, you have discredited the most noble intentions. But we have found the only proper way out--we have operated without "shock therapy" and have not been too quick to repudiate the legacy of the past. We have achieved a great deal. Whereas the decline of production as compared with 1989 is somewhere around 46 percent on the average for the countries of the former USSR, in Uzbekistan it is 12 percent. The drop in national income on the average throughout the republics is 34 percent, while in Uzbekistan it is just 6 percent. In short, our situation is much better than that in other regions. On Barriers We ourselves are inventing a great many barriers today that separate us from one another. For example, the expressions "near abroad" and "far abroad" have recently come into everyday use. These concepts appeared with you in Russia, not with us. Then too, it is not entirely clear as to just what criteria are used to categorize certain countries with the "near abroad" and others with the "far abroad." For example, why is America, with whom you have developed fairly warm relations, considered the far abroad? In the same manner, I do not really perceive the concept "Russian-speaking population." Whom does this term include--just Slavic peoples? But then, where do you place me, a person who has completed Russian schooling and who speaks Russian? The Russian language has always united us--now we seem to be turning it into a watershed. Nazarbayev and I resisted right up to the end the departure of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan from the ruble zone. I said that the most terrible consequence of this step would be the fact that millions of people would feel alienated from Russia. And this is in fact what happened. Today Belorussia [Belarus] and Russia want to create a unified monetary system. I think this is proper, but it should not be confined to a union between Belorussia and Russia. This garment should be thrown out to all the countries of the former USSR.
