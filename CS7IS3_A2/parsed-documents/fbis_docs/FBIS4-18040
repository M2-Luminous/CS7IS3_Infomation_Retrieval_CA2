According to him, his ministry has already requested Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry to inform it urgently of what Suprunyuk is charged with, as well as of investigation and other actions taken against him. As Karasin said, Alma Ata [Almaty] "has resorted to the thesis that Suprunyuk must be subjected to psychiatric examination." "This cannot fail to evoke memories of the notorious methods of combating dissent. Nevertheless we hope that the Kazakh authorities will display an objective and unbiased approach, that they will be guided by their commitments in the area of human rights, including those made in the framework of the CSCE," Karasin said.
