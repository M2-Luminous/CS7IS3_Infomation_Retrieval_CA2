FBIS4-52865 "dreas094_j_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-094 Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 Indonesia * Paper Reports on Combat Aircraft Capability * Paper Reports on Combat Aircraft Capability 94SE0103A Jakarta SUARA KARYA in Indonesian 22 Mar 94 pp 3, 8 94SE0103A Jakarta SUARA KARYA Indonesian CSO [Text] Indonesia now has Air Combat Maneuvering Range (ACMR) fighter training facilities using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology, which is capable of monitoring the movements of fighter planes at all positions within its range. The ACMR facilities built at the Pekanbaru Airfield in Riau are one type of bilateral cooperation between the Republic of Indonesia Armed Forces (ABRI) and the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF). Plans are for ABRI's Commander in Chief and Singapore's Commander of Defense Forces to dedicate the ACMR Building today (22 March); the ministers of defense and security (MENHAN) of the two countries will sign the inscription and cut the ribbon. Dr Yeo Ning Hong, Singapore's Minister of Defense, accompanied by the secretary general of Singapore's Ministry of Defense Lim Siong Guan, by Air Force Chief of Staff Brig Gen Bey Soo Khiang, and by Navy Chief of Staff Commodore Kwek Sien Jin, were in Jakarta yesterday to meet with a number of Indonesian officials, including Minister of Defense and Security Edi Sudradjat. Plans are for the group of Singaporean defense and security officials to leave for Riau this morning together with a group headed by the Minister of Defense and Security of the Republic of Indonesia to attend the ceremony dedicating the ACMR Building at the Pekanbaru Airfield. In yesterday's meeting at the Department of Defense and Security, Edi Sudradjat and Yeo Ning Hong discussed technological developments in the field of defense and security, in particular the development of aerospace technology. The two ministers of defense and security also discussed efforts to increase cooperation between the two nations. ACMR Excellence The purpose of constructing ACMR training facilities in Pekanbaru is to increase the skills and quality of training in air firing for ABRI and RSAF fighter pilots, who up to now have gotten firing training from the air or at the Air Weapon Range (AWR) in Siabu, Riau. The ACMR facilities are equipped with Air Borne Pod training equipment made available by the Singapore Air Force. The Air Borne Pod equipment is located on the undercarriage of the fighter planes, which allows the maneuvers made by the fighter planes in the vicinity of Pekanbaru to be captured by the Satellite and Radar Tower Erection and by Real Time Tracking and Positioning (RTTP) monitored on Base Control Debriefing Station (BCDS) screens. This ACMR system is capable of monitoring fighter planes within a fixed radius of the AWR Siabu region. Air Force KADISPEN [Head of Information Services] Col J. Paryanto told reporters recently that the ACMR is able to monitor aircraft movements within a radius of about 100 miles. In addition, the ACMR is also able to monitor interception and firing movements carried out by the plane and at the same time give the fighter pilot guidance, instructions or corrections from the display room. The ACMR is also able to record all of fighting maneuvers in the air, which allows the collection of more concrete and accurate material for discussion by the fighter pilots. It is said that these two air-borne capabilities will have a positive effect on reducing the cost of firing training. It is well known that the ACMR used by Indonesia and Singapore has more reliable monitoring capabilities than the ACMR used by the United States, Japan, Korea and Thailand, which are only able to monitor the movements of planes in positions which have already been determined. Up to now joint Air Force training, especially with Thailand, has used Thailand's monitoring equipment, the Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI).
