FBIS4-60575 "drnes102_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 SYRIA Daily Rejects Peres' Statement on Normalization Daily Rejects Peres' Statement on Normalization JN2605082194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 26 May 94 JN2605082194 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Press review] [Text] Under the headline "Peres' Statement and the Israeli illusion," AL-BA'TH says: The Israeli officials' contradictory statements on peace and the terms of reference of the peace process continue. The latest of these statements was made by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. Yesterday he asked Syria to normalize its relations with Israel, and emphasized that the normalization process should have begun with the negotiation process. AL-BA'TH adds: This means that Peres wants normalization before the Israeli withdrawal from the occupied land. It is not ruled out that Israel wants normalization of relations while our land is under occupation. The statements by several Israeli officials, especially Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and Peres emphasize this fact. It says: In their statements, Rabin, Peres, and others have so far not referred to full withdrawal from the Golan, but they always and only emphasize withdrawal in the Golan. This emphasizes that Israel wants the peace process to entrench its occupation of Arab land, and then the Arabs should normalize relations with it. By this, Israel would have both peace and land. This is what Israel seeks through deeds, not words. The newspaper stresses that these statements do not benefit the peace process, but are directed against it. The Israelis are mistaken if they believe Syria may give up its declared policy on the peace process. The newspaper says: Syria's acceptance to participate in the peace process stemmed from its clear principles and constants, based on implementation of resolutions of international legitimacy and the land-for-peace principle. The newspaper stresses that full and comprehensive Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories is unnegotiable as a condition for continuing the peace process with all its details. The newspaper speaks about the Israeli policy which depends on maneuvers and evasion of the requisites of the peace process, and says: That policy is totally rejected by Syria. Syria always emphasizes that the basic condition for achieving a just and comprehensive peace is Israel's full withdrawal from our occupied land. Short of this, the peace process will continue to be stalemated. The newspaper warns against the Israeli maneuvering policy because it will lead the peace process to a dead end, which is what Israel seeks. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: Israel should remember that the conflict is continuing and resolving it will not be easy. It is time for Israel to be aware that there will be no peace, security, and stability in the region while our Arab land is occupied.
