The unions, however, called the strike "a success." There were no violent incidents during the strike. Official sources report that the central government has approximately 180,000 employees, with another 100,000 from decentralized institutions. Meanwhile, the government called the protest movement intended to undermine the referendum a "failure." If approved, it will make possible reforming the Constitution to hold the parliamentary elections ahead of schedule, change the Supreme Court of Justice magistrates, and reduce the president's term from five to four years. Government Minister Arnoldo Ortiz has reported that work in government institutions is proceeding normally, with the exception of two or three of them. Ortiz said the union leaders made the mistake of calling the strike for political reasons rather than labor-related reasons and this is what caused the strike to fail. Armando Sanchez, secretary general of the National Federation of State Workers Unions, told the press that 90 percent of the workers went on strike and that the protest will be resumed Monday if their demands are not met.
