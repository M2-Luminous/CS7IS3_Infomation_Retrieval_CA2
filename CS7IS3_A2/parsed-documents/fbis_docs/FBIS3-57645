Just recall the historic ruling establishing the adversary nature of the process, the direct appeal to legislators to remove a deficiency in legislation, and the direct references in judicial documents to the Russian Constitution. New ground in judicial practice was also broken during the cross-examination of Marshal Dmitriy Yazov. It is well known that, following Yazov's arrest at Vnukovo-2 Airport, the marshal was cross-examined 22 and 30 August 1991, first as a suspect, then as a defendant, without the participation of an attorney. (Incidentally, the videotape of these very cross-examinations turned up in the hands of crafty journalists from DIE SPIEGEL in mysterious, and, quite possibly, criminal circumstances.) Yazov's defense attorneys, Nikolay Pechenkin and Lev Abdeldyayev, asked the Military Collegium to exclude the record of these examinations from the range of evidence being discussed in the judicial process. However, the state prosecution persistently returned the accused marshal to the evidence that he gave to the Prosecutor's Office investigators in the absence of a defense attorney. In other words, the question arose of the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the law. Formerly, the courts endeavored to ignore such problems, which are of a theoretical rather than a substantial character. The Russian Federation Supreme Court Military Collegium under the chairmanship of Anatoliy Ukolov invervened and issued the following ruling: "The suspect or defendant in a criminal case has the right to have a defense attorney either from the moment the charge is filed, or from the moment of detention or the use of preventive restrictions amounting to arrest. Evidence obtained from a suspect or defendant in violation of this right to a defense attorney has no juridical force and cannot be used to prove the charge leveled." This means that yet more holes have appeared in the indictment against the members of the SCSE and their associates. At the very least, the court has forbidden the subsequent use of evidence given by Yazov 22 and 30 August 1991 and the examination records compiled as evidence on this basis. According to an ITAR-TASS report, the former head of the Union miltary department admitted the unconstitutionality of measures employed in August 1991 against Mikhail Gorbachev, former head of the USSR, and also the actual creation of the USSR SCSE. However, Yazov, referring to the reality of the collapse of the unified state, again stressed the forced nature of the top USSR party and state leaders' actions at that time. According to Yazov no combat orders were given to the military formations sent into the capital; an instruction was given only to place the Armed Forces on combat alert. The examination of Dmitriy Yazov continues.
