Nemtala said that Poma was arrested following relentless investigation by the state's intelligence services. He declined to provide further details or the place where Poma is being held. The EGKT began its terrorist activities in July 1991, with the "bombing" of two high tension pylons in the Alto Lima zone of the city of El Alto. Poma reportedly participated in this attack, which claimed the life of an EGKT member. The organization then perpetrated a number of attacks leading to the arrest of top leaders: the brothers Raul and Alvaro Garcia, who are jailed in the Chonchocoro prison, and Felipe Quispe, known as "El Mallku," among others. The state's intelligence services are searching for Carlos Lara, who is considered to be a member of the EGTK "general staff."
