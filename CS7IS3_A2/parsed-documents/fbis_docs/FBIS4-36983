This was stated yesterday by Foreign Minister Velayati who is in Germany. Velayati also described his two-day talks with the German chancellor and other high-ranking German officials as useful and constructive. Velayati, who was speaking during an interview with the Central News Unit correspondent in Bonn last night, referred to the noteworthy developments in Tehran-Bonn relations during recent years and said: These relations can be used as a good example for other European countries concerning bilateral relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Velayati said that main points of his discussions with German officials during this visit included the formation of a joint economic commission next fall, the continuation of cooperation in international forums, Germany's more active participation in Iran's Second [Five-Year] Economic Plan, the formation of the two countries' cultural assembly, and parliamentary cooperation between Tehran and Bonn. The foreign minister said that the regular contacts between the Iranian and German heads of state over the past two years have constituted an important element in advancing the two countries' relations. Commenting on the impact of Iranian-German relations on global and regional developments, Velayati said: [Begin Velayati recording via telephone] Iranian-German cooperation has gone beyond bilateral relations and has assumed regional and international dimensions. As the current head of the ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization], and as current head of united Europe, Germany will hold talks in the future on cooperation between these two regional bodies. Europe, with its greater experience and vast dimensions of cooperation, and Iran -- especially after the expansion of ECO, which is a young organization -- can use Europe's experiences, and cooperation between the two organizations will be extremely positive and constructive. We have agreed to hold a joint session next fall in New York with the troika on the foreign ministerial level. The troika is actually the presidency of the European Union and consists of former, current, and future foreign ministers of countries acting as EU presidents. They participate in meetings with other countries and actually mold the European Community's foreign relations. [end recording]
