Mohamed Salah Dembri delivered a message from Algerian President Liamine Zeroual to President Konare. His discussions with the Malian leaders centered on the internal situation in Mali and Algeria and on major subregional issues. [Paris AFP in French at 0802 GMT on 9 March, in a Bamako-datelined item, adds: "Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare held talks yesterday with Algerian Foreign Minister Mohamed Salah Dembri on the Tuareg issue. Their talks focused mainly on obstacles to the implementation of the national peace pact signed in April 1992 between the Malian Government and the Unified Movement and Front of Azaouad, MFUA, whose guarantor is Algeria. MFUA has called for Algerian participation in a meeting in Bamako on the integration of former rebels into the regular Malian Army. This appeal comes at a time when divisions within the Tuareg movements who signed the peace pact have led to the death of four Tuaregs including Colonel Bilal Saloum, one of the main architects of the peace pact."]
