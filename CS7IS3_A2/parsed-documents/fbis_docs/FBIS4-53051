The government has established a "Liaison Council for Coordinating Construction of Information Infrastructure Relative to Asian Regional Development," chaired by MPT International Department director Yoshio Uchimi and comprised of 11 companies such as Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and NEC and three academics. The council will participate in the joint preparation of development plans with target nations and promote participation in various projects. The initially targeted area will be China and the Shanghai region and on-site surveys will start in the first part of June. It aims at recovering ground lost in the area of infrastructure construction to European and U.S. firms because of a late start. The liaison council will also see the participation of Fujitsu, Taisei Construction, Mitsui and Company, and the Sakura Research Center. Other members will include three academics such as Hitotsubashi University professor Takayuki Itami and government-affiliated agencies such as the Japan Export-Import Bank. If the projects go smoothly and other organizations desire to join the council, additional memberships will be approved. In practice, a joint research forum will be established with the target nation under the auspices of the MPT for the purpose of conducting integrated studies on the need for communication services, status of policies and actual construction work and overall regional effect of projects. Upon completion of such studies, the Japanese representatives will propose a communication infrastructure construction project which encompasses factors such as installation of public telephones, cellular communications and satellite communications which are compatible with local conditions. In so doing, MPT intends to implement government aid as well as to assist in the winning of bids for pending projects. The reason why China was selected as the first target area was that when Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Koizumi visited China in May 1993, Japan was formally requested to extend aid under a plan which visualized the installation of 100 million telephones by the year 2000, or twice current levels, and which brightened the prospects for major construction projects. In the future, the MPT hopes to expand candidate areas beyond China to include Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. Participation of Japanese firms in the construction of communications infrastructure in the Asian region had lagged in the past. A look at the supplier records of digital switching equipment destined for China shows that NEC and Fujitsu rank third and fifth respectively and that the combined share of the two firms is 20 percent. While European firms hold the first and second ranking positions, U.S. firms which had lagged just like Japanese firms are now beginning to win major projects. The recent MPT projects to extend assistance to the private sector could very well invite criticism from Europe and the United States that, "Such efforts could distort private-sector competition."
