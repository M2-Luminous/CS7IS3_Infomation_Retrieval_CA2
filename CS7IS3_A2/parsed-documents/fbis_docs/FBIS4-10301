Mike McCurry, spokesman for the U.S. State Department, said that the U.S. Government will continue denying U.S. entry to those Cubans who use third countries to achieve that purpose. McCurry pointed out that U.S. immigration policy will remain unchanged, while defending the decision of the U.S. Coast Guard to return to the Bahamas 19 Cubans who on 12 April tried to enter U.S. territory from those Caribbean islands. The U.S State Department spokesman admitted that crossing the sea by Cubans who abandon the island in boats or fragile vessels is not safe, but is a threat to their lives. Cuban authorities, on the other hand, believe that Washington encourages the illegal departure of Cubans by breaking the migration agreements that establish a concession of up to 20,000 visas per year. Wayne Smith, former head of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana and an expert on Cuban issues, from the International Center for International Policies, stated that the U.S. Government has even systematically denied visas to people who have traveled to the United States in the past.
