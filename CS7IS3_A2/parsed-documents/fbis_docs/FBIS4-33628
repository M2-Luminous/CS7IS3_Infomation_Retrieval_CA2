Toussaint, justice minister in the provisional government. Toussaint assured the audience that restoring government authority, reforming justice, and reducing the cost of living will be Justice Ministry priorities and discussed the Ministry's meager resources at the current juncture. [passage omitted] "Senator Romel Manigat, president of the upper chamber's justice commission, painted his own picture of the Haitian justice system in a five-page address in French, saying he believes it is on crutches and even paralyzed. He pointed an accusing finger at judges he claims are selling justice at will." [passage omitted] "Toussaint thanked the president of the unofficial Senate office. He did not refrain from turning the pages of Haitian history, saying that the country is currently passing through the gravest moments in its history. The minister summarized four points on which they should work so that the justice department can function properly and that legal order can be restored." [passage omitted] "We will work to reform Haiti's judicial system even though the task will not be easy, Toussaint said as Senator Yves Rousseau was taking a nap in his seat. Senator Dupiton had a quiet laugh when Toussaint said that the one who asked for 10,000 people instead of 7,000 people to enter Haiti within the scope of the UN Mission in Haiti should be arrested. The Ministry he leads lists as its priorities: salaries, the cost of living, economic stabilization, and the restoration of government authority. Unfortunately, they may be biting off more than they can chew. It is a provisional government, not a definitive government."
