In a statement to AL-RA'Y, Dr. al-Iryani specifically said: We are ready to negotiate with any of the YSP leaders within the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 924, which invites those concerned from the Yemeni parties to search for peaceful solutions to the Yemeni problem. He said that the word "concerned" includes leaders from the YSP. Al-Iryani said that the delegation which will leave for Cairo to seek a solution to the current crisis comprises an equal number of members from the three parties which participate in the coalition government: the General People's Congress, the Yemeni Reform Grouping, and the YSP. Al-Iryani, who was preparing to leave for New York to pursue the search for a solution to the his country's crisis, said : I am going to New York to see what the Americans and the Saudis have in their quiver. The Yemeni minister, who is close to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, did not elaborate on what other steps he believes the UN Security Council could adopt on the Yemeni crisis. However, he voiced extreme anger toward Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid's recent statement warning that the UN Security Council will impose sanctions on the Republic of Yemen if the cease- fire is not respected. Al-Iryani said that by making such a statement, Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has exceeded his authority as Arab League secretary general. The Yemeni minister said: I am surprised that the Arab League secretary general steps forward to condemn an Arab League member. He added: The only time we heard similar language was during the second Gulf War. Al-Iryani called on Arab League officials to act within the Arab League's framework. Addressing the Arab League secretary general, al-Iryani said: 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid does not have the right, nor is it his duty to act as an agent for issuing UN resolutions against the Republic of Yemen or any other Arab state. The Yemeni planning minister said that his government wishes to reach a peaceful settlement of the Yemeni problem to avoid further losses resulting from the war against the YSP. He added: However, we will continue to resort to force if the YSP leaders adhere to their intransigent stands against the Republic of Yemen's constitutional legitimacy. He announced that the Yemeni forces will enter Aden and al-Mukalla by force if no peaceful settlement is attained. He added: I do not know of any country in the world which, faced with this situation, would not resort to force. He condemned those who try to impose a veto on the Yemeni forces entering Aden. He said: Those who impose a veto should submit a political alternative. He said: We act on the territory of the Republic of Yemen and we totally reject that they tell us not to do so. The Yemeni planning minister seemed confident of military victory and restoring the rule of legitimacy to the entire Republic of Yemen territory.
