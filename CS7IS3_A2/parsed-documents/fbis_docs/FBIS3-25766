Speaking before a crowd of 10,000 which filled Umtata's Independence Stadium for the funeral of Apla commander Sabelo Phama, Daniels said attempts to establish a volkstaat [Afrikaner homeland] amounted to provocation. Daniels said the "absurd boerestaat" [Boere state] advocated by General Constand Viljoen could be regarded as "provocation for the continuation of the war." "The moratorium on armed struggle declared by the PAC -- and fully endorsed by Apla -- was not a defeat of the freedom fighters. We are political fighters giving the masses of Azania the chance to decide their own form of government. So to Apla fighters, we say: be ready, be on the alert, sharpen your weapons for any eventuality by the enemy, be combat-ready. We are heading for bitter times." [passage omitted]
