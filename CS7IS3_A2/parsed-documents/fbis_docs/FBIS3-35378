Security forces were slow in responding to what started as a peaceful march to the downtown embassy, where demonstrators wanted to protest the killing of three of their countrymen at the Afghan embassy in Islamabad. Two badly beaten and bleeding Pakistani staffers narrowly escaped a lynching when they were dragged outside by the enraged crowd. Another beaten man and two physically unhurt but severely shocked staffers were escorted out of the building after the arrival of security forces. On arrival the demonstrators, after yelling insults at the embassy, quickly became emboldened and began throwing rocks at windows, then wrenched the brass name-plaque from the embassy wall and smashed it. Soon after a wild stream of Afghans began climbing the sandbags lining the embassy walls for protection against incoming artillery, and began sacking the premises. "The Pakistanis disgraced our embassy in Islamabad. This is our response," one demonstrator told AFP. "We are determined to have our revenge for our three killed countrymen," another of the furious demonstrators added. Three Afghan gunmen, who held children hostage in the Afghan embassy in Islamabad, were killed Monday when Pakistani commandos assaulted the diplomatic compound.
