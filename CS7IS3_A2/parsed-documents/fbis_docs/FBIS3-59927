[passage omitted] At the request of journalists Leonid Kravchuk commented on the standing down of 17 SS-24 missile complexes. "This does not violate the law," he said. "The law stipulates removal from Ukrainian territory; this way the missiles are in the silos but the warheads have been dismantled. Why should they be on standby when the nuclear button is actually in Russia? It is better to stand them down: This way they will not be used by anyone." Compensation and security guarantees will be stipulated in a trilateral agreement between Ukraine, Russia, and the United States.
