In his opinion, the efforts of both the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] and the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] are directed toward a continuation of market reforms. This is a "good message" for the international world of finance, as well. "The reestablishment of macroeconomic balance, that is to say, stabilization, is central to the economic policy of both parties, and this is compatible with the MNB's monetary policy," the vice president said, who felt it necessary to emphasize that the central bank was a neutral organization, independent of the government, but that it had to adjust its monetary policy to the economic policy of the government in power. As he put it, the MNB was the supreme guardian of monetary policy, but it could not perform miracles if the situation of the budget was not stabilized. Szapary referred to the international perception that in an "interregnum" between election rounds and in the period of coalition meetings, central banks have an increased responsibility in forming monetary policy. This is especially true for the situation in Hungary because in the first third of the year, the deficit in the balance of payments greatly surpassed projections. As reasons for this, the vice president gave the increase in imports and the only inaccurately traceable course of the income generated by exports. Therefore, even before the first round of elections, the MNB indicated to the government that it intended to take measures in its own sphere of authority to prevent a further deterioration in the balance. It will restrict the liquidity of the domestic money market by, for instance, buying back bonds, and increase the prime rate of the central bank. This, in turn, will of course influence the interest rates offered by commercial banks as well. Szapary told NEPSZABADSAG that the bank was aware of the most diverse conjectures about a devaluation of the forint. He did not want to say anything definite, because that would only benefit speculators, but he said that the MNB wanted to continue its former exchange rate policy of pursuing a "tactic of small steps." Incidentally, the MNB is currently in negotiations on issuing bonds abroad.
