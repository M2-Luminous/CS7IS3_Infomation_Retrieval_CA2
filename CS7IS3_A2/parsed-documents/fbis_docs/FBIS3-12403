Samir Ghawshah, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation's executive committee, emerged from the committee's second meeting here in two days to say that there would be no resumption of talks until there were guarantees of security and "international protection" for the Palestinians. The decision casts doubt on the invitation by US President Bill Clinton to both sides to begin accelerated talks in Washington on Wednesday to speed up the peace process. Israel has accepted Clinton's initiative. Monday's session, under the chairmanship of PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat, lasted two and a half hours, but was adjourned until later Tuesday to await the outcome of a United Nations Security Council debate on the massacre, Ghawshah said. That debate, held over from Saturday amid sharp disagreement between the PLO and the United States, was due to have begun around 0100 GMT Tuesday (8:00 p.m. Monday in New York). Madeleine Albright, the US ambassador to the United Nations, said in New York that negotiations prior to the debate were "going well." The current Security Council chairman, Roble Olhaye of Djibouti, said the delegations had "accomplished a lot" and that there were "hopeful signs for a resolution." The PLO's representative at the United Nations, Nasir al-Qidwah, said he might well address the council, and that the Americans would not stand in his way, as they often did. Talks in the Council snagged Saturday on Washington's opposition to PLO demands that the UN send an international peacekeeping force to the occupied territories, a move rejected by Israel. PLO leaders have also slammed as "inadequate" Israeli pledges to disarm the most extreme of the Jewish settlers in the occupied territories, in the wake of Friday's massacre of 52 Muslim worshippers in the West Bank town of Hebron. They want all settlers disarmed, an unreasonable demand in the eyes of the Israelis, who point to continuing attacks on settlers by Muslim extremists. Israeli premier Yitzhaq Rabin announced in Jerusalem on Monday that Israel would accept the deployment of an international civilian force in the occupied territories. "We would accept the stationing of an international presence in Gaza and Jericho, but it should not consist of military forces and should comply with the Oslo Declaration of Principles" on Palestinian self-rule signed last September, Rabin told representatives of American Jewish organisations. But another PLO executive committee member 'Ali Ishaq told AFP after Monday's session that Rabin's offer was "derisory". The PLO's mainstream Fatah movement announced Monday that it had ended the ceasefire it declared to celebrate the historic September 13 accord with Israel on limited Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. Shortly afterwards its Fatah Falcons guerrillas claimed responsibility for the murder of an 80-year-old Israeli who was hacked to death with an axe at Kfar Saba north of Tel Aviv. Fatah supporters paraded in the Dayr Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip on Monday evening to claim the murder as an act of revenge. Ghawshah also said the PLO leadership had resolved to increase its diplomatic activity to win worldwide backing for its demands, by making representations to the Arab nations, the non-aligned movement, the Russians, the Americans and the Europeans. Three Arab delegations pulled out of talks with Israel in Washington on Sunday in protest at the massacre, after PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat criticised the Israeli army for failing to stop US-born doctor Barukh Goldstein emptying three and a half clips from his Galil automatic rifle into the worshippers. And the Arab League council in Cairo on Sunday framed an uncompromising resolution blaming Israel for the attack.
