He made it clear, however, that his candidacy is negotiable and may be exchanged for an alliance. He said: "Each party cannot have its own candidate, and people should not consider themselves invincible just because they may have respectable aspirations. Right now the nation comes first." This was the tone of Magalhaes' speech at the opening of the 1994 Bahia State Legislative Assembly sessions. On 1 March, the governor stayed in touch with Brasilia throughout the day. He believes the fate of the constitutional amendment, which could change the requirement for people in executive positions like his to resign from them in order to run for president, will be decided in the next 48 hours. The governor said he is not working to push the amendment through and that all parties will be free to vote as they please. Magalhaes recalled, however, that the Constitution had reduced the terms of office for governors who took over on 15 March 1991. He explained: "The proper thing to do would be to restore the lost portion, and one way of doing this would be by approving the amendment that will extend the deadline by which presidential hopefuls must resign from their executive positions. It also would be nice if reelections were possible because if that were to happen Brazil would witness something unprecedented in Bahia State: the lack of candidates willing to compete with me for the governorship."
