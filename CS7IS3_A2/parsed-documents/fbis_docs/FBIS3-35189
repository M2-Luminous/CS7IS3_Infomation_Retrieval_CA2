In a speech he delivered at the general session of the disarmament conference in Geneva today, al-Sahhaf said: Iraq has fulfilled all of its obligations as stipulated in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The Security Council must, for its part, fulfill its obligations that are stipulated in Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 and lift the economic embargo, which it imposed on Iraq and which is no longer justified even on the basis of the Security Council resolutions themselves. The foreign minister added that the continuation of the unjust blockade on Iraq provides clear evidence that certain hegemonistic states wish to impose on the world community their own political stands which are not related to the UN Charter, the international law, and the principles of justice and fairness. The foreign minister urged the disarmament conference to work for halting the arms race in which some Middle Eastern states are engaged. He said Iraq was one of the first states to demand that the Middle East be freed from the weapons of mass destruction. He noted that Iraq and the other Arab states had warned that the Zionist entity possesses large stockpiles of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons as well as long-range missiles that can deliver these weapons to targets thousands of kilometers away and refuses to sign the nonproliferation treaty. The minister said: Paragraph 14 of UN Security Council Resolution 687 stipulates the setting up of a zone free from the weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery. Three years after that resolution was issued, we have not yet seen any serious move to implement this paragraph. Instead, we see a feverish race by certain Middle Eastern states to acquire arms, including major efforts to possess and develop weapons of mass destruction. In his speech, the minister wondered about the reasons behind the zeal shown by certain states to pursue Iraq, threaten it with the use of military force, and then actually using brutal, military force against it, while at the same turning a blind eye to, and even helping others, the Zionist entity for example, acquire and develop weapons of mass destruction. He said: Is it not the right, and even the duty, of the world community and this conference to ask if security, peace, and stability can be achieved through such biased and twisted methods and policies. The foreign minister emphasized that Iraq's position on chemical weapons was made clear at the Paris Conference of 1989. Iraq, he said, asserted its commitment to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and support to the world efforts to halt the armament drive. Iraq was one of the first states to sign the nonproliferation treaties and agreements. Iraq also emphasized that the call for a complete ban on chemical weapons must be associated with a call for a complete ban on nuclear weapons. The foreign minister urged the international community to deal fairly with the issues of security and stability in the Middle East and to abandon double-standards. He also called on the Security Council to expeditiously implement Paragraph 14 of Resolution 687. He said: We believe that the conference's top priority is to take swift measures to guarantee the implementation of Paragraph 14 of Resolution 687 to turn the Middle East into an area free of mass destruction weapons. The conference should not allow certain countries, which are known to all, to exploit the delicate stage through which the Middle East is passing, to make suspicious transient gains which will certainly lead to further imbalance, which will undermine security and stability in the region, and which will expose the security and interests of the people in the region to very sever dangers. The foreign minister added in his speech: The development in international relations, during the past decade and at the beginning of the present decade, calls on all members of the international community to accept that the equal-footing participation of all states in developing human common interests is necessary. This participation should be based on the provisions of the UN Charter, the rules of the international law, and on justice. This participation also should be far away from double standards and selectivity in implementing these provisions and rules; it should be in the service of genuine security and stability in the various parts of the world. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that the achievement of this requires the adoption of disarmament arrangements and measures on fair and objective bases which guarantee the countries' natural rights to security and peace and which respect their sovereignty and independence. No country or a group of countries should be allowed to make gains or privileges at the expense of other countries. Al-Sahhaf said: Proceeding from this understanding, included in the final document of the 10th extraordinary session of the UN General Assembly, Iraq took part in the disarmament conference in 1989 as an observer. On the basis of this understanding also, Iraq built its stand which calls for expanding the membership of the conference so that it will include the countries which have a desire for membership. The minister added: In 1991, a comprehensive aggressive war was launched against Iraq. More than half a million soldiers from the armed forces of more than 30 countries, including superpowers and major countries, took part in this war. They used in this war all the conventional and nonconventional weapons they have in their arsenals, including some internationallybanned weapons. Immediately following the cease-fire, difficult -- in fact unique and unprecedented -- conditions were imposed on Iraq. In his speech, the foreign minister touched on Resolutions 687 and 715 issued by the Security Council in 1991. These resolutions contain a series of measures to destroy some weapons and the material and equipment associated with them as well as to lay down a mechanism for continuous monitoring. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf stressed that Iraq has cooperated with the UN Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to implement the measures included in Resolution 687. He said: After three years of work with the UN Special Commission and the IAEA, it has become clear that Iraq has implemented the required steps stipulated in Part C of Resolution 687. This fact was clearly stated in the reports and joint minutes adopted during four sessions of high-level talks between Iraq and the IAEA. Addressing the 50 members taking part in a session held by the UN Human Rights Commission which began in Geneva today, Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said that Iraq's genuine belief in the principles of the 1948 Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the 1993 Vienna Declaration emanates from its history and civilization. He said that respect for and enhancement of human rights since they are an essential human reality are taken for granted. He added that proceeding from this belief and true understanding, Iraq ratified many international charters dealing with human rights, the last of which was the ratification of the child's rights convention. Iraq is also studying those charters that were not ratified. In addition, it is actively and effectively participating in conferences and meetings that deal with human rights. Al-Sahhaf spoke about the violations of human rights. He said that what is actually happening in the world today is that human rights are regrettably being used as a political weapon to shake the political regimes of states, interfere in their internal affairs, and fragment their national unity and cohesion just like what is happening in many parts of the world including my country, Iraq. He affirmed that as a result of this, the issue of human rights has become an issue of interests that is somehow affected by the policies of some major powers in our modern world. There is no issue that is more controversial in terms of standards and selectivity than the issue of human rights. Our evidence is that the UN Human Rights Commission is always abreast of all the terrible violations of human rights and the human international law in Palestine and the occupied Arab territories. Many resolutions were issued condemning these violations. Moreover, in light of the world community's inability to implement these resolutions, Israel continued to disregard the basic human rights in these areas and pursued its violation of these rights. The world today is witnessing what is happening in Yugoslavia while the United Nations is unable to find a solution to this tragedy. Without doubt, this is attributed to the stands of some major powers which follow the policy of selectivity and double standards in their international dealing. The foreign minister continued: Through its constitution and laws, Iraq sought to establish the state of law by following a realistic and practical policy that adopts the requirements of establishing a community that is balanced in its economic, political, and cultural growth. This balance gave priority to economic, social, cultural, and scientific infrastructures. This reflected positively on building the individual and on the requirements for the growth, prosperity, and development of human rights. This was actually accomplished by combating illiteracy and making education compulsory at all levels and by taking care of the status of women, children, and the handicapped. This reflected clearly on all economic, social, and cultural rights. It is enough to note here what Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, former executive delegate of the UN secretary general, said on 15 July 1991 in his report to the UN secretary general when he referred to the background of the situation in Iraq. In his report Khan said: As of mid-1990 Iraq, in certain ways, was rapidly approaching a level similar to that reached by some European countries. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf said he regrets the attitude demonstrated by certain states toward these Iraqi trends. He said: That independent course was received with negative reactions from abroad, demonstrated by an unfair campaign of accusations and allegations on human rights violations in Iraq. The human rights issue was used as a weapon to obstruct Iraq's development plans and national programs to build the institutions concerned with democracy and human rights. However, Iraq's determination to continue with its programs has not, and will not weaken. Iraq has adopted several laws and measures and made several decisions which emphasize respect for the will of the Iraqi individual and his right to a dignified life, and which allow him to exercise his basic rights even under the hard conditions facing our country. The minister said: It is difficult for human rights to flourish during crises and armed conflicts, but their respect is enhanced when security, peace, and stability prevail. We began to feel this after the end of the war between Iran and Iraq on 8 August 1988 and until August 1990. During that short period of time, discussions started on a draft for a new constitution. Also, emergency laws and resolutions issued during the period in which Iraq was defending itself against the Iranian aggression were reconsidered and several of them were annulled. Citizens were allowed to travel abroad and a new phase in building a multiparty system was launched. The Party Law and a new law guaranteeing the freedom of the press were issued. Emergency laws and legislations which Iraq had to use because of the war with Iran were annulled. This new reality soon changed, and was adversely affected by the comprehensive war launched against Iraq on 17 January 1991 in which all types of destructive and internationally-banned weapons were used. Undoubtedly, the respected members of the human rights committee realize that these conditions, which were imposed on my country, as well as the unjust economic embargo, have produced negative effects on human rights in general. Al-Sahhaf denounced the inhuman attitude of the states that seek to blemish Iraq's reputation in the field of human rights. He said: Those who call for human rights, accuse the Government of Iraq of violating human rights and try to show the world that they care for the Iraqi people, have committed the ugliest crimes against Iraq before and after the military aggression in January 1991. They still insist on continuing their genocide crime against our people by insisting on maintaining the comprehensive blockade despite the fact that the reasons on which these states based their decision to impose the blockade, are no longer valid. He added: One of the constant serious effects of the blockade, which has affected all segments of the Iraqi society, is the deterioration in the food situation to dangerous rates. Here, I wish to refer to a report by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, FAO, issued in August 1993 on food expectations. I also wish to note the acute shortage in medicines and medical needs, especially after the medical shipments contracted by the Health Ministry before 2 August 1990 were halted although their price was paid in advance to the supplying companies. Additionally, health institutions, medical equipment, and utilities sustained heavy damage in the hostile air bombardment. The level of medical care also dropped because of the spread of diseases and epidemics, which principally affected women and children. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf described the immense damage that the people of Iraq have suffered as a result of the continuation of this blockade, which has not only harmed the dignity and livelihood of the Iraqi people, but also their economic, social, cultural, civil, and political rights. He said: The lack of stability, high prices, and scarcity of basic food commodities and medicines has had terrible consequences despite the exhaustive efforts of the Iraqi Government. Al-Sahhaf added: This embargo has seriously affected many aspects of the human rights situation on the one hand, and the overall development process on the other. For, it is widely known that international human rights conventions make it incumbent upon world states to cooperate to uphold these rights. Meanwhile, what is happening to Iraq as a result of the embargo is the outcome of a calculated decision to obstruct the government's efforts to honor its national and international commitments as enshrined in these conventions. The foreign minister indicated that the continued enforcement of the economic embargo has not only undermined the humanitarian, economic, social, and cultural activities of average citizens, but also contributed to the obstruction of the national political program of democracy devised by the Iraqi Government. The minister recalled that several of these moves pertaining to the Constitution, the freedom of press, the multiparty system, and other aspects that constitute the main focus of this esteemed commission were expected to have been accomplished. However, the minister noted, there is a fact that we must enlighten you about, namely, that the politicians who contemplated launching political parties in accordance with the government program have been forced to abandon their plans by the harsh circumstances imposed by the embargo. This is because their main concern right now is the harsh living conditions and health situation to which their families are being subjected. Consequently, the lifting of the economic embargo that has been clamped on the Iraqi people will be instrumental in the rapid consummation of the moves the Iraqi Government has made in the area of human rights, al-Sahhaf maintained. The foreign minister held the international community in general responsible for redressing the Iraqi people's sufferings, saying: Lifting the unfair embargo imposed on the Iraqi people and ending the injustice meted out against them is a humanitarian responsibility that must be shouldered by all, including the UN Human Rights Commission. Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf urged the UN Human Rights Commission to endorse a policy banning the use of economic embargoes and starvation, because this blatantly contravenes the most basic human rights principles and rules the Human Rights Commission upholds. The foreign minister said he hopes the commission will adopt a stand that calls for lifting the embargo imposed on Iraq, because such a stand would be in line with its humanitarian approach and the rules of the humane international law.
