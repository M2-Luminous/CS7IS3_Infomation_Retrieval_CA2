The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs at once issued a statement demanding a swift and objective investigation and also punishment for the guilty persons. "In any case, there must be talk of a political solution to the problem of this city and of Bosnia as a whole. We believe that such a solution can be found. Otherwise an armed conflict could arise between the Serbs and the international peacemaking forces. The Serbs have expressed readiness in principle to hand Sarajevo over to UN control. It is necessary and possible to urgently define the terms of such a handover. Preemptive strikes against the positions of any one of the sides will only exacerbate the situation."
