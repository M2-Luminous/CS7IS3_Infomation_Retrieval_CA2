FR940419-2-00046 FR940419-2-00033 Background : Since 1988, the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health and Human Services has awarded 145 grants to States to support respite care services and crisis nurseries under the Temporary Child Care for Children With Disabilities and Crisis Nurseries Program. Through these State agency grantees, over 250 local service providers have been recipients of the $52,106,552 awarded thus far. In addition, other projects, not utilizing Federal funds available under this program, have been developed and implemented in local communities designed to address the needs of similar target populations. In FY 1993 the Children's Bureau awarded grants to 24 States with funds earmarked for expanding respite care and crisis nurseries services within the States. Respite care programs funded under the Temporary Child Care program are designed to alleviate social, economic, and financial stress among families of all children and, particularly, children with disabilities or children who are chronically or terminally ill through the provision of short-term, non-medical child care. Such respite care provides families or primary care givers with periods of temporary relief from the pressures of the demanding child care routine, thus preventing severe family stress. Respite care programs generally provide 24-hour services, access to medical services; referral access to counseling/therapy; staff training, including child abuse/neglect reporting responsibilities; and public awareness efforts. Crisis Nurseries programs are designed to protect children by providing a safe environment at a time when the chances of neglect or physical abuse in the home are increased. These programs offer parents the option of time out as a preventive measure to reduce the incidence of child maltreatment. In general, crisis nursery programs provide many of the same services as respite care programs but also place greater emphasis on intervention, remediation and prevention services including referrals for out-of-home placement, when appropriate. Other community programs also provide respite care as an integrated part of their services. New legislation recently established Subpart 2 of Title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act, entitled the Family Preservation and Support Services, which encourages and enables States to develop, establish or expand and operate programs for family preservation and community-based family support services. These programs are family-centered and will focus on strengthening the family unit. Family preservation services will assist families in crisis when the child is at imminent risk of being placed in out-of-home care because of abuse and/or neglect. Family support services will focus on activities aimed at increasing the strength and stability of families. Existing programs vary considerably in terms of quality, experience and methodology. However, the demand for services is increasing as the number of single-parent families, families in poverty, and stress on families increases; as fewer disabled children are institutionalized; and as substance abuse impacts greater numbers of children and families. Additional resources are needed to assist in identifying, developing and utilizing effective program practices, information and materials in order to meet this demand. Minimum Requirements for Project Design In order to successfully compete under this priority area, the application should: •Provide a letter addressed to the Commissioner, Administration on Children, Youth and Families, and signed by the Governor which certifies that the State agency applying for funding is the State agency designated to carry out the program. •Demonstrate knowledge about the problems and issues involved in providing services for children with disabilities and children at risk of abuse and neglect. •Provide documentation of the commitment to improving the quality of respite care and crisis nurseries program and services. •Describe a plan for identifying emerging issues from the fields of child welfare (including family preservation and family support), developmental disabilities, and child health, particularly as they relate to prenatal drug exposure and pediatric HIV infection. •Describe a plan for preparing and disseminating information and policy papers to the field which address these emerging issues. •Describe a plan for promoting collaboration among agencies within states and communities.
