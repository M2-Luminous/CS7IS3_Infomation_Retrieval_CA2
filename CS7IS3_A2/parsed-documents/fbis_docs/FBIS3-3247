Managers who took part in the annual meeting on general merchandise, which closed here few days ago, said they believed that competition in the market will become more intense. As a result, the companies engaged in retail and wholesale will have to adjust their business structures and change their management mechanisms. Over the past few years many of the state-owned wholesale companies in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Guangzhou have made great achievements in broadening their business scopes and shifting their management mechanisms, according to the meeting. Among the more than 300 members of the national general merchandise association, 46 retail and wholesale companies have so far adopted the joint stock system, and 16 have been listed on the country's stock exchanges.
