In the authors' opinion, the redox condensing agent--a mixture of triphenylphosphine (Ph[.sub]s[/]P) and 2,2'-dipyridylsulfide (Py[.sub]2[/]S[.sub]2[/])--which was used for making oligonucleopeptide phosphamines meets these requirements. An attempt is made to analyze the course of the reaction and the formation of byproducts as well as outline the bounds of redox condensing reagent (AVKR) applications for producing oligonucleotidyl-(PN)-peptides. The source materials and synthesis procedure in the presence of various nucleophilic catalysts are discussed in detail. The study shows that the reaction is especially sensitive to strong bases and terminates in the their presence by forming a symmetric pyrophosphate. The use of the redox condensing agent without the catalyst makes it possible easily to phosphorylate the weak-base amines while the catalyst retards the reaction with them and facilitates it with more basic amines. The best results are obtained with peptides whose pKaï¿½9. The findings confirm that synthesis occurs with the formation of a phosphamide bond both in the 3' and 5' oligonucleotide position. Both nucleophilic catalysts and the basic properties of peptide amino groups as well as the end phosphate position directly affect the course of the reaction and the oligonucleopeptide and byproduct formation.
