Accompanied by senior provincial officials, the vice-premier went to local oilfields, factories, grain depots, market places and state farms to explore people's lives. He also held talks with local officials and entrepreneurs, exchanging views on how to develop the local economy. The vice-premier said Heilongjiang's difficulties in developing its economy is temporary and can be overcome. "There are bright prospects for invigorating the local economy," Zhu said. He said the province's resource-processing type of economy, its big heavy industry and large number of state-owned enterprises should not be a burden to its development. These could be turned to good advantage. Zhu Rongji told local officials that the central government is taking steps to reduce the price gap between farm and industry products, which will certainly benefit Heilongjiang, a leading grain-producing province of China. Zhu reminded the officials that the province's developed industry could provide a greater technical support in developing its rural industry, which helps increase farmers' cash incomes. As it has one of the largest manufacturing industries in China, Zhu said, the province should take the establishment of a modern enterprises system as a major solution to the difficulties facing state-owned enterprises. In doing so, the vice-premier noted, the most important point was to liberate enterprises from interference by governments. To the province's many defence industry enterprises which are having a hard time, the vice-premier also offered a prescription. It was: to rely more on technical rather than capital input for better performance; develop more labor-intensive industry to create more job opportunities for redundant workers; look for a bigger market share in the service industries. Referring to debts between enterprises, the vice-premier warned that this time, the central coffers would not provide large amounts of money to help clear any debts arising from poorly-funded capital construction projects. Not only this, the vice-premier said, the state bank would stop giving loans to poorly-funded local construction projects, unless the scale and contents of these projects were properly readjusted. While urging the province to step up its effort to attract more overseas investment, the vice-premier also called for better administration and higher product quality in border trade, so that this would develop further and more healthily. On his visit to Daqing, Zhu Rongji noted that the city's oil industry should employ more new technology to maintain its oil output at the present level by the year 2000. Zhu Rongji was accompanied on his tour by Finance Minister Liu Zhongli, Railway Minister Han Shubin, Coal Industry Minister Wang Senhao and other officials from the State Council.
