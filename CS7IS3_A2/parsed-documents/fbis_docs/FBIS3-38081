As he said, Russia's Foreign Ministry sent an inquiry to the headquarters of the UN Protection Forces in the former Yugoslavia. "According to the preliminary data available to the headquarters, the Bosnian Serbs' planes were returning to their base after a bomb strike on a military plant controlled by Bosnian Muslims. If this is indeed the case, the Bosnian Serbs violated one of the UN Security Council's resolutions adopted more than a year ago. The resolution bans flights by military planes in the air space of Bosnia-Herzegovina," he said. According to the diplomat, the "closed skies" resolution has been repeatedly violated by Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croats. "They all were aware of the possible "adequate military" measures toward "the violator." However such measures were not taken till today," he said. Russian diplomats who scored in the past two weeks considerable successes on the road of settling the crisis in Bosnia by peaceful means had repeatedly warned the Serbs, Croats and Muslims against the possible provocations "by field commanders or whoever else," Interfax's interviewee pointed out. "Now what we warned against and what we feared has happened," he said.
