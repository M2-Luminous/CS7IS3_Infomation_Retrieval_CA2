Although he has not been praised to the skies by the government media, as is the custom in such situations, Mr. Marjanovic, we have learned, charmed the Serbian president so much that in a responsible post like that of Serbian prime minister he wanted to see none other than the candidate we have mentioned. If Slobodan Milosevic had had his way at once, the news that Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic was the choice for new prime minister would have been stale by now, at least a month old. But it was obviously difficult for the director of Progres to give up his old post, where he was now in his fourth term, and, as the employees themselves say, even they do not remember when Mr. Marjanovic came to that firm as a promising young executive. Gas In actuality, the director of Progres, contrary to many people's impression, has not spent his entire working life in that position. He began his brilliant career as an economist in his native Knin, where he worked for 12 years in TVIK [Knin Screw Factory], climbing to the position of commercial director thanks to his zeal and knowledge. But in 1973 he exchanged Knin for Moscow and TVIK for Progres. In the years that followed he lived in Russia, where he became manager of the Progres representative office, and it is assumed that his now-famous "Russian" connections date back even to that time. Here is how he described his passion for that country in an interview : "A love for Russia was nurtured among the people of Krajina and passed down from generation to generation, so that it was also a dream of mine to see that country and to work in it." Conceiving that slender thread between the Serbian and Russian identity as something very ancient, as general director of Progres Mr. Marjanovic built his career after 1970 on that cornerstone. When almost all Yugoslav firms began to turn their backs on the Russian market as the 1980's were coming to a close, he embraced it with still greater fervor, so that in the last few years Russian-Serb business collaboration has been flying like the wind. Apart from the 1992 signing of what published sources called the biggest contract ever between Russia and Serbia, calling for commodity trade of $3.5 billion a year, a joint Russian-Serbian venture Gastrejding was also formed under the sponsorship of Progres and acquired a monopoly over the importing of gas from Russia. At that time the total value of that transaction was estimated at $180 million in both directions. In late 1993 a contract was signed with the Russians for a gas pipeline through Bulgaria to southern Serbia which is supposed to bring incredible prosperity to the "southern railroad line," and rumor has it that Belgrade has been heated this winter with Russian gas. All of this is certainly thanks to Marjanovic the businessman, "since he is a man in whom the Russian side and the government of the Russian Federation place the greatest confidence." And the Russians who have confidence in Miki Marjanovic are not be underestimated. The list of those who are his friends includes Yuriy Brezhnev (Leonid's son), with whom he had a wild time drinking French cognac at Crazy Horse in Paris, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russian prime minister, and Gennadiy Shikin, Russian ambassador in Belgrade, with whom he spent New Year's Eve in 1994 in the restaurant Dva Jelena, singing in his powerful tenor voice a mixture of old Serbian songs from the city and Russian ballads. Aid When all that is taken into account, it perhaps becomes clearer why Marjanovic the businessman is so much in favor with the Serbian president. After all, in addition to all those transactions known to the public, there have also been those others, which are perhaps a guarantee to Serbia that the Russians still have a keen interest in them on both the economic and political fronts. "After all, everyone who knows Mirko Marjanovic says that he makes his biggest moves in such a way that few people find out about them." But the successes of Progres and its general director in Russia and elsewhere (32 representative offices in the world) do not seem to be so applicable on home ground. We have learned that 70 percent of the work force of approximately 1,200 are on mandatory leave. Malicious tongues would say that in Progres there are many people from Krajina to whom Director Marjanovic has entrusted good positions within the country and abroad. Someone has called Marjanovic "mother of the Serbian people" for all he has done for the Serbs in Bosnia and the krajinas. In terms of food, clothing, medicine, and perhaps other things, those Serbian lands have received from the director of Progres aid valued at $3 billion, "since aid to the needy is our debt and our obligation as human beings." Aside from all, Miki Marjanovic is also a distinguished sports figure as president of the Partizan Soccer Club since 1989, and, according to his worshippers, he put that team on a sound footing: "Success in competition must be aimed at profit, but profit must in turn be used to create a strong team that can achieve the greatest success." For all his success and ability, Mr. Marjanovic lives modestly in a four-room apartment on Banjica, although, it is said of this man "of stature," that a smallish villa is in the works and will be built by Progres. In view of this portrait of a business executive, it comes as a surprise that some of the opposition (the SPO [Serbian Renewal Movement] and DSS [Democratic Party of Serbia]) should say that they would withhold support from him. This perhaps lends credence to the rumors that Milosevic's real candidate is after all someone else. But, as Mirko "Miki" Marjanovic once said: "At this point we all need to be on the same line, the line of Serbia, the line of patriotism in defense of the country and our people. And as Dr. Mira Markovic has said: `Even the wolves stick together in a blizzard.'"
