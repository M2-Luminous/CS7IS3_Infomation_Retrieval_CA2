Here is Mikhail Mamulashvili reporting from Tbilisi: [Mamulashvili] The main aim of Eduard Shevardnadze's visit to the western part of the republic was the desire to see for himself the state of affairs in the regions. This time, the head of state visited two rayons - Zugdidskiy and Tsalendzhikhskiy - which until recently were at the center of the Zviadist movement. You will recall that it was here that the main events during the armed confrontation between government troops and armed supporters of the ex-president took place. The last time Shevardnadze was in Tsalendzhikha was two years ago. Back then he was obliged to endure reproaches and insults from people who considered Zviad Gamsakhurdia the only legitimate leader of the country. On 29 April, things were different. The press service of the Georgian head of state informed me that Shevardnadze was given the warm welcome typically accorded by the inhabitants of that region. He met with the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, the heads of the local administration, representatives of the intelligentsia and local workers. Speaking to the inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha, Shevardnadze stressed that Georgia is now going through a bad patch. We want to build a democratic state and that's why we all have to work instead of sitting down with our arms folded. Touching on the situation in Abkhazia -- and inhabitants of Tsalendzhikha are particularly anxious about this question since their rayon borders Abkhazia and there are a large number of refugees in Tsalendzhikha itself -- Shevardnadze said that all matters and problems connected with that region would in all probability be solved in the near future. The head of state was accompanied on his trip to western Georgia by Vakhtang Goguadze, speaker of the Georgian parliament, Prime Minster Otar Patatsia, and other officials.
