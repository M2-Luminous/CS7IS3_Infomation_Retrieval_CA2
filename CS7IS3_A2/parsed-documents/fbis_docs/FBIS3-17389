This was done during the presentation of a bank note factory. Ukraine's President Leonid Kravchuk, Acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, and Viktor Yushchenko, the chairman of the National Bank of Ukraine, took part in the opening ceremony. Our correspondent Ihor Kulinichenko reports on this event. [Kulinichenko] Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk pushed the button and the unit started functioning. And here is the first product, symbolic product, so to say, coming out [word indistinct] -- Ukraine' first monetary unit. [Announcer] During his conversation with journalists Leonid Kravchuk emphasized the expediency of issuing [Ukraine's] own national monetary unit. [Begin Kravchuk recording] The state that has its own money, its own currency, is an independent and sovereign state. This is why any talk to the effect that we will be independent while we have some other currency in our state is a mere deception of the people. You do not need to go far, here is the National Bank chairman, ask him: Can a state be independent when it has some other currency? [passage indistinct] Where is Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy? I am here with the journalists, and when I say that the country's own currency is the attribute of statehood, they tell me that I am a nationalist. Maybe, this is because I am from a different region. I have already replied to other people, including the residents of Moscow. Because, if other another currency [circulates in Ukraine], our bank and Viktor Andriyovych will become a subsidiary. And the Russian Central Bank is, by the way, setting such a condition. And this is normal. One should not blame the Russian bank. This is a normal condition. If you agree to use the ruble you have to become a subsidiary. And then the deputies, elected by the people, will assemble at the Supreme Council and they will have to make decisions on [Ukraine's] own money, on credit policy, on taxes. And they will be told that this does not [word indistinct] with the interests of the Russian National Bank. This is normal. This is why, under these conditions, the people will be allowed to elect deputies, but the deputies will not be able to make any [word indistinct]. This is why we all here -- myself, the prime minister, the National Bank chairman, and all those present, came here so as to emphasize that this is an attribute of our independence. And any talk to the effect that there can be something else is pretense and a deception of the people. I would not like to arrest, as they say, attention on this very aspect, but money, the financial and banking systems are the [word indistinct] of such a sign. When reforms [words indistinct] we are setting up Ukraine's own banking system. [end recording] [Announcer] Ihor Kulinichenko told you about the commissioning of the state bank note factory whose presentation was attended by the president of Ukraine and other high-ranking government officials and statesmen.
