Mexico participated at the OECD meeting in Paris as the 25th member this organization. Tello presented to the organization's Council of Ministers an initiative that was backed by representatives from Sweden, Finland, Canada, and Spain. On the last day of meetings, the Mexican foreign secretary asked the OECD to analyze the pertinence of institutions created as a result of the Cold War to prevent a duplication of efforts and to make operations more efficient. He said the organization is prepared to initiate a global analysis of the international economic cooperation system. At the conclusion of the meeting, OECD President Jean Claude Baye said in a document that Mexico's membership in the OECD is a wonderful development. The OECD president added that OECD members view the beginning of a new phase of development for the organization and are pleased with Mexico's contribution. This is the first time Mexico has participated as a full member since it officially joined the organization in April. The OECD includes the world's most industrialized countries.
