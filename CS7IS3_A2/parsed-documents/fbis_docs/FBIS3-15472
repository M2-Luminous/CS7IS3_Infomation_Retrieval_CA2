In his opinion, unemployment can be kept in check for two-five months with higher inflation and monetary injections, but this course has no long-term prospects. "If the economy is not stable and there is no stable money, unemployment will increase anyway and we will have an unpleasant combination of jobless and high inflation," said Gaydar. Speaking of the draft budget, he noted the difference between the message's indices and the ones named today by the prime minister. In his opinion, the main difference is approaches to the inflation -- a key aspect of the 1994 economic policy. They are rather qualitative than quantitative. The presidential message inspires hope for an economic breakthrough and stability and the government indices are not optimistic. The budget deficit is estimated at approximately 10.2 per cent of the gross domestic product, the level of 1993, which means the inflation will not decrease. Gaydar personally would not vote for the document until certain changes are introduced in its spending section. The draft provides for doubled spending on the state machinery and the military-industrial complex simultaneously with the reduced social spending.
