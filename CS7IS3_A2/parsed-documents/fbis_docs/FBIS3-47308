The Geneva treaty for Laos of 1962 was trampled on and destroyed completely by the special war of the imperialists, which they steadily escalated. In addition to their mobilizing the rightist forces and the special forces of Vang Pao to attack and seize liberated areas, starting on 17 May 1964 they used their air force to brazenly destroy our country. They used various types of aircraft to drop many kinds of bombs and brutally kill our people who had done nothing wrong. This lit the fire of anger among the multi-ethnic Lao people more and more, and it caused them to rise up and fight an ever broader people's war. It also mobilized the spirit for battle of the cadres and combatants of the Anti-aircraft Battalion. The enemy air war grew steadily fiercer especially in Viang Sai District, the stronghold of the revolution. This was a special target for the air pirates who wanted to destroy the base of the patriotic forces. They used various types of aircraft to drop bombs every day in hundreds of sorties. Every day the Viang Sai base was covered by a frightening amount smoke and wreckage from explosions. This fierce warfare forced our army to strengthen the Anti-aircraft Corps and improve its combat capabilities. This was the reaction to the "spreading fire" which required water to be put out. They combined the 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th anti-aircraft companies to create an anti-aircraft battalion on 2 May 1965. Its assignment was air defense for central Viang Sai. This battalion was under the command of Comrade Khamchan. Comrade Sao was responsible for political activities. Comrade Phonkeo was chief of staff. Leadership was provided by the artillery department of Supreme Headquarters. After being established the unit moved into position to defend the position of the central leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front and worked to improve the various support bases which were necessary. The unit mobilized the people to be patriotic and hate the enemy and to send their sons to join the ranks of the army amd do other things. They had to overcome difficulties and confusion of many kinds, but the most important task was mobilizing the fighting spirit of the cadres and combatants within the unit to continue our army's brave tradition that it was better to die than to surrender. Not long after the establishment of the unit the imperialists on 4, 5 and 6 June 1965 used aircraft of various types to drop bombs in attacking Viang Sai District again. This was a ferocious attack. Their aircraft attacked for 3 days and nights; there was not even a minute without the sounds of aircraft and explosions of various kinds reverberating. They not only wanted to wipe out the revolutionary forces but also made the mountains, which symbolized the beauty of the area, into level ground. [passage omitted] All levels of cadres and all combatants were united in their resolve to fight to the death and to let their gun emplacements be their graves. Initially the gun emplacements were covered with branches, but after many hours of battle the force of the explosions against the gun emplacements began to expose them. This gave the air pirates targets so that they could attack each emplacement fiercely. Nevertheless they were not able to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the unit. Against this steel we had to be brave. In this battle to defend Viang Sai District not only were the cadres and combatants able to maintain the security of the central command, but they were also able to shoot down and destroy 12 aircraft. This was the origin of the name of the 4.5.6 Anti-aircraft Battalion. During the entire period that the unit performed its air defense duties, it took part in 527 small and large-scale engagements. Of these 150 were fierce battles. They shot down more than 110 aircraft and captured 5 pilots. Because of these accomplishments the battalion was honored by the party and upper echelons with 12 freedom medals, two bravery medals, and one bravery banner. One combatant was made a national hero.
