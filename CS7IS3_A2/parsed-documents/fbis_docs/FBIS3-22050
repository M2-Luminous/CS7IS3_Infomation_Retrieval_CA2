However, the drug traffickers will be tried by the military courts and the commanding officer of the Army has already stated that no one in the military is involved. Landing strip used by drug traffickers in Campanilla: The encircled area of the photo shows the Peruvian Army's Otorongo Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. For the past year, it has been used by small planes carrying drugs to Colombia in plain sight of the soldiers based there. It was built by Vaticano. Although public opinion has for the past two weeks had ears for nothing but the alleged connections of drug trafficker Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera with prominent figures in the world of entertainment, a disturbing question nevertheless keeps cropping up with respect to this shady individual: Was he or was he not connected with members of the Armed Forces and Peru's National Police (PNP)? Last week, Nicolas de Bari Hermoza, head of the Army, and PNP General Victor Alva Plasencia both emphatically denied that anyone in the military or police has had connections with Chavez Penaherrera. Nevertheless, in the midst of the confusion caused by police arrests of entertainers, stars, a designer and a former beauty queen, rumors and suspicion that members of the Armed Forces or the Peruvian Police might be involved in Chavez Penaherrera's drug trafficking ring continued to grow. Despite the amount of time that has passed, people still have vivid memories of the connections of drug trafficker Reynaldo Rodriguez Lopez, the "Godfather," with high-ranking National Police officials still serving prison terms. So far, statements by (retired) Peruvian Army Major Evaristo Castillo Aste published in CARETAS last week provide the first indications that would detract from the categorical statements made by top-ranking PNP and Army officials to the effect that no one in the military or Police is involved with Chavez Penaherrera. In the jungle, (retired) Major Castillo Aste served first of all as chief of operations and later military adviser to General Eduardo Bellido, now political and military head of the Huallaga Front. What he said is deserving of an investigation as thorough as it must be transparent in order to assess the responsibilities of those serving at and assigned to the various military and Police bases near the area in which Chavez Penaherrera operated in Huallaga Valley. Chavez Penaherrera is unquestionably one of the biggest--if not the biggest--drug traffickers in the country. There is also some suspicion about his connections with terrorists in the area. However, what is particularly troublesome in this case is that there does not appear to be the slightest interest on the part of either the military or the Police in investigating possible cases of corruption committed by members of law enforcement agencies. Chavez Penaherrera, aka "Vaticano," has already been accused of treason on charges of narcoterrorism. His case is being channeled almost automatically to the military courts, where he is awaited by a faceless court that will certainly sentence him to life in prison. Naturally, when he is turned over to the military courts, the regular courts of law will be powerless to conduct investigations, not only into Vaticano's probable relations with members of the Armed Forces and the PNP, but also with nonmilitary and nonpolice sectors. The following is a thorough examination of the connections that very possibly link Vaticano with certain military and Police figures. The information comes from thoroughly reliable sources and, as the reader will see, the accuracy and details speak for the quality and veracity of the information. Looking the Other Way Kilometer marker 787 on the Juanjui-Tocache section of Marginal Highway in the Department of San Martin, which between 1990 and mid-1993 was one of the airports set up by Vaticano to send cocaine paste (PBC) to Colombia, was not concealed in any way. It could not be because located at the end of the 1,500-meter airstrip used by small planes from Colombia is (now blockaded by cement barriers and barbed wire) the Peruvian Army's Otorongo Military Base used for antiterrorist operations. Both the strip and base are next to the town of Campanilla. The base has been there, manned by (approximately) 40 soldiers under the command of a captain, since before 1989. In other words, there could not have been a single flight, shipment of cocaine paste, or takeoff or landing by Colombian planes in Campanilla that was not observed by personnel at that military base. To deny such complicity, which we shall describe in further detail below, would amount to saying that a small plane can land in Lima's city square without being seen by soldiers guarding the government buildings. The captains assigned to the Campanilla Military Base (and who are rotated every three or four months) are not the only officers responsible. Their chiefs, who visited the base periodically, could not possibly have been unaware of what was going on. Even if they did not observe the landings, when making their inspections, the officers must have at least wondered what was taking place on the 1,500-meter strip! Nor did all the action take place in Campanilla. Nearly all the runways built or set up by Vaticano were near military bases. Most were run by the Army, as in the case of Tingo Maria, Aucayacu, Tocache, Juanjui, Sion, Punta Arenas, Uchiza, Saposoa, Bellavista, and Palmapampa. The Peruvian Air Force (FAP) now has its own bases at Tingo Maria, Tocache, Juanjui, Uchiza, Saposoa, and Bellavista. The Navy has a base at Aguaytia, where a secret airport also once operated. The responsibility extends to the highest-ranking officers in the Armed Forces in the area: the commanding officers of Emergency Zone 8 (San Martin and Huanuco) between 1990 and 1993. According to information gathered by this periodical in the area and contained in more than one report drafted by members of the Army Intelligence Service (as on 22 November 1991, for example), the complicity between the chief of the Otorongo Base and Vaticano's ring was the result of a financial agreement involving at least $3,000 to $4,000 a flight. If one considers that not only the captains in charge of the base, but their superior officers also consented to the goings-on, then one has to conclude--and this is the information that circulates in the area--that these superior officers also took payments and in larger quantities. Life in Campanilla The operation run in Campanilla that turned the town into the biggest center for collections and shipments in Huallaga involved most of its 3,111 inhabitants. It is perhaps for that very reason that no one wants to speak of what was happening in the local streets until only very recently. It is as if the entire town had suddenly suffered an attack of amnesia. However, Army intelligence reports--which no one heeded at the proper time--and accounts gathered in Juanjui can reconstruct what the people of Campanilla do not wish to recall: The activity began at the collection centers. The peasants went straight to certain homes in town. For example, the house where Humberto Chavez Penaherrera lived is on the second block of the Julio Romero Castro section, the street running right into Campanilla, about 150 meters from the base. The building belongs to his brother, Emilio Chavez Penaherrera, who lives on Block 3 of the Alfonso Ugarte section in Juanjui, where SI found him. He said he has not seen his brother Demetrio since the latter was 15 and ran away from home in Campanilla (the Chavez Penaherrera family moved from Saposoa to Campanilla when Vaticano was 9) and swore he knew nothing about his other siblings Humberto, Bertha, or Bersabe. "We have all gone our separate ways and I know nothing about the others," he said. The only thing he admitted was that he has a house in Campanilla where his brother Humberto lived until his arrest late last year: "I left it when I came here from there eight years ago to devote all my time to running my lumber business," he said. Vaticano was not living in Campanilla. He moved to Colombia in 1990 but returned frequently (for important shipments, it is said) and stayed at that house when he did so. His sister Bersabe, also under arrest although it is not known for what charges, lived across from the Plaza de Armas. Another collection center may have been Humberto's ranch, located on the same level as the town but across the Huallaga. This would mean transporting the product on rafts to the little port of Campanilla across from the ranch. Lower down on the same side of the Huallaga lives another brother, Juan II (the Pope is also named John). According to those who know him, he is very poor. The drug was taken from the collection centers to the airstrip. This meant crossing the river or walking a few blocks. According to one report from the Army Intelligence Service drafted by an agent who visited Campanilla near the end of 1991, the haulers or "handlers" carried it in backpacks. They would sit down on both sides of the streets and wait for payment or some scheduled flight. For their part, the chiefs moved about in pickup trucks guarded by armed hired killers. As the time for a flight drew near, they converged on the airstrip to make their shipment. The twin-engine planes brought the money in dollars. It was unloaded and the drug loaded, some 800 to 1,000 kilos of cocaine paste on every flight. According to the report and as confirmed by anyone visiting Campanilla, this all took place "in plain sight of Army personnel." In order to convert coca leaves into paste, the laboratories operated in homes or on the riverbanks. When Humberto Chavez was arrested on 3 December, a lab operating on the bank of the Huallaga opposite his ranch was raided and destroyed. All of this movement in town also presumed the complicity--and paying off--of municipal authorities. The mayor from 1990 to 1992 was Aprista [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] member Guzman Gonzales Rivadeneyra. But the facilities are different. For Vaticano, Campanilla was not just his center of operations. It was also the village where his family had come 30 years ago when it amounted to no more than a few huts. It is perhaps for that reason that he gave the mayor $500,000, the latter admits himself, "counting it out one bill at a time," in order to build things: the Plaza de Armas, the church, a satellite dish, lights for the town (only for the streets lining the square), and street repairs, a la Pablo Escobar. However, the current mayor, Reinerio Cardenas Isuiza, told SI Thursday that all the works were the result of a common effort. During his term in office, he said, they had received help from Humberto Chavez only to repair streets and only in the form of food for the members of the Engineering Battalion: 27 kilos of meat a day. Like the residents of the town, the mayor recalls nothing at all about drug operations even though he has lived in Campanilla for 20 years! Barriers In September 1992, after the first news reports appears concerning Vaticano's activities in Campanilla, the Army itself joined with the DEA [Drug Enforcement Administration] to install cement blocks on the runway. However, that was not the end of the complicity. The bulletin distributed by the National Antidrug Directorate (DINANDRO) at the press conference at which Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera was presented states that "the barriers were moved at night to the edge of the runway so the illicit operations could take place (the landings, loading of cocaine paste, and takeoffs), then put back in place so as not to awaken suspicion." What did personnel at the Otorongo Base do while this was going on in front of their very eyes? Army Intelligence reports state that the soldiers even got in on the act, loading the bags of cocaine paste on the small planes and moving the cement blocks. Only last year, as a result of the intervention of the Peruvian Air Force detachment stationed in Juanjui, heavier blocks were moved into place and barbed wire and explosives were installled. The flights were suspended at Campanilla, but continued at other strips run by Vaticano. "Duck Man" For years, numerous military and police intelligence reports told of Vaticano's activities in what is known as Medio Huallaga. According to sources in Huallaga, in 1990 Vaticano financed the construction of the landing strip in Campanilla with the aid of the San Martin Development Corporation (CORDESAN) and the Army. Officials from Corde San Martin, the miniregion of Juanjui, and even the Huascaran Engineering Battalion 112 helped set up the section between kilometer markers 786 and 787 on the Marginal Highway in order to turn it into the Campanilla airport. Peruvian Army Major Briceno headed the Huascaran Engineering Battalion 112 which in 1991 and 1992 had as its task the reconstruction of the Juanjui-Tocache section of the Marginal Highway. Campanilla is at the midway point. From the ground it is easy to see the difference in altitude between this kilometer and a half and the rest of the highway, which implies that in its reconstruction effort, the Engineering Battalion left this section intact. Once the terrain had been "separated" for the airport, it had to be expanded on the sides and leveled for the runway. This was done by workers hired by the Juanjui miniregion in the CORDESAN jurisdiction, then headed by engineer Sergio Guerra Chombo. Adolfo Isuiza, the newsman from Juanjui who was murdered in August 1992 by Vaticano's hired killers, filed this report in one of his dispatches to Radio Tropical in Tarapoto. A confidential report drafted in August 1991 by CORDESAN confirms the irregularities. The officials involved were Renan Morales Azpur, head of the Juanjui-Tocache highway reconstruction project, Tito Perez, head of the Juanjui miniregion, and the latter's chief, one Rondon. Both the airstrip and one section of the Marginal highway, specially equipped, were controlled by Vaticano for the landing of Colombian aircraft that took off again loaded with basic cocaine paste (PBC). According to information received in Huallaga, Vaticano ended up operating as many as 240 flights a month. He admitted the spectacular figure during DINCOTE [Counterterrorism Directorate] interrogations. Then why did the Punta Arenas BCS not take note of the affair? The only possible reply: Someone looked the other way and more. And yet, Vaticano's drug trafficking operations in the jungle did not depend solely on the flights of Colombian planes. During certain periods, the combined antidrug operations of the FAP, PNP, and DEA observers prevented the entry into or departure from Campanilla. Nor is the distance from this spot and the Colombian border a small one. However, Vaticano found a solution to the problem posed by his operations. Reliable information gathered in Huallaga states, for example, that in February 1992, there were signs that Vaticano's clan used Army helicopters to move the cocaine paste from Huallaga to La Media, an important underground runway located in Nueva Jerusalen del Erene, Ramon Castilla-Caballococha Province, in Loreto. This clandestine airstrip was only a few minutes from the border with Colombia, meaning it was much easier to get the drug from Peru at that point. La Media was raided on 23 March 1993, resulting in the arrest of Colombian drug trafficker Manuel Guillermo Ayala Calderon, aka "Paisa" or "Peter," who in statements to the PNP said he had had drug trafficking connections with Vaticano. However, what is most important is the existence of very precise information detailing how Vaticano could have operated with prominent military officials in the area. There are signs that Vaticano was in Lima in February 1992. During his absences from Campanilla in 1992, his brother Emilio Chavez Penaherrera, "Gigante," ran the "business." However, the latter was in constant contact with Vaticano by radio in order to receive precise instructions, consult with him when necessary, or send messages to him. On 24 February 1992, Gigante told Vaticano that "the duck man" urgently wanted to talk with him. According to the information obtained and duly cross-checked, Vaticano's men used the term "ducks" to refer to Army helicopters flying between different spots in Huallaga. Nor is that all: That day, sources in Huallaga say, Vaticano talked by radio with "the duck man," whose identity reportedly corresponds to a Peruvian Army officer, one Captain De la Puente, whose code name in the zone was "Javier." Other reports state that this officer was reportedly a key in Vaticano's relations with other military men. It is also known that precise reports exist from 1991 pointing to signs of the use of "ducks" by Vaticano to carry the drug from different parts of the valley to Campanilla. In 1991, coordination with the military, and specifically with the chief of the BCS in Punta Arenas at the time, was reportedly the responsibility of Elias Chavez Penaherrera or "Lan Chile," Vaticano's brother and lieutenant at the time. Reports found in Huallaga state that Vaticano paid off prominent military officials in the zone, both in order to land small planes on the Campanilla runways as well as for the use of the "ducks" to carry the drug in complete safety from one place to another. There reportedly exists an Army counterintelligence report stating that this Captain De la Puente supplied Vaticano helicopters from 1900 at night to carry cocaine paste from Campanilla and sometimes even to areas near the Brazilian border (Sion). "The duck man" may have been from the Tarapoto Military Base or the BCS in Punta Arenas, the reports state. On 20 February of that same year, Vaticano informed the Colombian drug trafficker known as "Doctor" that things were "still going badly" since the "handling" or movement of the drug and payoffs to military personnel had become very expensive. Other military men in the area, probably involved with Vaticano during those years, are EP Lieutenants "Mickey," "Cahuide," and "Zorro," their code names in Huallaga. As one can see, a great deal remains to be investigated with respect to the military aspects of the Vaticano case. More "Men" The same conversation which Vaticano had with his brother Gigante on 24 February 1992 can provide more clues to the corruption of members of law enforcement agencies in Huallaga. Witnesses of the conversation in Huallaga say that Gigante told Vaticano that the report appearing in different media concerning the capture by UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] and the DEA of a small plane carrying 380 kg of cocaine paste was not accurate. His brother informed Vaticano that the load seized in Pucallpa ("by the men with green eyes" and "the men from the red earth") was a sale of 800 kg of cocaine paste that they had made to the Colombian drug trafficker Mario. If what Gigante had told him was true, what happened to the remaining 420 kg? Another piece of information may be related to this fact. It has to do with a conversation which Vaticano had on 5 March 1992 with a sister of his in Juanjui ("La Calena" or Bersabe?). The sister reportedly told him that the seized drug was in Juanjui and that the "chief of the place" intended to get it to Colombia through Tarapoto. Vaticano reportedly had his sister so inform "Calavera" (Humberto Chavez Penaherrera) so that the latter, with help from the military, would try to get the shipment back. Campanilla Defense Front In March 1992, Vaticano reportedly ordered, through Gigante, that the members of his ring in Campanilla not carry rifles, shotguns, or machine guns, evidence compiled in the area indicates. However, he excepted handguns and ordered that if they had to be carried, they should be concealed in clothing. The sources consulted go on to say that Vaticano stressed that above all, his men should not carry weapons bearing the Peruvian coat of arms and reportedly told Gigante that he coordinate with the "engineer," possibly the head of the BCS in Punta Arenas. According to different versions given in Huallaga, weapons with the Peruvian coat of arms could only belong to the Army. How could Vaticano's men have Army weapons? The explanation given by sources interviewed state that in 1991, Vaticano promoted the formation of the Campanilla Defense Front against the SL terrorists and advised the head of the Punta Arenas BCS to give Army weapons to the settlers, many of whom belonged to his ring. That year, witnesses say, Vaticano decided not to go on paying quotas to the Shining Path. The Campanilla Defense Front was one way to stand up to terrorism in coordination with the Army. (This was roughly the time of a confrontation of Vaticano's band with a Shining Path column. Fifteen terrorists died in the battle, people in Campanilla say.) Also according to accounts gathered, Vaticano reminded the head of the Punta Arenas BCS, through Gigante, that the collection of payments by small aircraft landing on the Campanilla strips had been temporarily suspended. Gigante replied that he had already reminded the officer in question of that fact, but that the latter went on collecting, perhaps, he said, because they were soon to transfer him, the informants consulted in Huallaga say. Why did Vaticano prohibit his men from carrying long arms, particularly if they bore the Peruvian coat of arms, and why did he insist on not collecting payoffs during the early days of March 1992? The information available indicates that these measures were reportedly taken by Vaticano because of a report published on 29 February 1992 by the daily newspaper LA REPUBLICA reporting his activities in Campanilla and his connections with members of the Army. Vaticano reportedly did not want to expose himself by revealing the network he had managed to set up in Huallaga for his illegal drug trafficking operations. Police Involved Other sources report serious clues that might compromise PNP officials with Vaticano. They allegedly include Major "Che Gato," one Colonel Bernedo connected with the escape of the trafficker "Mosquito," son of "Mosca Loca" and Captain Rafael Lopez, cousin of the first husband of "La Calena," Abel Lopez Soria. The latter officer's nickname is "Muneco." It has also been learned that one of the police now questioning La Calena is supposedly the one who stole and later sold to Vaticano for $5,000 the report containing everything the police knew about him up to the time he was captured. 1990: Abundant Proof The arrest of Colombian drug trafficker "Paisa" or "Peter" in March of 1993, who admitted making more than one "deal" with Vaticano, led DINANDRO to make a thorough search of its files and records of antidrug operations. An extensive and detailed police report drafted in April 1993 concerning Paisa's capture in Caballococha contains the search and seizure on 24 July 1990, drafted by members of the PNP's Condor Patrol in Campanilla. The report states that the police entered Vaticano's house, located approximately 30 meters from the laboratory, which was on the right bank of the Huallaga River opposite Campanilla. They found the following: seven plastic bags, each containing 40 kilos of cocaine paste; two plastic bags, each containing 24 kilos of paste; one plastic bag containing 16 kilos of paste; two FAL [Armed Forces of Liberation] cartridge pouches containing 15 shells each; and an FAL rifle with the serial number sanded off. The same report goes on to state that: "The expansion of investigations to obtain more evidence relating to Demetrio Chavez Penaherrera in illegal drug trafficking (TID) activities yielded information that the latter has relatives with records for such activities, Humberto Chavez Penaherrera (aka Calavera) in particular. The trafficker was arrested at his house in the company of Cirilo Cardenas Mendoza and Ausberto Grandez, along with arms and military equipment, communications equipment, in a joint EP-PNP operation. The sum of $2,000 was paid to EP Captain Alfaro for the return of 04 FAL; he is a known trafficker in Alto Huallaga." What is surprising about this report is not so much the content of what was found and seized, but the fact that it confirms the proximity of the dates. If, on 24 July 1990, a police patrol managed to identify and then destroy Vaticano's logistical infrastructure in Campanilla, it is surprising that the following year, he should be promoting a questionable Defense Front of the People of Campanilla with the consent and apparent benevolence of the Army and that, during the early months of 1992, based solely on the information obtained, he should with impunity be running a vast drug trafficking network. There are more than enough reasons for a thorough investigation of the possible relations of this drug trafficker with prominent military and Police officials in the zone. To fail to do so will weaken even further the precarious image which our country has abroad in terms of its fight against drug trafficking.
