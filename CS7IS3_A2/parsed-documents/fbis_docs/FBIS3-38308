The means of achieving this is helping the Center Democrats over the 2-percent representation threshold, and to this end, the small nonsocialist party needs a higher profile and a platform from which its policy statements can be delivered. This is the platform Mimi Jakobsen has been given in the form of the heavyweight Industry and Social Affairs Ministries. The party's fortune, however, has not automatically been made with new posts and new people. The ministries will have to be run aggressively and professionally -- and more, if the new ministerial titles are to prove a bonus on election day. The idea is that it will be possible to see the Center Democrats' fingerprints on government policy in two of the party's key areas, industry and social policy. This is not something that will necessarily be straightforward, for there will be no more major packages of legislation in these fields in what remains of the life of this government. Mimi Jakobsen will now coordinate her own Industry Ministry -- not a ministry that attracts much popular interest. On the contrary, it is very technical and weighed down by legislation, and many EU [European Union] commitments are linked to it. It is true that the CD leader inspires feelings of security and confidence among the larger industrial and commercial organizations that have also declared their satisfaction with the step toward a real superministry for industry. Mimi Jakobsen, however, will be unable to satisfy the desire for the removal of the many subsidy arrangments which Danish industry views as a distortion of competition. Bente Juncker takes over an onerous Social Affairs Ministry where her predecessor had slowly succeeded in becoming well liked among the broader general public. The problem for Juncker is that her direct and temperamental character could work against her. Also, in the coming months there will be no major initiatives in the field of social policy. Initially, she will have to make do with making public her predecessor's action plan for children. On the other hand, the Center Democrats have gotten rid of the troublesome government critic that Juncker has up to now appeared to be. This in itself could mean greater calm and less disturbance in the publicity the party receives. A.O. Andersen -- who is highly respected inside the government -- will try to bring life to the unsuccessful Research Ministry, whose outgoing minister, Svend Bergstein, has been unable to put forward a single draft law in the past year. At the same time A.O. Andersen will look after his Ecclesiastical Affairs Ministry, and he has therefore been called the "minister for faith and science" at Christiansborg. It is the Research Ministry that is to raise A.O.'s profile, but this could prove difficult because Bergstein failed to win any power from other ministries in the past year. It is Nyrup Rasmussen, together with Mimi Jakobsen and Finance Minister Mogens Lykketoft, who is behind the reshuffle. The reshuffle has been in the works since before Christmas but has been slowed down by Helge Mortensen's illness due to heart problems. The uncertainty whether Mortensen would be able to come back to work has persisted right up to the government's first birthday, and as a result the ministers who have been fired have succeeded in qualifying for compensation during a period of unemployment and a lifelong pension of 57,000 kroner per year. The fact that the cabinet reshuffle happened on 28 January was closely linked to Svend Bergstein's criticism of the government in BERLINGSKE TIDENDE on Thursday [27 January]. The reshuffle was originally to have taken place in a few days' time, but Bergstein's demonstration of his lack of political awareness accelerated his dismissal. There was to be a demonstration of dynamism, and the criticism of Nyrup's hesitation over unpleasant decisions was to be rebuffed. And dynamism was a key word for Mimi Jakobsen when the new ministers were presented. "We find ourselves in a place where it hurts," she said, referring to the sacrifices, for the Social Democratic Party in particular, that were necessary to bring about a total reshuffle. Karen Jespersen has been fired -- quite unreasonably, it is being said -- so that the Center-Democrats can take over the field of social policy. This could lead to problems with the Social Democrats' grassroots that are traditionally identified with social policy. While, at the same time, her successor, Bent Juncker, is not very well liked among ordinary Social Democrats. Karen Jespersen was applauded into the party Folketing group on Friday morning, and she can expect to become a minister again in Nyrup's second government after the election. Until then she, probably together with Pia Gjellerup, will act as the party's media strategist in the period up to the election later in the year. Arne Melchior is the victim, because he is too pale and "amoeba-like" a figure. He is angry, and this could give rise to undesirable disturbances when he returns to the ranks of ordinary Folketing deputies. From the very beginning Svend Bergstein was a bad choice by Mimi Jakobsen. He accelerated his own dismissal by his remarks to BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. The fact that Nyrup Rasmussen has chosen to cut the number of ministers only by two, and not the number of ministries -- something he had indicated in an interview with BORSEN last week -- also has to do with regard for the Center Democrats. Mimi Jakobsen continues to take the view that the Research Ministry, the Tourism Ministry, and the Industry Ministry are future-oriented and must therefore be retained. She has the strong backing today of Social Democrat Ritt Bjerregaard. As a result of the reshuffle, Helge Mortensen has been given a less demanding post at the less burdensome Tourism Ministry. Jan Trojborg, who is considered to be a rising political star, will take a shot at the politically demanding Transport Ministry. The reshuffle is the Center Democrats' chance to entice voters back into the fold. The problem is simply that the party's unfaithful voters have been unwilling to accept being part of or supporting a Social Democrat-led government. As many reshuffles as you like will not solve that problem.
