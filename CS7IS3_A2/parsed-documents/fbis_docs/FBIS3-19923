Party secretary Mona Sahlin is making no secret of that. In a few weeks, she will present an electoral platform, or an electoral manifesto, to the SDP's executive committee. It will not be a multicolored brochure with gold-plated promises. "No, we're promising no strange reforms, but we're promising to fight tooth and nail to create new jobs, and that will mean sacrifices," she told DAGENS NYHETER. "We have been very careful about not promising anything that would mean new costs. It's not reforms but rather the opposite we have to implement if we win the election." Sahlin does not think any party will promise gold and green forests. Instead the campaign will be a contest to see who can save the most, she believes. Right To Work Restored "The party that can most convincingly show that sacrifices will lead to new jobs will win the election," she predicted. Sahlin and Ingvar Carlsson will not commit themselves to rescinding every hateful act of the Riksdag and restoring the good old SDP order. This will only occur to the extent that it does not cost money. Thus far, then, in statements or motions, the Social Democrats have issued the following messages: - The right to work should be restored. That means that the probationary period should be reduced to six months and that employers on their own may not exclude any employee from the seniority list when pink slips are handed out. - "School money" should be abolished. That means that private schools can no longer ask towns for support for their activities. - The new grading system for elementary schools should be rescinded. - The family doctor law and the right of private specialist physicians to set up practices should be abolished. The right to freely set up private child-care centers might also be halted. Home Care Allowance To Be Abolished In some instances, the Social Democrats will save bundles of money by rescinding nonsocialist decisions: - The home-care allowance is to be abolished if it has now been implemented. - Double taxation on stocks will be reintroduced and the capital gains tax on sales of stocks will be increased. - The property tax will not be abolished in 1995. - Capital income taxes will remain at 30 percent. Furthermore, the Social Democrats will hike the national tax for those with high incomes from 20 to 25 percent. This is a "temporary" tax hike but Sahlin would not say when the tax rate would be reestablished. That depends on how quickly the deficit in the labor market fund can be eliminated. She said, however, that she was ready to defend a tax cut for those with high incomes the day Sweden's economy is back on its feet. Opposes National Federation of Trade Unions "Yes, I get to go out and say that now we have carried the burdens together to achieve long-term financing of the labor market fund and now we will return to the 1990 tax reform." The Social Democrats have explicitly pointed to one promise they are not making in this year's campaign: The compensation level for unemployment insurance will not return to 90 percent as quickly as the National Federation of Trade Unions [LO], among others, has demanded. "I'm not promising any timetable, but it will not be during this fiscal year or the next one," Sahlin said. First, compensation for those with long-term illnesses will be increased from 70 to 80 percent. "I hope we can implement the increase during the term of the next government." That would extend through 1998. Nor are promises made to families with children. Might the promised 1991 increase in the child-care allowance be shelved for good? No Pension Promises "The increase is not included in the electoral manifesto, but I will continue to be a politician for another 40 years," Sahlin replied hurriedly. The Social Democrats have not forgotten the old promise about extended insurance for parents, she stated. "It's clear we haven't. But that lies far in the future." No promises are made to towns and county boards about higher state subsidies even if the Social Democrats strongly criticized cuts that were made in 1993. No promises are made to retirees that pensions are to be completely inflation-proof and not just 98-percent so. Fighting for Growth "We are now fighting for a new pension system and to achieve growth so we will be able to deal with the pensions of the future," Sahlin stated. No promises are made to tenants and owners of single-family homes regarding a new home financing system. "But we want to push for the discontinuation of the 3-billion-[kronor] interest-rate subsidy that the nonsocialist government wants to implement in 1994-96," Sahlin remarked.
