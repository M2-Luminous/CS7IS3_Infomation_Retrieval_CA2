He said of many authoritative Italian commentators that "they only get excited when they talk about Italy's national interest," in the petty nationalist belief of rediscovering a nonconfessional foreign policy to set against the Catholic foreign policy desired by Alcide De Gasperi, which has lasted for the past 40 years. Thus they ultimately discover a foreign policy confined to what can be seen barely beyond our borders, in a merely geographical vision of international politics. Against geopolitics, he sets geoeconomics, which does indeed have "global horizons." He vigorously defended Italy's busy activity within the international bodies: "We are among the countries that have benefited most from these alliances and from having taken part in a system within which certain rules prevail," he said. [Bugno] But the concept of the national interest is not now so uncommon. The new Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, cited the U.S. national interest to explain the Americans' support for Boris Yeltsin. And in Germany and Poland some emphasis is placed on this concept. Not to mention France, where this emphasis has never been absent. [Andreatta] I too perceive the dangers of a renationalization of European foreign policy. In the way international relations are taught in the universities, in the mentality of the new generations of diplomats, there is something of a taste for a return to the "art deco," the "Liberty" period in foreign policy. This, because the great war of religion which divided the world is over, and so too is the imposition of an order founded on the basis of the strict mathematical logic of the nuclear equation. Personally, I regard all this with anxiety. Of course, I could even admit that, as an exercise, France's gamble over GATT was textbook material. They were able -- for the sake of nonvital interests that had become important only for reasons of domestic policy -- to play a well orchestrated game which, however, placed in jeopardy negotiations that lasted 2,800 days and that made it possible to lower world tariffs by almost 40 percent. At one stage they hinged on France's problem with increasing its grain exports by a few million tonnes or denying American films access to European television channels. The French jeopardized the negotiations with their parliamentary filibustering methods. Such conduct does not seem to me to belong to the mainstream of history. However, it cannot be assumed that all countries can succeed in doing that which France succeeded in doing, keeping in mind that France has in its past someone called De Gaulle, who always did such things. For these reasons I believe that Italy -- a country that is very superficial on matters of security and defense and that will never equip itself with the financial and political resources to organize a security based entirely on its own management capability -- must be careful not to become isolated. Hence the concern with strengthening the framework of international organizations. [Bugno] How? [Andreatta] I will give you some examples. We proposed to the British that the Central and Eastern European countries be admitted to the second and third pillars of the Maastricht Treaty, that is, those that concern a common security and foreign policy and justice and domestic policing policy. This, reversing the old belief that first we should build the economic Europe and then the political Europe. This is not possible with these countries. This also entails a division of labor, however -- leaving to NATO the predominant, though not exclusive, task of reassuring the Russian moderates, and to the European Union that of providing the intermediate countries with economic, political, and institutional relations, providing them with such substantive ties as to make it clear even to the most expansionist of the Russians that, beyond Belarus and Ukraine, there lie territories already integrated into Europe. Furthermore, with a view to the NATO summit in Brussels we wrote to American Secretary of State Warren Christopher and NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, notifying them that we would be asking that part of the budget resources be reserved for financing research into nonlethal weapons to be used in peacekeeping operations and for the use of techniques for border control and for crime control in guerrilla warfare. We also placed emphasis on the issues of security in the Mediterranean; in the future it may be possible to offer the countries of the Mediterranean some kind of association analogous to the Partnership for Peace, the instrument now being used to stabilize relations with Eastern Europe. [Bugno] Are these all Italian initiatives? [Andreatta] Yes, but the newspapers do not talk about them and the parties are not interested. On no less than two occasions in October I was summoned before Parliament just to hear the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] criticize me for having failed to side with the rebels in the White House in Moscow against President Yeltsin. According to the PDS, the Italian Government should have corrected its pro-Yeltsin stance, shared by all the Western countries, and sided with the old Parliament. But nobody asked me to come to discuss the issues of the NATO summit. And yet dozens and dozens of people in Rome and Brussels, in the embassies, are dealing with these issues precisely in order to put forward Italy's viewpoint, what you say is the national interest. [Bugno] What conclusion do you draw from this? [Andreatta] As far as the PDS is concerned, the sole conclusion is that this party has reached as far as the economic and foreign policy lines that have been the constants of the past 40 years. I do understand that this could constitute so-called "innovation" for the PDS. It certainly is not so for the country, and it is not so for me, since I have always demanded a balanced budget, and when I was treasury minister I used to have to increase the deficit by 1-2 billion lire just to make the PCI [Italian Communist Party] -- now the PDS -- happy and thus to try to have the finance bill passed. Nor is there anything new abut the obvious observation that Eastern Europe and Russia are now having to pay for the rebirth of the liberal ideal that lay behind the revolutions of 1848 but which never prevailed in Russia. [Bugno] You have often drawn a distinction between the national interest and the general interest. Why? [Andreatta] The reason for this distinction is that I would like to demystify the idea held by some elites that their own interests coincide with those of the country. What lies behind the writings of some commentators is in fact the same mistake as Henry Ford made when he said that Ford's interests were America's interests. No, interest is something that has to be built politically, in a complex manner, just as the concept of the common good is a complex one, too. And in a democracy viewpoints can change in time. [Bugno] I must ask you this question. Somalia and Bosnia: These are two issues that are prompting much discussion. [Andreatta] Somalia: My position has been to avoid turning a technical and military disaster into a rupture with our allies. The easiest solution was precisely to raise the flag of national interest and, as at Sigonella, to become famous for 15 minutes and to damage Italy's relations with its own partners and with the United Nations. I consider it one of my merits that I have succeeded in blocking any suggestions in this direction, avoiding encouraging the Italian people's worst instincts -- that oscillation between broad internationalism and an escape into peevish isolation. We have countered errors without challenging the authority of the United Nations. And this corresponds to Italy's general interest. [Bugno] What about Bosnia? [Andreatta] None of the warring sides seems to want to stop, and the international community, by facilitating supplies, is in fact ensuring that matters continue that way indefinitely. And yet in December peace seemed to have been achieved. But it is the Muslims now who are opposing a division on the basis of 33 percent to each of the warring sides, as they themselves demanded during last year's negotiations on board the Invincible, and the danger is that they will no longer obtain even that. But you cannot impose the desire for peace on a people when each of their components has suffered terrible iniquities.
