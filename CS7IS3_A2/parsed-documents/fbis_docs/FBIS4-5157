FBIS4-5157 "dreas068_c_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 North Korea CPRF Urges Release of `Patriotic' ROK Students CPRF Urges Release of `Patriotic' ROK Students SK0704053394 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0449 GMT 7 Apr 94 SK0704053394 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland [CPRF] published its Information No. 647 Wednesday, in which it accused the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique of more frantically intensifying fascist crackdown upon patriotic students who rise in the struggle for independence against the United States and for national reunification. According to the information, the South Korean fascist clique, some time ago, arrested about 450 students affiliated with Hanchongnyon (the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils), who had staged a demonstration urging a peaceful solution to the "nuclear issue" and protesting the deployment of U.S. Patriot missiles in South Korea. And they walked away students affiliated with the Pusan and South Kyongsang Provincial Federation of General Student Councils, who had protested against the rice market opening and shipment of Patriot in South Korea and urged a total dismantlement of the U.S. military bases. They also imposed heavy penalties upon students, who had exchanged messages with students of Kim Il-song University in the North and taken the lead in demonstrations calling for anti-U.S. independence and national reunification, on "charges" of violation of the "National Security Law". The puppet clique's brutal suppression and harsh punishment are an open challenge to the patriotic students of South Korea who aspire after independence, democracy and reunification, the information says, adding: "We strongly hold that such anti-reunification, anti-democracy fascist laws as the `National Security Law' should be abrogated in South Korea and all the patriotic students arrested on unwarrantable charges be released without delay."
