A spokesman for the presidency here was unable to give casualty figures, saying reports varied widely with some mentioning thousands of dead. In Istanbul, Bosnian Vice-President Eyup Ganic told AFP that ``hundreds'' of people had been killed during the course of three chemical attacks on Gorazde on Saturday. ``This is genocide under UN supervision,'' he said. Ganic added that he would be flying to New York on Sunday, at the demand of President Alija Izetbegovic, to demand an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council. [passage omitted]
