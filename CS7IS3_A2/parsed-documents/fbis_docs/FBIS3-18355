[Bossi] Ours is a great idea, a strong idea, a great project to give Italy a liberal-democratic majority and government. I believe that this idea is so strong that it cannot fail but to advance confidently. It is stronger than protagonists and men, and perhaps stronger even than their particular positions -- and why not? -- than their egoism and their tawdriness. [Reporter] So you see Bossi and [National Alliance leader Gianfranco] Fini coming together again? [Berlusconi] I see a project that will win. [Reporter] All the political forces want to name the prime minister. Does Forza Italia also want its own prime minister? [Berlusconi] No, I believe that Italians will choose a prime minister with their votes. If, as I forecast looking at today's opinion polls, the freedom alignment or the group for good government -- that is, the liberal-democratic group -- will win. The votes obtained within this group will indicate who should be given the task of forming a government.
