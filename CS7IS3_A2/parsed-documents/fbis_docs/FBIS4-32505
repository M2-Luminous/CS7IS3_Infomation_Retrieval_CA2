How is this fact perceived by a man who should have, by virtue of his top position in the government commission for granting licenses for the export and import of arms, a sufficient overview of this matter? [Gerinca] Every dealer tries to find a buyer, and, when he finds one, he tries to keep his name a secret because there are many possible ways in which to disrupt a potential deal. The producer or the seller, not to mention the buyer, therefore prefers not to talk about it. I believe that so far it has been a good thing for Slovakia, too, that less was said and more was done in this respect. [Sporer] Done? But if we take into account the small amount of spare parts manufactured in our arms factories (about 5 percent of the original volume of production before conversion) that the factory managers are declaring, then not even the "doing" could not have involved sales on a large scale. [Gerinca] I agree. And, besides those, only surplus equipment from the arsenal of the Army of the Slovak Republic [SR] was being sold, and that is basically coming slowly to an end--in view of the time limits set by international agreements. [Sporer] The heavy weapons manufactured in Slovakia were sold by the state through Omnipol. Omnipol was represented and still is represented mainly by people who today live in the Czech Republic--dealers with contacts in specific countries and with specific customers. It is logical, therefore, that if, for example, an Arab or some other client used to arrange deals over dinner with a man from Omnipol, he will not turn today to the prime minister or the manager of an arms factory if he wants to place an order but again to the person with whom he used to deal. Is the loss of Omnipol a big loss? [Gerinca] Not just a loss but also it literally constitutes harm to Slovakia's interests. These people, after all, are still working for those who pay them, and their priority is to close deals that benefit their organization, that benefit Omnipol. They sell arms manufactured in the Czech Republic, but they also try, naturally, to sell those from other countries--business is business--to make the maximum profit for Omnipol, even at the cost to our producers. We try to prevent it by creating our own system. In Slovakia, only a Slovak firm or basically a legal entity can trade in weapons commodities. [Sporer] But can Omnipol participate in the sales in the role of a middleman? [Gerinca] It must have a middleman from our companies who will buy on its behalf. And then Omnipol would proceed with the sale. [Sporer] The ideal thing would probably be to get people from Omnipol to work for a similar firm in Slovakia, wouldn't it? [Gerinca] Omnipol is an established organization. People who work there have a certain security. Slovakia does not have a similar organization established on world markets. In certain ways, our merchants who made a name of sorts for themselves in business tried to get those people for themselves. But offering something that might be successful in the future was not enough compared to a certain thing. [Sporer] From this standpoint, how do you rate the activity of the former minister of general engineering and, before that, director of the VHJ ZTS [Economic Production Unit Heavy Machinery Enterprises], Mr. Luhovy? [Gerinca] As far as I know, Mr. Luhovy is doing business in retirment. He wants to help Slovakia, and he lives in Slovkia. [Sporer] Was he rejected? [Gerinca] No. Of course, the question remains how such help can be utilized. I do not know what Mr. Luhovy is doing today. I am not in contact with him. [Sporer] As an alternative to Omnipol, the company Armex was created in Slovakia almost seven months ago, with the honorary deputy chairman of the SNS [Slovak National Party], Vitazoslav Moric, named by the government to be its manager. But so far it has not been issued a license by your commission.... [Gerinca] It is difficult to comment on it because Armex so far has not applied for any license. Obviously it has a reason. [Sporer] A reason? [Gerinca] In the case of Armex, the state retained 100-percent participation in its business dealings. The idea was to create an organization composed of representatives of five ministries, whose task would be to assume responsibility for trade matters and, as far as possible, a certain coordination of these activities. The start of its activities was tied to the start of production in the arms factories. However, not even the basic prerequisites were present--I have in mind, among other things, the question of experience and initiative in the work of the people involved--and, as a result, the organization is not functioning. It was probably unrealistic to expect anything else from state officials who were delegated to take on this duty. [Sporer] Is it within the authority of the government to make personnel changes in Armex? [Gerinca] Of course. The government created Armex, it named its general manager, and it can even dissolve it. [Sporer] How many companies in Slovakia are trading in arms? [Gerinca] It is difficult to give a specific answer because there is the matter of getting permission to sell. This is granted by the SR Ministry of Interior. When someone is granted this permission to sell and buy arms commodities, it can ask the government licensing commission to issue a license for these activities. But there are also private dealers who sell weapons only on SR territory, merely on the basis of a permit to carry on a trade--they do not have to have a license. But I emphasize that those who want to export or import arms from abroad must apply to our commission for a license. This possibility is mostly used by firms that trade in short hunting rifles. But a license can also be applied for by a company that generally trades in other products but wants to do this as an additional activity. [Sporer] In the Martin and Dubnice arms factories, they are saying that, after the conversion, the territories the Slovaks left were taken over by the Poles, and the Russians have become very active. In addition, the Czechs, too, by way of the RDP Group, are actively trying to market their improved T-72 tank. What chance does our heavy-machinery industry have of making a comeback? [Gerinca] It is true that the Poles, who did not go in for conversion, filled the void. However, the Russians, who never stopped developing tanks, already have the production of T-80 and T-90 tanks on the line. Moreoever, they own an excessive amount of equipment. We have to admit that we actually never developed new types of tanks, only tanks that were already established and that could be, so to speak, "shown"--Herefore, also the T-72 tanks. If we want to succeed, somebody will have to invest in development. [Sporer] "Somebody" who? [Gerinca] The buyer who is interested in starting production. Abroad it is a matter of course that this role is assumed by the army of the country that manufactures the arms. It rearms itself and gradually also gets the opportunity to trade with other countries. But the budget of our Army, no matter how high it may appear in comparison with other departments, simply does not provide the possibility of adding new equipment. Therefore, it cannot help in starting up arms production, either. It is, of course, another thing when a factory improves and produces, say, a tank turret (Dubnica), for which it finds buyers among armies equipped with T-72 tanks. It is up to the managers of arms factories to calculate whether a similar trade would be profitable for them. [Sporer] There is talk about losses in the tens of billions that the state suffered as a result of the conversion. Briefly, how can arms factories cover this loss, in your opinion? [Gerinca] Their managers know best about that, but it would probably not be appropriate for me to merely reply that the yearly turnover in high octane gasoline was about 20 billion Czechoslovak korunas. A better example is provided by the people from Martin. It is said that, when they manufactured and sold a tank, they made as much as they would if they manufactured and sold 40 tractors today.
