Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos announced Mr. Papoulias' one-day visit, noting that the goal is to seek an immediate, viable, and peaceful solution to the Bosnian problem. Milan Milutinovic, ambassador of New Yugoslavia in Athens, this morning conveyed a request from Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to former Prime Minister Konstandinos Mitsotakis to undertake an initiative for the solution of the Yugoslav crisis. Last Saturday [12 February], Mr. Mitsotakis had a long telephone conversation with Mr. Milosevic. After his meeting with the honory chairman of New Democracy Party, the Yugoslav Ambassador expressed the hope that Mr. Mitsotakis will finally undertake an initiative, but did not define the content of this initiative. However, a little later, the office of the former prime minister issued a written statement in which Mr. Mitsotakis calls upon the Government to undertake an initiative for a solution to the Bosnian crisis by virtue of the fact that it occupies the presidency of the European Union. Mr. Mitsotakis stresses that now, as was the case in the past, Greece must play its role decisively in defending peace. He further points out that Greece cannot remain a speechless and weak observer of historic developments which concern it directly and probably dramatically. Diplomatic observers have described this statement as Mr. Mitsotakis' first move in Slobodan Milosevic's request for mediation, and they were sure that it will be followed by contacts between the former prime minister and the Government and probably by some initiatives abroad.
