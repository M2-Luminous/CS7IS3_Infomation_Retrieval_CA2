Russia's Foreign Ministry views these talks as a major direction of its efforts in the current year, he stressed at Thursday's briefing. He pointed to Moscow's intention to "contribute to the endeavors to create favorable conditions for next year's conference on extending the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty." As Karasin said, Moscow believes that a "treaty on banning nuclear tests should be timeless and have no ceilings; that it should provide for an effective system of control and for strict sanctions against its violators." According to the diplomat, "Russia favors a realistic and evolutionary approach to developing the system of international control over the implementation of a treaty on banning nuclear tests, which would provide for using at its initial stage seismic methods, instruments for surveying radioactivity in the atmosphere, and on-site inspections." "Some countries have suggested a number of additional methods, but this may considerably increase expenses connected with control system and lead to delaying the drafting of the treaty," Karasin said.
