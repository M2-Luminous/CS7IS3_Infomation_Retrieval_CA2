However, for the most part, they do not seem too keen on housing Haitian refugees. Nobeline Brewster tells us more: [Begin recording] [Brewster] Media reports say the United States is asking Caribbean nations to provide a temporary or permanent home for the Haitians and part of a military or police force. This as efforts intensify to get rid of the military and restore democracy to the French-speaking nation. Government officials in Barbados wouldn't say much more than that the Haitian crisis is being discussed, but other Barbadians are quite vocal. Senator Dr. Erskins Simmons says we should open our doors to as many Haitians as we can. Dr. Simmons argues that Haiti was home to many Caribbean people in the past and the region must now return the favor. He says we could seek financial assistance from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees. [Simmons] Lots of Barbadians, Vincentians, Jamaicans migrated to Haiti in the early days. We put strain on their social systems when we were under pressure. We owe it to them to take some of the strain off of their social systems now because their social systems cannot absorb the type of problems that they have. [passage omitted] [Brewster] But many other Barbadians are not too keen on allowing Haitians here, but all seem to agree on Barbadian participation in an international force. [Unidentified speaker] If you have armies and your neighbor is in trouble, and the armies are not going to help the neighbor, what is the sense of having the army? This is a tailor-made situation where we can use an army effectively. Of course, we cannot fight [words indistinct], but certainly we can be there to give moral support to whichever developed countries are willing to restore democracy back to Haiti again. [passage omitted] [Brewster] The U.S. is currently conducting exercises off Haiti and political analysts say they may be preparing for a military intervention. U.S. President Bill Clinton says such intervention may be used to get rid of the defiant Haitian Army. [end recording]
