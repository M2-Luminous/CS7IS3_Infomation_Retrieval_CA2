Dr. Amal 'Uthman, minister of insurance and social affairs, gave the figure in her statement before the Consultative Council's committee on services. The minister did not say whether the figure was the result of a decline in the juvenile crime rate or whether there were other causes. AL-JUMHURIYAH weekly posed the question to officials responsible for juveniles in police stations and welfare institutions in an attempt to monitor the facts. The details of the news item said there were fewer than 200 juveniles between the ages of 15 and 18 in welfare institutions throughout the republic. The constant decrease in this number has forced the ministry to convert some juvenile institutions to other functions. In addition, there are governorates where there are no juveniles who have received judicial sentences. Figures Public Security reports for 1993 state that a total of 17,896 juveniles committed acts of theft, murder, prostitution, etc. The reports show that 74 boys and 12 girls under age 7; 132 boys and 15 girls under age 11; 1,000 boys and 93 girls under age 13; 5,000 adolescent boys and 411 adolescent girls under age 16; and 9,000 adolescent boys and 439 adolescent girls under age 18 committed crimes punishable under the juveniles law. Among them were 3,347 who committed crimes of deception, 5,181 who committed crimes of battery, 285 who committed crimes of murder and wrongful injury, 3,487 who committed crimes of public transport or vagrancy, 216 who committed crimes of vandalism, and 65 who committed crimes of violation of trust. There were 7,031 juveniles who committed various misdemeanors. Security reports for 1993 also recorded a definite increase in the number of crimes and juvenile perpetrators compared with 1992. The reports recorded 257 felony cases committed by 299 juveniles in 1992. There were 6,327 juvenile misdemeanor and vagrancy cases. There were 15,536 male juveniles charged and 1,274 females. Public Security reports also list 27 juvenile welfare institutions and homes under the Ministry of Social Affairs. The penal institution at al-Marj contains at least 500 juveniles. It is administered by the Prisons Department and Juvenile Police Administration. Juveniles who have been judicially sentenced are committed to it. It is the only institution whose case records show not a single case of escape. This is because it enforces the closed institutions law and is under strict security guard. Other juvenile welfare institutions and homes: For example, according to security reports, 70 juveniles have been committed to the al-Jizah classification center by judicial sentences. There are 120 juveniles in the education home in al-Jizah, 100 juveniles in the youth institution in 'Ayn Shams, 50 juveniles in the people's education home in Old Cairo, 50 girls in the institute for minors charged in cases of prostitution and out-of-wedlock pregnancy, 115 girls in the al-'Ajuzah girls' institution, and 50 male and female juveniles in the al-Jizah observation home. The security reports also say that an average of 5,841 juveniles run away every year from juvenile welfare institutions and homes. Social and security studies and research confirm the evidence of the public security reports. The most recent study on juvenile misdemeanor was done by Colonel 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, head of the Juvenile Investigation Department in Cairo. The field study proved the phenomenon of juveniles running away and that there are insufficient welfare homes and refuges to absorb delinquents, vagrants, and orphans. Those who manage most of the institutions have a low level of qualification, and budget and facilities are meager. Increase in Juvenile Crimes We asked Col. 'Uthman 'Abd-al-Khaliq, "How many juveniles come in every day?" He replied: "There is no fixed daily statistic, as the number depends on police campaigns. For example, there were 180 juveniles arrested on 27 March. On 31 March the number dropped to 35." Is there an actual decrease in the number of crimes committed by juveniles? 'Atiyat Muhammad Salih, head of police women social workers at the department, replied: "The answer definitely is no. There is a clear increase in the rate of crimes of various kinds and degrees of seriousness committed by juveniles. "The decrease has occurred only with regard to cases of subjection to delinquency including: begging; gathering cigarette butts; sleeping in streets, large water pipes, ruins, and garbage bins; and other cases that lack the element of crime." She continued: "Also, there are gaps in Law 31 of 1974. In the 20 years since the law was passed, the community's scale of values has changed due to social, economic, and psychological circumstances. "For example, anyone caught for the first time is handed over to his guardian, who is warned to watch his behavior carefully. If the same juvenile is apprehended again, the guardian has the right to lodge a complaint within 10 days, in which case the guardian will be charged with the misdemeanor of negligence and pay a fine of only 5 pounds." Where Do They Go? How does the chief woman social worker of the Cairo police explain the phenomenon of juveniles running away from social welfare institutions and homes? She answered: "I personally am asking that the welfare institutions belonging to the Ministry of Social Affairs be abolished. More private associations should be established, such as the My Children Association (Gam'iyat Awladi) in al-Ma'adi, the Firm Handhold Association (Gam'iyat al-'Urwah al-Wuthqa) in the Citadel, and other associations that provide physical, social, educational, and psychological care for youngsters. "Most of the institutions under the Ministry of Social Affairs financially, technically, and administratively can be seen as schools to graduate children who are even more delinquent and more dangerous to the community. "These institutions are unable to absorb juveniles because of meager resources and mismanagement. An institution's board of directors does not meet at the scheduled times. No one knows the secrets of these institutions that are managed in an inhumane manner. "We may remember that most of the victims of the American tourist Mr. William were children who had run away from institutions. "In addition there are repeated cases of flight due to inhumane treatment in most of these homes. This treatment comes across in the stories of the young runaways who are reapprehended and return to us. These cases are documented in police station books. The number of runaways is at least 50 percent. "One of the most important factors aiding juveniles to run away is that most of these institutions implement an open-door system without guards. "The 'Ayn Shams popular institutions and girls' welfare homes are open institutions. Juveniles in them are allowed to go out once a week. Usually a juvenile goes out and does not return. "Juveniles in other institutions are allowed to go out daily and carry on their normal lives." Major General Hamdi al-'Awadi, director of the Cairo police investigation department, thinks that the lack of a strict security guard at the institutions contributes primarily to juveniles running away. "Most of these institutions are negligent in performing their mission, which is to reform and educate juveniles, caring for them medically and psychologically, so that they become good citizens in the community. "There are many reasons for this. Most important, the role of Social Affairs is limited to establishing juvenile institutions. There is no attention to protecting the basic rights of juveniles, respecting their feelings, and providing the specialized expertise to undertake their care. "Young people are extremely sensitive to the labels with which they are branded. Criminology investigations dealing with the process of applying criminal labels have shown the damage that results from characterizing young people permanently as miscreants or criminals." He continued: "This necessitates the formation of a high commission on juveniles. It should include all the organizations and agencies active in the area. There should be full coordination between the juvenile police, the juvenile courts, the Social Affairs Ministry's social welfare institutions, and private associations. Confessions of a Runaway Ahmad is a child who has run away from the 'Ayn Shams institution. We met him at the Cairo Juvenile Police Station. Ahmad, who had run away, refused to give his full name for fear of punishment when he returned--first from the director of the institution, then from its seven supervisors, its head, and finally the head of the ward. Punishments are many and varied in the institution. There is hair shaving; cleaning and sweeping the wards; chores and services in the homes of officials; sweeping, cleaning, and shaking out bedding and carpeting; polishing furniture; washing dishes; and hanging out laundry. On returning, a juvenile gets a grade. Four disobediences mean being beaten with a cane across the hand or being made to kneel for hours on end. Full meals are not served. The food listed on paper is quite different from what is distributed to the juveniles. A sick juvenile gets no doctor or medicine. He works and sweeps even if he comes down with a fever. Human Crime I left the juvenile police station at al-Azbakiyah for the juvenile welfare homes. The Egypt Society for the Protection of Women and Children depends financially, technically, and administratively on the Ministry of Social Affairs. The society is located on Dikirnis Street, off al-Khalifah al-Mansur Street, in the Safir section of Heliopolis. It includes the Women's Protection Home, registry no. 94 of the year 1969, as well as al-Amal Nursery School, license no. 469 for the year 1986. Before going, we telephoned the home about whether it would accept a young girl. The woman official agreed to accept the girl at once, without asking any questions. According to regulations, this home is supposed to accept only girls who have been sentenced by the juvenile prosecutor. We hesitated for a long time before entering the home--an old-fashioned villa with faded walls flecked with yellow paint that gives you a feeling of gloom and mystery. In the neglected garden are scattered remains of old toys, a broken swing, and a few chairs on which a child could not sit without falling and being hurt. The villa has two stories. The reception room and the nursery school are on the first floor. There were four girls, aged between four and five. One supervisor was in charge of all the children's affairs. We asked about the director of the home. "She's not in," answered a young girl. "Who is in charge here now?" "I," she answered, in a tone tinged with fear and caution. The girl exchanged long glances with the supervisor of the nursery school. She left us and went into a side room. We asked the nursery school supervisor: "Where are the girls who live in the home?" "There are no girls now. But there is a girl coming in a while." She meant the imaginary girl whose coming we had announced! A few moments later, a woman in her thirties appeared--a mute. She came from the upper story and was accompanied by another woman. The two women were, as they say, skin and bone--withered features, in their eyes a sad downtroddenness reminiscent of the system of forced labor and humiliation. We asked again for the name of the directress of the home. The nursery school supervisor replied: "Ghadah Muhammad Amin. She lives permanently on the top floor of the home. There is a room for her and two rooms to receive visiting girls." We asked to see the register of visiting girls, but the girl on duty suddenly returned to ask us to make an urgent telephone call. The girl dialed a certain number, and Hilmi Mahmud Salih, the society's director, told us over the line: "You are forbidden to obtain any information. Photographing is forbidden." We would have to see him first at the general administration in Qasr al-'Ayni! I left the room where the mute woman was sitting. We tried to communicate with her by signs and glances. The woman said quite innocently, "Pregnant girls come here. They leave immediately after giving birth." We asked the overseer of the nursery school, "Where do the girls go after giving birth?" "As soon as a girl gives birth, the directress of the home turns the infant over to the police station, and they take charge of placing it in an orphanage. The mother leaves the home." We left the home stunned. How could girls be allowed to go out and risk becoming delinquent again and again? We got the answer from someone in the vicinity of the home. A man who refused to allow his name to be mentioned told us: "The circumstances of this home are suspicious. It accepts any girl carrying an out-of-wedlock child. When she gives birth, she becomes a domestic servant with the knowledge of the home, which takes her entire salary and gives her a small part of it. "I know lots of stories about the girls who leave the home--'Abir, Hiyam, and many others. Some obey the orders of the directress; others run away onto the streets, into the unknown." The man continued very nervously: "Last week there were 10 girls here. Day before yesterday there were three. Where did they go? "Those here permanently are the mute and her companion. Their health has been ruined from working night and day. "Those in the early months of pregnancy manage to work in domestic service. The others do chores around the home until it comes time to give birth." Papa Wahid Al-Hurriyah Institution for Social Care has more than one shift. The 75-year-old institution used to be called the Fu'ad I Orphanage of the Egyptian Society. Its head in 1919 was 'Ali Pasha Mahir. It subsequently became the 'Ayn Shams Social Administration. It is under the Ministry of Social Affairs. Although we entered the institution without an appointment, we saw healthy children living a normal life in a peaceful house in which one could feel real, not artificial warmth. When we asked some of them whether they were happy here, they answered with childish innocence: "Very happy, thanks be to God. We all love Papa Wahid." We learned that Papa Wahid is the director in charge of al-Hurriyah Institution and that it accepts children who are victims of orphanhood, divorce, poverty, or illegitimacy. The director was the only child of parents whom he never has seen all his life. He does not even know what they look like. He was raised with his paternal uncle and his wife. There he learned the meaning of orphanhood and the cruelty of discrimination between children living in one house. When he grew up and obtained a crafts school diploma, he decided to repeat the General Secondary Examination and enroll in the Social Service Institute in order to devote himself to caring for these youngsters. For 32 years he has been caring for children whom he regards as his own. There are 95 children in the institution, and they call him "papa." His own son lives in the building and spends his spare time with his "brothers" in the home. They are children against whom no court rulings have been passed, but their social and economic circumstances have made them orphans although their fathers and mothers are still alive. The director of the institution said very bitterly: "Although the home has room to accept at least 120 children, insufficient resources prevent us from accepting any but critical cases. The budget is very meager and not fixed, and the money never stretches far enough. The result is that there are neglected victims--children exposed to delinquency of whom the streets are full." A child is subjected to thorough social investigations before being committed to the home. The institution accepts children from the age of six. It provides them with care and gives them opportunities for a normal education from primary school until graduation from university or technical and crafts schools, depending on their talent and ability. Despite the meager budget, the institution seems model. Original oil paintings by College of Fine Arts students living in the home adorn the walls. In the extensive long halls, one sees only flowerpots of green plants that the children carefully tend. The kitchen is extremely clean and lacks nothing. The refectory has clean and serviceable tables and chairs. The dormitories are divided according to the children's ages. All the dormitories remind one of four-star hotels. A social specialist supervises each wing. There is a mosque for prayer, a study hall, and a dispensary equipped with various kinds of drugs. We saw not a scrap of paper on the floor and not a single fly. What most drew one's attention were the children's expressions, which radiated joy, contentment, and a sense of confidence and security. We asked the director of the home whether the institution's rolls recorded a single case of running away. Khalid and Sayyid answered together: "Once Mr. Richard came here. He took us to al-Amal Village in Madinat Nasr. We couldn't stay there, although the institution is pretty and has everything. We came back because Papa Wahid and our brothers and sisters are here. We all love each other." How has the home's director been able to provide these facilities for the children of the institution? "The budget from the government is very meager, amounting to 120,000 pounds. Half of it is allocated to employees' salaries; the other half to feeding the children. "I therefore turn to the method of nonmonetary contributions in kind. Charitable people provide us with all the needs of the children: clothing, school equipment, medicine, even some kinds of food, candy, and drinks that the children ask for." I asked how he explained the running away of children. He answered: "It results primarily from the policy of the institution's management--whether the institution can become a factor attracting the young person by providing love and affection first, and then comprehensive care."
