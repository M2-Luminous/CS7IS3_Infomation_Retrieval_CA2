The Free Democrats say that for this reason, the only option for our side is to accept the UN secretary general's third alternative, which provides for the end of talks on the confidence-building measures and a return to discussions on the basis of a set of concepts and Butrus-Ghali's map. The political council has learned that the UN secretary general's report reveals the extent of the unacceptable concessions made by our side. It adds, however, that one can see a significant and positive point made in the report--the lack of political will by the Turkish side for a solution to the Cyprus issue.
