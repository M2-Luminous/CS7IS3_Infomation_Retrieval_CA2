Scores of elderly people, some in their 80s, seeking reparation for Japan's occupation of China during the 1930s and 1940s, began descending upon the Japanese embassy in Beijing just after it opened yesterday morning. The authorities had apparently been tipped off about the protest and surrounded the embassy with about three dozen uniformed policemen and several times that many plain-clothes police. Protesters from across the country were supposed to converge on the embassy at 10 am, but they started arriving much earlier and were bundled off into jeeps and taken to a police station near the embassy, according to the sources. They said some 300 petitioners appeared at the embassy and more than 100 were taken away by police. Some of the protesters detained were carrying letters addressed to Prime Minister Hosokawa. Gao Minke, 82, who works in a hospital in southern China, wrote in a protest letter that Japan should apologise for war crimes and compensate relatives of the victims. Mr Gao, who was detained, said he lost more than 10 relatives at the hands of Japanese soldiers in a rural part of Jiangsu Province in 1938. An estimated 10 million Chinese died during the occupation. Others tried to deliver copies of a letter signed by the Preparatory Committee of Chinese Civilians Seeking Reparations from Japan saying "problems left over by Japan's war of aggression have not been solved". "We representing 500,000 living sufferers and relatives of the dead victims, resolutely request that you give a formal apology to the Chinese people and a definite reply to the reparation demands of the Chinese civilian victims," the letter to Mr Hosokawa said. Police also intercepted more than 100 protesters at a train station in the southern part of the city, the sources said. Tong Zeng, a researcher in his 30s who has been one of those behind the movement for Chinese civiliansto get billions of dollars in war reparations, was reportedly taken into custody yesterday. When contacted last night, his family said: "He is out and will be away for a few days ... They have taken him away." Those detained came from as far afield as Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang in the south and Liaoning Province in the northeast. Most were in their 60s and 70s. It was not clear whether they were still being held last night. "They didn't really understand why they were detained. They thought, they were just delivering a letter and expressing their opinion. It's totally legal," said a source close to the protest. Diplomats inside the embassy said they were unaware of the protesters' presence. China gave up all claims to war reparations from Japan when the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1972. Still many ordinary Chinese believe their government was wrong to do so. During this session of the National People's Congress, 32 representatives from the province of Hubei presented a war reparation proposal to the motions department of the rubber-stamp parliament calling for a Japanese apology and reparations. The delegates argue that while their government has given up its rights to reparations, there is nothing in any accord with Japan which rules out civilian compensation. The delegates and followers of the preparatory reparations committee demand US$180 billion in compensation. Mr Hosokawa is expected to meet Prime Minister Li Peng today, and President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Zhu Rongji tomorrow.
