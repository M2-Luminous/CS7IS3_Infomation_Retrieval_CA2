The sources said North Korea apparently test-fired the second modified Chinese "Silkworm" missile around Thursday [2 June]. The missile was fired from the North Korean east coast toward the Sea of Japan. North Korea launched a similar "Silkworm" missile in the Sea of Japan on Tuesday. The sources said the aim of the test was not clear, but added that it probably has little political significance since such tests are often conducted in close succession. The sources said the government is also closely monitoring North Korean preparations for medium-range ballistic missile tests.
