"The important thing is the sovereignty of states. Instead, we should close ranks because Peru is a sovereign country; it has been totally autonomous and independent since 28 July 1821, and this independence must be maintained," the president said. Friday, U.S. Ambassador to Lima Alvin P. Adams read a note from his government to journalists. In his note, the ambassador urged Peru to respect the autonomy of the judicial branch and stated his interest that the people responsible for the "brutal La Cantuta assassination" receive justice. Fujimori said that in "Peru, the branches of the state are independent." He said this during a brief television statement while aboard the airplane that took him to Lima from the city of Puno, in the extreme Andean south, where he dedicated some community works. Fujimori stated: "There are laws in other countries that other countries do not find appropriate, as has happened in our country." The chief of state defended his position that the Army personnel involved in the abduction and death of the nine students and a professor from Lima's La Cantuta University in July 1992 be tried by a military court, thereby avoiding "the political handling some want to give this case." Fujimori indicated that military justice will punish the guilty. Legislation regarding the La Cantuta case was approved last Tuesday by the government controlled Congress; on Thursday, Fujimori announced it, and on Friday, the Supreme Court of Justice penal bench confirmed it by a majority vote. The law has been challenged by the victims' relatives, the Peruvian opposition, most of the press, the Lima Bar Association, and the National Human Rights Coordinating Board because "it is contrary to the new Constitution as well as the country's current laws."
