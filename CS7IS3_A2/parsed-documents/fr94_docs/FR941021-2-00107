Pleasant, in Fayette and Westmoreland Counties, PA. CSX and W&LE certify that: (1) No local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can be rerouted; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or by a State or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in complainant's favor within the last 2 years; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental report), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 and 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to government agencies), and 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication) have been met. As a condition to this exemption, any employee adversely affected by the abandonment shall be protected under Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen, 360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether employees are adequately protected, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed. This exemption will be effective November 20, 1994, unless stayed or a statement of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) is filed. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues, 1 statements of intent to file an OFA under 49 CFR 1152.27(c)(2), 2 and trail use/rail banking requests under 49 CFR 1152.29 3 must be filed by October 31, 1994. Petitions to reopen or requests for public use conditions under 49 CFR 1152.28 must be filed by November 10, 1994. An original and 10 copies of any such filing must be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. In addition, one copy must be served on Charles M. Rosenberger, CSX Transportation, Inc., 500 Water St., J150, Jacksonville, FL 32202, and William A. Callison, The Wheeling & Lake Erie Railway Company, 100 East First St., Brewster, OH 44613. 1 The Commission will grant a stay if an informed decision on environmental issues (whether raised by a party or by the Commission in its independent investigation) cannot be made before the exemption's effective date. See Exemption of Out-of-Service Rail Lines, 5 I.C.C.2d 377 (1989). Any request for a stay should be filed as soon as possible so that the Commission may take appropriate action before the exemption's effective date. 2 See Exempt. of Rail Abandonment_Offers of Finan. Assist., 4 I.C.C.2d 164 (1987). 3 The Commission will accept late-filed trail use requests so long as the abandonment has not been consummated and the abandoning railroad is willing to negotiate an agreement. If the verified notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void ab initio. CSXT and W&LE has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's and discontinuance's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Commission's Section of Environmental Analysis (SEA) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by October 26, 1994. A copy of the EA may be obtained by writing to SEA (Room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser at (202) 9276248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA becomes available to the public. Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision. Decided: October 14, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Vernon A. Williams, Acting Secretary.
