He was even arrested in Konjic once, suspected of selling ammunition to the Serbs. Our brief meeting in Sarajevo was used for this interview, and we first asked him to comment on conflicts between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]. [Divjak] It was difficult for members of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO to engage in a conflict, which is a result of political desires to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina that fit into the longing for Greater Serbia and Greater Croatia. I have been in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and in the Supreme Headquarters from the very first day, and all the while, we have been trying to involve patriots in the defense of Bosnia-Herzegovina in its internationally recognized borders. Unfortunately, some estimated that Bosnia-Herzegovina should be divided on principles originating from Garasanin, on the Serbian side, and from World War II, on the Croatian side, not taking into consideration that all three nations have lived and will continue to live in these parts. It is true that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina became even more complex and that the attitude of Europe and the world toward it has changed since the conflict began between the extreme parts of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army. These conflicts have escalated to the point where former friends and allies who were fighting the common aggressor together are now perpetrating massacres against each other, killing women, children, old people, and burning each other's homes. Unfortunately, politics determined some relations that do not suit the nations of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The aggressor from the east is best at this game, the aggressor which began all this -- the fascist SDS [Serbian Democratic Party] and parts of the former JNA with extremists from Serbia and Montenegro. Joint goals of the HVO and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the beginning of the war are now distanced due to some territorial pretensions and divisions, due to the demand that a part of the territory be controlled by some kind of Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian (Muslim) republic, which is definitely not a referendum wish of the majority of people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Those conflicts will continue for a while, for neither the Geneva talks nor any other negotiations under the pressure of Europe and the world can produce any results. Conflicts will stop only when all three warring factions agree to sit together and have peace. That can happen in six months, in a year, or more, but conflicts will rage on until the world stops interfering. [Bosnic] Tell us something about the Tuzla recipe for relations between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Divjak] This is not only the case in Tuzla; fortunately, it is also alive in the Bosnian Sava Basin region and, to some extent, in Sarajevo. It is a recipe of how one should live in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Representatives of the Croats and Muslims on this territory have convinced us that they can and will live together. There is yet another fact -- a new-old initiative on the Bosnian nation is emerging. Many people spoke about the new national organization. That is not bad, but the Croats, Muslims, and the Serbs must not lose their national identity. [Bosnic] As a soldier, what do you think about the Geneva talks? [Divjak] This is an attempt to forcefully solve the problem of Bosnia-Herzegovina, former Yugoslavia, and the Balkans, and not according to the wishes of citizens and nations that have been living here for centuries, but according to the desire of the old lady Europe. Let me remind you that in February 1993, at the time when he was leaving his "throne," U.S. President Bush talked to Russian President Yeltsin about the division of interest spheres according to the Yalta agreement. Past relations in Europe, in the Balkans, and in former Yugoslavia mirror the relations between the United States and Russia. When Russia pulls, the United States pushes its allies and injects a couple of billion dollars into Russia. Even recently, the United States gave $2 billion to Russia. We know about the historic friendship of Russia and Serbia and that Serbia depends on Russia, and Russia is protecting the "endangered" Orthodox Church from Islam and Catholicism. History accepts the destruction of a nation, ethnic cleansing, and those who want integral Bosnia-Herzegovina -- the Croats and the Muslims -- will suffer. Ethnic cleansing in this war mostly affected the Muslims, but the Croats will not be spared either. [Bosnic] Are you a Serb or an orthodox Bosnian? [Divjak] I have always been a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina. I have lived in Sarajevo for 28 years, and all the while, I feel that I am a citizen without losing my national identity. I have never accepted any nationalism and I never will. I am a citizen of Sarajevo, a citizen of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Bosnian and a Herzegovinian. I feel like most honest people in these parts, if you will. Bosnia is my only country; I have no other. The Croats, the Muslims, loyal Serbs, all those who live in it, have the same right to my country. [Bosnic] Is there anything you would like to say to the Croatian public? [Divjak] Since this interview will reach the public in Croatia and parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina in which there are mostly Croats, I would like to clarify something. The Chetniks -- the Serbian side -- accused me of being a criminal of war and a traitor of the Serbs, while the Croats accused me of being a member of the JNA intelligence service, a communist, and a founding father of the Muslim army. In this war, I am fighting for the equality of the Croats, the Muslims, and those Serbs who fight in the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army and in the HVO. My intentions were never aimed toward any single nation in particular. Accusations that I advocated conflicts between the Croats and the Muslims are senseless; this is propaganda by those who are against integral Bosnia-Herzegovina in its borders. Even if it is divided under pressure, those who live here will arrange their relations as they have done for centuries. Present leaders of all three national parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina will be forgotten, but Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain.
