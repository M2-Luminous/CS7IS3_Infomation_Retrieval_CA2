Our meeting with the EU [European Union] Commission was very productive. Following the discussions we had, we will finalize our program, which will be submitted in April of this year. I believe that it is a common assessment that Europe today is at a critical crossroads. The broader international and European milieu are characterized by instability, uncertainty, strong political developments, and bloody conflicts. The European economy is going through an extended crisis and recession. It is the worst crisis since World War II. Unemployment has reached unacceptable, explosive levels with an obvious danger of instability in our social structure and our democratic norms. In general terms, this is the framework in which the Greek presidency is called upon to act during this third presidency, which our country now assumes. There is a need for more democratic and effective bonds, less bureaucracy, and greater decentralization of the decision-making process. There is a need to give the European Union the appropriate means to allow it to respond to its internal problems and face the big international challenges. There is a need to enforce our cohesiveness and coherence by respecting the national identities and particularities and the differences of opinion where they exist. The European Union is a group of countries where each member has its own contribution to make to the European construction process. We need to bring the European Union closer to its citizens and maintain the model and tradition of the European society and be in a position to respond to the justified expectations of our citizens regarding the right to work and have satisfactory compensation. The Greek presidency will also seek to use the existing framework and the capabilities offered. At the level of our internal development, our primary goal is to contribute to the efforts to deal with the recession and unemployment and to attempts to strengthen employment. We will base our efforts on the initiatives that have been undertaken thus far in this direction; the development initiatives adopted in Edinburgh and Copenhagen; the results of last European Council, which was very important; on the plan to fight unemployment we have adopted; as well as on the EU Commission's White Paper, especially after its unanimous acceptance by the 12 EU governments. We place particular importance on the ideas contained in the White Paper which, in our opinion, gradually overturn the philosophy of pure liberalism that prevailed in recent years. These ideas helped in the formation of a new development model where the local initiative, corporation, state, representative organizations and the European Union are called to play an important and supplementary role. In foreign relations, we are called upon to complete the negotiations for the accession of Austria, Norway, Finland and Sweden by 1 March 1994. It is a very ambitious goal; and if needed, the negotiations will be speeded up and special summit meetings will be organized with the four prospective members. In our presidency, we are also interested in the expansion of the European Union to the south. Therefore, we will pursue pre-accession talks with Cyprus and Malta. We are also interested in upgrading relations with the other Mediterranean countries. We will continue the joint action which began during the Belgian presidency. Yugoslavia occupies the highest priority. The Middle East issue also demands constructive support by the European Union. It has already been decided to hold an international conference in Rodhos during the spring of 1994 for businessmen to identify development projects in the Middle East. We will also use the possibilities of preventive diplomacy by contributing to the preparatory conference that will take place in Paris in the spring in the CSCE framework. Finally, the Greek presidency will continue the transatlantic dialogue beginning with the meeting of 11 January between the president of the European Council, the presidency of the European Union commission and the U.S. President. It should be noted that preelection campaign period for the European Parliament will begin a few months after the assumption of the EU presidency. This calls for the systematic implementation, and in some cases acceleration of our program, given the importance we all place on these elections. There could be a need to help the European Parliament in preparing for these elections. Furthermore, allow me to say, outside the text, that the meeting between President Delors, the EU Commission members and the Greek Government was particularly important and satisfying, it was indeed productive. I believe that we have identical views on almost all issues, all points. Our goals are common and we hope to achieve them. Thank you. [Delors] Ladies and Gentlemen, I will not use up the time for the questions. I just want to thank the prime minister and his government for their welcome and renew once again the message of friendship to the Greek people which I mentioned yesterday and say that the Greek people are a full member of the European family. I think that this morning we have done a very good job. The European Union of course has a lot of problems, it has a lot of members, many partners; and we should set order and priorities. The White Paper should be followed as a framework for action in order to help the European economy with unemployment and other issues, including the European political, economic and monetary union; the common foreign policy and other issues; the issue of Yugoslavia; the issue of security in Europe and the Mediterranean; the Middle East issue; and finally the thoughts and ideas about a Greater Europe. The Greek presidency has also added its desire to see European construction advancing, and I think that this term is beginning with a lot of confidence. During the summit meeting in Corfu we will discuss the various issues I mentioned in the framework of European action at the community level, but also at a national level. Thank you very much.
