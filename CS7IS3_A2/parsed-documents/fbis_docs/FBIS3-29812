Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the new Yugoslav Communist Movement, said in an interview with the KCNA correspondent in his country on Feb. 7 that it was a base betrayal to a partner of the dialogue and an intolerable challenge to the fair public opinion that the United States pronounced an ultimatum, crying for socalled full-scope inspections and "sanctions". The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can never be solved by pressure and threat, he said. The Mali-Korea Friendship Association said in a statement on Feb. 4 that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cannot be solved by means of force and only the dialogue is the realistic way for the solution. It strongly urged the United States to immediately come out to the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks. The Zambia-Korea Friendship Association strongly demanded in a statement on Feb. 5 that the United States stop a very dangerous row of pressure upon the DPRK, implement the promise to the partner of the dialogue and discharge its duty in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreement. Ranbir Singh, chairman of the Indian Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, said in an interview with the KCNA correspondent in his country on Feb. 4 that the United States must give up its unreasonable pressure regarding the "nuclear issue", stop the provocative moves for another war and honestly accede to the DPRK-U.S. talks.
