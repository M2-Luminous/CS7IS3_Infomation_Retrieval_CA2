FBIS4-27195 "dreas104_a_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-104 Daily Report 29 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Demands for Hata's Resignation Continue Demands for Hata's Resignation Continue LDP Chief Reiterates OW2905092294 Tokyo KYODO in English 0906 GMT 29 May 94 OW2905092294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, May 29 KYODO -- The chief of the largest opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) called Sunday [29 May] on the minority government of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to resign en masse before the summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial countries in Naples in July. LDP President Yohei Kono said during a lecture in Niigata, north of Tokyo, "what can the minority ruling government promise at the G- 7 summit meeting? Can it carry out what it has decided? We must consider whom we can dispatch to the international community with responsibility." Kono told reporters after the lecture that he supports an early dissolution of the House of Representatives for a snap general election, saying the current government does not reflect the opinion of the people shown at the general election last summer. The president of the LDP, which was ousted from power for the first time in 38 years by the coalition last August, also said his party and the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ], the second largest opposition party which withdrew from the ruling coalition in April, share the view that the minority government should be replaced. Former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the LDP said Sunday it would be difficult for the LDP to form a coalition government with the SDPJ as the majority of its members are supported by labor unions. "The majority of SDPJ members of parliament depend on labor unions (for their seats)," Watanabe said during a Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) television program. "So it is practically impossible to form a coalition unless agreement is reached with labor unions." Watanabe, who heads the third largest LDP faction, said "it is also wrong to think dividing the SDPJ would be easy" to form a coalition with some SDPJ lawmakers. The LDP's main support still lies among leading business circles, while the SDPJ draws its strength from Japan's labor unions. On prospects for the timing of a general election, Watanabe said it is reasonable that the next general election be held under the new electoral system since only the passing of a bill is needed for demarcating the boundaries of a new single-seat electoral map. Watanabe said, however, that Hata has "the arbitrary right to dissolve" the Diet, suggesting an election might be held under the current multiseat system. The Diet in January legislated a package of electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system for the lower house with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional representation. An independent panel of experts is currently dividing the nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat districts. LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori showed understanding of SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi Murayama's call for an agreement between ruling and opposition parties to hold a general election under the current system, delaying the introduction of the new electoral system until the following general election. Mori told a news conference in Sapporo, Hokkaido, in northern Japan, that "it is one idea that the leaders of responsible parties gather and take such a measure (as Murayama offered)," suggesting his willingness to cooperate with the SDPJ. Mori also said the LDP should cope with a general election under the current electoral system "if Hata dissolves (the Diet) of his own accord." Three senior LDP legislators said Sunday if the Hata cabinet resigns en masse, the LDP may nominate a non-LDP candidate as premier. Former Construction Minister Taku Yamasaki, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato and former Posts and Telecommunications Minister Junichiro Koizumi made the suggestion on an Asahi TV program. The trio have created a new policy study group. Yamasaki said, "(the next government) will be a caretaker cabinet until the next general election and will be a de facto coalition cabinet of the LDP and the SDPJ. But it will be difficult for a candidate from the two parties to assume the premiership." "Michio Watanabe will be a strong candidate (if he quits the party and becomes an independent)," Yamasaki said.
