He emphatically pointed out: In implementing the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and of the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional Party Committee, it is necessary to clearly understand the situation, strengthen unity, engage in arduous struggle, overcome difficulties, strengthen the building of socialist democracy and the legal system, and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. At the forums held on the evening of 7 January and on the afternoon of 9 January, Liu Zhenyi, Zhang Yingqi, Liu Zhen, Yang Xilin, Jia Cai, Yu Xinglong, Wang Tianen, Yi Junhua, Wang Xiumei, Liu Xiaowang, Wuerjilang, Liu Zuohui, Yun Gui, Feng Yuqiang, and Zhou Guangde and other comrades gave speeches one after another on the current situation, the hot topics of the people's concern, economic construction, and the building of democracy and the legal system. At the forums, Comrade Wang Qun frequently chipped in and gave speeches. Wang Qun said: Comrades have offered many very constructive suggestions. You have done a lot of investigation and research work, have the practical situation well in hand, and reflected the opinions and demands of the masses. Wang Qun pointed out: The situation in our region is currently excellent. This is the common understanding of all. However, there are still many difficulties and problems that merit the great attention of the regional party committee, the regional people's congress standing committee, and the regional government. Regarding the existing problems, the most crucial issue involved is to treat them correctly and solve them properly. For example, the problem on the gap between the development rate of our region and that of the developed areas must be solved with the common efforts of the higher and the lower levels of the whole region. Our Inner Mongolia has a great momentum for development, and our development pace will not be slow in the days to come. First, we have a definite foundation and a clearly-defined correct development strategy; second, the state's input in Inner Mongolia is very big; and third, the state has adopted special policies in the border minority areas. We should have full confidence in narrowing the gap between our region and the developed areas. Wang Qun stressed: Leaders at all levels should pay great attention to the pricing issue, control the prices realistically, and strengthen management. Wang Qun stressed: We should resolutely and continuously grasp the anticorruption struggle because this is a major affair which may help us win the trust from the masses. It is necessary to estimate problems on corruption in a fact-seeking manner. While recognizing the basic fact that the main aspect of our party is good, most of the party members and cadres are clean and honest in performing official duties, and the corrupt elements inside the party only account for a small number, we should also fully understand the seriousness and harmfulness of the corrupt phenomenon inside the party, realistically regard this struggle as a strategic task, and grasp it unswervingly until good results are achieved. Wang Qun pointed out: We should recognize that the current temporary difficulties are problems which we have met on our road of advance in the course of reform, and that they can be solved. All of you should correctly approach these problems, and distinguish between the major and minor aspects and the essence. We should solve these problems with the ideology of serving the people wholeheartedly and on our own initiative in an effort to promote reform, development, and stability. Wang Qun pointed out: We should give full play to the role of the people's congress standing committees in the course of the four modernization drives. In accordance with the decision of the chairmanship meeting of the regional people's congress standing committee, we will organize deputies of the National People's Congress in our region and some regional people's congress deputies to inspect leagues and cities in the near future. We will solve the practical problems concerning the people's production and living in the course of implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central Committee. Wang Qun called on leaders at all levels, all trades and professions, and all sectors to act in line with the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th Party Central Committee and of the Eighth Enlarged Plenary Session of the Fifth Regional Party Committee, pay attention to the situation and unity, boost enthusiasm, overcome difficulties, accelerate reform, and develop the economy. Wang Qun called on the people's congress standing committees to act in line with the objective of building the socialist market economic structure, coordinately carry out our legislative policies and reform policies, accelerate the pace of legislation, enhance the legislative and law enforcement level, and promote the establishment of the socialist market economic structure. It is necessary to conscientiously and repeatedly study Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, arm our minds and guide our work with the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, emancipate the mind, and seek truth from facts. We should also give less empty talks, do more practical work, actively support and supervise the "government, the higher people's court and the people's procuratorate" to successfully carry out their work, give full play to the role of the people's congress standing committees as the organs of state power in the localities, and enable the people congress system to play a greater role in the course of building the two civilizations.
