SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On September 19, 1991, final regulations under section 401(a)(17) (TD 8362) were published in the Federal Register (56 FR 47603). On August 10, 1992, the IRS published in the Federal Register (57 FR 35536) regulations proposing to extend the effective date of the final regulations under section 401(a)(17) (and related regulations), generally to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1994. On December 30, 1993, proposed regulations under section 401(a)(17) amending the final regulations were published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69302). Written comments were received from the public on the proposed regulations. Because the only request for a public hearing was withdrawn, no public hearing was held. After considering all of the written comments received, the proposed regulations are adopted as modified by this Treasury decision. Statutory Authority This document contains amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 1) under section 401(a)(17) of the Internal Revenue Code (Code). These regulations reflect the enactment of section 401(a)(17) by section 1106 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA '86), and subsequent statutory changes made by section 1011(d)(4) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) and section 13212 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA '93). These regulations are issued under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. Explanation of Provisions 1. Overview Section 401(a)(17) of the Code provides an annual compensation limit for each employee under a qualified plan. This limit applies to a plan in two ways. First, a plan may not base contributions or benefits on compensation in excess of the annual limit. Thus, a plan does not satisfy section 401(a)(17) unless it provides that an employee's compensation in excess of the annual limit is not used in determining allocations or accruals for a plan year to which the annual limit applies. Second, the amount of an employee's annual compensation that may be taken into account in applying certain specified nondiscrimination rules under the Code is subject to the annual compensation limit. Thus, for example, an employee's compensation in excess of the annual limit is disregarded in determining the accrual rates for defined benefit plans under those nondiscrimination rules. The annual compensation limit applies separately to each group of plans that is treated as a single plan for purposes of the applicable nondiscrimination requirement.
