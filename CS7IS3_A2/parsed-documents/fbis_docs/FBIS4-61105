It would be premature to think that Moscow will affiliate to this program in May or June, the deputy secretary general noted, addressing the opening of the headquarters of the Partnership for Peace coordinating center in the Belgian city of Mons, but we hope that the Russian flag will fly here alongside the others this summer. Previously this same building in Mons housed the center which directed the Live Oak military program, which was designed to repulse Moscow in the event that it tried to blockade West Berlin. It symbolized the division of Europe, U.S. General George Joulwan, NATO supreme allied commander Europe, stressed at the ceremony, but in the future it will be a symbol of the new NATO and the new Europe. It seems that the Russian Government, the NATO deputy secretary general noted, is now unanimous over the need to affiliate to Partnership for Peace, which 14 East European countries have joined. It seems that NATO regards the participation of General Vladimir Zhurbenko, deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, in the NATO military planning committee session in Brussels as one of these signals: Among other things that session examined questions of cooperation with the East. In the weeks ahead, military men from the East European states will begin preparing for joint exercises in Mons and participation in peacekeeping operations and other NATO events. The first maneuvers within the Partnership for Peace program will be held this summer.
