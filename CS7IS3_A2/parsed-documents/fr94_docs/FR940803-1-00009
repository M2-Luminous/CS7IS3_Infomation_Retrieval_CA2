FR940803-1-00009 FR940803-1-00003 2. Would this change facilitate or hinder future licensing of LLW facilities? 3. Would this change have any adverse impacts on public health and safety and protection of the environment? 4. Would the responsible regulatory agency lose any control over the disposal site if it is not owned by the Federal or State government? 5. Are there valid reasons why land ownership requirements for NRC-regulated disposal sites should be more restrictive than EPA-regulated hazardous waste, municipal waste, and Superfund facilities, where government ownership is not usually a requirement? 6. How would private ownership affect liability for a disposal site? 7. Would States' concerns about assuming liability for a disposal site be alleviated by this proposal? 8. Would deletion of the State or Federal ownership requirement eliminate governmental liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) for releases from the site and, if so, does this change have any adverse impacts on public health and safety and protection of the environment, including after the active institutional control period? 9. Should the NRC consider allowing a site owner to be only the licensee, or broaden the proposal to allow other private ownership? 10. Should there be a time period after which the licensee can request termination of the license, even though the land might remain in private ownership? 11. If the NRC were to implement this proposal, are the surety requirements contained in 10 CFR Part 61, Subpart E, sufficient? 12. Under ยง61.80(e), all records are to be transferred to Federal and/or State agencies at the time of license termination. If the license remains in effect during the active institutional control period (licensee is site owner), would there be a need for this records transfer?
