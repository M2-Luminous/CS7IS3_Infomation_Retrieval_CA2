They realized progress in tourism but have hit snags on the customs and labor force issues. The heads of the two delegations left for Tunis and Israel to consult with 'Arafat and Rabin respectively and will be back in Paris on 25 April. We have asked Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'], the head of the Palestinian delegation to the Paris talks and who is also the head of the PLO Economic Department, about the achievements of the talks this week. He said: [Begin recording] [Quray'] In this round we realized progress in tourism. A paper has been agreed on. We have no big problems in this matter. The difficult problem which is still unsolved concerns imports and related policies, trade and its effect on the overall economic policy. We have agreed on a principle which I consider to be important and a gain, namely, that there must be an imports policy, a Palestinian customs policy regarding a number of commodities that are basic and important for development and for the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the occupied territory, in terms of pricing, customs tariff, permitting imports, and other things, with the Arab countries and the world. However, we have hit a snag on defining these commodities with Israel. This has been and still is a problem. We hope they will reconsider their position on it next week. The other topic is the currency and banknotes. Here also the talks stopped at a previous problem, namely, the Palestinian currency and the Shekel, will it be a legal tender [previous two words in English] or a usable currency ['umlat tadawul]. We insist on the term usable currency. I can say that these are the difficult basic points in these negotiations. When we come back we will talk about the other issues. [Correspondent] During this round, you also discussed the issue of the Palestinian labor force. What have you achieved in this regard? [Quray'] Concerning this point, we raised the issue of the suffering and pain of our workers because of the closure of the territories and the Palestinian worker's inability to go to work, whether in the occupied territory or in Israel, and the serious reflections of this situation on the overall peace process. We presented this in the previous round and we have repeated this in this round and they showed some flexibility in this regard. They allowed 5,000 workers to return to work. A budget for employment has been allocated for Gaza and the West Bank, about $10 million. The fact is that this is just some sort of a sedative, it does not solve the problem. Either the employment process is organized or new job opportunities for the Palestinian worker are created within the national economy. Such a creation is our ambition, but it is a very difficult process and will not be realized by mere wishful thinking. It needs construction, projects, infrastructure, and other things. I am not going to discuss economic science here. The feasible issue is for this process to be organized with Israel. This is what we are considering in the negotiations. It has not been decided yet.
