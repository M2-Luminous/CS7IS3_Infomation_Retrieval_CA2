The chairman of the Geology and Mineral Resources Committee, Mr. Antony Panayotov, discussed the introduction of new technologies in gold and copper ore mining. He familiarized Australian companies with the possibilities to participate in auctions of oil prospecting blocks in the Black Sea shelf. Australian businessmen were interested in possible cooperation in the sphere of transport and in leasing planes of the Balkan air carrier. This year the largest quantities of imported raw sugar are likely to come from Australia, said Mr. Valentin Karabashev. Draft agreements on the avoidance of double taxation and mutual protection of investments were presented to the Australian government three months ago. According to the deputy prime minister, they will be signed in the near future. An agreement on the avoidance of double taxation has already been signed with Indonesia, now another step will be made towards free trade between the two countries. Interest towards the Bulgarian delegation was unexpectedly lively. "We might possibly start importing rubber directly from Indonesia, without the mediation of Singaporean companies," Mr. Karabashev pointed out.
