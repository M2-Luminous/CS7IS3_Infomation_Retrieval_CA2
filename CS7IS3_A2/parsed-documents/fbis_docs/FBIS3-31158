The opposition Hungarian Socialist Party (HSP) collected 50,000 authenticated signatures for parliament to include a media bill in its agenda. Meanwhile, the government has also submitted its media bill draft, to be discussed by Parliament in the near future. HSP's Ferenc Kosa wants Hungary to have a media law before the election campaign. If not, supervisory committees could be set up to ensure ethical campaigning on radio and television, he presumed. Miklos Haraszti of the main opposition party, the Alliance of Free Democrats (AFD), noted that the government had a new version of the media law differing from the original consensus at several points. As the bill can only pass if supported by two-thirds of deputies, he felt preliminary consultations were inevitable. Attila Zsigmond of the ruling Hungarian Democratic Forum said the HDF was ready for discussions, but he was not authorised to announce this officially.
