In principle this jump can be considered insignificant in percentage terms. However, it is of special note that the demand for hard currency 5 January reached a record level for the entire existence of the exchange - initial applications to buy stood at $182,850,000, but the final volume of transactions was recorded at a level of $180,550,000. Thus are we witnessing a new flurry of heavy demand on the currencies market, with attendant consequences for the ruble? I think that to draw such a conclusion would be premature. It is entirely possible that the record volume of hard currency trading could be caused by the factor of delayed demand -- after all, the exchange had not operated for almost a week. On the other hand, the influence of another factor on the change in the situation on the currencies market is being viewed extremely seriously by specialists. It is well known that an instruction from the Central Bank of Russia banning the sale of goods and services for foreign cash anywhere on the country's territory came into force at the beginning of the year. And many trade firms -- and also wholesalers supplying goods from abroad -- will be forced right from the first days of the new year to convert their ruble proceeds via the exchange so as to settle with foreign suppliers and maintain trade turnover at its previous level. This should objectively lead to an increase in the demand for hard currency and to a growth in the daily levels of exchange dealing. Incidentally, here it is worth noting the formerly unheard-of law-abiding behavior of Russian businesmen, since the overwhelming majority of hard currency stores refused to accept foreign cash after 1 January. Well, if anyone refuses to accept the rubles of Russian citizens anywhere, V. Smirnov, deputy chief of the Central Bank of Russia's Main Administration for Currency Regulation and Currency Control stated, the bank calls on such citizens to inform it about such incidents, and the most decisive measures will be adopted. However, so that misunderstandings should not arise, let me point out that the Central Bank's instruction banning hard currency trade has some exceptions. They regard stores situated in the extraterritorial zone, that is to say, after you have been through customs, or, say, foreign airlines selling tickets on Russian territory. All the same, discrimination against the Russian ruble can now be considered to have been eradicated in principle in our country. But here the question naturally arises: What is there to balance the increase in the supply of rubles from trading organizations on the currencies market, so that the exchange rate of Russian money should not fall even lower? Only the more active sale of foreign currency by Russian citizens could be such a counterweight; according to specialists' estimates, the public have already accumulated several billion dollars' worth. But such a change in behavior patterns cannot, unfortunately, be observed at the moment. At any rate, in the words of S. Stolyarova, chief of the "Rossiyskiy Kredit" bank's department of exchange outlets, at the end of last year their volume of sales of hard currency to the public reached a near-record level. And in the first two-three days of the new year the trend has not changed. Nevertheless, it can be hoped that the situation will change markedly in two-three weeks' time, when the majority of customers of former currency stores will be forced to begin exchanging their dollars or German Marks for rubles. After all, they will not want to give up frequenting expensive stores and restaurants, and foreign cash will not be accepted in these places. However, there is no doubt that a radical change in the behavior patterns of Russian citizens with regard to foreign currency will occur only when the dollar ceases to be a means of accumulation and when inflation falls to a level covered by interest rates on bank deposits. In this sense December has aroused in us real hopes; after all, inflation was at its lowest for the whole of the past year -- only 12 percent per month.
