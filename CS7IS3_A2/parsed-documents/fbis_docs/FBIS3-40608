Arguments are rampant over appointing heads of states just like in the Mogul era. The unfortunate historical event of a mother and daughter fighting for power is also happening within the People's Party. The scene of a mother being insulted by the daughter for power is emerging before us. This disgusting scene has made the ugliness of many struggles for power in history to be less grisly. Let us save the details of this fight and the identification of its script writer and directors for some other time. All this is happening at this very sensitive and dangerous time when Pakistan is entangled in two extremely important problems. Efforts to make a decision about Kashmir have been accelerated all over the world. Millions of Pakistanis and Kashmiris have been waiting for the resolution of the Kashmir issue for the last 40 years. Kashmir is the place where the humble servants of the Prophet are sacrificing their lives daily. They are occupied fully in working for their goal of gaining independence from India and joining Pakistan. Not a day passes without depressing and heartrending news from some corner of the world about the future of this Kashmir. Many important people have visited Pakistan and India during the last few months to talk about it. First, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robin Rafael came to Pakistan, followed by a visit of a deputation led by Roger Godsave, chairman of the British Parliament's committee on Kashmir. They visited the United States for one month before coming to Pakistan. On Monday, Pakistan's worst enemy Senator Pressler arrived in Islamabad with some other senators. Pressler thought it important to visit India before coming here. His activities will be clear to us in a couple of days; however, diplomatic circles in the capital have firmly declared that whatever Benazir Bhutto, Ghulam Ishaq Khan, and smooth-talking Mirza Aslam Baig could have done during the 90 days has been done. Now whatever is happening is just an occurrence behind the facade of which Benazir will do with Kashmir what she has done with the nuclear program. We can inquire later whether she had the support of all these powers that had blessed her when she had frozen the nuclear program. During the visit by Richard Godsave, who is considered the leading expert on Kashmir in Great Britain, the elements associated with those who militarily help the freedom fighters were very happy. The opinion he expressed about Kashmir while in Pakistan deserves our attention. He announced loudly that "this problems cannot be resolved with UN resolutions. Those who believe that the Kashmir issue can be resolved with UN resolutions should get out of the dream world. The world has changed a lot. We must accept facts and look for new ways. The United Nations cannot resolve this issue. Anyone who says that the Kashmir issue can be resolved by putting economic restrictions on India is living in fool's paradise. India's relations with Europe and the United States are very close. It is important to think with a cool head at this point." Roger Godsave threatened: "If Pakistan remained adamant on its emotional stand on this issue, it will get nothing." Commenting on his visit with the president and the prime minister, Roger said: "I feel that Pakistan needs to be flexible in its stand." Roger also said that the people of Kashmir are the ones who are actually affected by this problem, and, until they are involved, this issue cannot be resolved. The proposal for a three-party discussion was presented by Sayyed Ali Gelani, an Azad Kashmir leader, at the beginning of this year. However, this proposal was first presented in the United States of America. It was organized by Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai, the executive director of Kashmiri American Council. It is said that this proposal was just like the proposal Nawaz Sharif had presented for the nuclear program. The organizers also proposal were also sitting far away. Roger Godsave had presented a formula for resolving the Kashmir issue during his trip to the United States. This formula in itself is a masterpiece. Godsave claims that the Kashmir issue can be resolved if this formula is followed. According to this formula: 1. The secretary general of the United Nations has to appoint a special emissary for Kashmir. This emissary will visit both sides of Kashmir in addition to visiting India and Pakistan to get a first-hand account of the situation. He is to present his report to the secretary general. This emissary will also be responsible for cooling the emotional attitude of both countries leaders on Kashmir to enable them to take further steps to resolve the Kashmir issue. This emissary also have to make both countries to agree to call back their armed forces out of Kashmir. 2. In the second phase, steps are necessary for India and Pakistan to recall their armed forces from the area of Kashmir under their control. 3. The UN peace force should be sent to Kashmir as soon as both countries recall their troops. 4. The peace force will stay in Kashmir for five or ten years and this whole region will remain under UN control. During this period, conditions will be made conducive to making a decision on Kashmir's future. An interim government under the UN supervision will be established there until the situation improves. 5. A referendum on both parts of Kashmir will be conducted during the fifth phase so that the people of Kashmir can decide on their future. 6. The most important aspect of this formula is that the representatives of the Kashmiri people will participate in every important discussions during this interim period. This proposal is clear about its positive and negative aspects. The proposal also makes it clear what it means to keep the whole Kashmir under the United Nations for five to ten years. We also know what changes will happen when the United States, hiding behind the facade of the United Nations, establishes its feet in this region, and in what tone the United States will talk to Pakistan, India, and China to get them to agree to certain conditions. The United States will do whatever it wants during these five or ten years, and it is not difficult to guess what the result will be when the time for a referendum comes. The referendum, if it is held, will not be according to the UN resolutions. As is clear from Roger Godsave's statement, this referendum will be held in the light of the new developments and to look for a "new resolution" of the problem. It is not a hidden fact that many Pakistani politicians are also thinking in the same vein. Those who know are saying with confidence that Benazir's dealings with the United States over resolving the Kashmir issue is the cat that will be out of the bag in the middle of 1994. This is not a new thing; this pressure was increasing since the beginning of Mohammed Nawaz Sharif's government. The path that Mohammed Nawaz Sharif took to get out of this pressure was to look for new friends around the world. He had found new friends in the form of Japan and Korea. However, the results of his efforts are in front of the nation. There is no one here to stand up to the U.S. pressure. The whole U.S. effort is to get India out of this appalling situation which it is in now in occupied Kashmir. One way to achieve it is to send a message of disappointment to those struggling in Kashmir by holding talks between India and Pakistan. It is a different story as to the kind of impression the Pakistan media will present of these talks. The main purpose of this exercise is how India uses these negotiations while they are in progress and later. If an agreement is reached to declare Siachen a nonmilitary zone during the first phase, it would be progress toward a solution that the Americans have been presenting to us for the last few years. Division of Kashmir is part of this agenda. What they are saying is: 1. A situation must be created for paving the way toward implementing Roger Godsave's formula. 2. Kashmir be divided over religion. 3. Line of Control be recognized as a permanent border. 4. By ignoring the UN resolutions, a situation would be created whereby Kashmir is neither under Pakistan nor under India. It is not possible to implement solution number two as this might result in creating several "East Pakistans" within Kashmir. The Muslim population has spread into two or three parts of Jammu and Laddakh in addition to the Kashmir valley. Any division in this situation will result in additional riots and the situation will become worse. Similarly, there is no logic in accepting the Line of Control as the permanent border nor will it satisfy any side. Suggestions number one and four appear to be the same suggestion presented in two different ways, and efforts have been accelerated to implement them. It appears that some influential supporters for this proposal have been created in occupied Kashmir. At the same time, those who raise the slogan for Pakistan in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir have been so discouraged that the Azad Kashmir leaders are telling the volunteers that they are willing to accept a solution that the leadership of occupied Kashmir will approve. This news was published in the national papers; however, it was not given as much attention as should have been. No one tried to find out the purpose of it all. What kind of solution is the leadership in occupied Kashmir proposing? This is not limited to talks with India at the government level. Benazir Bhutto has been able to participate in those talks because of Nawaz Sharif's pressure. However, efforts are being made to make the U.S. solution acceptable. Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto is trying to convince herself that she has learned a lot in the past and will not repeat those mistakes that hurt her in the past. At the same time she is making all the arrangements to encourage the same kind of uncivil and criminal activities that had brought the people out in the streets in 1977. How does the PPP [Pakistan People's Party] want to treat the institutions established according to the constitution and laws? One can guess from the incident which occurred last Monday at the Election Commission office. Three PPP assembly members are responsible for it. Chowdehry Ishfaq, Pir Mohammed Aslam Bodha, and Shahid Nazir wanted the Election Commission to issue notification about their winning the election immediately so that they could take the oath without waiting. When they arrived at the Election Commission office, neither the chief election commissioner nor the secretary of the Election Commission Humayun Khan was there. They ordered the personal assistants to the election commissioner and the secretary to issue these notifications at once. When these lowly workers explained that it was not within their authority, they went to see Joint Secretary Sardar Durani. They cursed him and threw a paper weight at him. The PPP lawmakers were told that these notifications cannot be issued until the official results are given by the returning officer and details of property ownership of newly elected candidates are received. Still, they demanded that all laws and regulations be suspended and notifications issued. For one hour S-Block, where the law ministry along with the Election Commission offices are located, was ruled by lawlessness. The police on duty joined the onlookers there. These people finally left after threatening the staff. The reason was that the National Assembly session was adjourning on Monday, and these people were going to miss their daily allowance for several days if they did not take the oath that day. At 8:00 p.m. when Chief Election Commissioner Justice Naiumuddin and Secretary Humayun Khan reached the office, the staff informed them of the whole story. One government official told us that the personal assistant of Justice Naimuddin told him the whole story while weeping bitterly. The old retired justice could not do any thing except to give a day off to his staff so they could recover from this abuse. The PPP officials are the kind who do not respect even active judges. Earlier, Benazir Bhutto's law minister (he is gone now) Sher Afghan had put pressure on the Election Commission and had them change the date for the internal election. The grisly part of this whole affair is that the newspapers did not take any notice of it, and only Daily PAKISTAN published this news item. It is said that the chief election commissioner called a long meeting with two other judges and high officials of the commission. It was also discussed if these PPP assembly members should be charged with the contempt of court as demanded by the staff. However, after the meeting, Justice Naimuddin advised his staff to be patient and not to stretch this affair too far. Allah will look after us. When the staff continued to insist, Justice Naimuddin told them that since he was the oldest of them all they should respect his age, and forget this incident. However, he did receive the written complaints of his staff. He told this reporter that he had decided not to take any action over this fiasco and that the case was closed. The leaders and the members of the PPP have abused every agency and the weak heads of these agencies are covering up to be commended for their loyalties.
