The talks, which were attended by Bosnia-Herzegovina Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic and Bosnia-Herzegovina Army Supreme Commander General Rasim Delic, concerned the difficult situation in Gorazde. Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency President Alija Izetbegovic said after the talks: I expressed to Mr. Akashi the readiness of our side to halt the fighting throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina on condition that the attacks on Gorazde cease. The Serbs [words indistinct] have to withdraw to the positions of 30 March, and then the political talks can start. An arrangement has to be reached that the cease-fire agreement does not turn into the freezing of the Serb occupation. There can be no political talks while the population is being killed. These are our conditions, and Mr. Akashi expressed understanding for our position. We stand available to Mr. Akashi and his [word indistinct] to continue the talks in order to achieve a cease-fire around Gorazde as soon as possible. President Izetbegovic stressed the cooperativeness between the Bosnia-Herzegovina side and the UN, and said that, if the aggressor failed to show cooperativeness himself, decisive action against the Serb side was expected from the UN. This implies energetic [word indistinct] of air power against Serb equipment in and around Gorazde. Expressing his satisfaction and honor at meeting President Izetbegovic, Prime Minister Silajdzic, and Army General Delic, Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Akashi said: We agreed at the talks that the situation in Gorazde requires special attention. I understand very well now the position of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. Based on these talks I will now be going to hold talks with the Serb side in accordance with our constant efforts to find common ground for reaching a just solution. Asked by the reporters whether he had already contacted Karadzic and whether there were indications that the Serb side would agree to talks, Akashi said: I will try and meet Karadzic as soon as possible. I do not think that anyone should refuse to talk to the peacekeepers from the United Nations. Asked whether there would be further air strikes against the Serb positions in Gorazde, Akashi said that this depended on the development of the situation. If our staff and the staff of the humanitarian organizations come under attack or are exposed to direct threats, and if there is a threat to Gorazde as a safe haven, then the United Nations will draw the relevant conclusions and can ask for close air support from NATO. I think that enough restraint will be shown, and that we will not be placed in that situation. We have carried out close air support action twice already, and I think that this is enough. I think that this should be enough for reasonable and realistic people. This is what Butrus-Ghali's special envoy Yasushi Akashi said.
