In the resolution, the DP noted that the present situation surrounding the North Korean nuclear issue is very grave and stressed that North Korea should fully allow the special inspection of the undeclared sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The DP also urged the government to make independent efforts in close cooperation with the United Nations and the four neighboring major powers, including the United States, to prevent war on the Korean peninsula. The DP also called on the United States and the United Nations to do their best to maintain dialogue for the peaceful settlement rather than resorting to the measures that could result in war.
