FR940317-1-00164 FR940317-1-00014 The Commissioner's guidelines are intended to provide State agencies with criteria for developing intrastate funding formulas that target the needs of those in greatest economic and social need, and low-income minorities within each PSA. The guidelines also provide area agencies, service providers, older individuals, units of general purpose local government, and the pubic with a method by which to assess the State's proposed intrastate funding formula impact in each planning and service area. We anticipate that the public hearing process at both the State and local levels will provide groups, organizations, and individuals that may be affected with as much information as possible about the actual impact the formula will have on current and projected plans and services within the PSA's. AoA is aware that there may be changes in the allocation of Title III funds to PSA's if State agencies determine that it is necessary to modify current or develop new intrastate funding formulas in response to changes in demographics, or in compliance with the Commissioner's guidelines in these regulations. Whether the formula remains the same, is modified or a new formula is developed, it is essential that the process of targeting older individuals in greatest economic and social need with particular emphasis on low-income minority individuals have a demonstrable outcome. The 1992 Amendments strengthen the targeting provisions of the OAA through a number of requirements relating to State Units on Aging (SUAs), area agencies on aging (AAAs) and service providers. The Amendments require SUAs to set specific objectives and describe actions used to increase participation of low-income minority older individuals (Section 305(a)(2)(G)); require SUAs to provide technical assistance to minority service providers (Section 305(a)(1)(D)); require area plans to include specific service objectives for minority targeting (Section 306(a)(5)(A)(i)); provide assurances that providers serve low-income minority individuals in accordance with their need for services (Section 306(a)(5)(A)(ii)); and require that all AAA activities must include a focus on the needs of low-income minority older individuals (Section 306(a)(5)(C)). In determining how funds available under Title III are to be distributed to implement these objectives, the 1992 Amendments make it clear that States must base the distribution of funds on an intrastate funding formula that takes into account the distribution of older individuals, and of older individuals with greatest economic need and older individuals with greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals. The Amendments also require that the SUA submit its formula to the Commissioner for approval. The guidelines proposed here in accordance with section 305(c)(2)(C) having the following objectives: •To provide flexibility for the States to develop a formula, based on the provisions of the Act, which is appropriate to the conditions in each State; and •To provide criteria for approval by the Commissioner which are outcome rather than process oriented and meet a standard of administrative simplicity. The criteria developed in these guidelines are based on the principle that funds and services should be targeted on older individuals in greatest economic need and older individuals in greatest social need, with particular attention to low-income minority older individuals. There are two criteria for approval of the formula: (1) to be approved, the formula may not allocate less funds to each PSA with a high concentration of low-income minority older individuals than would have been allocated to each of these PSA's by application of the current formula to the most recent decennial U.S. census data or the best available data.
