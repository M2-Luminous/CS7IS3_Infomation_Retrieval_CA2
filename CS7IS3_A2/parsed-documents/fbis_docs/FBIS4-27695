FBIS4-27695 "dreas107_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-107 Daily Report 2 Jun 1994 South Korea Blix: Measurement of Fuel Rods `Impossible' Blix: Measurement of Fuel Rods `Impossible' SK0206232894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2207 GMT 2 Jun 94 SK0206232894 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [by Nam Son-yong from UN Headquarters] [Text] Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], today reported officially to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali that it has become impossible for the IAEA to make a follow-up measurement [chuhu kyechuk] of nuclear fuel rods at a reactor in Yongbon, North Korea. In his written report, Director General Blix said: Based on the IAEA inspection team's report on the replacement of nuclear fuel rods at a North Korean 5-megawatt reactor, the IAEA came to the conclusion that the selection [sonbyol] of fuel rods to determine whether North Korea has diverted nuclear fuel or not has become impossible. Serving as a final confirmation on the failure of the IAEA inspection on the nuclear fuel rods in North Korea, his report provides grounds for the UN Security Council to apply sanctions against North Korea. Accordingly, following a verbal report by Director General Blix this afternoon [3 June], the UN Security Council will likely have full-fledged discussions on methods of sanctions against North Korea. A UN diplomatic source says the United States, ROK, and Japan have begun to discuss a resolution on sanctions, and France,which holds a hard-line position, has also separately drafted a resolution. According to this source, in light of the present atmosphere, it is highly possible that the UN Security Council will directly apply economic sanctions without taking steps for warning. If China continues opposition to sanctions, measures to prohibit remittances from Japan and North Korean missile exports to the Middle East will likely be taken, while permitting China to continue supplying oil and food to North Korea.
