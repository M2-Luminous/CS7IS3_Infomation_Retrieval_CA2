He said the main fruition of the leadership of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il over the past three decades since he began to work at the WPK Central Committee is that he has strengthened and developed the WPK to be an ever-victorious revolutionary party of chuche type and to be authoritative vanguard of the world socialist movement standing in the foreground of modern history. Noting that the dear leader's idea and theory of party building are the immortal banner of the building of the revolutionary party of chuche type, he said: His idea and theory of party building serve as the guideline that, first of all, indicates the most correct way of building the working-class party as a leading political organization for realising the idea and guidance of the leader. The dear leader gave the famous formulation that the working-class party is, in essence, the party of the leader, basing himself on the stark fact that the WPK was founded and has been strengthened and developed by the great leader President Kim Il-song and on the principle of the chuche philosophy that the oneness of the ideology, leadership and unity must be ensured in the socio-political organism with the leader, its brain, in the centre. Having formulated the essence and mission of the working-class party with the leader in the centre, he set it as the fundamental principle of party building to establish a monolithic ideological system in the whole party, thus becoming the first in history to indicate a correct way of building the party as the leader's. His idea and theory of party building are a guideline that shows the most correct way of building the working-class party as a genuine party of the people which assumes responsibility for their destiny and serves them. The working-class party is necessary for the people and only when it is united with the people in one mind, it has viability -- this is the basic stand of the dear leader toward the party building. The dear leader has established chuche-based principles and mode of politics with benevolent politics and magnanimous politics as the main point and gave a full exposition of the revolutionary method of party work and popular working style. The immortal significance of his idea and theory of party building also lies in that they are the guideline which indicates the most correct way of building the working-class party as an independent and creative party. The dear leader has held high the banner of chuche, the banner of independence and creation in party building and party activities, wholly inheriting the idea and will of the respected leader President Kim Il-song, who had hewn the path of independence and creation under the banner of the great chuche idea. With the dear leader's idea and theory of building an independent and creative party successfully realized, the WPK has been strengthened and developed to be the most dignified and authoritative party of chuche that maintains our way in the organizational and ideological work and in the establishment of leadership art and shapes and carries out the revolutionary line and policies of the party in our way. Indeed, the dear leader's idea and theory of party building are an ideological and theoretical summing up of the historical experience and lesson gained in the communist movement in the 20th century and the building of working-class party and an immortal banner of the revolutionary party building in the era of chuche.
