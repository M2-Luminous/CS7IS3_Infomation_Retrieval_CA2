Meanwhile, that evening a terrorist commando dynamited the Presidente Hotel in Huancayo, causing considerable damage. These two events, which occurred almost simultaneously, and the two murders committed by subversives in the city of Huancayo prove that inside the terrorist organization there is a radical, fanatic group that does not want the "peace agreement" demanded by Abimael Guzman and wants to continue to ravage the country with selective murders and acts of sabotage. Although there are indications that the Shining Path faction that wants to "lay down its arms" (it can be deduced that this expression means sort of "cease fire" from their point of view) is the majority and predominant sector, it is also obvious that the fanatic group who do not want to stop their insane bout of murders and attacks is still active in several places in the country. From the letters recently written by the Shining Path members held at Canto Grande prison, and by their leader Cox Beuzeville -- and also from the big flag displayed yesterday -- it can be seen that Shining Path members are in no way considering surrender, much less giving up their arms.
