Over the weekend, Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola and mediator in the peace talks, was in Huambo and Luanda, where he held contacts at the highest level. He returned to Lusaka last evening. The UNITA negotiating team returned this afternoon from Huambo, where it held talks with its leader, Jonas Savimbi, and its leadership. The government negotiating team, which used the break to go to Luanda, also returned to Lusaka early this evening. All the people involved in the peace talks are here in Lusaka, but it is still not known what the negotiating teams will discuss tomorrow. Before the peace talks were interrupted, the negotiating teams from the government and UNITA were discussing the involvement of UNITA and its senior leaders in the government. Meanwhile, on the occasion of Africa Refugee Day today, Angolan refugees here in Zambia called on the government and UNITA to speed up the present talks with a view to establishing peace in Angola, because they are tired of living as refugees. There are 50,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia.
