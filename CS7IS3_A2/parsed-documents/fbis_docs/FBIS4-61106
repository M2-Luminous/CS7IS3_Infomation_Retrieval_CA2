The conference will examine the issues of NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Anatoliy Potapov now comments on Russia's attitude to the program. Lately many politicians from the NATO member countries have turned their attention to Russia's delay in joining the NATO Partnership for Peace program. Sometimes some of them even allow themselves to come to such a conclusion that Russia is after all not going to join the NATO program. Now let us examine the real issues at stake. It should be remembered that there is a single document that must be signed by each state that has embraced NATO's program. This is the first stage of joining the program. Moscow has no fundamental disagreements with this single document that spells out in general terms NATO's Partnership for Peace program. Even though Russian experts have on several occasions pointed to the document's nebulous character and its perfunctoriness, this is of course a general declaration of intentions. It is the second stage of the program that is very important: the handing over of a so-called presentation document to NATO. In this document it is written in black and white what exactly each country expects from the program and what contributions are expected from each state -- that is, the rights and obligations of member states of the NATO's partnership program. Moscow believes that the first stage -- the signing of the single document -- is a mere formality that represents no binding obligation. The crux and the concrete content of the partnership program is embedded in the second stage. The planned partnership and the scope and scale of the proposed agreement are clearly spelled out in this second document. Experts in Moscow are now working on this second document to determine clearly all the aspects of the partnership program in order to make it abundantly clear to Russia and to NATO. Russia may sign the little, single document -- that is, the first stage. It may similarly propose in its place a more capacious and concrete agreement. The most important thing is that Moscow is not moving or shying away from the NATO program, but on the contrary would want to establish a solid base for its signing. In preparing the draft of such an agreement, Russia hopes to consult NATO. This, of course, will take time, but then the working program of the partnership would be harmonized in reality and would be very solid. Why is Russia now giving such minute and detailed attention to the hammering out of the draft of the future agreement? Because it should contain certain Russian-specific points, certain Russian interests. It should be noted that no other European country invited to join the program possesses such huge and powerful nuclear weapons as Russia. Neither [as heard] of them has the same weight and influence in the world arena like Russia does, and none of them has the same geopolitical peculiarities as Russia. That's why Moscow would want these basic conditions and peculiarities taken into account in planning the partnership program. Therefore, it is not the formal time of joining the NATO's partnership program which matters. The issue is that the partnership between Russia and NATO should be real: equal in reality and in the interests of a stable and permanent European security.
