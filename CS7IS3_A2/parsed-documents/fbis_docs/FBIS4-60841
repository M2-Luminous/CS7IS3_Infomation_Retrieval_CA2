At a seminar held at the end of March, Lieutenant General Matti Kopra, chief of the Finnish Defense Forces General Staff Operations Directorate, for example, urged the Finns to be cautious when assessing and implementing decisions in the sphere of defense policy. "We should be in no hurry to become members of any military alliances," he said. "Our country now has more options in the sphere of security policy than at any time in its history. They must all be weighed up cautiously and unhurriedly." The general also warned against adopting decisions in the defense sphere on the basis of "suddenly emerging notions of an external threat to Finland." "Our defensive system," he pointed out, "is a result of long-term planning and cannot be altered substantially in the space of a few years." Academician Pekka Jauho, who studies these so-called notions of a threat, pointed out at the seminar that Finland's military position is being consistently complicated as a result of the changes in Europe. He voiced doubt that the country's security can be ensured with the help of any collective system in the event of a serious crisis. Researcher Juha Martelius, who reported on Russia's new military doctrine, believes that the Russian Federation is concerned about the threat of NATO expanding to the borders of its immediate neighbors, as well as the worsening situation concerning the political and economic rights of Russia's citizens in the "near abroad." He believes that, at worst, Russia might consider Finland also to be part of the "near abroad." Second, "the self-organization of ethnic minorities of Russians and of Finns who have come here from St. Petersburg and the oblast to take up permanent residence has now become apparent in Finland, as a result of which not only a hotbed of social tension but also a security risk might arise in time." (Martelius is an expert on Russian affairs in the secret -- political -- police.) One more question concerning Russia. Attention was attracted at the end of March by a statement by Lt. Gen. Lass Vekhter [name as transliterated], deputy commander of the Northern Military District, who was once military adjutant to President Urho Kekkonen. For security reasons he objects to the planned construction of a highway from Salla in northern Finland to Alakurtti in Murmansk Oblast. A Russian air unit is stationed in the latter population center. But the civilian authorities in the northern provinces of Oulu and Lappi adhere to a different opinion, considering this road beneficial to the economic development of both countries. Martti Ahtisaari, Finland's new president, recently gave his first news conference after taking up his post. He reported that Finland's Partnership for Peace treaty with NATO might be concluded this spring. But the time of signing will not depend on the corresponding schedules of neighboring countries -- Sweden and Russia. There is no hurry here, the president said.
