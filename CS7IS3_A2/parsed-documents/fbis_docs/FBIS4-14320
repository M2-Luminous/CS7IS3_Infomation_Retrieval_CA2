He was addressing a news conference, along with other foreign ministers of ICO [Islamic Conference Organization] Contact Group on Bosnia at the United Nations. He said according to the interpretation of the ICO, the Security Council by imposing the embargo had in fact amended the UN Charter, which was something beyond its own mandate. The foreign minister said the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina held the special UN representative, Mr. Akashi, responsible for the deaths in Gorazde by acting to stop the air strikes against the Serb aggressors. He said the ICO members support this view and favor the removal of Mr. Akashi from his position. He said there are many other countries, besides the ICO members, who are also demanding his removal. Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali said during their meeting with the UN secretary general, the ICO foreign ministers raised the question that if there was no peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, then what exactly the UN forces were keeping there. [sentence as heard] The peacekeeping forces must have a clear defined role of enforcing peace, he added.
