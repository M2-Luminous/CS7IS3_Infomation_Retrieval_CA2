FR941107-1-00021 FR941107-1-00007 Substantive revisions to the legal proceedings disclosure requirements were made most recently in 1984. 47 The amendments required disclosure of legal proceedings involving federal commodities laws 48 and applied the disclosure requirements to promoters and control persons of newly public companies. 49 47 Release No. 33&hyph;6545 (August 9, 1984) [49 FR 32762]. 48 Specifically, Regulation S&hyph;K Item 401(f) was amended to require disclosure of judicial and administrative restrictions on activities regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC''), as well as court restrictions on engaging in activities involving the purchase or sale of a commodity or the violation of federal commodities laws. A provision requiring disclosure of findings of federal commodities law violations by courts or the CFTC also was added. 49 The amendments added Item 401(g) [17 CFR 229.401(g)], which provided that registrants that have not been subject to the reporting requirements of Exchange Act Sections 13(a) [15 U.S.C. 78m(a)] or 15(d) [15 U.S.C. 78o(d)] for the 12 months immediately prior to the filing of the registration statement, report or other document to which Item 401 is applicable, are required to disclose the Item 401(f) information with regard to control persons if the event occurred within the past five years and was material to a voting or investment decision. In cases where such registrants were organized within the past five years, the Item 401(f) disclosure is to be included with respect to promoters as well.
