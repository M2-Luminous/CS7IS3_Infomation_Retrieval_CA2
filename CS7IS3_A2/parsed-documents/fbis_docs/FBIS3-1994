Zou Jiahua said: It is not very easy to ensure the accuracy of statistics. It is a rather serious phenomenon where, for their own advancement or transfer or for political honors or the material interests of a small group, leaders of some localities, departments, and units would carry out statistical tricks. Some even retaliated against statistical personnel who dared to uphold principles. It is necessary to tackle these negative and corrupt practices with party discipline and state law. He said: The socialist market economy makes new demands on statistical work. Following the change in the form of the state's economic management from the previous tangible, microscopic, and direct management to intangible, macroscopic, and indirect management, the CPC Central Committee and State Council always encounters three questions in making macroeconomic policy decisions and in macroeconomic regulation and control: First, in what condition is the current national economy and social progression? Second, how are we going to regulate and control them if they are abnormal? Third, what will be the effects of the macroscopic regulatory and control measures? These three questions concern statistics at all times. Without timely and accurate information supplied by the statistical system and without their effective supervision, it is difficult to make correct policy decisions for the national economy. Zou Jiahua said: In statistical work, we must break through traditional statistical concepts and further reform and open up. We should establish a statistical system that suits China's national conditions in keeping with the general laws of the market economy and by referring to the world's advanced statistical science and technology. It is necessary to radically reform statistical and surveying methods, develop partial survey methods, and actively promote the sample surveying method in particular. It is necessary to establish a system of statistical and survey methods which is based on periodic general surveys, whose main body is regular sample surveys and which uses major surveys, scientific calculations, and a small number of overall statistical reports in a comprehensive way. Zou Jiahua also stressed: Cultivating and developing an information market and achieving the commercialization and industrialization of information is one of the main points in the development of a market system. Vigorously cultivating and developing a market in statistical information is a task which brooks no delay. Statistical departments must energetically promote the effective circulation of social and economic information and share it with society.
