First EPA evaluated which renewable oxygenates would be likely to be used to fulfill the program requirements during the early years of the program and what volume of oxygenate that represented. Second, feedstocks for the production of these oxygenates were examined to determine whether sufficient feedstock supplies would be available. Third, EPA examined the adequacy of projected production capacity for the dominant oxygenates for the first years of the program. Fourth, EPA investigated whether transportation and distribution networks were adequate to support the program during the initial years. Fifth, EPA examined the projected storage and blending capability during this time frame. EPA examined the capability over time of each link in the renewable oxygenate production and distribution chain to handle the demands of the renewable oxygenate program, and concluded that a phase-in of the 30 percent requirement is necessary and that the phase-in being promulgated today is an appropriate response to leadtime concerns. 2. Likely Renewable Oxygenates Ethanol is likely to be the dominant renewable oxygenate used to meet the renewable oxygenate requirements, especially during the initial years of the program, since it is the only renewable oxygenate currently produced in large quantities. Since ethanol cannot be blended during the summer months to meet the requirements of the program, its use will be concentrated during the winter months. ETBE, the simplest ether derived from ethanol, also is likely to be used in significant quantities since it, unlike ethanol, can be blended during the summer months to meet the requirements of the program. As discussed below in section III.F.6, however, ETBE production capacity is expected to be virtually non-existent in 1995 due to construction and permitting time constraints. Its use is expected to increase by 1996 through the conversion of existing MTBE facilities so that the requirements of the program are met by a combination of ethanol use in the winter and ETBE use year-round. Other renewable oxygenates are not expected to be available in significant quantities before 1997 given the leadtime required to design and construct new renewable production facilities. ETBE use is expected to increase further during the summer months once the Phase II RFG standards take effect in the year 2000, since ETBE use will make it easier (relative to MTBE) for refiners to achieve the more stringent VOC performance standards. 3. New Renewable Oxygenate Demand Before EPA could evaluate the adequacy of the renewable oxygenate supply, distribution, and blending capacity, it was necessary to estimate the program's demand for renewable oxygenates. The estimate was derived in terms of new ethanol demand, since as discussed above only ethanol or ETBE are expected to be used in significant quantities during the first few years of the program, and since the use of ETBE would not alter the total amount of ethanol required by today's rule because the oxygen in ETBE is derived solely from ethanol. The ethanol demand created by the program was estimated by multiplying the projected 1995 volume of reformulated gasoline covered by the Federal RFG program (including the two covered California areas) of 38.7 billion gallons per year by the volume percent of ethanol (5.76 percent) necessary to meet to 2.0 weight percent oxygen requirement in 30 percent of RFG. As a result, today's program is estimated to require about 670 million gallons of ethanol to meet the full 30 percent requirement. In actual practice, refiners may blend greater or lesser amounts of ethanol in any individual gallon of RFG, depending on such factors as tax credits and price and availability of various oxygenates. The actual amount of new ethanol production required by today's rule is smaller than 670 million gallons because some ethanol is currently sold in areas covered by the RFG program. Based on the monthly reporting by Information Resources, Inc. (IRI) for 1993, it appears that as much as 280 million gallons of ethanol is already being used in areas covered by the reformulated gasoline program (State-wide data was weighted based on population to reflect ethanol consumption only in the RFG areas within the State). Not all of this can be credited toward the renewable oxygenate program, however, unless the summertime use is converted to ETBE. Based on the IRI data, as much as 180 million gallons of ethanol is currently being used during those months of the year in which EPA would expect non-VOC-controlled gasoline to be produced (on average September 15 through March 31). Thus, the amount of additional wintertime ethanol production required to meet a 30 percent renewable oxygenate requirement in 1995 would be approximately 490 million gallons (390 million gallons in new, year-round capacity in later years once ETBE production capacity can be brought on-line). A 15 percent phase-in of the program would require approximately 155 million gallons of additional ethanol production. While this volume of ethanol could be met using existing capacity by displacing ethanol from existing ethanol markets, EPA believes, for reasons discussed earlier, it is desirable to minimize displacing significant amounts of ethanol from existing markets.
