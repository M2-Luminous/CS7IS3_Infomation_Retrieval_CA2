If the airplane design includes provision for the use of communication headsets, the evaluation must also consider conditions where headsets are being used. If the evaluation shows conditions under which it will be difficult to converse, an intercommunication system must be provided. (d) If installed communication equipment includes transmitter ``off-on'' switching, that switching means must be designed to return from the ``transmit'' to the ``off'' position when it is released and ensure that the transmitter will return to the off (non transmitting) state. (e) If provisions for the use of communication headsets are provided, it must be demonstrated that the flightcrew members will receive all aural warnings when any headset is being used. 39.
