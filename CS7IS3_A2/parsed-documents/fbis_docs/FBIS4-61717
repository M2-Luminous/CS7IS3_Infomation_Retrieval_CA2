The bloodiest, the most destructive war in the history of mankind ended 49 years ago. It ended with a thunderous Russian shout of Hurrah which rolled over defeated fascist Germany, over the liberated countries of Europe, over the whole world. Probably, 9 May 1945 was the happiest day in the whole of the 20th century. That happiness was brought to mankind in the first place by the valiant fighters of the Red Army, which included Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Kazakhs, Uzbeks, Georgians, and people of other nationalities who were at one in defending their homeland. The whole of mankind bowed its head low as a sign of immeasurable gratitude to the Soviet, the Russian soldier, because without him the fate of the world could have turned out differently. It was Russia which stopped and turned the brown plague to dust. And it was Russia, as often in the past, which saved the world in the 20th century. We won victory at a very great cost. There is not a family which did not suffer a bitter loss, and since then it has become the custom to bow our heads to the memory of those who died in bloody battles, in bombardments, exchanges of fire, and in concentration camps. We remember those on the home front who worked till they dropped. May you be for ever remembered, and with boundless gratitude! Dear Muscovites and guests of our city, as we return to those years of the Great Fatherland War, we try to find answers to today's questions. What was it that helped us endure? What helped us to defeat that mighty army which was sustained by the resources of the whole of Europe? I think the most important thing was a firm belief in victory. Even in 1941, when the foe was occupying town after town, when Leningrad was blockaded, when the Baltic states, Belarus, and the greater part of Ukraine fell, when the foe was approaching Moscow -- we believed and knew that victory would nevertheless be ours. It was this that enabled everyone to do the seemingly impossible. Veterans recall how difficult life was at that harsh time. But it was at that very time that people found strength of spirit. A great truth was revealed to us -- man's best qualities have lost none of their value. Without honesty, decency, charity, and self- sacrifice, we would not have been victorious, would not have endured. These qualities are in our blood, in our character. No tests of endurance can destroy them. I cannot fail to mention the unity, the breath as one which helped us overcome all difficulties and deprivations. Today we know how hard it was to achieve that unity. The roller coaster of prewar repressions corrupted the life of millions of people, leaving bitterness and resentment in their hearts. But in the face of the chief danger, all this faded into the background. Quite a few emigres -- former enemies of Soviet power -- sided with its defenders in order to save the homeland. Today we also commemorate the anti-Hitler coalition formed by hitherto hostile states. Faced by deadly danger, they abandoned mutual hatred and took joint action against the common enemy. The second front, though opened late, did bring closer the end of the hateful war. It was then that the strategic partnership, which we are now striving to strengthen, came into being. We have differences with the West, but there is also a unique opportunity to put an end to distrust between each other forever. The only important thing to remember always is that Russia must be treated with respect. Our people will never accept any other language from any state whatsoever. This is because they will always remember how much blood was shed for the sake of peace, and because this is the sacred precept of those who died for our motherland's honor and independence. One of the most important lessons of the great victory is that the strength of unity, the strength of accord is invincible. This is significant for us, particularly today. We all want our country to become free and flourishing, and the people's life dignified and prosperous. Surely we can unite around this main aim? Today I call upon all those who hold dear the name of the citizen of the Russian Federation [Rossiyanin], those who hold dear the glory of the fatherland: let us unite in peace! We managed to be united in the great war: I believe we can be united in building civic peace. The first steps on this road have been taken. Many parties, movements, unions, and associations joined the Treaty on Social Accord. Let those who are always displeased grumble and let instigators shout away. We will continue, because the difficult path to peace is always better than political squabbling and war. Let the tears and the grief of mothers in Armenia and Azerbaijan, in Georgia and Tajikistan, and the bloodshed in Yugoslavia be a stern warning to those who value political revenge more than human lives. By signing the Treaty on Social Accord, we did not and are not seeking victory. We seek overall peace. We do not regard as our enemy those who refused to join the Treaty. There are no quick solutions or simple formulas in the building of a new Russia. We are prepared to hold a dialogue and on-going consultations with parties and factions, which is the meaning of the Treaty on Social Accord. Esteemed veterans, I know that the beginning of the war has a particular place in your memory. We retreated then. We did not dare look into the eyes of women and old people then. We had to learn to conquer in action. We mastered this difficult skill, though not immediately. The people gave its Army the best weapons in the world, the best equipment in the world, the best soldiers, and the best military commanders. In the name of the triumph of justice and as a mark of nation-wide respect and nation-wide gratitude, a monument to Georgiy Konstantinovich Zhukov, the great Russian commander and true son of Russia, will be unveiled in Moscow in exactly a year from now, on 9 May 1995. A decision was taken today to found a Zhukov order and medal. Honor and glory to the great Russian military leader! The year 1941 was especially difficult and bitter for us. But 1945 was a year of victory. It is important for Russia today to remember this during the current transformations. We began these transformations without the necessary experience, and at first we were compelled to draw on the practice of other countries. But now, more than two years on, we have been able to accumulate our own priceless Russian experience. No other state has it. You will read about it in any book. Now we will go further, clearly understanding what needs to be done in Russia in order to revive its greatness and dignity, and how. Recent years have been especially difficult for all of us. Everything could very easily have been wrecked, but we held out. This is due in no small measure to you, dear veterans, to your wisdom, courage, and steadfastness, to the fact that you know the true price of peace and reject hysteria, panic, and cheap demagogy. I have no doubt that veterans will continue persistently to defend stability and civil peace in Russia. Dear friends! Today the splendid central museum of the Great Patriotic War, built by Muscovites, opens here on Poklonnaya Gora. Many defenders of the fatherland did not live to see this day. Many of them could not come here because of old age and illness. May the memorial complex being built on Poklonnaya Gora be the general homage of Russia and our people to the heroes and simple soldiers of the war, to their feat of arms! Yesterday the victory memorial was blessed by the Russian Orthodox Church. Henceforth, this place will become one of the shrines of Russian history. We failed to keep safe the Church of Christ the Savior, or the church built to commemorate the faith and soldierly glory displayed in 1812. But I believe that the fate of the Victory Memorial will be different, will be better. I appeal to you, dear veterans, and to your children and grandchildren, our descendants: let us jointly preserve the Victory Memorial, let us jointly preserve our shrines! In exactly one year's time, we will mark the 50th anniversary of the great victory. Preparations for this great event start from today. The coming year will be a year of commemoration, of making sense of our peacetime and wartime history. This history includes difficult and bitter pages. We will have to restore those pages which were mercilessly torn out and record those which have not yet been fully recorded. It is our duty to put in order all monuments, all graves of the homeland's defenders. It is our duty to restore the shining names of those who are still listed as missing without trace. But the most important thing is that all of us, all Russian citizens, should change a little and become more tolerant, charitable, and wise; it will then be easier to deal with everything which poisons our lives today. As true sons of the fatherland, we will be proud of the heroic deeds of our forbears, draw conclusions from their mistakes, and will remember that one of the most important lessons of our history is the lesson of unity. When we are in agreement, we are strong. When we are together, we are invincible. Glory to the veterans of the Great Fatherland War! Glory to the Russian Army! Glory to Russia! Glory to Moscow! Hurrah!
