Among them, over 1,100 became party members in the 1940's and 420 in the 1950's. The reason for withdrawal from the party given by most is: The party's existing line goes against the party's manifesto and their beliefs when they joined the party. It was disclosed that over 500 among a total of about 2,200 who applied to withdraw from the CPC changed their minds after they reconsidered the issue and after relevant organizations carried out ideological work among them. Among those who resigned from the party, more than 90 were once cadres at ministerial or provincial level or members of the Central Advisory Commission.
