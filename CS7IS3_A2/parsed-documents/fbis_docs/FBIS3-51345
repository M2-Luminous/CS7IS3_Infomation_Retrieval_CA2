Rosa Rodriguez is a military officer who went into retirement a few years ago and served in the 3d Army Corps. Rosa Rodriguez took a course on drug trafficking in the United States. Therefore, he is supported by the U.S. diplomatic mission. The president of the Republic, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, took considerable time in appointing the Senad head. The Senad reshuffle prompted "diplomatic" frictions between Wasmosy and U.S. ambassador to Paraguay Jon David Glassman. It was actually the U.S. ambassador who announced that the new Senad head would be appointed sometime this week, at the latest. According to military sources, there were three candidates: One of them rejected the post and the other two were not approved by the U.S. mission. [passage omitted] The president of the Republic, engineer Juan Carlos Wasmosy, has given "absolute liberty" to the new Senad head, retired Gen. Juan Ramon Rosa Rodriguez for the latter to properly discharge his new duties. Rosa Rodriguez noted that if he does not properly discharge his duties, it will not be because he is unwilling to do so, but because he does not have the elements required for it. The president said: "I fully trust you and I ask everyone here and all the organizations to provide the support required for an all-out struggle against money laundering and crime." Addressing Gen. Rosa Rodriguez, the president added: "You have all my support and the support of all levels of government to fight this scourge without any protection. [sentence as published] You have absolute liberty and the support of the national government to fight this evil." Moving on, the president thanked U.S. Ambassador Jon Glassman for the assistance the U.S. Embassy has supplied our country to fight drug trafficking "because, sadly enough, our country is being used by criminals as a transit country." The president concluded by saying: "I hope that all of us, united, some day may be able to wipe out this damned trafficking from America's Southern Cone." Rosa Rodriguez The new Senad head said: "Thank you very much for trusting me, Mr. President. I cannot promise more than dedication and honest effort, but I can assure you that if Senad does not properly meet your expectations, it will never be because of ill will, laziness, or malice, but it will be because our capacity and our means are not enough to fulfill your wishes." This may be interpreted as a call to re-equip Senad, whose potential, according to Senad Assistant Secretary Colonel Cirilo Velazquez, is very small compared with drug traffickers' potential.
