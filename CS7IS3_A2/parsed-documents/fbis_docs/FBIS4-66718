BBC radio will broadcast a half hour current affairs programme on South Asia every day from April 4. This was announced on Tuesday in Bombay by Mr. Alexander Thomson, the editor of the South Asia Report, which at present has a duration of 15 minutes. "The expansion of South Asia Report at this time shows the commitment of the BBC to coverage of a region of immense political, economic and strategic importance," he said. Mr. Thomson and BBC's India correspondent, Mr. Mark Tully were in Bombay to honour Mr. Jonas Kurkalang from Dadar, Bombay, one of four prize winners of the `Can you hear me' competition conducted last year by the South Asia Report. Amongst the other prize-winners are two from Madras and one from Nepal. New office in Delhi: Mr. Tully pointed that the very fact that the BBC was increasing its coverage of South Asia emphasised the point that the organisation continued to be deeply committed to radio journalism. `Radio is not going under and will not despite television', he said. He announced that the BBC was opening a new and modern office in Delhi which would be equipped to produce many of the programmes on the Hindi service which had earlier been produced in London. Mr. Tully also emphasised that it was the success of BBC World Service television in India that had sparked the interest of so many others in the region. `The BBC is determined to remain one of the main players regardless of how much competition there is', he said. He also pointed out that although Star TV had been taken over by the Australian media baron, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, BBC had a contract with Star TV and "there is no sign that it will be broken even though it has an early get out clause." Reorganisation: Discussing the future plans of the BBC, Mr. Thomson said that `Bush House is going through fundamental reforms, almost a revolution in its history'. He was referring to the process of reorganisation taking place whereby the BBC planned to divide its coverage of the world into six regions. The eastern region would essentially be restricted to South Asia unlike in the past when it encompassed Iran and Afghanistan in the west and Myanmar in the east. As part of the expansion of its coverage of the region, the BBC would be setting up an FM transmitter in Dhaka, Bangladesh and a studio in Islamabad, Mr. Thomson said. This was the only region where the BBC was expanding at a time when it was cutting back in many other parts of the world. Mr. Thomson also announced that in response to feedback from listeners, the BBC would broadcast in South Asia on a new frequency of 7160 in addition to the present 15310 on which it was being broadcast. The expanded South Asia Report would begin with a nine minute world news bulletin at 0700 hrs IST [Indian Standard Time] followed by the current affairs programme.
