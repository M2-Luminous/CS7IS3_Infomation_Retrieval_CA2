We have received promises of as much support as possible," Eduard Shevardnadze, the head of the Georgian state, said on Tuesday, summing up the results of his official visit to the U.S. capital at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington. "It is quite natural that the attention of the world has been focused on the political processes in Russia and on whether it will succeed in building a new, truly democratic state," E. Shevardnadze noted. "The West can and should assist in this process, but if it views events in Russia in isolation from what is happening in other former Soviet republics it will have to pay a very high price. I tried to explain in my conversations that despite the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the territory which it occupied remains a single socio-economic space where there is still a close interconnection between cultures and social thought. That is why I am convinced that all the new independent states should be viewed as a whole. Otherwise, the stability of even the largest and most influential of them may be undermined by instability on its borders". Earlier on Tuesday E. Shevardnadze had meetings in Washington with World Bank president Lewis Preston and International Monetary Fund managing director Michel Camdessus. The expansion of cooperation with the world's largest multinational credit-lending and financial organisations in advancing the republic's economy was discussed, Georgian Deputy Prime Minister Irakli Menagarishvili, who took part in the talks, told ITAR-TASS. "The meetings were held in a constructive and warm atmosphere. E. Shevardnadze assured his interlocutors that, notwithstanding all the difficulties connected with military operations and their consequences, Georgia firmly intends to go ahead with the market reform policy. He outlined our government's plans in this respect and urged the World Bank and IMF leaders to help the republic resolve the complex economic problems facing it. Support for the Georgian national monetary units was discussed at the talks," I. Menagarishvili said. The same day the head of the Georgian state visited the Capitol where he had a series of meetings with the heads of committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate of the U.S. Congress. The main subject there was the problem of humanitarian, technical and financial aid to the forer Soviet republic. "I hope that I succeeded in convincing the legislators to allocate additional funds to Georgia," in addition to the $70 million which President Bill Clinton promised to grant this year, E. Shevardnadze said in reply to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent. E. Shevardnadze began the third day of his visit to Washington with a short working lunch with James Wolsey, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. The Georgian delegation was unable to tell the ITAR-TASS correspondent anything about the nature of the issues discussed, because the conversation in the guest residence of the republican leader was one-on-one. It is no secret, however, that the CIA is assisting Tbilisi in training its national security forces and the personal guard of the head of state. After concluding the Washington part of his visit to the United States, E. Shevardnadze flew to New York. Today he is due to speak at the UN Security Council and to set out the Georgian Government's position on questions of the prospects for a settlement in Abkhazia and for sending international peace-keeping forces to the conflict zone.
