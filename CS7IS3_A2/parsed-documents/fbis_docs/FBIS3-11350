During the final phase of the meeting, he took a question from one of the ambassadors. The Nicaraguan ambassador asked a question regarding the future dissolution or reduction of the Guatemalan Army. [Begin recording] [Nicaraguan Ambassador Jose Ernesto Fonseca] [Words indistinct] [De Leon Carpio] Army reduction in our case is not viable, and I believe in general this is not possible, because even countries that supposedly have no armies do in fact have them. Our Constitution clearly establishes the presence and establishment of a single army and does not accept another armed group or any irregulars; thus, according to the president, there is no room for this topic. Regarding the first part, indeed there have been talks within the Armed Forces on retraining and even on reduction. A study is being undertaken in accordance with Guatemalan Army plans and with conditions that are going to take place, but naturally the armed conflict must end before this can happen. It is impossible to ask for an Army reduction while subversives are present, while there is an enemy inside the country. Much has been said about the Civil Defense Patrols, and I am going to broach the subject right away, because there have been requests for their dissolution. They form part of, precisely, Guatemala's defense system. The Civil Defense Patrols are groups of people who have joined together. There have been many discussions as to whether they are really volunteers. A poll was taken recently by the human rights ombudsman, who replaced me, and the result was very surprising, as far as the level of volunteers is concerned, by those who comprise the so-called PAC's, Civilian Self-Defense Patrols, which are now called Civilian Defense Volunteer Committees. Much has been said to the effect they should be dissolved, because some members of these patrols commit abuses; this is true, and we admit it. We are aware of this and have issued orders that whenever these abuses take place, when these occur and illegal acts or crimes are committed, they will be placed on trial just like any ordinary citizen. We admit they have caused us problems, but to go as far as eliminating those who have halted the advance of subversion is illogical and naive. In Guatemala, many groups are asking for the elimination of these defense volunteers, not only groups within Guatemala but groups abroad, and I have always said when groups like this request this elimination, they are either naive or do not want the subversives' advance to be stemmed. These civilian defense patrols have been an example the world over on the way one can counter and hinder the advance of guerrilla warfare to such an extent that many countries have regrettably copied this. I say regrettably, because I regret guerrilla warfare has also taken place in other countries. Other countries have copied the way our people--who are angered by their sufferings, their orphans, their widows, etc.--have become organized to defend themselves. It is difficult for the Guatemalan Army or any other Army in the world to control terrorists' advances. The organized civilian efforts have furthered our country's military defense, however, because they have stopped the guerrilla's advances; this is what they have done and that is why we have won the military war. The rebels have been militarily defeated. In this respect, I would like to add there is already a disposition for [words indistinct] in the places where there is no confrontation. The defense minister will confirm there are no guerrillas in two-thirds of the country, and in the other [words indistinct] there are no Civilian Defense patrols. I have noticed, however, there is a great deal of confusion regarding groups such as the Civilian Defense Patrols and the Peace and Development Committees. They are very well-organized groups, which, in the future, when they no longer need weapons, can be of great help in furthering economic and social development in their own communities. We would like the defense minister to add to our comments. [Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Rene Enriquez Morales] [Passage omitted] Messrs Ambassadors: With regard to dissolving, reducing, modifying, or renovating the Army, we [words indistinct] a draft to the president of the Republic on how to renovate the Guatemalan Army once the guerrilla threat has ended. Many of the suggested actions are already being implemented by those who have the constitutional responsibility to do so and in compliance with the orders of the constitutional president of the Republic. We believe those reforms will allow us to modify and strengthen certain areas; for example, [words indistinct], to become more effective. The Army reforms will allow us to change quantity for quality. The measures have to be organized and will include the [words indistinct] studies from the military academy, the university, and the centers for military studies. A person who graduates as an officer cannot be ranked as such if he does not have a [words indistinct] of a liberal career. Nobody will be able to take [words indistinct] course and much less the command staff course if he does not have a university degree or a master's degree in any of the liberal disciplines. This program, gentlemen, has already started. [Passage indistinct]... because there is still an ongoing armed conflict. There is, however, [words indistinct] to change quantity for quality in the Guatemalan Army. The president of the Republic knows this well and, moreover, he has approved such efforts. I do not want to take more of your time, so I will not add further. Thank you. [end recording]
