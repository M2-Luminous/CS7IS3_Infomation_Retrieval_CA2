The fundamental reforms that established the organizational bases of the entire internal service on the scale of the Russian state date back to the time of the reign of Alexander I, who on 16 January 1811 signed an edict on the establishment of a special kind of troops--the internal guard including local military commands, which previously were under the jurisdiction of the civil authorities and along with the police were responsible for the "preservation of peace and calm." "...the provincial companies and regular commands," stated a document from the "highest" level, "should be better organized and made to conform to their current service function and to the general order and we order that all these commands be transferred from civilian to military authority...." The emperor's edict from 27 March to the military minister ordered the regular provincial companies and commands to be redeployed in the capitals of the provinces [guberniyas] and internal guard battalions to be formed from them. At the decision of the Military Collegium a month later, these battalions were brought together in 20 brigades. On 3 July 1811, the "Statute for the Internal Guard" was affirmed at the highest level. In comparing the tasks of Russia's contemporary internal troops with those of their predecessors, one can find much in common. And there is perhaps nothing surprising about this: There have been changes in the political situations, social foundations, and nature of crime and violations of the law but the essence of military service in defense of the interests of the state, society, and individual, the "preservation of peace and calm," has remained as it was. A special page in the history of the internal troops was the participation in the Great Patriotic War in 1941-1945. Not many people know that on that memorable June morning the fascist forces first hit not only our border troops but also our troops at small garrisons guarding railroad bridges and other structures along the western border. In the first weeks of military action, the internal troops sent to the fighting army large and well-trained forces, forming 15 rifle divisions, which operated in the most dangerous sectors of the front. All of them fought courageously and some subsequently received honorary names. The manner in which the internal troops fought is shown, among other things, by the fact that an individual special-purpose motorized rifle brigade that was formed in 1941 and became an educational center for the training of reconnaissance-subversion groups for actions in the enemy's rear trained 22 Heroes of the Soviet Union. Among them were the commanders of partisan formations D. Medvedev (the legendary scout N. Kuznetsov operated in his detachment), V. Karasev, F. Ozmitel, and others. Altogether more than 200 servicemen trained by the internal troops were honored with the lofty title of Hero during the period of the Great Patriotic War. The soldiers and sergeants, warrant officers and officers of the internal troops perform an entire spectrum of the most varied missions: They perform guard and convoy duty, they support the public order in cities and towns, and they participate in the elimination of the consequences of earthquakes and other natural disasters as well as the freeing of hostages from the grip of terrorists.... For several years now, servicemen of the internal troops have been providing for public security at so-called "hot spots" in regions where states of emergency prevail. The troops have all that they need to handle such complex and multifaceted missions. They include not only combined units and operational units but also special motorized, air, and naval units. The internal troops have a solid base for the training of junior commanders and various kinds of specialists. Those wishing to tie their fate to the troops may do so by signing a contract for three or five years. Men 18 to 40 years of age are accepted for contract service on a voluntary basis. For some positions, women from 20 to 40 years of age are accepted. Questions involving contract service in the troops are resolved in the military units of internal troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia and also by the military commissariats of the republics in the Russian Federation, autonomous okrug, kray, or oblast, and cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. The officer corps is formed from graduates of higher military educational institutions of the internal troops. Here are their addresses: Vladikavkaz Higher Military Command Red Banner School imeni S.M. Kirov--362005, g. Vladikavkaz, 5; Novosibirsk Higher Military Command School--630114, g. Novosibrisk, 114; Saratov Higher Military Red Banner Command School imeni F.E. Dzerzhinskiy--410023, g. Saratov, 23; St. Petersburg Higher Military Command School--198075, g. Sankt-Peterburg, 75; Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School--614108, g. Perm, 108 The schools accept inducted personnel, reserve personnel with a military service obligation, service personnel in extended service at the end of two years of extended service, and warrant officers at the end of two years of service in positions of warrant officers or officers no older than 23 years of age; also civilian youths 17 to 21 years of age. Service personnel wishing to enter a school present a request to the command prior to 1 April and those with a service obligation and civilian youths submit an application to rayon (city) military commissariats or internal affairs sections in their place of residence prior to 1 May. The graduates of higher military educational institutions are assigned the rank of lieutenant and are given a diploma of the Russian type with conferment of the qualification of jurist (for higher military command schools) or engineer of a particular profile (for the Perm Higher Military Command-Rear School). Both officers finishing higher troop schools and contract personnel among those accepted for service on a voluntary basis have good opportunities to improve their education. You can be certain that when you enter into service in the troops you obtain guarantees of your social protection! Persons performing service in the internal troops are assured monetary remuneration in the manner and in accordance with the standards set by the Government of the Russian Federation for service personnel. Service personnel of the internal troops are granted certain privileges guaranteed by the laws of the Russian Federation on the internal troops of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and on the status of service personnel: --payment of monetary compensation instead of a food ration, the amount of which changes as prices rise, being equal to 1,445 rubles [R] a day beginning 1 February of this year; --payment at the end of the year of a monetary award for the conscientious performance of duties in the amount of three salaries for the duty assignment and military rank; --payment of an award for class qualification of up to 7 percent of the salary for the duty assignment; --payment of a bonus for special service conditions up to 60 percent of the duty salary; --provision of material assistance once a year in the amount of one salary for the duty assignment and military rank. In set cases at the request of the service personnel, they are issued an interest-free loan in the amount of 12 salaries for the duty assignment and military rank over a period of up to three years for the initial provision of a household. Those entering service in the troops are freed from the payment of income tax on monetary compensation, monetary awards, and other payments that they receive in connection with the performance of the obligations of their military service and also from the payment of the land tax and property tax. Provision is made for the compulsory state individual insurance of the service personnel of the internal troops; for free transportation on all kinds of public transportation in the cities, suburbs, and localities (except taxis), and also--in utilizing basic leave to the site of their leisure activity and back, including by air; a free one-way trip once a year for family members of contract service personnel--to the place of leave and back. To this one must also add the following possibilities: --free medical assistance in military-medical subunits, units, and institutions and the possibility for service personnel and members of their families to rest and improve their health in the rest homes and sanatoria of the internal troops and Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia; --aid to the wives of servicemen who do not have the possibility of finding work at the place of service of their husbands; --provision of places in children's preschool institutions for children of service personnel with payment under favorable conditions; --provision of monetary compensation for cadets undergoing schooling at military educational institutions of the internal troops beginning with the second course at the norms for personnel serving under contract. And this is despite the fact that they are provided other kinds of allowances (food, personal property, medical services, and others) free of charge. The Law of the Russian Federation on the Status of Service Personnel also provides for: --payment of monetary compensation with the departure of the serviceman for leave in the amount of six minimum payments for labor as set by law (as of the time of departure for leave) for the serviceman himself and three minimum payments for labor as set by law for his wife and for each minor child. It is also worth knowing that service personnel without permanent living quarters or in need of improving their living conditions are provided free financial aid for the acquisition of housing: --not less than 75 percent of the cost of living quarters for those with a total service time of 10 to 25 years and 100 percent for those having served 25 years or longer; --payment of living space, municipal services, and the installation and use of apartment telephones amounts to 50 percent of the cost. If the service personnel of the internal troops serve in remote places or places with severe climatic conditions, they are paid more for the performance of their duties (up to 100 percent more) and also a bonus for uninterrupted service in these places (up to 100 percent of the salary for the duty position and military rank). The service personnel of the internal troops are granted additional privileges for the performance of missions in defense of the constitutional rights of citizens under the conditions of a state of emergency and under the conditions of armed conflicts: --payment of additional salaries and salaries twice the standard for the military rank; --one month of military service in these regions counts as three; --mission expenses are paid for the entire period of the performance of the tasks; --additional leave amounting to 10 calendar days is granted for each 3 months of military service in these regions. [Boxed material] So, you have been given some information to think about. Your choice depends on you and you alone. BUT IF YOU are dreaming of the romance of military service, are not afraid of difficulties, and do not consider yourself a weakling and if you want to participate directly in the building of a law-governed state, are prepared in the role of a soldier of peacemaking forces to act where your help is needed, and are not averse to fighting for the right to wear the red beret of the special forces, then you will have made the right decision! The internal troops are waiting for you! [Additional boxed material under the heading "In One Paragraph"] The elite of the internal troops is a special-purpose formation. They are always prepared to tackle on short notice any military mission thousands of kilometers from the place of their deployment. By no means everyone has the right to wear the red beret of the special forces. It must be earned through outstanding performance in special training and through flawless execution of the soldier's duty. 856 officers and warrant officers of the internal troops took part in combat operations in the Republic of Afghanistan as military advisers. 522 of them were given state awards. In the last two years alone, operational and special motorized military units carried out more than 50,000 service and combat missions. 2,142 firearms and 236,000 pieces of ammunition of various kinds were confiscated by front-line details together with internal affairs agencies or independently; they confiscated 2,165 grenades and explosive devices and 24 pieces of armored equipment. In eliminating the consequences of the 1988 earthquake in Armenia, troop personnel saved 659 people and confiscated from plunderers and turned over to the state money and material assets valued at R9,157,150. Patrol details arrested 203 robbers and marauders and confiscated 44 firearms and a large quantity of ammunition. The fund to help the population suffering from the disaster collected R531,237 and 3,154 liters of blood were given. More than 14,500 servicemen of the internal troops participated in the elimination of the consequences of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station, whereby 276 of them were awarded orders and medals for self-sacrificing actions and 162 officers were given military ranks one level higher than is foreseen for the position that they hold. Altogether more than 4,300 servicemen of the internal troops were given state awards in the period from 1989 through 1993.
