Rees] [Text] Bloemfontein March 23 SAPA -- The National Peacekeeping Force [NPKF] could recruit more than 4,000 additional troops next month, depending on the availability of training bases and accommodation, NPKF Commander Gen Gabriel Ramushwana said on Wednesday [23 March]. He said the force was urgently looking for new bases with adequate accommodation for the NPKF's second intake, due In mid-April. The additional troops would be deployed after the elections if necessary. Three battalions of troops, numbering about 3,000, have completed training at the De Brug camp near Bloemfontein and are undergoing evaluation before deployment next month. Another battalion is near the end of its training at Koeberg near Cape Town. Gen Ramushwana said he and his commanders were not too concerned about the looming election date or the numbers of troops at hand, but rather concentrated on the quality of the peacekeepers. He stressed the NPKF was not the only security agency responsible for a peaceful, fair election.
