FBIS4-33448 "drlat109_a_94008" FBIS-LAT-94-109 Daily Report 6 Jun 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Explosion Reported at Scientific Center Explosion Reported at Scientific Center FL0606182394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network in Spanish 1700 GMT 6 Jun 94 FL0606182394 Havana Radio Rebelde Network Spanish BFN [From the "National Radio News"] [Text] On Sunday, an explosion occurred in the area of the No. 2 plant at one of the PPG [anti-cholesterol agent] production complexes. A commission created for this purpose is currently investigating the causes of this incident. The commandos of La Coronela and the No. 8 Unit of the Minint [Interior Ministry] National Fire Prevention and Extinguishing Directorate were the first to arrive following the emergency which occurred at 1100 on Sunday at the No. 2 plant of Western Scientific Center. The determined participation of the young firemen prevented the fire from spreading. Emilio Gomez Hernandez, a delegate of the 95th Sector of the Fifth Arroyo Arenas Council, also played an important and courageous role. Eva Alvarez arrived immediately and was able to interview him. [Begin recording] [Alvarez] What did you do when you heard the explosion? [Gomez] I was in the yard. I quickly evacuated the personnel over to the river, as we have been instructed to do. [Alvarez] In which yard were you? [Gomez] In my back yard. I was going into the house, coming from the backyard. [Alvarez] Do you live across the street? [Gomez] I live exactly across the street from the plant. When I heard the explosion I looked up and saw red flames. I thought it was an air raid or a bomb. Then I quickly... [pauses] I expected another explosion so I quickly evacuated the personnel across the river. I mean all the personnel in the area. [Alvarez] And the neighbors. [Gomez] And the neighbors. There are 18 houses in the area. I evacuated them toward the river. Then I quickly ran over to the plant [words indistinct]. [Alvarez] What did you do at the plant? [Gomez] I tried to close the valves, meaning the boiler's valves. [Alvarez] Do you know about that? [Gomez] Yes, I know where they are because I have been here with them. There are three valves at the plant. [Alvarez] The plant where the accident occurred? [Gomez] Yes, the plant where the accident occurred. Then I checked this side and had someone close down the street which leads to the freeway and the street which leads to Lazaro Pena. [Alvarez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival? [Gomez] To facilitate the firemen's arrival and to keep public transit vehicles away. Then I checked the neighborhood in case someone had been injured. That is what we did. [Alvarez] Did you have anything to do with the injured comrades? [Gomez] No. [Alvarez] Did they sustain minor injuries? [Gomez] Yes. [Alvarez] I understand nine of them sustained injuries but were able to walk. [Gomez] I saw when they left and they were able to walk. That is what I saw. [Alvarez] Then you made sure the valves were secure. [Gomez] I secured the vales and the neighborhood, afraid another explosion would occur. In other words, everyone in the neighborhood was led to the river. [end recording] Emilio Gomez Hernandez surpassed his responsibility as a delegate. He evacuated the neighbors and, thanks to his knowledge about the plant, he was able to close the valves connected to the boilers -- despite a shower of glass which threatened his own life. This man, a retired officer from the explosives team, honored the motto of the Minint, which today marks its 33rd anniversary -- our strength is the people's strength.
