The bill, ridiculed abroad and contested by sections of the ruling right-wing coalition, was nevertheless expected to be voted in its essentials in second reading by the lower house of parliament. The upper house, the Senate, has already voted the bill with communist and right-wing support while socialist senators abstained, calling it "repressive" and "antiyouth." [passage omitted]
