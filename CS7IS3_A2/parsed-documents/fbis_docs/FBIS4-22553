According to available information, trading sessions will be suspended after the exchange rate goes beyond this mark. Will this really happen? After all, as "people in the know" are telling us, Ukraine has merely replicated in a grotesque form the actions Russia took to stabilize the monetary and credit system. The Russian leadership has had time to assess all the drawbacks and advantages of this measure by turning to Ukrainian experience. However, we must say that the liberal press of Moscow has done everything in order to portray the policy of the Zvyahilskyy cabinet in the most negative light. The Moscow press wrote on this account: "The memorable abolition of the rate of the karbovanets set on the exchange has ultimately robbed it of the attributes of a banknote." On the eve of the election campaign, the issue of feasibility or unfeasibility of the regulated exchange rate was once again up for discussion, turning into a heavyweight argument in the battle for deputy seats. They embarked upon accusing the government of an administrative approach and encroachment on the principles of a market economy. However, the trouble was that contrary to gloomy predictions, the exchange rate of the karbovanets stabilized, becoming the main argument in the election battle. Let us quote some numbers. On 31 December 1993, one dollar fetched 27,000 karbovantsy; a month later, this ratio did not change. By the end of the month, the exchange rate of the dollar went up somewhat and came to 30,200 karbovantsy. The average monthly rate of inflation also testifies to the condition of the Ukrainian economy. Beginning at 50 percent last year, the Zvyahilskyy government succeeded in bringing it down to 19 percent in January and 12 percent in February. This is how all of this has influenced common consumers. The cost of the minimum "basket" consisting of 22 consumer goods which are the most essential for living changed in the following manner: 4 January--412,000 karbovantsy, 3 February--426,000 karbovantsy, and 3 March--432,000 karbovantsy. It would be proper to recall how the current government started out. The conventional belief is that Kuchma resigned in the fall of last year. However, in essence only the formal act of surrendering the attributes of power occurred at that time. The introduction of a fixed exchange rate of the karbovanets in August amounted to the real resignation (do not confuse this with the suspension of trading sessions on the currency exchange). As a result of the action taken, the government acknowledged the bankruptcy of the policy it had pursued, and at the same time lost Mr. Pynzenyk, who considered it impossible to remain faithful to the ideals of economic romanticism in the midst of "Red directors" and other supporters of state regulation. The decision of the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Bank to introduce a fixed exchange rate of the Ukrainian national currency brought about its record leap. From 5,970 karbovantsy, the exchange rate plummeted to 19,050 karbovantsy to the ruble [as published], and the cost of the noncash ruble rose to 15 karbovantsy at the time. Yet another sad record is associated with the activities of the Kuchma government: Ukraine came to rank second in the world in terms of inflation rate, overtaking such countries as Zaire and Somalia (Serbia ranks first). In 1993 the emission of currency went up by a factor of 17, whereas the exchange rate of the karbovanets against the dollar fell by a factor of 36. How can this be? The answer is simple: The difference represents the volume of capital exported from Ukraine. This is what ill-conceived actions in the area of currency regulation and foreign economic activities have brought about. However, the statistics given do not reflect the whole picture because they fail to account of such a phenomenon as dollar inflation in Ukraine. Last year the exchange rate of the dollar fell by a factor of 2.77. If we put this indicator together with the index of a decline in the karbovanets, it will turn out that purchasing power of the national currency in real terms fell by a factor of approximately 47. We should add that during 1992 and 1993 the National Bank extended large emission credit to the Kuchma-Pynzenyk government in order to subsidize industry, transportation, and agriculture. A considerable proportion of these subsidies were used to produce export products. In the process, exporters who sold products for freely convertible currencies drew additional income due to the decline in the exchange rate of the karbovanets and state subsidies, as well as due to exemption from payment of value-added and excise taxes. It is not at all surprising that the fixed exchange rate failed to produce the desired result, but instead greatly discredited the very idea of state regulation in the area of monetary circulation in the eyes of the public. It would appear that most countries of the world, such as Austria, Sweden, Hungary, Finland, Poland, and others, which can hardly be suspected of being "nonmarket," use regulated exchange rates as the main instrument for financial stabilization. Both America and Japan have gone through this. However, it is precisely the point that for Prime Minister Kuchma this was a forced measure, an act of desperation not bolstered by other undertakings. The absence of a comprehensive approach to solving economic problems was the main flaw in the activities of that Cabinet of Ministers. Prime Minister Ye.L. Zvyahilskyy took office with this kind of inheritance. First off, the government embarked on currency regulation which was expert and justifiable under the current conditions; it is one of the most significant ways to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and a reduction in the rate of inflation. It was suggested that the interbank currency exchange take a "pause" because its operation facilitated the buildup of the inflationary spiral. The government proceeded to take this measure, which was unpopular in banking circles because the exchange rate of the karbovanets against the dollar and the Russian ruble that was artificially understated on the exchange was not in line with the ratio of the real purchasing power of these currencies, since there were extremely few real transactions to sell currency. This had to do with the fact that transactions concluded came at best to just 5 percent of the entire currency turnover of the country. Experts estimate that the exchange rates of the dollar and the Russian ruble were overstated by no less than a factor of 2.5, which did tremendous damage to the economy of Ukraine. Therefore, a tender committee allocating currency for targeted uses in the interests of the entire economy of the country appeared instead of a monopolized group acting on the exchange in keeping with a preliminary agreement. A restructuring program appeared, which reduced the risk of the use of financial funds proceeding from the arbitrary motives of "comrades in the leadership." Two more reasons may be named among those that influenced the relative stabilization of the karbovanets: first, restrictions on intermediary surcharges, which resulted in a veritable economic war between the government and traders in "black gold," and, second, the containment of monetary emission. However, the seriousness of the intentions of the Zvyahilskyy government and the deliberation of the steps taken by it can be verified soon. Russia has banned the use of foreign currency in settlements for transactions. This is when the test of strength for the karbovanets will be administered. As far as the hryvnya is concerned.... Recently, I happened to ask Deputy Prime Minister Landik about its fate. His response was: "I promise you that this will be done on a Thursday. I cannot say precisely when, but definitely on a Thursday."
