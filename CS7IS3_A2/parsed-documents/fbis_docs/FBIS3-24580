Basanov, Ye. F. Pen, P. Ye. Tverdokhleb; UDC 535.232.65] [Abstract] Light beam splitters for formation of three- dimensional interconnection, employing planar lightguides based on the effect of total internal reflection, and holographic arrays for the radiation input and output are examined in this paper. Single-beam arrays for input and output, as well as multiple-beam arrays are discussed and their characteristics are compared. It is demonstrated that in such microcircuits the application of multiple-beam arrays for radiation output is preferable, because when the light losses in the hologram materials are taken into account, they provide a significantly greater efficiency of utilizing the light source power than the single-beam arrays. When the coefficient of light attenuation is 3dB/cm, splitters with a N=1024 output beams and a laser power efficiency of 50% can be produced using the multiple beam arrays.
