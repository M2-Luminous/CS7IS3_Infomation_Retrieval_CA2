This is our radio editor's editorial: Senator John Kerry has many times visited Vietnam and excavation sites to settle problems relating to POW-MIA or the missing-in-action issue. He has met with leaders of the Vietnamese party and Government as well as ordinary Vietnamese citizens. More than anyone else, he understands and correctly assesses the Vietnamese people and country. After his recent visit to Vietnam, he declared in Washington on 25 January that it is time we lifted the trade embargo because it is no longer against Vietnam -- thus against us [sentence as heard]. The selection committee on POW/MIA issue of the U.S. Senate headed by Senator Kerry drew the conclusion after one year of investigation that there was no evidence of American prisoners-of-wars living in detention camps in Vietnam. He also said 123 of 196 discrepancy cases had been solved. So, the four preconditions for lifting the trade embargo put forth by the U.S. President have been satisfied. So there is no reason for the continued U.S. embargo. Senator Kerry said he would submit a report on his latest field study in Vietnam and raise that issue with President Bill Clinton. He also said that besides cooperating with the United States on the MIA issue, Vietnam was expanding its economic relations with other foreign countries. That is why the United States might lose the opportunity for doing business with Vietnam. Senator Kerry's viewpoint is shared by many politicians, scholars, and businessmen in the United States and other countries who have come to Vietnam.
