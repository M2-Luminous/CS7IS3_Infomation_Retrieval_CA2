[Arouca] My visit to Europe began in Rome, where I was received by his holiness the pope in a joint audience and with the treatment accorded to heads of state. I was very impressed with the treatment that the Vatican accorded to my wife and me. We had a brief exchange of views. I sent photographs of the meeting to the Mozambican press, but they were not published. That was true sabotage. In instances where the photographs were published, they were so small one could hardly see them. It is regrettable that local journalists should act like this. The audience at the Vatican had been arranged two weeks in advance through the regular channels. Everything went according to legal procedures. In Rome, I also met a number of politicians with whom I exchanged views. I saw to it that protocols of cooperation were signed between Fumo [Mozambique United Front-Democratic Convergence Party] and those parties. Fumo succeeded in doing that. Right now we are in contact with those parties, and the indications are that such contacts will continue. In Bonn, I visited the Konrad Adenauer and Friedrich Ebert Foundations. We have succeeded in establishing positive relations with those foundations. In Lisbon, I met with the Christian Democratic Party. I think this is the only party that is in contact with UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of Angola]. The other Portuguese parties have adopted a leftist stance and enjoy very strong relations with Angola's MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] and Mozambique's Frelimo [Mozambique Liberation Front]. I did not try to establish contacts with those parties. I have tried to do so in the past, but to no avail. In fact, the only party that has maintained relations with non-Marxist parties from the former colonies is the Christian Democratic Party. By the way, some time ago, in an article signed by J.M., DOMINGO said I had been a CDS [Social Democratic Center] militant. I must point out that I have never been a militant in any Portuguese party. Actually, the Portuguese know that I have been the Fumo leader since 1976. After all, no citizen may belong to two parties at the same time. It would be wrong for me to be the leader of one party and a militant in another. The insinuation appeared in that newspaper, and I think it was shrouded in a certain degree of malice. In any event, ill-intentioned deeds stay with those who practice them and not with those at whom they are leveled. Going back to the visit, I must tell you that I do not wish to go into further details to prevent sabotage and a blockade by certain adversaries. [Manuel] You have often been referred to as the Catholic Church's ticket in the upcoming elections. This has to do with your meeting with the pope and your frequent contacts with [Mozambican Cardinal] Dom Alexandre. What are your comments? [Arouca] This was my first contact with the pope, and I do not know if there will be others. As for Dom Alexandre, my contacts with him date back more than 30 years, when he was a mere village priest in Jangamo, in the outlaying areas of Inhambane. Afterward, he served as a priest in Homoine, where I think he was born.... When I was studying in Portugal, I used to come to Mozambique on vacation, and usually I met with him and talked to him. He is rather close to my family and knows my parents and all my relatives. That cemented our friendship at a time when none of us dreamed that he would become a cardinal. I did not see him while I was in exile in Portugal, but we resumed our contacts after I returned. My contacts with him are not political at all--far from it. I do not expect to be backed by the church as a candidate for the simple reason that, as a jurist, I am supposed to know that canonical law prohibits the involvement of the church in political schemes. Aware of that reality, I have nurtured neither the will, desire, ambition, nor whim of becoming a candidate backed by the church. The church cannot meddle in politics, and I uphold that centuries-old principle, which is part and parcel of the basic laws of that institution. I maintain relations with many bishops in Mozambique, but these are purely relations of friendship. I am a believer and was brought up to following the austere principles of religion. My entire family is Christian. The claim that I might become the church's candidate is not true. [Manuel] Elections are scheduled to take place in about nine months. How does Fumo envisage its electoral strategy? [Arouca] Right now, we are formulating our strategy. For obvious reasons, I cannot give you the details. We have, however, made a great deal of progress in this regard, more than in other areas. We regret that the process is marred by so many disturbances, discrepancies, and setbacks. Yet, I think that this is the price we ought to pay for the establishment of democracy in Mozambique. Will the process evolve normally? I think that it will, although there are signs looming on the political horizon that there could be serious political disturbances. In any event, there is a great deal of goodwill for the process to move forward quickly and clearly. I think the Mozambican people will do their best so that the process is neither halted nor disrupted. We are following it with attention and will do our best to see that what has happened and is happening in Angola does not take place in Mozambique. I am optimistic. [Manuel] There seems to be a great deal of polarization about Frelimo and Renamo [Mozambique National Resistance], with each claiming to be the champions of democracy. What role will the unarmed opposition parties play? [Arouca] Frelimo and Renamo have not started democracy in Mozambique, unless one thinks that those who ruined the country, carried out destruction, and caused 1 million deaths and 4 million refugees have established democracy.... It is the people who started democracy. I have read in several newspapers that Dhlakama and Chissano are natural candidates. This implies that all the others are unnatural candidates. How this can be natural is something that is beyond my comprehension. Are natural candidates those who waged war, ordered massacres, and ruined the country's infrastructures and unnatural candidates the ones who stood for democracy through dialogue? I do not quite understand that. The unarmed parties have a very important role to play in this political process. What needs to be known is whether we will be able to play that role efficiently in these circumstances. If there are no major splits among the unarmed parties and if there is a balanced understanding between the opposition and the powers that be, I think the unarmed parties could play a decisive role. Right now, I am in touch with some of the political leaders, specifically to encourage them to understand that unity is fundamental for the opposition to win. One must always bear the following in mind: If, for some reason, Frelimo wins the next elections, it would be very difficult to remove it from power. The opposition's main opportunity to achieve this is during the first elections, not during succeeding elections. [Manuel] Are you suggesting that the opposition should form a coalition? [Arouca] I do not know whether it will be a coalition, a unity, or a front. As I see it, the opposition ought to have a strategy that is as unified as possible if it wants to win the elections. If the opposition remains divided, none of the parties will go very far. [Manuel] And have your calls been welcomed by those leaders? [Arouca] Well, the parties that I have spoken to have been receptive and understanding. In fact, I expect my contacts will result in the establishment of a force capable of winning the elections, and that is very important for this country. [Manuel] As far as I know, your political career is quite a long one. How do you see yourself as a candidate for the Presidency of the Republic in the upcoming elections? [Arouca] In January 1993, Fumo held its first national congress. During this congress, it was decided that I would be the natural candidate to run in the first democratic elections. I accepted that decision with a degree of satisfaction, and I have made arrangements to play that role in a positive manner. Yet, contrary to what some people may think, I have no ambition or personal interest in becoming president of the Republic. Throughout my life, I have been invited to play senior roles, both by the Portuguese Government during the colonial era and by Frelimo after independence. I refused to collaborate with Portugal because I did not want to side with colonialism. I refused to work with Frelimo because I did not want to throw in my lot with the establishment of communism in my fatherland. In view of this, I could ask: So, why am I running for the post now? I have accepted it for a number of reasons. I can explain some of them. First, I have been in politics for some 40 years and a lawyer for about 30 years. That has given me some political, administrative, and juridical experience. I clearly understand that it is my duty to serve the country. All of us are not enough to tackle the task of reconstruction. Moreover, it is my view that people may only conscientiously exercise their right to vote if there are at least three or four candidates for the presidency. At least one of them should be a civilian who was not involved in the war or responsible for the situation the country faces today. Only this will permit the people to choose their candidate. To say that the candidates are Chissano and Dhlakama is to force one to choose a soldier. I reject that. It is not democracy. The people have the right to choose between soldiers and civilians, but not between two soldiers. This is one of the reasons why my candidacy will be announced. It does not matter whether I am elected. What matters is that the people may clearly and conscientiously make a choice. Another reason for my decision is that I think this country is like a train that has derailed into a swamp of corruption and stagnation. If I am elected, my priority will be to put the train back on track, to head it in the right direction, and to put it into motion. Later, power will be handed over to the younger generation because I feel that it is the country's young people who should lead the nation. Another reason is that after I saw the direction in which Frelimo's reforms were heading and the manner in which the Frelimo government operated, I realized that no significant change can take place in this country as long as Frelimo remains in power. The priority for the opposition is to remove Frelimo from power. These are some of the reasons. Personally, I think that being president of the Republic is a sacrifice, although one that every citizen ought to endure for the sake of his fatherland. Only people without occupations or professions yearn to be president. [Manuel] It has become quite clear that the ability of governments to rule in a country like ours is declining in favor of international financial institutions like the IMF and the World Bank. How do you think you would fulfill your program under such conditions? [Arouca] These institutions have not parachuted into the country. They entered the country because the Frelimo government created so much poverty and misery that it became necessary for the IMF and the World Bank to come here. If the Frelimo government had worked differently, it would not be in such a tight situation today. The way out of this? I am not the one to tell you. Frelimo has its own experts, and it should solve its own problems. [Manuel] It seems that Fumo has not been able to escape the tradition of crisis that is the hallmark of opposition parties. Recently, the removal of its vice president was announced. How do you assess the situation in your party? [Arouca] Dr. Carlos Jeque has not been removed. He resigned for personal reasons, and these need to be resolved. I think he felt he could not give his best to the party because of those reasons. He has not been removed from the party, and there is no crisis whatsoever. He merely ceased to be the vice president, a very demanding post. [Manuel] Your name has been cited as being linked to a project for the creation of a democratic institute in Mozambique. What are your comments? [Arouca] I have such a plan. I embarked on it because, nine months before the elections, there are areas in the country where people do not even know that a multiparty system is in place. They still think that we live in a single-party system. As a government, Frelimo should shoulder the responsibility of effectively educating the people. Frelimo does not do it because it is not interested. What matters for Frelimo is that people continue to think that only Frelimo exists and that it might even be dangerous to vote for another party. I think there should be a nonpartisan body so that parties may join hands, organize teams, meet the rural population, and tell them that the situation has changed, how it has changed, and what their rights are. I think this is fundamental and urgent. [Manuel] In recent statements to MEDIAFAX, the Renamo leader accused you of serious violations, embezzling his movement's funds, and so on. You have never commented on this publicly. Why? [Arouca] I have never commented on it because these accusations are not worth commenting on. These accusations should not only be made; they should be proved, as well. When the Renamo leader produces evidence of what he is saying, you may rest assured that I will then refute it because what he said has never taken place. He has probably ignored what has happened. He ignored the fact that I was invited to lead Renamo when it was still called MNR [Mozambique National Resistance] and before he was around. I turned down the invitation. First of all, I am against war, and Renamo always had a militaristic outlook. I think that problems between Mozambicans should be resolved through frank and loyal dialogue, not through arms. We all know how to start wars, but no one knows how they will end. Second, Renamo was created a year after I established Fumo, a party more in line with my political philosophy. General Dhlakama probably ignores that. He ignores the history of his own party. He should be better informed. Dhlakama has the bad habit of making wild statements against everybody without proving what he says. That is not suitable for a candidate for the presidency of the Republic. This strange attitude is gradually disqualifying him. He is well aware of the accident that claimed the life of former Ambassador Ataide--who was accompanied by Mateus--who was known as Dhlakama's personal representative in Europe. He knows, like I do, how they died and where they died, although their bodies have never been found. It would be better if Dhlakama abstains from talking about things about which he does not seem to be well informed. In one of his interviews, Dhlakama said I was rather old. That is true, and I am only honored by that statement. It gives greater legitimacy to my candidacy. I think candidates ought to be somewhat old to be perceived as honest. I would like to remind him that Nelson Mandela, leader of the ANC [African National Congress], is 72; UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is 72; and, if I am not mistaken, Dr. Mario Soares, president of the Portuguese Republic, today regarded as one of Europe's most brilliant statesmen and already mentioned as the successor to Butrus-Ghali, is also about 72. They are all much older than I. Nobody has said that Mandela, Butrus-Ghali, or Mario Soares are too old to perform their duties efficiently. This only shows that the older people are, the more mature, experienced, and useful they become. In fact, power should be exercised by experienced people with suitable academic qualifications and not by adventurers.
