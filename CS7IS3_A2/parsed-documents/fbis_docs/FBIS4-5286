In explaining the reason for his resignation, the prime minister revealed that a "new fact concerning a legal problem has come to light" in connection with the management of his personal funds which he had entrusted to one of his friends for several years since 1981. He added that he would take moral responsibility in his capacity as the country's highest-ranking political leader. The prime minister made bold to announce a new political and ethical issue concern himself; this had not been mentioned in arguments over the so-called "Hosokawa suspicions," which include his 100 million yen loan from Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin company. He cited the new issue as the reason why he will resign as top state leader. In a sense, this approach left a clean impression. However, let us think about this for a while. How many people in Japan are satisfied with the reason the prime minister gave for his resignation? Over the past several months, Prime Minister Hosokawa continued to refuse calls by the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and the Japan Communist Party [JCP] for his cooperation in revealing the truth regarding his 100million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin and the alleged purchase of shares in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT), which he reiterated was conducted by his late father-in-law. Specifically, the prime minister has rejected demands that new documents concerning the suspicions be submitted to the Diet and that Masatoshi Miyama--former secretary to the prime minister whom the prime minister himself admitted was deeply involved in those activities--be summoned to the Diet as a sworn witness. A Palliative Reason for Resignation We had asked why the prime minister refused to cooperate with the opposition parties in summoning his former secretary if he denied all allegations and had no qualms of conscience. Moreover, we maintained that the prime minister should have positively dispelled suspicions surrounding himself and put state affairs, including budget deliberations, on the right track as soon as possible. Nevertheless, the prime minister had stuck to his refusal to summon his former secretary to the Diet. When the prospects for breaking the impasse in Diet business became quite uncertain, he had no choice but to step down. Judging from these circumstances, it is quite obvious that the direct reason for the prime minister's resignation lies in "Hosokawa suspicions" themselves, which have been discussed at Diet sessions. Nevertheless, the prime minister's stance of bringing up another case, of which he cannot give clear details, and citing it as the reason for his resignation is far from "clean"; it is nothing other than palliative. The prime minister is to resign. However, it does not follow that suspicions regarding the prime minister have been cleared. It is unforgivable to use the resignation for "concealing suspicions." The prime minister bears political and moral responsibility to cooperate in making public the truth regarding all issues of concern, including the new item he has brought up, in the future as well. Amid the public outcry over corruption concerning money-oriented politics under the LDP administration, the Hosokawa coalition administration was established under the banner of "political reform." Prime Minister Hosokawa is, so to speak, a "child of political reform," whose largest mission is the carrying out of political reform. The prime minister gallantly emerged at the forefront of the political arena, enjoying the expectations and trust of the general public, who were quite disgusted at the LDP's tainted, corrupt politics and maximized their distrust of politics. We cannot help saying it is an irony of history that Prime Minister Hosokawa himself stumbled due to his own problems concerning political ethics, and that he has been forced to step down, digging his own grave. The prime minister himself probably feels regret. However, for the people whose hopes have been disappointed, the current situation is probably more than they can possibly bear. Although it seems that we are trying to attack an already overwhelmed prime minister who announced his intention to resign, we have one more thing to say. His receipt of a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa Kyubin, alleged purchase of NTT shares, and the new issue regarding management of his personal funds are incidents which occurred several years before Mr. Hosokawa accepted the offer to become prime minister. At a time when the Sagawa scandal became a focus of attention and the scandal involving former LDP Vice President Kanemaru gave a severe shock to the political world, why did he make the decision to become prime minister before closely examining his own private affairs? Although the prime minister had a close relationship with one of the central figures of the Sagawa scandal involving persons in the center of the political world, and he acknowledged the existence of a 100 million yen loan from Sagawa, he became the master of the "political reform administration." We are completely baffled by the ethics of such a situation. When looking at the matter from a different angle, we have to point out the questionable fact that the "political reform administration" itself was formed centering on those who were in the center of the LDP's money-oriented political world, and that they still occupy leading posts even after the establishment of the administration. Prime Minister Hosokawa's Last, Valuable Legacy "The stepping down of Prime Minister Hosokawa" has proved that the inverse logic of the situation--that as long as the prime minister masquerades under the good name of "political reform" and endorses "political reform," he is exempt from responsibility for his past misdeeds--is unjustifiable. The selection of a "successor to Prime Minister Hosokawa" will probably face difficulties in connection with a struggle of party interests among the coalition parties. The parties concerned should decide on a new administration to replace the Hosokawa administration while keeping the above in mind as Prime Minister Hosokawa's valuable legacy. Following the prime minister's declaration to step down, the Hosokawa administration will come to an end only eight months after its inauguration. The administration has been generally regarded from its inception as an interim administration for materializing political reform. It was still unable to pave the way for deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget after enacting political reform bills. The administration will go out of power after truly carrying out its mission as an "administration that carries out one task." LDP-led administrations tackled political reform for the past six years, but failed to carry it out. Both the Kaifu and Miyazawa administrations collapsed due to their failure to carry out political reform. While experiencing many twists and turns, Prime Minister Hosokawa, at any rate, maintained the unity of a carriage being pulled by eight horses [seven parties and one parliamentary group of the coalition] under the banner of "political reform," and carried out the enactment of political reform bills, which the LDP administrations were unable to do. We should straightforwardly appraise this achievement. There was little possibility that without Mr. Hosokawa, seven parties and one parliamentary group could have been united amid complicated bargaining concerning party interests and policies in the course of establishing the coalition administration. Taking this into consideration, we are sure that Mr. Hosokawa will leave his name in history as a person who brought about a great change in postwar politics by putting an end to the LDP administration which had enjoyed one-party rule for 38 years. Among the achievements of the "Hosokawa administration," for which the people could not cherish expectations under the LDP administration, are the following: the opening of the rice market; a new sense of history, which neighboring nations highly evaluated; and the adoption of welfare policies which reflect the voices of labor groups. The Hosokawa administration, which has ushered in a new wind of "change" in Japan's politics, is to close its short life. However, a political vacuum and stagnation in state affairs are no longer unforgivable. At this juncture, we would like to urge each party and parliamentary group not to waste time by vainly pursuing party interests and polices, but to make efforts to establish a new administration as soon as possible.
