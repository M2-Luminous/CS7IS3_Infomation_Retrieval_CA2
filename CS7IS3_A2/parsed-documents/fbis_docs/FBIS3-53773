Speaking at the international seminar on the process of development in Central Asia and Caucasus, Va'ezi also said the Islamic Republic was closely monitoring political, social and economic developments in Central Asian and Caucasian republics. It is the duty of all countries to contribute to the reconstruction of Central Asian countries, the deputy foreign minister said. According to Va'ezi, ethnic disputes, civil war and conflicts with other countries constitute a major impediment to the economic development of Central Asian and Caucasian republics. In order to enable those countries to export their gas and oil, the Islamic Republic has allowed them to use Iranian ports along the Persian Gulf, he said, adding that "this is very important and decisive." He said the republics of Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan can transport their oil and gas to other countries via Iran. The volume of trade between Iran and those countries have reached 300 million dollars, Va'ezi said, adding "this is good for the beginning."
