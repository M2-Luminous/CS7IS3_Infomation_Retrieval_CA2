FR940812-2-00173 FR940812-2-00065 Aside from the local/distant status of broadcast signals, §76.51 also serves a purpose in determining the applicable royalty rate for distant signals to be paid by cable systems. The earlier FCC must-carry rules determined when a broadcast signal was distant, and in turn the Commission's distant signal carriage rules in effect in 1976 determined how many distant signals a cable operator in a top 100 television market could carry. 47 C.F.R. §§76.61 and 76.63 (1976). Cable systems operating in the top 50 markets listed in §76.51 were generally allowed to carry three distant signals, while systems in the second 50 markets could generally carry only two. When the distant signal carriage rules were eliminated in 1981, see Malrite T.V. of New York, Inc. v. FCC, 652 F.2d 1140 (2d Cir. 1981), cert. denied sub. nom., National Football League, Inc. v. FCC, 454 U.S. 1143 (1982), the Copyright Royalty Tribunal adjusted the royalty rates under the Copyright Code provision permitting adjustment ``[i]n the event that the rules and regulations of the [FCC] are amended .␣.␣. to permit the carriage of additional television broadcast signals beyond the local service area of such signals. .␣.␣.'' 17 U.S.C. 801(b)(2)(B). The result was that cable carriage of formerly non-permitted distant signals triggered a substantially higher copyright royalty rate (3.75% of gross receipts per signal) than that applicable to carriage of formerly permitted signals (less than 1% of gross receipts per signal). See Adjustment of the Royalty Rates for Cable Systems, 47 FR 52146 (Nov. 19, 1982). Cable systems in the top fifty §76.51 markets, therefore, can generally carry one more non-3.75% distant signal than cable systems located in the second 50 markets. Except for redesignation of the scope of a particular market, the markets listed in §76.51 and their ranking have remained unchanged since the section's inception in 1972. In 1985, the FCC amended the list to include Melbourne and Cocoa, Florida in the Orlando-Daytona Beach, Florida hyphenated market, and added Visalia, Hanford, and Clovis, California to the Fresno, California market. See Report and Order in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;11 RM 4557, 102 FCC2d 1062 (1985)(Florida); Report and Order in MM Docket No. 84&hyph;439, FCC&hyph;85&hyph;59 (1985)(California). That action raised some of the same issues presented in this proceeding, and we asked for public comment concerning the implications of the FCC action on the copyright cable compulsory license. Notice of Inquiry in Docket No. RM 85&hyph;2, 50 FR 14725 (Apr. 15, 1985). We asked the public to respond to a series of questions, including: (1) What is the impact on the copyright law of a change by the FCC in the major television market list; (2) Whether the amendment of §76.51 was a rule change requiring an adjustment in the royalty rates; (3) How should the 3.75% royalty for distant formerly nonpermitted signals be applied to the changed market; and (4) What action, if any, should the Copyright Office take to clarify the issues raised by the FCC changes in the major television market list.
