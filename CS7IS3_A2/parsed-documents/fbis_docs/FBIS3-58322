Armed Forces Minister Jeremy Hanley also said at Commons question time that he foresaw no role change when the new commander of the UN protection force, Sir Michael Rose, takes up the post at the end of this month. Sir Michael was formerly commander of the SAS [Special Air Service] in the Falklands war. Labour's Kate Hoey (Vauxhall) said there was a "credibility gap" undermining both NATO's and the UN's roles because of failure to "take action against Serbian aggression." She demanded "immediate, selective air strikes" to get the airport at Tuzla reopened and a lifting of the siege of Sarajevo. Mr Hanley said that so far British troops had escorted 1,675 convoys carrying over 80,000 tons of aid. There had also been over 1,000 flights. "They will continue to provide support for relief operation throughout the winter." He added: "It is not fair to say there is a credibility gap. What we are doing is helping countless thousands of lives. Countless thousands of people are being kept alive by our efforts." He added: "We are doing a great job and I am proud of what we are doing." John Wilkinson (C Ruislip and Northwood) asked if Sir Michael would go out with any new "political instructions" from Britain or the UN. Mr Hanley told him: "He will carry our his task superbly, he is a magnificent soldier. But there is no change in role foreseen." Later Commons Leader Tony Newton, deputising for Mr Major at question time, set out the Nato proposals, stressing Britain's willingness to use air strikes if necessary. Mr Newton said: "After some very fruitful meetings in Brussels this morning, the Prime Minister speaking there has made clear that we will be drawing up plans to help UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] bring in a Netherlands contingent to replace the Canadians in Srebrenica, and has also agreed to examine how Tuzla airport can be opened, with the intention that it should serve as a conduit for humanitarian relief. "He has also made it clear that if it is necessary to use air power to achieve these objectives, then we would be willing to do so." Tory Matthew Banks (Southport) said: "Britain, until recently, has been entirely right to resist premature calls for air strikes in the region which would have led to extreme danger for our troops on the ground who were sent there to police a UN ceasefire, not take part in guerilla warfare." He urged that "Britain continues to maintain a flexible and responsive approach to military action in Bosnia." Miss Hoey told the Government to apply Back to Basics to foreign policy: "Part of that should be a basic understanding that aggression should not be rewarded. It is crucial that the siege of Sarajevo is lifted and that your Government calls for immediate air strikes to take out the artillery which surrounds that city." Mr Newton urged her to study full reports of agreements reached in Brussels today.
