June 26 is the day when the operation officially started in the Georgian-Abkhazian war zone. Russian paratrooper and motorized infantry units, trained for peacekeeping operations, are taking positions on both banks of the Inguri. Mine clearing has started and a bridge on the river is being repaired which will hopefully enable Georgian refugees to return to their home in Abkhazia. Nadareishvili said that nearly 30,000 refugees had returned to the Gali District. The local authorities made jobs, bread and sugar available to them. Vladislav Ardzinba, chairman of the Abkhazian parliament who visited the area three days ago and talked to its residents, did not rule out the possibility of setting up local government made up of Georgians. Nadareishvili admitted that the return of refugees to the Gali District would probably take 12 to 18 months. He said that Georgian could hardly be able to maintain its territorial integrity as long as the Abkhazians dictate their own terms.
