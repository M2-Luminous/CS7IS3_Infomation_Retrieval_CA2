Ibishi: "A Nightmare Life From Tortures"] [Text] Anybody who sets off on the road to a village in Shala wonders in terror how he will pass the police checkpoints at Tunel i Pare and Stanterg. That is where the maltreatment begins, concluding with savage tortures in the Serbian police stations. Many buses are stopped at these sensitive points, and their passengers checked. Cars are also inspected, and the most eagerly expected are those with license plates from other towns. All this is done on the pretext of searching for weapons and to create tension. During these checks, according to the mood of the police, travelers are beaten and then sent to the police station, where the police continue their "urgent" mission with beatings and manhandling of the harshest and most inhuman kind. Teachers also pass these checkpoints, and are taken in for questioning and asked where they are going and why. Houses Raided, Men Tortured in Police Stations Raids on houses in the Shala region have recently intensified. Not a day has passed since the new year without a house being searched, supposedly for weapons or young people who have not been sent on military service. Heads of families are beaten in front of members of their family, and grown-up sons are tortured. The police go wild if they do not find weapons. They are not content with rubber truncheons, fists, kicks, and punches; there have been cases of men tied behind tractors and beaten on the back with spades. In some cases, teeth and ribs have been broken, and some people are still bedridden as a result of injuries caused by the police. Such beatings have occurred in Stanterg, Bare, Bajgore, Vidishiq, Rashan, Zabergje, Magjere, and recently in Vllahi and other villages. Many men have been issued with summons to appear at the police station. Stanterg has for many months been a scene of torture, where the inhabitants of Shala wait in line to be taken in for questioning. If they do not hand in weapons, they are beaten and tortured by policemen now notorious for their barbaric lack of restraint. If the police wear themselves out beating Albanians, those waiting outside have to come back the next day to be subjected to police tortures. It has been common for dozens of village houses to be raided on the same day, with dozens of men and boys being taken to police stations to be beaten and tortured without scruple. The Serbian regime wants to sow fear in this region so that the population will move, with the younger generation setting off for the big wide world. Heads of Households Beaten and Manhandled Police violence and torture take place not only in the villages of Mitrovice, but in those of Leposaviq and Vushtrri [Vucitrn]. The Albanians are mainly beaten over weapons. Old men say that these tortures are worse than those of 1956, because then only the heads of households were beaten, whereas now any male the police come across may be beaten at home in the presence of the rest of the family. Even women can be beaten, as in cases in Bistrice, Stanterg, Sllatine near Vushtrri, etc. This filthy campaign is being led by a certain Velovic, Kandic, and one Vucina from Vushtrri, who at one time pretended to be the Albanians' friends. Velovic has forgotten how he used to talk 10 years ago in front of delegations that came to Trepca, saying, "It is a pleasure to see Serbs, Albanians, Dalmatian Croats, Montenegrins, Romany Gypsies, and Latins living together at Tunel and Stanterg, helping each other....
