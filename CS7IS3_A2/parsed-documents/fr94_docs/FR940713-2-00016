In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order 486, 52 F.R. 47897), the Commission's Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed an application for surrender of license for the Lowell Atlantic Hydroelectric Project, No. 5946&hyph;007. The Lowell Atlantic Hydroelectric Project is located on the Lowell Canal System, off the Merrimack River in Middlesex County, Massachusetts. An Environmental Assessment (EA) was prepared for the application. The EA finds that approving the application for surrender of license would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.
