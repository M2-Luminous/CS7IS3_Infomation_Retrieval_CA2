Most ethnic Koreans there were mobilized by Japan as miners during World War II and left behind after the war, when Russia seized the territory. The joint team will conduct a basic survey on living conditions and demands of the Koreans and will seek cooperation with the Sakhalin local government and Red Cross for four days. Seoul considers the issue of returning the Koreans a symbolic work to resolve wrongdoings by Tokyo in the early 20th century. "Most Koreans who want to return to Korea are those who went there during World War II and now are aging. So we are to seek an early solution to the issue," a Foreign Ministry official said. The South Korean delegation, headed by Sin Kak-su, chief of the Northeast Asia division of the Foreign Ministry, include officials from the prime minister's office, Health and Social Affairs Ministry and Korea National Red Cross, while the Japanese team will comprise Foreign Ministry and Red Cross officials. Russia will send observers from the Foreign Ministry and State Committee on National Problems.
