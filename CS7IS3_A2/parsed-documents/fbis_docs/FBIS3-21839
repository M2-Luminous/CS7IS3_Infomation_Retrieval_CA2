"I handle a great deal of confidential information on this issue. We have arrested several drug traffickers and we have found out the money is moved immediately," Endara told ACAN-EFE during an interview held in his office. The Panamanian president, who chose not to reveal specific, coordinated cases of drug operations, emphasized there is "very extensive" cooperation with the United States, Spain, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala. Endara said cases in which drug traffickers have been arrested, released, and allowed to leave the country have occurred many times and cannot be considered isolated events. "All of a sudden, we find the drug trafficker is set free and allowed to leave the country. It is a worldwide known fact that the drug business pays a lot of bribes (illegal money commissions)," explained the president regarding the mysterious releases. Endara said he has held meetings with Supreme Court justices and personnel from the Attorney General's Office to get them to adopt measures aimed at preventing such events from occurring again. The president, however, emphasized that it is necessary to improve the current law on drug trafficking activities. He insisted on the need to approve the draft bill he had sent to the Attorney General's Office, which the parliament "significantly" improved. The new antidrug draft bill introduces the figure of a secret agent, which is not included in the current law. Endara said it is "absurd" that the same penalties that imposed on drug traffickers be applied to a secret agent if arrested by the police. He added that agents that infiltrate receive the same penalties as drug traffickers who deliver or receive drugs. If a secret agent is sent to jail, "we move heaven and earth" to get him released. Nobody, however, wants to be a secret agent if there are no laws to protect him, the president indicated. Last Tuesday, during the inauguration of the parliament's last period of sessions, Endara said Panama is being threatened by drug trafficking activities, drug use, and money laundering. He also asked deputies to combat drug trafficking activities and their effects on the country's economic, social, and political life. He called on the deputies to approve the new law so as to be able to fight this "imported scourge" more efficiently.
