It was carrying the first prefabricated Russian helicopter to arrive here. The helicopter will be meticulously assembled in the customs area. The Ka-32 helicopter, which was used by the Soviet Army during the invasion of Afghanistan, is now being offered to several governments because of its excellent maneuverability and efficiency. Imaribo S.A., headed by George Bitar and Alex Grebenchtchykov, has negotiated the sale of several of these helicopters to South American countries. To improve the operation, the enterprise is installed within the Florida Free Zone, where the helicopters will be fully assembled by seven Russian engineers who will reside in the city of Piedra Alta. Luis Calachi is in charge of the free zone. He told EL OBSERVADOR that each helicopters costs $2.5 million and that Imaribo S.A. intends to build an assembly plant in the free zone to assemble the helicopters that are sold in this region of America. The container in which these helicopters are shipped is the size of six 20-foot containers. The first arrived on 3 June and was escorted by Transport and Public Works Ministry officials. The Ka-32 marked a new stage in the development and manufacturing of helicopters in Russia. This version is used to transport cargo in its hold and its outside winch can be used in the construction, mounting, and stringing of electricity power lines. This helicopter is also useful for ocean oil rigs, salvage operations, and to transport sick people. The helicopter that arrived on 3 June has already been sold to Peru. This unit may be used in the fight against drug trafficking or against the Shining Path organization. The Uruguayan Army supplied a crane to help unload the container. This type of helicopter can be assembled in three days. Other containers are due to arrive in Florida because sales have been made to other countries in the region.
