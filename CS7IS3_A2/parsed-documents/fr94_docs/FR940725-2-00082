FR940725-2-00082 FR940725-2-00051 [Docket No. 94&hyph;18] Roland W. Jones III, M.D.; Revocation of Registration On August 25, 1993, the Deputy Assistant Administrator, (then-Director), Office of Diversion Control, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), issued an Order to Show Cause to Roland W. Jones, III, M.D. (Respondent), of Orange, Texas. The Order to Show Cause proposed to revoke Dr. Jones' DEA Certificate of Registration, AJ1690406, and deny any pending applications for renewal of such registration. The Order to Show Cause alleged that Respondent was not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas and that Respondent's continued registration would be inconsistent with the public interest, as that term is used in 21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4). The Order to Show Cause alleged that on November 9, 1990, the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) placed Respondent's license to practice medicine on ten years probation with several terms and conditions. The Board found that Respondent engaged in the intemperate use of alcohol, that he had been disciplined by a hospital, and that he failed to keep accurate records of purchases and disposals of controlled substances. The Order to Show Cause further alleged that based upon Respondent's failure to follow the terms and conditions of the November 9, 1990 probation order, effective August 20, 1992, the Board suspended Respondent's state license to practice medicine. In addition, effective June 26, 1992, the Texas Department of Public Safety canceled Respondent's state registration to handle controlled substances. As a result, Respondent is no longer authorized by state law to handle controlled substances. Respondent filed a request for a hearing on the issues raised by the Order to Show Cause, and the matter was docketed before Administrative Law Judge Mary Ellen Bittner. On January 24, 1994, the Government filed a motion for summary disposition, which was accompanied by a copy of the Texas Department of Public Safety Certification of Non-Registration. Respondent did not file a response to the Government's motion. On February 28, 1994, in her opinion and recommended decision, the administrative law judge found that the Respondent did not deny that his state license to practice medicine has been suspended or that his state registration to handle controlled substances has been canceled. The administrative law judge therefore, granted the Government's motion for summary disposition and recommended that Respondent's DEA Certificate of Registration be revoked. On March 30, 1994, The administrative law judge transmitted the record to the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator has carefully considered the entire record in this matter and, pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67, hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon findings of fact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth. The Deputy Administrator adopts the opinion and recommended decision of the administrative law judge in its entirety. The Drug Enforcement Administration cannot register or maintain the registration of a practitioner who is not duly authorized to handle controlled substances in the state in which he conducts his business. 21 U.S.C. 802(21), 823(f) and 824(a)(3). This prerequisite has been consistently upheld. See James H. Nickens, M.D., 57 FR 59847 (1992); Elliott Monroe, M.D., 57 FR 23246 (1992); Bobby Watts, M.D., 53 FR 11919 (1988). The administrative law judge properly granted the Government's motion for summary disposition. It is well-settled that when no question of fact is involved, or when the facts are agreed upon, a plenary, adversary administrative proceeding involving evidence and cross-examination of witnesses is not obligatory. The rationale is that Congress does not intend administrative agencies to perform meaningless tasks. Phillip E. Kirk, M.D., 48 FR 32887 (1983), aff'd sub nom Kirk v. Mullen, 749 F.2d 297 (6th Cir. 1984); Alfred Tennyson Smurthwaite, N.D., 43 FR 11873 (1978); see also, NLRB v. International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Ironworkers, AFL&hyph;CIO, 549 F.2d 634 (9th Cir. 1977); United States v. Consolidated Mines and Smelting Co., Ltd., 455 F.2d 432, 453 (9th Cir. 1971). Since Respondent is not currently authorized to handle controlled substances in the State of Texas, it is not necessary to reach a conclusion regarding whether his continued registration is inconsistent with the public interest. Accordingly, the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823 and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b) and 0.104 (59 FR 23637), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of Registration, AJ1690406, previously issued to Roland W. Jones, III, M.D., be, and it hereby is, revoked and that any pending applications for renewal of such registration be, and they hereby are, denied. This order is effective August 24, 1994. Dated: July 15, 1994. Stephen H. Greene, Deputy Administrator. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17947 Filed 7&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4410&hyph;09&hyph;M
