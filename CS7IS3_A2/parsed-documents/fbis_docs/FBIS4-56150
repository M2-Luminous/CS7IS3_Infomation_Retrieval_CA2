The topics approached during the talks, which both sides described as a "friendly working meeting," were mainly concerning the parliamentary relations between Romania and China, Romania's relations with the countries in its area, primarily with the Republic of Moldova, the Commonwealth of Independent States, and the Ukraine, Romania's relations with Russia, the situation in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and human rights. Speaking of the reformist process under way in China, Mr. Yue said this was concurrently taking place in both the economic and political spheres. As to the latter, he presented the progress made in consolidating democracy in his country, and made a point of saying that China would not copy other countries' experience, but build its own starting from its specific conditions. Relative to Russia's situation, Mr. Yue said his country wished this could improve, and that the Russian-Chinese relations were normal. A subject of interest for the Chinese side was Romania's position to the situation in former Yugoslavia. Ruling party Senator Sergiu Nicolaescu, chairman of the Senate's Foreign Policy Committee stressed that the evolution in Yugoslavia should be watched most carefully now that "some cherish the ambition of restoring the frontiers of pre-war Europe." Nicolae Ivanciu Valeanu, chairman of the lower house's Foreign Policy Committee, pointed out that Romania does observe the embargo ruled against former Yugoslavia, but that the Romanian Parliament adopted a statement according to which Romania would never, whatever the way, interfere in the conflict. Both sides voiced their hope that the traditional friendly relations between Romania and China would consolidate irrespective of the changes that might occur in the international situation.
