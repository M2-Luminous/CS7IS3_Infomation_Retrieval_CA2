[passage omitted] The mediators Lord Owen for the European Community and Thorvald Stoltenberg for the United Nations are attending the talks, which are aimed at reaching a ceasefire between the two sides in central Bosnia and agreeing on the shape of a future Bosnian state. [passage omitted] Germany is hosting the talks but Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has stressed it is not acting as a mediator. The Croatian press in Zagreb said Tudjman had informed Izetbegovic that he would ask "to use force against those carrying out offensives" in Bosnia if their summit in Bonn failed. Tudjman referred specifically to the new government army offensive around Vitez and Busovaca in central Bosnia, which Croat military sources say began Sunday. According to the Croatian press, Tudjman presented Izetbegovic with "a formal Croatian proposal for a global settlement" of relations between Bosnian Croats and Moslems and between Bosnia and Croatia. "If these negotiations do not yield results, Croatia will ask the United Nations, the European Union and NATO to use force against all those carrying out offensives," Tudjman is reported to have said in the presence of Kinkel, Owen and Stoltenberg.
