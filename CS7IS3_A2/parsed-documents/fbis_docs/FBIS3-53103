He demanded that the suspect be handed over to the German authorities. A German court issued a warrant for the arrest of suspect Yusuf S. [not further identified] in 1990 for participating in the attack. The spokesman added that the German court also accuses him of planning the attack. On 5 April 1986, a bomb blast at a nightclub frequented by U.S. military personnel in Berlin killed three people and wounded 230 others. The United States accused Libya of being behind the attack and retaliated by bombing Tripoli 10 days later. Lebanese judiciary sources said the man being detained in Lebanon, who is of Palestinian origin, worked in the Jamahiriyah office in East Berlin. The spokesman added that the man was arrested in Lebanon in 1992 and has been in custody since. The spokesman could not say whether he was arrested for the charges against him or for other reasons. The spokesman added: "Since then, we have been trying to get him handed over to Germany to try him." He added: "The German Embassy received his file in August 1993." The German authorities were informed of the arrest of Yusuf S. in Lebanon at the end of 1992 but the information was not revealed so as to keep the investigation secret. Another Palestinian, 'Imad Mahmud (37), has been held in Berlin since November 1992 on charges of planning and participating in the attack on the nightclub.
