[Takemura] Political circles are being urged to catch up with the new election system, and a realignment of political parties is becoming a realistic and vivid topic. In the next general election, we must not simply seek the majority power or quorum-oriented alliances. I think that in the next election we should take the first step based on our own judgment of Japan's future and the direction of its politics. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] In a recent speech, you noted that a regrouping of parties should be carried on in view of three factors: the perception of the times, political ideals, and political style. Could you explain these a little? [Takemura] Each party must have a clear political ideal or basic policy. I think that an interparty alliance should be discussed according to how distant a party is from others in such official positions. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What do you mean exactly by the perception of the times? [Takemura] Unlike the period of rightist-leftist antagonism under the cold war structure, we now can afford to choose political partners from a wide range, from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] to the Social Democratic Party of Japan. This is the time in which we have to find appropriate partners to hammer out new goals. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Could you define the political ideal? [Takemura] Basically, it is a party's stands toward the Constitution, the direction of the nation, and the implementation of democracy. Individual subjects include education, welfare, and the environment. Of course, security policy is also an important subject. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Then, what is your description of political style? [Takemura] The public is strictly observing in what manner parties collect and spend money, and in what manner they manage their own personnel and organization. So, I think a policy is not enough for a party to win the public's confidence. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you say this to clarify a gap between your party and the Shinseito-Komeito [Japan Renewal Party-Clean Government Party] team? [Takemura] I do not want to believe that the two parties have clear problems in their styles; however, some specific persons may have such problems. Probably, one of the most important points is (in what manner) the parties makes decisions (on their courses of action). [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your stand toward the "ordinary nation" proposal made by Shinseito Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa? [Takemura] Mr. Ozawa described that idea in various ways, but, generally speaking, the proposal for being an ordinary nation is being discussed in connection with Japan's military role in the world. I guess that advanced Western nations look normal to him, and he wants to make Japan play a military role equal to that of their levels. But it is impossible for Japan to achieve that objective without a revision of the Constitution. I think that the public takes a negative stand toward such an idea because the Japanese people still continue their regret over their nation's behavior during the war. The most urgent question for the international community is how human beings can jointly solve contradictions in various nonmilitary fields. As a matter of fact, coping with regional conflicts is a very important subject, but global environmental problems are even more critical. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your comment on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's proposal for a unification of the parliamentary groups of all the coalition parties? [Takemura] It is hard for me to see whether this is needed for managing the current Diet session or for a party realignment in preparation for the next general election. I cannot go for a drastic idea like that. Because each coalition party has its unique standpoint, it is too reckless to merge all of them into one parliamentary group or party all at once. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the prime minister's proposal affects your plan for a merger of Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Japan New Party [JNP]? [Takemura] I am seriously worried about that. We have been dealing with each other with much respect concerning an engagement to the JNP. I would like to have a serious talk with Mr. Hosokawa as soon as possible. This issue affects the very foundation of my party. I feel that the proposal ruins our steady steps up to now. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] There is an opinion that the next general election should be fought between the LDP and the anti-LDP group. What is your comment on that? [Takemura] I am skeptical over an election under such an artificial bipolar framework. It is theoretically possible to form a new party only for one's survival in the next election, but we would lose the public's confidence if we dissolve the party immediately after the election. Two-party politics is not a necessary condition for a single-seat constituency system. In particular, Japanese politics is undergoing a transitional period. For the time being, sound development would be ensured under the multiparty system, rather than under the two-party system.
