Late last year, the French company named Hyundai Precision & Industry Co. as the consortium's prime contractor in order to transfer its technology only through Hyundai, but the agreement was a reversal of this decision. Under the agreement, GEC Alsthom will transfer its technology related to the manufacture of TGV locomotives and coaches equally to consortium members, the officials said. Daewoo and GEC Alsthom will negotiate details of the technology transfer and consortium forming in the near future, they added. Because of the agreement between Daewoo and GEC Alsthom, the forming of a consortium for the production of high-speed trainsets will be expedited, along with the negotiations between the government and the French firm for the final contract. Officials of Hyundai Precision & Industry Co. refused to make any official comments on the Daewoo-GEC Alsthom agreement but unofficially welcomed it, saying it would expedite the forming of the consortium.
