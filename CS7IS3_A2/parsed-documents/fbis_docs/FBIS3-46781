According to Russia's Foreign Ministry report on tripartite trade obtained by a Moscow-based trade authority of the Korea Trade Promotion Corporation [Kotra] on 3 January, Russia is seeking to form a tripartite trading system coordinating Russia's resources, the ROK's capital, and North Korea's labor. The source says that Russia is studying the possibility of tripartite cooperation in 17 projects, including the development of Russia's iron mines and energy resources and the reconstruction of a railway traversing the Korean peninsula vertically. Particularly, Russia assesses that it will take the helm in tripartite cooperation. In other words, Russia believes that it can play the role of mediator for dialogue if North Korea rejects cooperation with the ROK. The reconstruction and joint operation of a railway traversing the Korean peninsula vertically is one of the tripartite cooperation projects Russia is now considering. In this project, the ROK is supposed to provide financial assistance and Russia is to provide locomotives and transportation machinery. The tripartite cooperation projects also include a plan to develop the Tuman River basin as a center of traffic, where sea routes linking Russia's Far East ports and ROK ports with the trans-Siberian railway converge. This plan will be promoted in connection with the Tuman River development plan. Furthermore, while reviewing a plan to offer markets to North Korea in order to enhance the operation rate of its light industry, Russia is planning to offer the ROK raw and subsidiary materials. Russia hopes to modernize plants and to build new production lines with ROK finances, facilities and technology while it supervises facilities and provides concrete designs for North Korea's nonferrous metals, shipbuilding, train and transportation equipment, ship repairing, construction materials, and light industries. At the same time, Russia is also looking for ways to coordinate North Korean labor and ROK capital and equipment in its development of agriculture, forestry, fishery, coal industry, energy resources, and iron mines. Russia desires the participation of ROK construction companies in the construction of energy, petrochemical, and electric appliance production bases in its Far East and Siberia. It may compensate North Korea in cash or barter trade. Regarding this, Kotra said, "It is difficult to put the tripartite cooperation into practice now, but an environment for this is maturing." He then added, "The ROK needs to prepare for this, and establishing a special body, such as an ROK-Russia-North Korea intergovernmental advisory committee for promoting cooperation projects, may be worthwhile.
