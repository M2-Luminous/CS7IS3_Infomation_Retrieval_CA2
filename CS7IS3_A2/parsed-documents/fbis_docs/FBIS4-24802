The Conscription Law now in force was reformulated and promulgated in light of China's new situation of reform, opening up, and economic construction. Practice has proved that this military service law prominently characterized by a military service system which takes compulsory service as the main component while integrating compulsory and voluntary service and militia and reserve service, corresponds with China's national and military conditions. It bears outstanding Chinese characteristics and is thus warmly supported by the people of all nationalities in the country and the commanders and soldiers of the entire armed forces. In the last 10 years, all localities have conscientiously implemented the Conscription Law; have made efforts for the fulfillment of enlistments in military service, militia, and reserve forces; have done well in providing special care for disabled soldiers and their families; and have effectively supported national defense construction as well as the building up of the armed forces. In particular, with regard to work concerning military service, all localities have strengthened their leadership, enthusiastically conducted propagation and education on the Conscription Law, actively formulated and improved local conscription regulations, and paid close attention to improving the personnel contingent involved in conscription work, thus reliably ensuring the quality of new recruits. The saying "when a family member joins the armed forces the whole family is honored" prevails in society. Officers and men of the Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force, in accordance with the provisions of the Conscription Law, have performed their duties in a trustworthy manner and trained hard for better military skills, thus making prominent contributions to defending the country as well as to safeguarding and supporting socialist modernization. The militia and reserve forces have taken an active part in military training, performed tactical duties, and played an important role in maintaining social stability and carrying out the two civilizations. These remarkable jobs have effectively promoted national defense construction and the armed forces buildup. In the new situation of deepening reform and establishing the socialist market economy structure, better implementation of the Conscription Law has important, practical bearings on strengthening the people's national defense awareness, on improving their consciousness in joining the armed forces according to the law, and on carrying forward the spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism. How should we properly implement the Conscription Law? We should first rely on the legal system and secondly on education. At present, we should change our concepts and work style and transform the habit of working mainly by administrative means under the planned economy structure into the habit of working mainly by legal means under the socialist market economy structure. This is to ensure national defense construction and the building up of the armed forces. The Conscription Law is a basic law in China's military system and serves as an important legal basis for national defense construction and the building up of the armed forces. In the course of establishing a socialist market economic structure, all localities and armed forces units should continue to propagate and implement the Conscription Law so that we can abide by this law in national defense construction and building up the armed forces and embark on the track of the legal system. Strengthening national defense education and improving the people's national defense mentality are the ideological basis for implementing the Conscription Law properly. In recent years, localities have introduced various methods in strengthening national defense education and improving the people's national defense mentality. This has played an important role in promoting the implementation of the Conscription Law. However, we should also understand that because efforts are being concentrated on socialist modernization, and because of the prolonged period of peace, particularly in this new situation when the socialist market economic structure is being established, some people's national defense mentality has weakened to such an extent that they cannot correctly handle the relationship between economic construction and national defense construction or the relationship between individual interests, collective interests, and state interests. Therefore, we should, in light of specific conditions and with the purposes in mind, conduct education on national defense, on joining the armed forces, and on patriotism among cadres, masses, officers, soldiers, militiamen, and personnel of the reserve forces. This education will enable everyone to understand the basic provisions of the Conscription Law; understand that strengthening the building up of the armed forces and improving national defense are important aspects of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; understand that economic construction is the basis of national defense construction, whereas national defense construction serves as a guarantee for economic construction and that the two are complementary to each other; and understand that without the country, there would not be a home and that individual and collective interests should be subordinated to the state's interests. Everyone should know that national defense mentality is an important manifestation of patriotism. In propagating patriotism and a spirit of selfless devotion, the people should strengthen their national defense mentality and consciously and actively fulfill their military service obligations. In short, if a good job is done in national defense education and improving the people's national defense mentality, a fine atmosphere will be created in which the entire society will care for and support national defense construction and building up the armed forces and all officers and soldiers will devote themselves to national defense construction. Let us hold high the banner of patriotism; further study, propagate, and implement the Conscription Law; and make greater contributions to strengthening national defense construction and the building up of the armed forces.
