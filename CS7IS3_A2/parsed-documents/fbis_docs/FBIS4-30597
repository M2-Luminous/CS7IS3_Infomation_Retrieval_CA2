The package, which contains 279 deregulatory steps prepared by the government's administrative reform promotion headquarters, is the "product of an all-out effort" for economic restructuring by the cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, a government official said. The package, a detailed version of portions of a market-opening program released in March, is designed to demonstrate Japan's seriousness about deregulation, the official said. The official said whoever replaces outgoing Premier Hata, who announced Saturday he would resign, will work to enforce the measures. "There should not be any setback in implementation of the package under the pretext of the current political confusion." The official said the latest package addresses government restrictions and regulations in four priority sectors -- housing and land, financial services, information and telecommunications and market access by foreign firms. The steps are aimed at promoting new businesses, giving consumers greater product selection and narrowing the price gap on goods in Japan and abroad, the official said. Japan pledged to come up with deregulatory measures before the Naples summit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in July. The administrative reform promotion headquarters will craft a five-year program designed to implement the proposals by the end of fiscal 1994, the official said. Meanwhile, government ministries and agencies will be asked to formulate specific measures in line with new deregulation guidelines drawn up by the panel. The guidelines include a drastic review of restrictions enforced as a way to adjust supply-demand ties for certain products, a reduction in rate-setting rules for public services, harmonization of Japan's standards and certificates with international rules and the halting of business practices that effectively hamper foreign entry to Japan's markets. The guidelines also call for clearer, simplified procedures for administrative permits, including import inspection systems. The panel urged strict enforcement of the antimonopoly law to ensure fair and free competition and called for a proposal by the end of fiscal 1994 to outlaw in five years some cartels currently allowed as exceptions under the law. The panel also unveiled a plan to abolish by the end of fiscal 1998 the resale price maintenance system, a protective measure allowed for designated product items. Other measures designed to spur competition include review of screening procedures for corporate mergers and stock ownership and a change in rules banning establishment of a holding company. The official said a set of measures announced on housing and land policies are intended to provide the Japanese people with high-quality houses at affordable prices. To that end, rules and regulations in construction and materials procurement will be relaxed, including acceptance of foreign data on materials and simplification of building permits. The panel said the scope of housing construction subject to public loans will be expanded, while the legal framework for land development projects will be modified. It said inspection standards will be eased for companies trying to enter the information and telecommunications industry. Charges on services provided by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT) and other common carriers will be set more freely, with government approval needed only for basic services charges. On market access measures, the panel called for smooth enforcement of steps announced in may to ease the large-scale retail store law. But it refrained from seeking abolition of the law, apparently considering its impact on small retailers. The reform panel said the government will study whether to allow self-service gas stations by looking into technical standards and other safety measures that would be required for such stations. Other market-access steps include abolition of a law at the end of fiscal 1996 that limits imports of gasoline and other petroleum products to oil refiners. On the financial sector, steps will be taken to liberalize rate-setting formulas for liquid deposits and housing loans and promote financial derivatives transactions. A set of steps to deregulate the securities market were also included as a way to diversify corporate fund raising. The panel said the latest package should be carried out under supervision of an administrative reform committee, a third-party organ likely to be created in line with a bill now in parliament. A follow-up report on the latest package will be worked out by the end of this fiscal year, the official said. The package will be formalized by the government but the timing of the formalization is yet undetermined considering Japan's political upheaval.
