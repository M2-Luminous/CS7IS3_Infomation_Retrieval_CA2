FBIS4-63144 "drsov098_r_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-098 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Azerbaijan Attempt To Debate Bishkek Protocol Defeated Attempt To Debate Bishkek Protocol Defeated NC1805193994 Baku AZERTAC in English 1527 GMT 18 May 94 NC1805193994 Baku AZERTAC English BFN [Text] Baku, 18 May (AZERTAC)--The item of the Bishkek Protocol was not included in the agenda of the today's session of the Azerbaijani Parliament. A group of MP's, who consider the document conflicting with the interests of the republic, proposed to discuss this item. According to them, signing the Bishkek Protocol, the Parliament's speaker Rasul Guliyev has exceeded his commission. The MP's also consider the fact that the Azerbaijani Parliament's speakers signature is affixed near the signature of the representative of the Armenian community of Nagorno-Karabakh "a de facto recognition of the so- called Nagorno-Karabakh Republic." Concerning this item, the Parliament's speaker said that there was "too much attention" devoted to the Bishkek Protocol and that, firing the passions against the document, some forces in Azerbaijan were trying to use it "as a means of political struggle". According to Rasul Guliyev, this document is just "a protocol of intentions which is without legal effect. It has only the recommendation character" and no consent of the Parliament was required for the signing of the document which is not a subject to ratification. [Baku AZERTAC in English at 1632 GMT on 18 May, in a Baku-datelined item, adds the following: ["Thirteen MP's attempt to place the item of the Bishkek Protocol signed by the Parliament speaker Rasul Guliyev on the agenda resulted in an unexpected break announced by the speaker today. (The Bishkek Protocol has been rejected in the Parliament earlier.) On failing to achieve their goal, they blamed Rasul Guliyev's deed in their statement and left the Parliament hall. They are convinced that the Parliament speaker exceeded his commission by signing the protocol."]
