Laar told Interfax that he and van der Stoel discussed the application of the Foreigner Act in the country. Lack of progress in this field had come under criticism both in Estonia and abroad. In particular, the European Union had recently expressed its disappointment over delays with issuance of residence and work permits to foreigners. Laar said that van der Stoel had expressed satisfaction over steps taken recently by government and parliament. In particular, the foreigners who had been registered as residents of the country before July 1, 1990, had been allowed to apply for a permanent permit simultaneously with an application for a temporary permit. Steps are taken to help the foreigners study the state language and obtain exit documents, Laar said.
