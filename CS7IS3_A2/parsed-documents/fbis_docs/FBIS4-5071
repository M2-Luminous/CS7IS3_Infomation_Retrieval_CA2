FBIS4-5071 "dreas067_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-067 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 North Korea Radio Denounces U.S. Press Reporting on DPRK Radio Denounces U.S. Press Reporting on DPRK SK0704035794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 5 Apr 94 SK0704035794 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 2200 GMT 5 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Text] According to reports, U.S. papers have recently came out publicly with bellicose assertions opposing our country. According to reports by the Voice of America on 4 April, THE NEW YORK TIMES ran amok in an editorial that the United States should at once bomb North Korea's nuclear facilities. U.S. TODAY has said this and that on the inevitability of unleashing a war on the Korean peninsula. A U.S. defense magazine, AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, on 5 April reported that the United States has worked out a plan to deploy ultramodern ground equipment to South Korea so as to directly analyze information sent by a spy satellite. In an interview with National Broadcasting Company [NBC] Television Network on 3 April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who has carelessly set out war outbursts [pokon] and disguisedly revealed a warmonger's true color, again brought up North Korea's fictitious nuclear development. He said that even at the cost of triggering a war on the Korean peninsula, the United States will suspend the development of nuclear arms. Raving that the United States will not rely on diplomatic means but take the road of pressuring North Korea, including imposing sanctions, he let loose outbursts that the United States will not exclude the possibility of a preemptive military strike on North Korea. Timed to coincide with the U.S. military heads' war outbursts, the U.S. papers' bellicose assertions opposing us, which are being revealed more nakedly, provoke just vigilance.
