This continuous climb in prices jeopardizes the central government's campaign to reduce inflation in the country's 35 major cities to 19 percent this coming December from 23.2 percent in April. The government's hopes for cooling inflation were fanned by a recent survey by the bureau's urban statistics team which found that prices were plummeting for machines, electronics and household electrical appliances. But the prices of grain, edible oil and meat are still climbing. This poses a serious problem for the government, which must improve its control over prices if it is to achieve its economic target this year. The survey found no signs that the upward trend in prices will reverse itself in the months ahead. According to the bureau, grain prices rose in April by 3.8 percent from March, and by 36.7 percent from April a year ago. On free markets, a kilogram of rice now fetches between 1.70 yuan (20 U.S. cents) and 2.20 yuan (25 cents), up 4.4 percent from the beginning of this year. Prices are lower in State grain shops because of the government's stern pricing guidelines that are intended to stabilize the grain supply. But managers of these shops complain of unprecedented losses. Because of a severe shortage, the prices of edible oil increased 55.8 percent in April from a year earlier. Some local governments, worried that edible-oil prices may run beyond what residents can afford, are subsidizing grain shops and restricting consumer purchases by once again issuing coupons. The average price of oil made from soya bean, rape seed and peanuts is now between 7 yuan (80 cents) and 9 yuan ($1) a kilogram, 0.6 yuan (7 cents) higher than at the start of this year. The swelling costs of animal feed are also making various meat products more expensive, the bureau said. Meat prices have climbed an average 33.4 percent from last year, the bureau said. The setback in cotton production, meanwhile, is presenting a tough challenge to the government's efforts to control cloth and garment prices. The bureau's figures show that prices for cotton cloth have persistently increased this year. In April, the year-on-year increase was 25.4 percent. Analysts explain that side-effects of the pricing reform and the rocketing cost of production materials have combined to form the Achilles heel of the economy. The government's lifting of price controls on grain and other consumer products last year created imponderable effects on the economy that are now being felt. Analysts do not expect the inflationary pressures to abate because of the persistent adverse factors that took shape in 1993.
