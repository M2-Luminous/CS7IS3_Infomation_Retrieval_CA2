FR940429-0-00128 FR940429-0-00013 Several commenters said that the regulations should not define the term campus security authority at all, thereby ensuring maximum institutional flexibility with respect to the reporting of crimes and the allocation of counseling responsibilities. The commenters suggested this course of action, stating that because of the variety of campus administrative structures (size, complexity, structure, and staffing patterns), an all-inclusive definition would be difficult to achieve. Other commenters said that the regulations should define the term but include only specific campus officials, such as the chief law enforcement official on campus or the dean of students, or specific offices, such as the campus security office. Many commenters specifically objected to including campus officials such as deans and residence directors within the definition of campus security authority. These commenters advanced several arguments: Some commenters said that students should be able to seek confidential counseling from such administrators before deciding whether to report a campus crime and that by requiring these administrators to report possible crimes brought to their attention by students, would undermine the usefulness of the administrators as student advisors and advocates; other commenters noted that deans and residence directors are not trained in criminal law and that requiring them to report possible crimes would probably lead to double-counting of crimes, once by the dean or other campus official and once by the campus police. Several commenters noted that under the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI's) Uniform Crime Reporting System, determining the number of crime counts is based on law enforcement investigation and does not include determinations by persons, such as those that might be made by deans and residence directors, who are not law enforcement personnel. Other commenters said it is unethical to require deans and residence directors to report crimes, that doing so is inconsistent with the intent of Congress, and that the proposed definition does not clearly exclude campus religious authorities, such as chaplains. Many commenters asked for clarification as to how the definition of a campus security authority relates to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Discussion: Section 485(f)(1)(F) of the HEA requires institutions to disclose statistics of certain campus criminal offenses reported to campus security authorities and local police agencies. As noted in the preamble to the first NPRM, the proposed definition of campus security authority, which the statute does not define, represented an attempt to strike an appropriate balance between the need of individual crime victims for confidential counseling and the need of the broader campus community for prevention and a complete reporting of campus crime. The Secretary continues to believe that to achieve this balance, and to ensure consistent reporting of crime statistics, it is necessary to define the term campus security authority and to include within the definition a wider range of campus administrators than those exclusively devoted to criminal or security matters. Therefore, the definition of a campus security authority includes a campus law enforcement unit, an individual or organization specified in an institution's statement of campus security policy as the individual or organization to whom students and employees should report criminal offenses, and an official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, but does not have significant counseling responsibilities. The Secretary does not agree that including a broader range of administrators is unethical or unauthorized by the statute; neither is it inappropriate by virtue of their lack of specific training in criminal law, nor is it likely to lead to double-counting. The function of these administrators is not to determine authoritatively whether a crime took place_that is the function of law enforcement professionals working within the criminal justice system_but, with respect to these regulations to report to the appropriate law enforcement personnel, either campus or local police, those allegations of campus crimes that the administrators conclude are made in good faith. These administrators would, of course, be free to seek advice from legal experts before reporting any allegations. In addition, there is no penalty for reporting allegations of campus crime to the appropriate law enforcement personnel if those allegations turn out to be baseless. If the law enforcement personnel, upon further investigation, conclude that the allegations reported are not substantiated by the facts or the law, no campus crime need be disclosed as a statistic. Because of the wide variety of institutions participating in the Title IV, HEA programs, the Secretary acknowledges that it is not appropriate to identify particular administrators, such as deans and residence directors, by their titles as being either included or excluded from the definition of campus security authority. Instead, the identifications must be made in terms of the functions of particular administrators. Institutions are expected to determine which officials have significant responsibility for student and campus activities and do not have significant counseling responsibilities for the purpose of this definition and to make this information known to the campus community. The Secretary notes that it was never the intent of the proposed rule to include chaplains within the meaning of the term campus security authority. Records created and maintained by a campus law enforcement unit, for the purpose of law enforcement, are not education records and are not protected from disclosure by FERPA. The definition of campus security authority also includes (1) an individual or organization specified in an institution's statement of campus security policy as the individual or organization to whom students and employees should report criminal offenses; and (2) an official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, but does not have significant counseling responsibilities.
