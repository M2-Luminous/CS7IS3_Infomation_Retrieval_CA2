Toyoda, 68, will succeed Chairman Gaishi Hiraiwa after the federation's general meeting scheduled for late May, the officials said. Toyoda's selection was endorsed at a meeting between Hiraiwa and the organization's vice chairmen, they said. Toyoda, who is currently one of the federation's vice chairmen, told reporters after the meeting he will seek the cooperation of other officials in managing the federation. Hiraiwa, 79, said Toyoda's appointment as his successor will rejuvenate the federation's leadership. Toyoda said after the meeting he would emphasize economic recovery and try to contribute to a healthy growth in the Japanese economy. Masaru Hayami, head of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), welcomed the selection of Toyoda as Keidanren's next chairman, citing automobile trade as the core of economic relations between Japan and the United States. He expressed the hope that Toyoda will demonstrate the leadership, independent of the automobile industry, to cope with the difficult problems facing the Japanese economy. Yoshinari Yamashiro, chairman of major steelmaker NKK Corp., said the federation will be able to tackle Japan-U.S. trade problems seriously under the new leadership. Toyoda emerged as the strongest contender for the post after Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp. and one of the federation's vice chairmen, became ill last November. Four vice chairmen of the federation, including Toyoda, are scheduled to quit their posts after serving two consecutive four- year terms and three successors have already been informally selected, Keidanren officials said. The three new officers will be Sho Nasu, chairman of Tokyo Electric Power Co., Kenichi Suematsu, president of Sakura Bank, and Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of Fuji Xerox Co. They will replace Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu Ltd., Yotaro Iida, chairman of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., and Hiroshi Saito, chairman of Nippon Steel Corp.
