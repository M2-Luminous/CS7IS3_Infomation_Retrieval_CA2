These arguments do not convince the Central European countries that are on the first row for membership. Today Andrzej Krzeczunowicz, Polish Ambassador to Belgium, has the floor and tomorrow it will be the turn of the deputy chief of the Hungarian mission to NATO, Andras Simonyi. [Doornaert] One of the arguments, among others of the Belgian diplomacy, is that the major problem of the Central and East European countries is one of social instability, not of foreign security. And that NATO membership will not remedy this. [Krzeczunowicz] But it is exactly the opposite. Poland is internally stable, we have a democratic system that works. The economic shock therapy is yielding results. It is true that it is hitting hard many people by marginalizing them. Nevertheless, the macroeconomic results are good. Last year, we registered a 4.5 percent growth, the European record, with a rise of 7 percent in our industrial production. Therefore, we feel at ease. One of our large neighbors speaks of its "bordering foreign countries," its sphere of influence. This is distrurbing. To the east, there are countries where foreign troops are still stationed, minority problems that might represent a threat. The instability does not emerge from us but from the neighbors. The recent events in Moscow do not make us feel very optimistic. The Parliament was shelled by tanks, and afterwards a totally irresponsible individual shows up who acquires one-fourth of the votes. [Doornaert] That is why NATO is saying that we should avoid doing anything which could support Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. [Krzeczunowicz] Look, anyone could use Zhirinovskiy for his own purposes. One can say as well that Mr. Zhirinovskiy is the product of the West's timidity. I cannot prove that, but you cannot prove either that a moderate attitude will moderate Russia's attitude, too. Appeasement is not a wise policy, as became obvious previously. [Doornaert] Do you mean that the best way to avoid security problems in Central and East Europe is to create a reliable deterrence policy by means of security commitments? [Krzeczunowicz] Exactly. The opposite attitude would be to say: Dear Russian friends, here is your area of influence. And NATO should say: This is our area of influence, meaning an area of peace and stability. Indeed, keep in mind that NATO won the Cold War. It cannot be lost now, that would be stupid. We feel that it is important that at the summit NATO will undertake to include the Central European countries meeting the standing criteria, i.e., stable democracy, pluralism, settling of border and minority questions. Poland realizes fully that it cannot become a NATO member tomorrow, that this requires numerous changes of our defense mechanism. However, it is important that a clear commitment is made so that the Partnership for Peace does not become an objective in itself, but the way to full membership. Otherwise, it cannot respond to real problems and the security vacuum will not be filled up. European Union [Doornaert] Belgian diplomats suggest that the Visegrad countries follow a logical order by becoming European Union [EU] members first, then of the Western European Union [WEU], and then of NATO. [Krzeczunowicz] Of course we want to become a member of the EU and of the WEU, we already are an associate member. Also we do not define security in a purely military sense. The fact that the EU sets up protectionist barriers against us is equally at our disadvantage. But before becoming a full member we will have to wait at least 10 years and our security cannot wait that long, that is the problem. [Doornaert] It has also been said that the expansion of NATO toward the Visegrad countries would draw new artificial lines in Europe, which would be a destabilizing factor. [Krzeczunowicz] But there have always been barriers, nowadays they exist too. There is NATO and the EU and the other countries. It is impossible to cancel all barriers at once in such a diversified continent, but one has to place them so that they have a rational function, namely to serve peace and stability. Leaving the barriers as they are nowadays is not rational at all. [Doornaert] How is it possible to enlarge NATO while avoiding giving Russia a feeling of isolation? [Krzeczunowicz] No one wants to isolate Russia, and certainly not Poland. Let us admit that it is particularly difficult to isolate a country which stretches over 11 time zones. Poland or the much smaller Lithuania will definitely not isolate giant Russia. Secondly, from a historical point of view, Russia has rather been inclined to isolate itself. It is up to Russia to open up to the world and the democratic process. We will be the first ones to welcome that. Poland assumes that there cannot be any lasting peace and stability in Europe without a Russian participation. No one wants to cut Russia from Europe and erect a new [Berlin] wall somewhere. We did not build walls, nor did the West. [Doornaert] Does NATO's attitude -- which gives priority to possible reactions in Moscow to the desire of the Visegrad countries for membership -- give the impression that your are being held in a kind of restricted sovereignty? [Krzeczunowicz] Well, if you recognize that a country has a veto right on the choice of an alliance that Poland should conclude, than Poland's sovereignty is restricted. If you do not recognize that right of veto, then we are a sovereign country. The decision does not rest with us, NATO must make it clear that there is no right of veto.
