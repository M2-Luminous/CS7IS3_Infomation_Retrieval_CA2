FR941013-2-00065 FR941013-2-00053 4. From the date of appointment, the trustee shall have twelve (12) months to divest both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, to provide all additional assistance reasonably necessary to the acquirer, and to submit affidavits to the Commission from each of the original equipment manufacturers certifying that each has individually approved the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or the Metco 601 Equivalent manufactured by the Commisssion-approved acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information for all uses for which Amdry 2010 or Metco 601 is approved by such original equipment manufacturer, and if such affidavits are not submitted, the trustee shall have an additional six (6) months thereafter to accomplish the divestiture of both the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, to provide the additional assistance, and to submit the affidavits. If, however, at the end of the additional six (6) month period, the trustee believes that the original equipment manufacturers will approve the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or the Metco 601 Equivalent manufactured by the Commission-approved acquirer of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information for all uses for which Amdry 2010 or Metco 601 is approved by such original equipment manufacturer, and will submit said affidavits to the Commission within a reasonable time, the time period for approvals and submission of affidavits may be extended by the Commission, or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court; provided, however, the Commission may extend this period only two (2) times. 5. The trustee shall have full and complete access to the personnel, books, records and facilities related to the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, or to any other relevant information, as the trustee may request. Respondent shall develop such financial or other information as such trustee may request and shall cooperate with the trustee. Respondent shall take no action to interfere with or impede the trustee's accomplishment of the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, the provision of additional assistance to the acquirer, and the approval of the Amdry 2010 Equivalent or the Metco 601 Equivalent by the original equipment manufacturers. Any delays caused by the respondent shall extend the time for the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, the additional assistance to the acquirer, and the approvals by the original equipment manufacturers, under this Paragraph in an amount equal to the delay, as determined by the Commission, or, for a court-appointed trustee, by the court. 6. The trustee shall use his or her best efforts to negotiate the most favorable price and terms available in each contract that is submitted to the Commission, subject to respondent's absolute and unconditional obligation to divest at no minimum price. If the trustee receives bona fide offers from more than one acquiring entity, and if the Commission determines to approve more than one such acquiring entity, the trustee shall divest to the acquiring entity or such entities selected by respondent from among those approved by the Commission. 7. The trustee shall serve, without bond or other security, at the cost and expense of respondent, on such reasonable and customary terms and conditions as the Commission or a court may set. The trustee shall have the authority to employ, at the cost and expense of respondent, such consultants, accountants, attorneys, investment bankers, business brokers, appraisers, and other representatives and assistants as are necessary to carry out the trustee's duties and responsibilities. The trustee shall account for all monies derived from the divestiture and all expenses incurred. After approval by the Commission and, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, by the court, of the account of the trustee, including fees for his or her services, all remaining monies shall be paid at the direction of Sulzer and the trustee's power shall be terminated. The trustee's compensation shall be based at least in significant part on a commission arrangement contingent on the trustee's divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information and submission of the required affidavits from the original equipment manufacturers. 8. Respondent shall indemnify the trustee and hold the trustee harmless against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities arising out of, or in connection with, the performance of the trustee's duties, including all reasonable fees of counsel and other expenses incurred in connection with the preparation for, or defense of any claim, whether or not resulting in any liability, except to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, or expenses result from misfeasance, gross negligence, willful or wanton acts, or bad faith by the trustee. 9. If the trustee ceases to act or fails to act diligently, a substitute trustee shall be appointed in the same manner as provided in this Paragraph of this Order. 10. The Commission or, in the case of a court-appointed trustee, the court, may on its own initiative or at the request of the trustee issue such additional orders or directions as may be necessary or appropriate to accomplish the divestiture of the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information, the provision of all additional assistance reasonably necessary to the acquirer, and the submission of affidavits by each of the original equipment manufacturers as required by this Order. 11. The trustee shall have no obligation or authority to operate or maintain the Amdry 2010 Information and the Metco 601 Information. 12. The trustee shall report in writing to respondent and to the Commission every sixty (60) days concerning the trustee's efforts to accomplish the divestiture.
