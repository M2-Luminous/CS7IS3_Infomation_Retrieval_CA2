Economic recovery will begin to show only this summer and will be slightly below the government's expectations because recession was deeper than previously estimated and eased only starting at the very end of 1993, according to Spaventa's report. While exports will continue to do well this year and grow another 7 percent, imports will increase 3.5 percent, bringing the trade surplus to about 64 trillion lire (39 billion dollars) and the current accounts in the black by 32 trillion lire (19.5 billion dollars). The weakness of the lira, according to government officials, was not the only reason the trade surplus boomed last year. Competitiveness of Italian products was enhanced considerably by the labor cost agreement reached last July, the officials claimed. Job losses however will continue at least until June but after the summer employment will pick up again and should rise to 0.6 percent from minus 2.8 percent in 1993. Industrial production will rise 1.6 percent and services should also increase production by 1.3 percent, Spaventa said. As for inflation, it should drop mostly thanks to slack price increases from abroad and the government's price containment policies, while gross labor costs should rise only 3 percent this year and interest rates will continue to come down, the report stated. The deficit will be a tougher opponent to beat, Spaventa warned, saying that the 1993 recession and the delay in domestic recovery will delay further debt and deficit reductions. The three finance ministers at the cabinet meeting also presented the 1993 economic report, confirming that GDP dropped 0.7 percent (compared to -3.7 percent in 1992) and that unemployment reached an annual average rate of 10.4 percent because of 655,000 job losses, while inflation averaged 4.5 percent against 5.2 percent in 1992. Comparing 1992 to 1993, Spaventa said the balance of payments went from a deficit of 12.68 trillion lire to 32.51 trillion lire in the black, while the balance of payments went from 34.37 trillion lire in the red to a surplus of 16.72 trillion lire. The deficit also fell from 158.8 trillion to 153.51 trillion lire. Domestic demand fell 5 percent last year (compared to a 0.8 percent increase in 1992) also because household incomes dropped 2.1 percent and gross fixed investments plunged 11.1 percent in 1993. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi after the meeting issued a communique warning Italy's economic press that false or inaccurate reporting of government economic forecasts and figures in the past have caused "grave political polemics," referring to allegations from Forza Italia during the election campaign that Spaventa had "falsified" his forecasts. "Any polemics, even the harshest, should be based on sure and incontrovertible data, supplied (officially and not surreptitiously) by authorized public bodies," Ciampi said, also referring to figures from Spaventa's report leaked to the press last night. "Conditions exist for a sustained and lasting economic recovery," Ciampi said, adding that the turning point "probably came between 1993 and 1994." Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Ciampi said he had some regrets because he "could have done more," but he stressed that the country's economic conditions were showing "clear signs of recovery." The solution to recession "is old but still valid," he went on, adding that success "is assured if there are correct and healthy budget policies, a strict wage policy and monetary policies aimed at stability." The government's greatest regret concerns persistently high unemployment but this was offset by falling inflation, an improved trade balance, the July labor cost agreement and a reduction in debt servicing, Ciampi said. Unfortunately, he went on, there is no miracle cure for unemployment. "Jobs are protected by creating serious and competitive industries," which have been forced to reduce their labor force through restructuring, the premier said. He praised the trade unions for helping reduce wage hikes. As for the poorer south, Ciampi said the region's economic backwardness "is closely connected to social problems" caused by organized crime. On foreign trade, one of the bright points since the de facto devaluation of the lira in September, Ciampi underscored the importance of exploiting last summer's inflation-pegging cost-of-labour accord if the export boom is to be maintained. "Results of extraordinary importance have been achieved in the balance of trade," he said, "enabling us to move in the space of a year from a current account deficit of 34 trillion lire to a surplus close to 34 trillion, or over 3 percent of GDP." He said this put the economy in a position to face 1994 "in a totally different viewpoint" as regards competitiveness and quality. On public finances, he pointed to another "considerable" result: curbing the PSBR/GDP [Public Service Borrowing Requirement/Gross Domestic Product] ratio to below 10 percent "for the first time in many years" -- although he recognised that some of the credit was due to falling interest rates that slashed debt servicing costs. On his government's budgets and use of the tax lever, Ciampi expressed "no regrets" in easing the fiscal pressure inherited from the Amato government and shifting corrective priorities to spending cuts. "My government enacted budgets to the tune of 40 trillion lire, but we couldn't squeeze the fiscal screw any tighter," Ciampi said, "because it would have stifled the recovery; that's why we turned to the spending side, with important results." A bigger budget squeeze "would only have had a nominal effect because revenue would have been lower, meaning lower tax returns and higher social protection spending." Ciampi again pointed to the objective of lowering fiscal pressure by 1.2 percent this year, and praised finance minister Franco Gallo for simplifying tax procedures. "Just look at the new personal income tax form," he said. Another goal he said had been achieved was a fall in the cost of labour, also in Italy's traditionally sheltered civil service. In noting the fall in Italy's debt interest payments, Ciampi voiced the hope that this would continue: "provided that we preserve the confidence and credibility we have won over the last year and a half."
