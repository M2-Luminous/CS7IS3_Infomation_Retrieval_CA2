However, we understand that they are extraordinary measures which will last for a short period of time until the new law on organizing the media has been implemented as part of the national reconciliation document. [Kustantin] Don't you fear that this [words indistinct] will take a long time? [Sa'adah] That is what we fear and is why we have many questions. If the intent is to sacrifice liberties for a short period of time for the sake of providing people's safety and for stability in Lebanon, then this is acceptable. But if the intent is to gag people, especially opposition radios, so the rulers will get some relief, this is something else. Therefore, we will contact senior officials to speed up measures to pass the new media law and end measures to prevent radio stations and other media from carrying out their duties. [Kustantin] Concerning stopping the private media from broadcasting news, does this decision have any legal or political justifications? Are you convinced about the justifications? [Sa'adah] If the justifications are for a short period of time, it is possible to control news related to the movements of the army and security forces and the investigation. Although the Voice of Lebanon, which belongs to the Phalagist Party, was licensed as a news station long ago, we submit to the Council of Ministers' decision if such a decision leads to providing relief for the Lebanese public. But this public will not rest if liberties disappear. This is what we will watch in the coming days. We will not remain silent about any repression of liberties. [Kustantin] Concerning the Christian issue, reports say that the Phalangist Party was relieved by the decision to dissolve the Lebanese Forces Party, as it gives it a free hand to become the sole representative of the Christians. Certain papers also write about the possibility of your acting within the law to regain property over which you are in dispute with the Lebanese Forces. How true are these reports? [Sa'adah] Concerning legal actions, some law suits were lodged long ago. Other suits have been prepared despite the new developments. As for us being relieved by these measures and now having a free hand, we have always called for party multiplicity and for a political, principled, and ideological competition. We are not relieved merely because the Lebanese Forces Party has been dissolved. We are relieved because the series of explosions have been halted. If the state and the security organs had not taken the measures they took, the series of explosions would have expanded, spreading the terror we have seen recently.
