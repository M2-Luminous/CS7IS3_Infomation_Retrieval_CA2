FR941206-2-00104 FR941206-2-00073 (6)&hyph;(9) No Change II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change In its filing with the Commission, the NASD included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the amendment to the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The NASD has prepared summaries, set forth in Sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change On March 28, 1994, the NASD proposed rules governing the operation and procedures for a new service for the delivery, handling and execution of individual investors' small-sized agency orders. 3 The NPROVE service, operated by Nasdaq, will provide automated executions of individual investors' small agency orders in Nasdaq equity securities, and will offer small retail investors new opportunities for price improvement of market orders. The new service will also heighten protections for individual investors' limit orders while enhancing the ability of market makers to monitor and maintain competitive quotations accessible to investors participating in an automated execution environment. 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34145 (June 1, 1994), 59 FR 29649 (June 8, 1994). The purpose of this proposal is to modify NPROVE to further enhance the operational efficiency of the system and enhance the limit order protection and price improvement benefits of NPROVE to retail investors. As described in more detail below, the NASD proposes to enhance the operational efficiency of NPROVE by collapsing the current proposal for three rounds of NPROVE order processing for unpreferenced orders into one 15-second round. With this streamlined order execution procedure, NPROVE will be less susceptible to the development of order queues during peak volume periods and retail investors will have greater assurance that they will receive a timely execution through NPROVE. The NASD also proposes to further enhance the price improvement opportunities afforded small retail investors through NPROVE by modifying NPROVE's order processing algorithm for the execution of matched market orders and limit orders. In addition, the NASD proposes to modify the limit order processing features NPROVE to provide for a broader, more detailed dissemination of NPROVE limit order information. With these changes, market participants will have a greater opportunity to interact with limit orders in NPROVE, thereby enhancing the limit order protection and price improvement features of NPROVE. Following is a more detailed description of these proposed changes. 1. Collapsing of NPROVE Order Processing Rounds As currently designed, the execution of unpreferenced market and marketable limit orders may involve up to three 15-second rounds in NPROVE. 4 In light of these three rounds of NPROVE order processing, some comment letters submitted to the SEC regarding NPROVE have expressed concern that it may take 45 seconds to process each order entered into NPROVE. 5 These commenters believe that executing NPROVE orders in 45-second intervals will create substantial order queues that will paralyze the system and result in investors receiving significantly delayed executions through NPROVE at prices wholly unrelated to the quotes that were displayed when their orders were entered into the system. 4‚ê£In Round 1, an unpreferenced order will be routed to the market maker at the inside bid or offer that is next in line for an NPROVE execution. The market maker may manually execute the order or allow the system to automatically execute the order after 15 seconds. If the market maker has effected a trade (or is in the process of executing a trade in that security) and has updated its quotation (or is in the process of updating), it may reject the NPROVE unpreferenced order. When, consistent with the requirements of Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 under the Act, an order is rejected by the first market maker in rotation, the order will enter Round 2 and will automatically be displayed to all remaining market makers at the inside quote. All of these market makers will have the opportunity to execute the order during a 15 second period. If no market maker manually accepts the order, it will be automatically executed against the first market maker in rotation. In the unlikely event that all of these market makers reject the order during Round 2 pursuant to a valid exception from Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1, the order will be executed automatically by the first market maker in rotation quoting at the new inside market. This is called Round 3. 5 See, e.g., letters from John C. Coffee, Jr., Adolf A. Berle Professor of Law, Columbia University in the City of New York,to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC, dated August 22, 1994 (``Coffee Letter''); and Simon S. Kogan, J.D., L.L.M., Attorney at Law, to Jonathan G. Katz, dated August 26, 1994. Given market makers' obligations to adhere to Rule 11Ac1&hyph;1 promulgated under the Act, the NASD believes most NPROVE orders would be executed during Round 1 and that it would be extremely rare for an NPROVE order to ever go beyond Round 2 order processing. As a result, the NASD does not believe that the commenters concerns are realistic. Nevertheless, while the NASD does not believe that prolonged order queues will develop under the current configuration of NPROVE, the NASD thinks it is appropriate to take prudent steps to ensure that such order queues do not develop. Accordingly, with one limited exception discussed below, the NASD proposes to collapse the three rounds of NPROVE order processing into one 15-second round.
