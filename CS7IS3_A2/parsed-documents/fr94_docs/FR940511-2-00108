Status: New Collection. Contact: Dominic Nessi, (202) 708&hyph;1015. Dated: April 6, 1994. Supporting Statement for Information Collection_Notice of Fund-Availability_FY 1994_Indian Applicants Under the Home Program A. Justification 1. This information collection is required in connection with the publication in the Federal Register of a Notice of Fund Availability (NOFA) which announced the availability of $12.750 million for the HOME Program for Indian tribes. The NOFA is authorized by the HOME Investment Partnerships Act (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, dated 11/28/90). The HOME Program provides funds to Indian tribes to expand the supply of affordable housing for very low-income and low-income persons. HUD regulations 24 CFR part 92, subpart M apply specifically to the Indian HOME Program. The HOME Act was amended 10/28/92 by the Housing and Community Development (HCDA) Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550). Some provisions of the HCDA 1992 directly affect the enactment. Copies of the 1994 HOME NOFA and applicable HUD regulations are attached. The information collection requirements imposed by the NOFA are as follows: Section III (entirety)_Application requirements: Standard Form&hyph;424, Form HUD&hyph;4121.1, Indian HOME Program Grants Comprehensive Approach, Form HUD&hyph;4122.1, Indian HOME Program Grants Project Summary, Form HUD&hyph;4123&hyph;I, Indian HOME Program Grants, Cost Summary, Form HUD&hyph;4125&hyph;I, Indian HOME Program Grants, Implementation Schedule, Form HUD&hyph;4126&hyph;I, Indian HOME Program Grant Certifications, narrative and supporting documentation that are responsive to the selection criteria including a description of how the HOME funds will be used, and the various kinds of information that are necessary in order to apply the selection criteria and rating factors. 2. The information is necessary so that the applicants can apply and compete for funding opportunities under this NOFA. The information provided by the applicants will be reviewed by HUD and evaluated against rating criteria for possible funding. The applicants will be notified of their selection/rejection. 3. We have not considered the use of improved technology since there is no other way to obtain the information except directly from the entities. 4. There will be no duplication of information. 5. There is no similar information already available which could be used or modified for this purpose. 6. We attempted to minimize the burden on the applicants by developing an application which limits the number of pages (not to exceed five). 7. The information will be collected on a one-time basis. 8. There are no special circumstances that require the collection to be conducted in a manner which is inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6. 9. There has been no outside consultation on this information collection. 10. No assurances of confidentiality is provided. 11. No sensitive questions are asked. 12. We do not estimate that there will be any additional cost to the Federal Government. The applicants will be reviewed in accordance with HUD's existing review and monitoring requirements. Annual cost to the respondent is estimated to be minimal since the application submission may be prepared by the Indian Housing Authorities. 13. We estimate that the information requirements of the proposed NOFA will have the following reporting burden: ␣ 1Section of NOFA affected 1Number of respondents 1No. respdts. per response 1Total annual resps. 1Hours per resps. 1Total No. hrs.
