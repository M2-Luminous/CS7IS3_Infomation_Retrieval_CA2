The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are babbling about a cooperative system in the nuclear issue, and are generally assuming a posture of actual warfare aimed at an offensive attack against the North. At the National Assembly's National Defense Committee meeting on 9 June, the so-called puppet defense minister proclaimed that the puppet army has entered into a 24-hour emergency alert system. The puppet clique indefinitely prolonged the measure to strengthen the posture of military preparedness, which was carried out from November of last year to late March of this year. As such, all of the puppet army is under an emergency alert preparedness day in, day out. The U.S. Forces occupying South Korea have also taken the posture of 24-hour alert preparedness, and the reinforcements of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces are thoroughly prepared to be committed to South Korea at any time. In addition, the U.S. imperialist aggression forces have completed preparation measures for a possible war on important U.S. military bases including the Osan airport and facilities, and they have completed storage of spare ammunition and oil. Also, a hot line has already been installed between the U.S. defense secretary and the puppet defense minister and is currently in use. The puppet clique is accelerating to reorganize the local reserve force, the puppet army's detached force, so that it can play the role of a professional army in preparation for wartime. The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are continuing to drag in up-to-date murderous weapons and equipments into South Korea. In March, 18 up-to-date Apache helicopters for offensive use, which is a scale of one battalion, was dispatched to South Korea. Currently, plans are being promoted to increase it to three battalions. War equipments of each branch of the service including antitank missiles, up-to-date moving radars, and vessels are continuously being brought into South Korea. This year, the U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are examining to take the posture of being prepared against the North step by step and according to scenario. In April, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry flew into South Korea, examined on-the-spot the new strategy plan 5027 to attack the North, and gave new orders. The U.S. imperialists and the puppet clique are all the more crazily carrying out military exercise aimed at a simulated war to invade the North. Under the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, the puppet clique carried out the first half of this year's joint strategic exercise in mid-May jointly by the puppet Army, Navy, and Air Force, and conducted various war exercises including air maneuvers, landing exercises, and anti-aircraft and antiship exercises in the northern part of Kyonggi Province and Korea's West Sea near the Military Demarcation Line on a large scale. All facts show that the U.S. forces occupying South Korean and the puppet army have assumed a full-scale posture to invade the North, thus the situation on the Korean peninsula has reached a touch-and-go stage.
