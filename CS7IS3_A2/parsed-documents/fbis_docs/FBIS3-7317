The latent debt must somehow be funded in the future, said Kazuhiko Takeshima, deputy director general of the ministry's budget bureau. Fiscal 1994 ends in March 1995. He was replying to questions in the Finance Committee of the Diet's House of Representatives. The debt includes 26 trillion yen in borrowings from Japanese National Railways Settlement Corp., and unspecified sums from local governments and from government-sponsored medical insurance programs, Takeshima said. Such debt results mainly from deferred regular fund allocations in budgets, and the ministry has been using this technical accounting method in budgets over the past years to avoid issuing deficit-covering bonds amid tough revenue conditions. In the fiscal 1994 budget package, now awaiting Diet deliberations, the ministry is to issue some 3 trillion yen worth of deficit-covering bonds to finance planned tax cuts, but is also using the method to avoid excessive bond issuances. Meanwhile, the outstanding balance of official national long-term debt is estimated to reach 261.8 trillion yen at the end of the new fiscal year, Takeshima said. He said 201 trillion yen is from issuances of government bonds, and the rest is borrowings mainly from the special budgetary account on postal savings. He said the balance of local government bonds is expected to reach 77 trillion yen.
