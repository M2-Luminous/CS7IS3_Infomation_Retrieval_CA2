Dealing with the effects on Gansu of the implementation of the tax-sharing system, Zhang Wule believed that there are both advantages and disadvantages in implementing the tax-sharing system stipulated by the central authorities. There are, however, more advantages than disadvantages. On the issue of the widening gap between eastern and western China, Zhang Wule said that it is an existing fact; however, through reform and opening up and by giving play to our own advantages, we gradually may narrow the gap between ourselves and the economically developed areas. Gansu is full of confidence on that point. When Zhang Wule talked about the relationships among reform, development, and stability, he said that Gansu presently enjoys sound momentum in economic development, nationality solidarity, political stability, social progress, and reform and opening up, and that the situation is favorable to the province.
