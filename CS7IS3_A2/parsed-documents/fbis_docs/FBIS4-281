FBIS4-281 "drafr067_c_94014" FBIS-AFR-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA AWB Calls For Dismissal of Goldstone AWB Calls For Dismissal of Goldstone MB0604162094 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1436 GMT 6 Apr 94 MB0604162094 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg April 6 SAPA -- Mr Justice Richard Goldstone should be suspended or dismissed and a commission of inquiry appointed to investigate his activities, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging [Resistance Movement -- AWB] demanded on Wednesday. In a statement issued by its Executive Council, the AWB said it had been the first organisation to "publicly state its disgust" at the Goldstone Commission. "The alarm bells are now ringing, even among the legal fraternity, over the nefarious activities of Goldstone's Commission. We demand that Goldstone, who is the only legal official in the Western world to be prosecutor, judge and executioner all in one, be suspended or dismissed as a matter of urgency." The AWB further demanded a commission of inquiry be appointed to investigate Judge Goldstone, which should include an investigation into his present and past political affiliations. "For too long this man, who was appointed by (State President) FW de Klerk and is responsible to De Klerk only, has vilified our esteemed army and police generals without them being charged in a court of law or given an opportunity to defend themselves," the AWB said. This was an apparent reference to the commission's "third force" investigation implicating top Police Generals Basie Smit, Johan le Roux and Krappies Engelbrecht. The AWB called on the National Party caucus to place "volk [Afrikaner people] and country" before personal financial gain by dismissing Mr de Klerk, "Goldstone's boss". "For God's sake, do this now, before this man is responsible for more chaos and bloodshed in our beloved fatherland," the AWB said.
