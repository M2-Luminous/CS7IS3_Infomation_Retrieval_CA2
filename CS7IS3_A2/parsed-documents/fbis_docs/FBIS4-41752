According to Dubinin, the monthly inflation rate will fall from 8-10 percent to 2.5-3 percent at the end of 1995. Production growth, if any, will take place no earlier than the end of next year. Dubinin informed the meeting of proposals to ease the tax climate being prepared. He said some taxes, including VAT (currently at 20 percent), would be reduced, and the entire list of taxes to be levied in 1995 would be reviewed. The finance ministry is considering emission of stocks which could be used for payment of taxes, Dubinin said. He added that the government would use a number of tax privileges in order to attract foreign investments to the top-priority industries.
