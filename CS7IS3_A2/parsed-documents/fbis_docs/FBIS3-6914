As already reported, the DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a statement manifesting the position of our republic regarding the undisguised attempt of the United States to crush [apsal] our republic with strong measures [kangkwon] and pressure by reversing the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact. In the statement, the spokesman revealed the good intentions [sonui] implemented by our republic and the traitorous act [paesin haengwi] taken by the United States in the course of carrying out the four-point simultaneous action steps agreed to at the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact. The spokesman said that the United States showed its intention to resume the 1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise at last and to impose sanctions on us at the UN Security Council on the pretext of the issue of inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and of the exchange of North-South special envoys. Concerning this situation, the spokesman clearly stated that we cannot unilaterally fulfill obligations put forward in the four-point simultaneous action steps, nor can we ensure the continuity of safeguards of the IAEA. This is just exercising the sovereignty of our republic. As was known, our republic made sincere efforts to fairly resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula after the agreement reached at the DPRK-U.S. New York contact last month. We explicitly ensured all conditions so that the inspection activities would be carried out to a sufficient extent for the continuity of safeguards for seven declared facilities. Moreover, we expressed magnanimity toward accepting all demands put forward by the inspection team members concerning the issues that went far beyond the scope of ensuring the continuity of safeguards. We put forward concrete measures and a reasonable method for realizing at an early date the exchange of special envoys of the North and the South, which the United States raised as a precondition. Nevertheless, going counter to this, the United States has never carried out the portion that it should have fulfilled [chagi halparul chonhyo ihaeing haji anta], and by continually presenting unreasonable pretexts, the United States has laid a barrier to implementing the four-point simultaneous action steps. Even after suspending the 1994 Team Spirit joint military exercise and announcing the date of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks, the United States persistently put forward the unreasonable preconditions that only after the IAEA inspection is carried out satisfactorily and the exchange of special envoys is realized, can these problems be resolved. Now claiming that the IAEA inspection is not satisfactory, the United States insisted that the inspection must be conducted again. The United States also asserted that if the exchange of North-South special envoys is not realized, it will not hold a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. What is more grave is that the United States claimed that it will refer our so-called nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. This is an act that can be carried out only by the Americans, who have not freed themselves from the concept of the cold war. As for inspection of our nuclear facilities, of which the United States is making an issue, the fact that nuclear materials in our nuclear facilities were not diverted for other purposes could be sufficiently verified by the recent inspection activities and the continuity of safeguards could be firmly ensured. From the outset, the IAEA Secretariat, violating the 15 February Vienna agreement by pursuing other purposes, demanded the inspection equivalent to regular and nonregular inspections based on the nuclear safeguards accord, instead of inspection for ensuring the continuity of safeguards. This illustrates that the United States and the IAEA, from the beginning, attempted to internationally isolate and crush us on the pretext of the nuclear problem. As for the issue of exchanging North-South special envoys, the agreement of the 25 February DPRK-U.S. New York contact only points out the resumption of working-level contact for the exchange of North-South special envoys. However, the United States stubbornly put forward the issue of realizing the exchange of North-South special envoys. This means violation of the agreement of the DPRK- U.S. New York contact. As mentioned earlier, the United States is busily going round in an attempt to refer our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council. Timed to coincide with this, the IAEA held a meeting of its Board of Governors and waged a campaign of adopting a resolution against us. To cope with such an unreasonable act [pudanghan haengdong] by the United States and the IAEA, our republic manifested the position of not dispatching its delegation to a third round of DPRK-U.S. talks. The rupture [kyollyol] of DPRK-U.S. talks is entirely attributed to the unjust position and attitude of the United States. Therefore, the situation on the Korean peninsula is again entering a dangerous phase. The United States showed the move to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Foreign reports noted that a U.S. naval fleet composed of 30 ships is approaching the water zone of the Korean peninsula. The world expressed deep concern over such a dangerous act by the United States. As long as the United States is attempting to crush our republic by all means using the nuclear issue and DPRK-U.S. talks, it is just for our republic to take self-defensive steps. As we have repeatedly declared, we are prepared for dialogue and for war. The United States should ponder the grave situation [omjunghan chongse] prevailing on the Korean peninsula. The future development of the situation will totally depend on the United States. We will watch the United States act.
