The report was immediately picked up by the press and television. A few days later, the same service circulated reports and a video about its operation to capture another "villain" -- Russian Party Chairman Nikolay Bondarik, who was a candidate for the city assembly. It turns out that he too was preparing various terrorist acts. A report on the Independent Television channel said that Bondarik's people had already killed someone. A group of armed men in camouflage uniforms and masks were shown seizing Bondarik, who was maintaining the calm of an Ancient Egyptian. The fighters were fearlessly twisting the arms of some weedy youth, a partner in crime, who had "offered resistance" to a dozen splendidly armed staffers of the antiterrorist service. All this information, reported to the press at a news conference specially called by the FCS administration, has generated a mass of questions. The "Great Russia" pre-election association, which the candidate for the city assembly belonged to, has issued a protest over his arrest and expressed the hope that a mistake was made. For several days I tried unsuccessfully to meet with A. Kuznetsov, leader of the antiterrorism service. There must obviously be a really large number of terrorists spread around town. But if we are talking about a specific case -- the arrest of five individuals who had seized some weapons, then the question arises, like in the well-known joke about Cowboy Joe: "How can someone need uncatchable Joe?" For the very reason that he is "uncatchable." Any high official of the FCS administration or the Internal Affairs Main Directorate with whom I have discussed the possibility of an attempt on Sobchak has responded with an ironic smile. However, let us assume that the five, headed by retired Captain A. Bogdanov, as the FCS Administration reports, did nevertheless take it into their head to deprive the St. Petersburg population of its beloved mayor. From the clinical point of view, how right in the head are they? After all, they had also hatched another terrible plan: to carry out an attack on the government building in Moscow, which could be seized by terrifying a few thousand professionals from the Kremlin security guard. The five, as has been officially reported, tried to seize some weapons. They attacked the security room of the "Zarya" science and production association, where (I quote VECHERNIY PETERBURG) "they tied up the female security guards and took several revolvers and several thousand cartridges for them from a safe. As they were leaving the security department the bandits found people waiting for them who were certainly not elderly women. The operation to capture them took a few seconds." "We had them under surveillance for quite a long time," A. Kuznetsov said, reporting the sensational details of the capture. But, excuse me, if the surveillance took a long time, does that mean that an agent of the FCS administration had been infiltrated into the group? Meaning that the agent behaved like the unforgotten Yevno Azef, who was leader of the Combat Organization of Socialist Revolutionaries and simultaneously the most valued agent of the Czarist police department. And objectively speaking, the role of the FCS administration agent was a provocative one, since measures were not taken to put an end to the preparation of the crime. In this episode the crime was carried through. Consequently, those who were carrying out surveillance of this group "for quite a long time" were interested in it being committed. Which leads to the conclusion that the episode involving the arrest of the five putative capturers of Government House in Moscow is a political card, pure and simple, played at a time of a deterioration in relations on the political Olympus. This is also informed by the persistent repetition in the FCS that all five were allegedly involved in the October (1993) events in Moscow, sided with the defenders of the House of Soviets, and decided to avenge the defeat of the lawful authorities. Equally surprising questions arise when you analyze the arrest of N. Bondarik, who has also been declared to be a terrorist. Who was killed by Bondarik and his accomplices has not been reported, yet this is a factor of most fundamental importance. In connection with Bondarik's arrest, Independent Television showed some object resembling a sawed-off shotgun and said that Bondarik and co. had been illegally hoarding weapons. Had this shotgun killed some state figure? And what about the theft of revolvers and cartridges from the "Zarya" science and production association? Some 2,000 rounds (some newspapers talk about "several thousand") taken from a place where the elderly lady guards are most often issued with revolvers which -- to prevent unpleasantness -- are completely rustfree? But if the conclusions from the inevitable questions are correct, the verdict is equally correct: The operations described above were pretty crude! In general all these matters are quite a long way removed from counterintelligence tasks. They are much closer to the political surveillance whose elimination was announced by President Yeltsin when he dismantled the Russian Federation Ministry of Security, in the probable belief that his stupid subjects would believe that the state can manage without political surveillance. Surveillance there is, but it looks like it is guided not by state tasks but by the whims of its immediate boss.
