Lobskiy; place and date not given: "Despite Reductions the Fleet Continues To Develop"] [Text] [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, how do you assess the results of your work with the Baltic Sea Fleet? [Kasatonov] Analogous inspections concerning the course of combat training are currently being conducted on all four Russian fleets. Of course, the situation in the Baltic Sea Fleet has an array of characteristic features, since to meet with those people and inspect units and vessels, one must leave the country and pay visit to countries of the near abroad. However, we did not experience any difficulties; the Latvian authorities facilitated our work. In general, inspections of units deployed in Kaliningrad Oblast and at the Liepaja Naval Base showed that the Baltic Sea Fleet is well prepared for the new training year, organizational problems have been solved, and methodological issues have been examined. The Baltic Sea Fleet has successfully begun the new training year, and I hope it will end the year the same way. I visited the Liepaja submarine brigade, and despite the fact that the troops are to leave the base soon, the results of combat training were just brilliant. This happening one more time merely testifies to the fact that the Baltic Sea Fleet, despite all its problems and difficulties, maintains self-control and manageability and efficiently performs tasks of combat training. [Lobskiy] Has the Naval Command set any new goals for the Baltic Sea Fleet for the new year? [Kasatonov] Of course. In connection with the fact that we have lost many of our Baltic bases, it is necessary to reexamine issues concerning communication, combat training, coordination, and command. [Lobskiy] The issue of establishing in Kaliningrad Oblast a unified defense rayon with a joint command, supply system, etc., has been examined for long time. What is the opinion of the Russian Naval Command on this issue? [Kasatonov] Great attention has been paid to issues of close cooperation among units of the Navy, Army, and Antiaircraft Defense, in the plans for combat training in 1994. Such work was conducted before. The command of the Russian Navy supports the establishment of a unified structure in the oblast, however, you probably understand that this issue does not fall within our competence. Returning to the question concerning new tasks, I will point out that the Baltic Sea Fleet will have to establish relations with navies of our former Baltic republics, which are today sovereign states. That is a very important task for the Baltic Sea Fleet. The commanders of these countries' navies also understand the importance of this issue. I met with Latvian Fleet Commander Zeibots, and I must admit that he expressed his willingness to initiate a constructive dialogue between our navies. Certain steps have already been made to establish a system of secure naval traffic, rescue operations, and early warning. The results of this work will be defined by the effectiveness of relations which are currently being established by the Baltic Sea Fleet Command with representatives of the Baltic states' navies. The Russian Naval Command is interested in continuing this work and will render any necessary support. [Lobskiy] You visited Latvia and met with representatives of the local authorities, commanders of military units, and workers. What problems should be resolved immediately? [Kasatonov] According to reports prepared by commanders of Liepaja garrisons -- both our commanders and the Latvians -- they have established working relations and jointly solved many problems. The same can be said regarding relations with local authorities. However, certain violations of the rights of Russian-speaking workers and servicemen of the fleet have taken place. We addressed this issue at a meeting with the head of the Liepaja Administration, and he promised to take necessary steps. I will report on this issue to the commander in chief and the Russian Defense Ministry. If this attitude does not change, the Russian Foreign and Defense Ministries will have to apply extraordinary measures. In general, in my opinion, a wise approach begins to prevail in the position of Baltic states, and I believe that all the problems will be solved at the negotiating table. The Baltic Sea Fleet Command has appropriate experience in this field, and it skillfully conducts its work in this direction. Speaking about Russian-Latvian relations, in my opinion, the Latvian side does not take into account the fact that Russia began to build those seaports and bases as early as the 17th and 18th centuries, and that, for example, Liepaja is closely connected with Russian history. This is the cradle of our submarine fleet. In this century, Russia has also done a lot to develop the infrastructure of these cities and seaports. I hope that these issues will be solved justly and by means of civilized negotiations. [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, last year, the Russian Federation Government adopted a program for revival of the Russian Navy. Does it include a chapter concerning the Baltic Sea Fleet, and if it does, what is its substance? How will the fleet look on its 300th anniversary? [Kasatonov] The military doctrine of our state defines defense tasks for the Navy, as well. Moreover, the importance of the Navy's role in the country's defense system will be increasing, since the number of nuclear warheads and ammunition deployed in the Navy will increase. Whereas the number of the Navy's nuclear warheads currently amounts to 27 percent of the total number of nuclear warheads, in the future, it will climb to 42-47 percent. Nevertheless, concrete elements of the Navy's development will depend on the results of economic reform. Today, the Navy is not only being reformed and reduced, but it also continues to develop. Recently, several modern battleships have been launched, and on 21 December, I participated in the launching of the newest nuclear submarine, the Severodvinsk. The Navy continues to conduct its regular cruises, patrols, and visits. Of course, all this is conducted in a different context than it was five or ten years ago. Today, the Navy fulfills appropriate international agreements on early warning of all sorts of incidents, which have been signed with various countries, conducts joint naval exercises, and pays working and official visits. This year, similar activities are to be no less frequent than they were last year. The concept of naval development in the third millennium is currently being examined, and what is most important, the Russian Government and the highest authorities of our state express their understanding. This allows us to be optimistic as to the future of the Navy. [Lobskiy] You know about the problems of the Black Sea Fleet very well. How do you assess the current situation in Sevastopol? [Kasatonov] Certain forces have been trying to entangle the Black Sea Fleet in political battles. This is the reason behind its instability, spread of crime, and activation of Mafia structures and nationalist, extremist forces. The murder of Captain First Rank Andrey Lazebnikov, a Russian officer, is the latest evidence of this. Moreover, the situation is not improving, only further deteriorating. Whereas Russia has proved its ability to solve the problems of the Black Sea Fleet, the other side has shown nothing but ambitions. In accordance with the Massandra agreements, this issue should be solved this year. If we keep waiting, history will never forgive us. [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, during your visit to Liepaja, you discussed the possible sale of scrap metal sunk in Latvian ports. However, the issue remained unresolved. Unfortunately, a great many material resources are being wasted, despite the fact that they can be cashed in today. [Kasatonov] Negotiations on property have been proceeding since we started our withdrawal. Today, Lieutenant Colonel Buyanov, a representative of the Central Department of Material Resources within the Russian Federation Defense Ministry, is in charge of these issues. Practically speaking, everybody admits that the current activities are inefficient. However, there are no appropriate legislative acts, government resolutions, or other documents. Apparently, such a situation satisfies somebody. [Lobskiy] Is there any hope that the situation will change? After all, the Navy commander has stated that if he had the right to decide about the fate of the remaining property, he would not take a kopek from the state coffers to build housing for servicemen. [Kasatonov] We have repeatedly addressed this issue to the Defense Ministry leadership and the government. And we will continue to do so in the future. However, I am not convinced that this issue will be resolved. [Lobskiy] What is your opinion of the reform of the personnel service structure? [Kasatonov] The defense minister has issued an order in this regard, and, as is known, one must not evaluate orders. [Lobskiy] But, even a preliminary examination of this document shows that an array of aspects of such work has been eliminated. For example, there has been no other structure dealing with the social problems of servicemen. Now, these kinds of activities will be reduced if not discontinued. [Kasatonov] Yes, such a threat really exists. However, I can say that, in a certain amount of time, maybe a year or half a year, we ourselves will analyze the work of the new structures and submit our conclusions to the defense minister. I am convinced that everything will be taken into account. These structures are to comprise only chief and deputy commanders, therefore, our job will be to help them organize their work and draw conclusions. [Lobskiy] Igor Vladimirovich, how would you comment on the results of the recent elections in our country? [Kasatonov] Our country has entered on the path of democratic development, which has been confirmed by the results of the elections. Another issue is that we can encounter certain setbacks and obstacles on this path, and they should be reckoned with. I believe that the common sense of our people will prevent any cataclysms. [Lobskiy] Comrade Admiral, during the tragic events in Moscow, certain newspapers disseminated a report saying that, on behalf of Rutskoy, you were proposed to take the side of the White House. Was that true? [Kasatonov] Nobody came forward with such a proposal to me. Probably, because I instantly declared my position: The president of Russia is the commander in chief. Moreover, it is immoral to solve political problems by means of military battles, as the former leaders of the Supreme Soviet did. Another important lesson coming from these events is that politicians, civil activists, and authorities should base their activities on the Constitution. Only such a path will safeguard the interests of Russia, its economic growth, and stabilization in society and the Armed Forces. This is a prerequisite for the effective development of the country and its government.
