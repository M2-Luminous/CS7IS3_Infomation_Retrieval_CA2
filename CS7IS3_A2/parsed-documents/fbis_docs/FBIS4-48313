"AZAPO objects in the strongest possible terms to the insinuation by the premier of the North-West region, Mr Popo Molefe, that there are elements behind the public servants' demands who seek to frustrate the work of the new government. "AZAPO reminds Mr Molefe that the people of the North-West region overthrew the homeland regime without needing to be instigated by any 'elements'. They assumed their own power and exercised their democratic rights," said AZAPO official Mr Nkosi Molala. "In the spirit of the discussions between the president of AZAPO, Prof Itumeleng Mosala, and the new president, Mr Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, recently, that co-operation will be sought in matters on national interests between our organisations, we urge the premier of the North-West Region to refrain from insinuating that people cannot make demands from the new government unless they are instigated by someone else outside themselves," he concluded.
