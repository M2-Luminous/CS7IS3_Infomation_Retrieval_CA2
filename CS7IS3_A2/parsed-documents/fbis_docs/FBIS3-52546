Three Muslim Brothers were detained in the past few days. They are Jamal 'Abd-al-Fattah 'Ashri, from al-Kunayyisah; Majdi 'Azzuz, from Imbabah; and Shawqi Ghazi. The latter was given electric shocks, sustained brain damage, and is still being treated at a mental hospital. The three were subjected to frightful torture at the hands of the state security investigation officers of the Jabir Ibn-Hayyan department, particularly Colonel Muhammad al-Dib, Major Sahrif Sirri, and 'Adil 'Abd-al-Rahman. The latest act of torture involved Jamal 'Ashri last Wednesday and Thursday. He was arrested after an exhibition on Bosnia-Herzegovina was canceled. He was slashed and sensitive parts of his body were shocked. The officers torturing him asked him to work as an informer for them and provide them with information on the number of Muslim Brothers and their activity in al-Jizah. They threatened to hold him in custody if he refused to respond to these demands. 'Ashri reported the incident to the Egyptian Human Rights Organization.
