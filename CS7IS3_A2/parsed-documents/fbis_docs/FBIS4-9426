This lavish praise comes from a head of state 2,500 km from Copenhagen. In an exclusive interview with BERLINGSKE TIDENDE, Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov gave the credit to the Danes for the fact that 11 European Union (EU) countries have now taken Greece to the European Court and have through diplomatic channels been pressing the Greeks into a corner to bring to end to the heated campaign against the Macedonian Government. The Greeks' blockade is threatening to destabilize not only the whole of the southern Balkans, President Gligorov said. A destabilization which in the final analysis could lead to a bloody new Balkan war. But the present and previous Danish governments have been the most active in trying to prevent such a development, the president told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE in the Macedonian capital of Skopje. "Denmark is the most encouraging ray of light in the EU. A small country which courageously remains firm on its principles and dares voice them internationally. This is something that I think will be remembered in the EU and to a special extent here in Macedonia. Denmark shows that you should live up to the documents you sign, the documents which form the foundation for the European architecture. At the same time Denmark's stance is a defense of all small countries and therefore also a defense of Denmark itself," said Kiro Gligorov, who does not on the whole think that the EU has done enough to defend Macedonia against its Greek neighbor. "Throughout the lengthy period since the conflict with Greece started, the EU could have gone to work much more toughly. We are after all talking about actions undertaken by an EU country. It is a conflict on the EU's borders, and a serious precedent will be set if the EU is unable to solve this problem. The point has now been reached at which the EU had to intervene and take Greece to court. Such a course of action was inevitable and hopefully Greece will reach its conclusions and preempt the trial by lifting the blockade. We would like to avoid the trial taking place. But if this does happen and Greece is found guilty, we take the view that the EU must find sufficient means to pressurize Greece into lifting the blockade," the Macedonian president said, pointing out that the EU also has an economic interest in having the blockade lifted as soon as possible, because Macedonia will confront the organization with demands for compensation for the enormous losses the small nation is suffering because of its isolation. President Gligorov estimates that the loss of income from trade and the repercussions for industry and agriculture amount to $86 million per month (more than half a billion kroner). The conflict with Greece still centers on three main complaints. The Greeks are demanding that Macedonia should change its name, its flag and its national symbols, and its Constitution. All of these are symbols which the Greeks fear could lead at some later date to the little country's making territorial demands on northern Greece. The use of the Vergina star in Macedonia's flag which is thought to have been Alexander the Great's royal symbol, is viewed in Athens as tantamount to the theft of Hellenic culture. That is why Athens is demanding that the flag and symbol must be removed before the blockade can be lifted. President Gligorov, who is depicted in Greece as a diabolic Greater Macedonian nationalist and dictator, sat in the presidential palace next to the red-gold flag with the sun of Vergina which he is unwilling to abandon to satisfy the Greeks' "national hysteria." ``Throughout this process we have shown the greatest amount of goodwill vis-a-vis the Greeks' problems. But there has to be a limit to how far we can go, if we are not to give up our national identity completely. It can be in no one's interest that this should happen. It could lead to similar demands from other neighbors. It could destabilize not only our own country but the whole region and Greece in the process, if we gave in to all these demands. We need an agreement which respects our national identity and creates a foundation for a permanent and peaceful relationship between our two countries. "Here in the Balkans where everything is mixed up in great confusion symbols take on very great significance. But many of our symbols in this region are common property, and I think that it is important that in the future we should view with tolerance and understanding the symbols as common property. The Greek antique culture is part of the cultural legacy of the whole of mankind. If the heated atmosphere in Greece continues and national frustrations remain as they are now it will be impossible to find a solution," Kiro Gligorov said, stressing that Macedonia is the only republic which has left the former Yugoslavia without acts of hostility as a result. "Instead of always talking about Macedonia as a powder keg which could explode any minute, Macedonia should be seen as fundamental pillar of peace and stability in the Balkans. Despite all the warnings and threat scenarios we have succeeded in creating a stable and peaceful society. If this had NOT happened, the war in Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia-Herzegovina would have spread south and would have created an all-embracing Balkan war," said Kiro Gligorov, who thinks that the biggest external danger to Macedonia is an explosion of the tense situation in Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo. If it comes to violent clashes between Kosovo Albanians and the Serbian authorities, this could trigger a flood of refugees to the south which could threaten stability in Macedonia where there exists a very fine and difficult ethnic balance between the Macedonian majority and the large Albanian minority. In such a situation President Gligorov would expect the countries of the West to help by taking the perhaps several hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees. "There is a danger of a destabilization of Macedonia in the event of a conflict in Kosovo, and in such a situation the refugee problem would probably be dramatic. As a small, poor country we will not be in a position to accept a very large number of these refugees, quite simply because we cannot create a life for them here and because we would not be able to guarantee our own internal stability. Our task in such a situation would therefore be to collect the refugees at the border and have them transported on to countries which have a better chance of taking them on and where there is no political danger involved in accepting these refugees."
