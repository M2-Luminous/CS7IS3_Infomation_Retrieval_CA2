The six, two Germans, two French and two Belgians, broke into the Cadarache Nuclear Test Centre near here at dawn. Carrying geiger counters, they draped banners from the top of the cooling tower reading: ``Atomic experiment don't play with our lives.'' Penelope Komites, head of Greenpeace France, denounced the experiment because of the presence of numerous other nuclear installations at Cadarache and because of ``major seismic risks.'' The experiment, to be carried out in a PHEBUS reactor, will simulate on a small scale a meltdown in the heart of a pressurised water reactor -- the type most frequently in service in the west -- and is aimed at increasing security. Komites said the experiment should be called off because it would provide a ``false sense of security'' over serious nuclear accidents. Scientists and ecologists will be able to watch the experiment live by teletransmission either at Cadarache or at Fontenay-aux- Roses, in the eastern Paris suburbs, home of France's Nuclear Safety and Protection Institute (IPSN), which is organising the meltdown. On Tuesday, 20 militants of the Austrian ecological group Global 2000 demonstrated outside the French embassy in Vienna, saying there was a ``considerable risk'' that radioactive materials would leak during the experiment ``which has no meaning and exposes the people of France, Europe and the wholeworld to pointless nuclear danger.'' The Cadarache experiment began on November 21 with pre- irradiation of 10 kilogrammes (22 lbs) of nuclear fuel and is the first of six simulations costing a total of 150 million dollars. The French electricity utility EDF is paying 25 percent of the programme, the European Community 30 percent and the United States, Canada, Japan and South Korea are contributing 15 percent. The first experiment was to have been carried out last summer but was delayed after metal shavings were found from a hole that had been drilled in a seal support. In October, a bolt dropped out of a heat measuring mechanism, causing another delay. But Cadarache director Michel Suscillon says there was no danger. ``Even in the case of a failure during the experiment, the radioactive products will stay confined behind four impermeable barriers.'' Greenpeace-Germany has spearheaded the campaign against the experiment, campaigning for a tourist boycott of the Provence region in southern France and prompting major tour operator Turistik Union International (TUI) to join in. Half of the students of a German high school dropped out of an exchange programme with a French secondary school.
