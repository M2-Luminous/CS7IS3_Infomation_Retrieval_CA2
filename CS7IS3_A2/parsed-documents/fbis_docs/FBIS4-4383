Najib Tun Abdul Razak, the minister of defense, said that the government intends to undertake the balanced development of the three services, the army, navy, and air force. He said: "We want balanced development in all of the services in the Malaysian Armed Forces (ATM), in accordance with the concept of modern, conventional warfare. This is to make sure that the strength of the three services in the Malaysian Armed Forces is suitable and that they can support each other. The only problem is that our financial resources do not make it possible to develop the three services simultaneously. We will concentrate on the development of the Malaysian Army in the future." He made this statement to reporters in Kuala Lumpur after receiving a visit from Gen Abdul Rahman Abdul Hamid, the commander of the Malaysian Armed Forces, who will retire on 1 February. Najib said that the development of the Royal Malaysian Air Force (TUDM) is only the first phase in the development of the Malaysian Armed Forces as a whole. He said: "In the future we will concentrate on the development of the army in accordance with the concept of modern, conventional warfare and the combined arms approach, which is very important for achieving a service which we can be proud of." According to Najib, in the initial phase of achieving this objective the government will be forced to budget its available resources to increase the strategic assets of the Malaysian Armed Forces. He said: "In the initial phase many of these strategic assets will involve the combat capability of the air force, because in conventional warfare the control of the air is very important, although it is not decisive. The function of the army is the final step in supporting the air force. However, the state of readiness of the army is also important. The government is aware of this, but our financial resources do not permit us to carry out simultaneous development. This will take time," he said. At a preceding news conference Gen Abdul Rahman said that the development of the three services in the Malaysian Armed Forces needs to be balanced to permit all of them to carry out their respective functions effectively, if we become involved in war. He said: "It is true that the army has been left behind, compared to development in other elements of the Malaysian Armed Forces, particularly during the last several years. This is because previously we emphasized resources, and army equipment for carrying on operations consisted of items left over from the struggle against the communist terrorists [1948-1960]. The army is not very well provided for in terms of its equipment. Therefore, we need to purchase more appropriate equipment for the army. To achieve the basic objective of national defense, we must improve the equipment of our armed forces in all aspects, including the army," he said.
