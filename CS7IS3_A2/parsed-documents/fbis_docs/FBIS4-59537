He also said that interest in stopping the war is not considered interference in his country's internal affairs. He also underlined that the YSP has no intention of seceding and denied that foreign parties were behind the start of the fighting. Al-Dali said the problem is that there is a party that does not want to implement the first part of the pledge and accord document which concerns the security and military situation.
