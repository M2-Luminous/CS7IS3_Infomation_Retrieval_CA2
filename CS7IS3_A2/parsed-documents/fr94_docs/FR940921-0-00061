(a) The emission standards applicable to conversions of 1993 and later model year vehicles and engines are: (1) All of the requirements that would apply if the conversion were being certified as if it were a new vehicle or engine. (2) If a vehicle or engine to be converted was originally certified to a NO X or particulate family emission limit other than the applicable new vehicle NO X or particulate standard, the family emission limit is the applicable standard. (b) The emission standards applicable to conversions of 1992 and earlier model year vehicles and engines are: (1) Exhaust hydrocarbons (as applicable by fuel type). The Tier 0 hydrocarbon standards, as applicable by vehicle class, contained in §§86.094&hyph;8 and 86.094&hyph;9 of this chapter, and the hydrocarbon standards, as applicable by engine class, contained in §§86.094&hyph;10 and 86.094&hyph;11 of this chapter; (2) CO, NO X and particulate. The applicable CO, NO X and particulate standards or NO X and particulate family emission limits the vehicle or engine was originally certified as meeting; (3) Evaporative hydrocarbons. Any evaporative requirements applicable to the original vehicle or engine will remain applicable to the conversion if the converted vehicle or engine retains the ability to operate on the fuel which it was designed and certified to use. §85.505 Labeling. (a) The aftermarket conversion certifier shall provide with each aftermarket conversion system a supplemental emission control information label, which shall be affixed by the aftermarket conversion installer in a permanent manner to each converted vehicle, in a location adjacent to the original emission control information label required in §86.092&hyph;35 of this chapter. If the supplemental label cannot be placed adjacent to the original label, it shall be placed in a location where it will be seen by a person viewing the original label. (b) The supplemental label shall be affixed in such a manner that it cannot be removed without destroying or defacing the label. The label shall not be affixed to any equipment which is easily detached from the vehicle. (c) The supplemental label shall clearly state that the vehicle has been equipped with an aftermarket conversion system designed to allow it to operate on a fuel other than the fuel it was originally manufactured to operate on, and shall identify the fuel(s) which the vehicle is designed to use. (d) The supplemental label shall show the vehicle model year; the aftermarket conversion certifier's name, address and telephone number; the installer's name, address, and telephone number; the date on which the aftermarket conversion system was installed; the mileage of the vehicle at the time of the conversion; and shall state that the converted vehicle complies with federal emission requirements.
