FR940412-1-00022 FR940412-1-00006 Tinnitus can be caused by a number of conditions, including injuries, acute diseases and drug reactions. Compensable evaluation for persistent tinnitus is currently restricted to conditions caused by head injury, concussion or acoustic trauma. Since the severity of disablement from tinnitus does not depend on its origin, we propose to eliminate the restriction that tinnitus result from trauma, and provide instead for a compensable evaluation whenever tinnitus is recurrent. We also propose to remove reference to diagnostic code 8046 (cerebral arteriosclerosis), and to remove reference to tinnitus under diagnostic code 6204 (peripheral vestibular disorder) in order to allow separate evaluations for tinnitus when caused by cerebral arteriosclerosis and peripheral vestibular disorder. No change is proposed in §4.87b, which provides evaluations for loss of smell (diagnostic code 6275) and taste (diagnostic code 6276) except wording changes in the NOTE following, for clarity, and redesignation of the section as §4.87a. The Secretary hereby certifies that this regulatory amendment will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612. The reason for this certification is that this amendment would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this amendment is exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of §§603 and 604. This regulation is subject to review under Executive Order 12866. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers are 64.104 and 64.109.
