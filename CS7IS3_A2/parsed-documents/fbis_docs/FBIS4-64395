Preliminary hearings judge Italo Ghitti will pronounce on the indictment requests -- also including many disgraced former party heads and the former Ferruzzi top brass -- on May 24. Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro said the indictments were sought for "all those who gave and took the money." Bossi's citation for violation of party funding laws is based on testimony from former Montedison managing director Carlo Sama, that the Northern League, like many other parties, received an unrecorded electoral contribution (200 million lire, or 125,000 dollars) in the run-up to the 1992 general election. Bossi denied knowledge of the payment in testimony to the Enimont-linked trial of money manager Sergio Cusani, which ended with an eight-year conviction two days ago. He said that the party treasurer, since sacked, had been a fool to accept the money, which he claimed was stolen from League offices shortly after the treasurer accepted it and while he was still working out what to do with it. But he expressed the view that he might have done the same thing if he had been in the treasurer's shoes, given the rising party's cash needs at the time. Among the others for whom indictments are sought are three former party heads who have admitted illegal contributions to their parties, Socialist Bettino Craxi, Liberal Renato Altissimo, and Social Democrat Carlo Vizzini, as well as the former Christian Democrat Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino, and his party's former treasurer Severino Citaristi, who have also admitted to receiving money from the firm. [passage omitted] Also on the indictment list was Republican Party chief Giorgio La Malfa, who stepped down but was recently reinstated after admitting an under-the-table payment of 300 million lire (like the payment to the League and the smaller parties, a small sum compared to the more than 150 billion lire, or 94 million dollars, allegedly paid out in the Enimont affair). Another big name was 1988-92 Christian Democrat leader Arnaldo Forlani, who denied any knowledge of kickbacks or other illegal party payments in testimony viewed by the prosecution and media as reticent. Two former Socialist high-fliers, former Justice Minister Claudio Martelli and former Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis were also cited, as were two of De Michelis's former staff, one still on the run. Another former minister named was ex-Liberal Egidio Sterpa. Craxi's brother-in-law and former Milan Mayor Paolo Pillitteri was also named. Former head of Ferruzzi external relations Luigi Bisignani, who allegedly arranged the passage of 93 billion lire in Treasury Credit Certificates (CCTs) via the Vatican Bank in payment of Enimont kickbacks, was named along with the Swiss-based architect of Ferruzzi-Montedison's "parallel accounts," Giuseppe (Pino) Berlini. Alberto Grotti, a former Eni deputy chairman facing charges in the separate Eni-Sai kickbacks case, was also named. Also cited was Mauro Giallombardo, a former Socialist Euro-MP whose Luxembourg and Swiss accounts were allegedly used as payment conduits. The League's former treasurer Alessandro Patelli was named along with the man he and others allegedly received the money from, Marcello Portesi. Leading prosecutor Antonio Di Pietro has claimed the Enimont-linked payments were divided into three phases: bribes to obtain tax breaks at its inception, payments to extricate Montedison at the highly favourable price of 2.8 trillion lire, and further payments to secure the benevolence of parties with whom ex-Ferruzzi supremo, the late Raul Gardini, had realised he must come to terms. Di Pietro was unable to convince Cusani to come clean on the final destination of more than 100 billion of the Enimont and related kickbacks. Cusani said he delivered the bulk of this sum back to Gardini, but was unable to prove this. Gardini committed suicide in July last year just three days after the jail suicide of former ENI chairman Gabriele Cagliari and just ahead of detention warrants for himself, Sama, Garofano, and Cusani. The closing page of the 63-page request to bring the 37 to trial referred to "serious evidence" against all those under investigation accumulated through confessions made by many of them and the findings brought to light during the Cusani trial, "which have been fully appended to the present request." The document also recalled that in his prosecution statements at the Cusani trial, Di Pietro reported that investigators could not track down an individual who received "the alleged billion lire coming from the Enimont bribe and going to the Italian Communist Party." Thus, the public prosecutors office will pursue this end of the investigation "for a complete reconstruction of the episode and to ascertain possible responsibility." The investigation will also be continued in an attempt to pin down the identities of other people who received Enimont kickbacks, especially unknown persons who laid hands on more than 1.5 million dollars delivered by Bisignani in dollars to Christian Democrats of the time in the faction led by Giulio Andreotti, seven-times premier and now senator for life. Forlani, said the request, is wanted to stand trial for acting in complicity with Citaristi and Enrico Boreatti, named as an official in the administration of the old Christian Democratic Party, for allegedly taking four billion 750 million lire (nearly three million dollars) in installments from Gardini, Sama and Garofano. The former head of the ex-Christian Democratic Party was also named in connection with another four billion lire in bribes doled out by Grotti, the former deputy chairman of the ENI. Named in connection with Bossi were Patelli, the former League administrative chief, and Poresi, the past head of Montedison external relations. The request said ahead of the April 1992 general election, in which the League rose to national prominence on a protest vote, "Bossi and Patelli received from Sergio Cusani and Carlo Sama, at the time of the electoral campaign for the 1992 general election, the sum of 200 million lire (materially paid by Marcello Portesi)...." With his arrest by Clean Hands magistrates, Patelli became the first official of the League to be linked with the business and political corruption so strongly decried by the separatist movement. According to the document covering the indictments sought, part of the flood of Enimont bribery funds was allocated as follows: 200 million to Altissimo, a former leader of the tiny government party; 200 million to Bossi; 8.5 billion (5.3 million dollars) to Citaristi; 8.5 billion to Forlani; some 11 billion (nearly 7 million dollars) to Craxi; 100 million to De Michelis; 500 million to Martelli; 300 million to La Malfa; 100 million to Pillitteri; five billion lire to Cirino Pomicino. The investigations said all these and other sums to others were intended for the political parties but that they were not written into the parties' balance sheets. Thus, the host of politicians cited are wanted for appearances in the dock on the charge of violations of the law on the public financing of political parties.
