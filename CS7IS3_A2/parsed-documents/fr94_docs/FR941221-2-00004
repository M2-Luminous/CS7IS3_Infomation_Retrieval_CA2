ACTION: Notice of municipal interest rates on advances from insured electric loans for the first quarter of 1995. SUMMARY: The Rural Utilities Service hereby announces the interest rates for advances on municipal rate loans with interest rate terms beginning during the first quarter of 1995. DATES: These interest rates are effective for interest rate terms that commence during the period beginning January 1, 1995, and ending March 31, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sue Arnold, Financial Analyst, Program Support Staff, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Rural Utilities Service, room 2230&hyph;S, 14th Street and Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20250&hyph;1500. Telephone: 202&hyph;720&hyph;0736. FAX: 202&hyph;720&hyph;4120. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Rural Utilities Service (RUS) hereby announces the interest rates on advances made during the first calendar quarter of 1995 from municipal rate electric loans. Pursuant to regulations originally published by the Rural Electrification Administration (REA) at 7 CFR 1714.5, the interest rates on advances of funds from municipal rate loans are based on indexes published in the ``Bond Buyer'' for the four weeks prior to the first Friday of the last month before the beginning of the quarter. The Federal Crop Insurance Reform and Department of Agriculture Reorganization Act of 1994 (Pub.L. 103&hyph;354, 101 Stat. 3178), signed by President Clinton on October 13, 1994, provides for the establishment of RUS as successor to REA with respect to various programs, including the electric loan program established by the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (7 U.S.C. 901 et seq.). On October 20, 1994, the Secretary of Agriculture issued Secretary's Memorandum 1010&hyph;1, establishing RUS and abolishing RUS. Therefore, RUS is publishing this notice implementing a rule originally published by REA. In accordance with 7 CFR 1714.5, the interest rates are established as shown in the following table for all interest rate terms that begin any time during the first calendar quarter of 1995. ‚ê£ 1Interest rate term ends (year) 1Rate (0.000 percent) 2016 or later 6.875 2015 6.875 2014 6.875 2013 6.875 2012 6.875 2011 6.875 2010 6.750 2009 6.750 2008 6.625 2007 6.500 2006 6.375 2005 6.375 2004 6.250 2003 6.125 2002 6.000 2001 5.875 2000 5.875 1999 5.625 1998 5.500 1997 5.250 1996 5.000 Dated: December 9, 1994.
