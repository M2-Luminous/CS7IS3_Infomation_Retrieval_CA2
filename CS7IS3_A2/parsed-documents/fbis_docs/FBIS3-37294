Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Valeriy Shmarov, who said so in an Interfax-Ukraine interview, added that "the Russian ruble will never be legal in Ukraine." He said that the Ukrainian leaders were thinking of "ways and means" of allowing the Crimean authorities a maximum of self-government but "the budgetary relations will remain largely unchanged." He described the Black Sea Fleet as "a powerful cover of the entire south of both Ukraine and Russia" but emphasized that "the Black Sea coast is, above all, our southern border."
