The Jeddah-based, AL-MADINAH, said despite reservations on some parts of the agreement, the agreement means that a new phase has begun for practical and realistic actions. While many people think that the agreement is full of deadly mistakes and bears seeds of failure, the paper said, other people thought it will fulfill the ambitions of the Palestinian people of the occupied territories who suffered too much from unemployment and poverty that makes the Palestinian side to soften its negotiation stand. AL-YAWM, of al-Dammam, said the agreement does not necessarily mean that all standing propblems had been solved because Israel, with a record full of manipulations and deception, many not carry out the agreement honestly. The paper urged the international community and big powers in particularly to guarantee full implementation of the agreement and called on the Palestinian to realise the biggest possible gain of the agreement. AL-JAZIRAH, published in Riyadh and 'UKAZ, published in Jeddah also tackled the same issue said the agreement would be a real test for the intentions of Israel and whether it is ready to cope with the Arab position on peace process. They said if the agreement is not followed by similar progress on other tracks, it would certainly expose to erosion elements and matters may change for the interests of peace opposing parties in the region.
