FR941227-0-00047 FR941227-0-00012 As an example of these built-in gain and loss provisions, in the case of a cash basis personal service corporation that converts to S status and that has receivables at the time of the conversion, the receivables, when received, are built-in gain items. At the same time, built-in losses would include otherwise deductible compensation paid after the conversion to the persons who performed the services that produced the receivables, to the extent such compensation is attributable to such pre-conversion services. To the extent such built-in loss items offset the built-in gains from the receivables, there would be no amount subject to the built-in gains tax. H.R. Rep. No. 795, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 63&hyph;64 (1988). The commentators suggest that the accrual method rule in the final regulations should be applied without regard to sections 267(a)(2) and 404(a)(5). The Treasury and the IRS disagree with the commentators that the legislative history quoted above precludes the adoption of the accrual method rule of the proposed regulations. The accrual method rule in the proposed regulations was adopted as an administrable method for both taxpayers and the Service to determine the extent to which an amount included in income or deducted in the recognition period is attributable to the pre-recognition period. Nevertheless, in response to the commentators' requests, the final regulations extend recognized built-in loss treatment for certain amounts properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5) in the recognition period. The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 267(a)(2) is recognized built-in loss to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period, and (ii) the amount is paid in the first two and one-half months of the recognition period, or is paid to an individual that owned less than 5 percent of the corporation's stock. The final regulations provide that an amount properly deducted under section 404(a)(5) is recognized built-in loss to the extent (i) all events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability to pay the amount, and the exact amount of the liability can be determined, as of the beginning of the recognition period, and (ii) the amount is not deductible under section 267(a)(2). The Treasury and the IRS believe that these rules are relatively easy for taxpayers and the IRS to apply and also provide relief from the deferral of deductions under section 267(a)(2) or 404(a)(5). The additional limitations for amounts deducted under section 267(a)(2) are needed because of the particular difficulty in determining whether amounts paid to related parties are attributable to services performed before or after the beginning of the recognition period. The final regulations also modify the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations as follows: (1) An exception from the accrual method rule for items deducted under ยง1.461&hyph;4(g) is added (relating to items in addition to those specified in section 461(h)(2)(C) for which payment constitutes economic performance); and (2) the exception from the accrual method rule in the proposed regulations for items deducted under section 469 is eliminated. The ยง1.461&hyph;4(g) exception is added to clarify the section 461(h)(2)(C) exception in the proposed regulations. The section 469 exception is eliminated because losses suspended before the recognition period under section 469 cannot be used in the recognition period under section 1371(b)(1). D. Section 481 Adjustments The proposed regulations provide that any item of income or deduction properly taken into account during the recognition period under section 481 is recognized built-in gain or loss if the item is taken into account because of a change of accounting method effective before the beginning of the second year of the recognition period (``one-year rule''). In certain cases, this one-year rule has the effect of (1) omitting income attributable to the corporation's C period altogether at the corporate level, (2) including income attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate level, (3) omitting a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period altogether at the corporate level, or (4) allowing a deduction attributable to the corporation's C period twice at the corporate level, because the section 481 adjustment on the change in accounting method is not treated as recognized built-in gain or loss. In addition, the Treasury and the Service believe that in most cases the portion of a section 481(a) adjustment attributable to the pre-recognition period and the portion attributable to the recognition period can be determined without undue administrative difficulty.
