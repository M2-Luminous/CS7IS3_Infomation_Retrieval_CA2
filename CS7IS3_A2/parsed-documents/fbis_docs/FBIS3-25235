Talks will resume in Lusaka tomorrow, and the working agenda will center on national reconciliation. In Luanda, the Malian diplomat held a working meeting with the French cooperation minister and requested the Luanda Communist government to suspend the ban on distribution of humanitarian assistance to areas administered by the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA]. Observers continue to insist that the parties should discuss national reconciliation with great care and skill, because it is the center point of any agreement that may come about in the Zambian capital. It should be pointed out that Dr. Jorge Alicerces Valentim, a member of the UNITA delegation to the peace talks, assured the international press yesterday that the two parties had already reached an agreement on the arrival of blue helmets in Angola to supervise the agreements that may result from the ongoing peace talks.
