Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has been and remains the principal actor in all these episodes. Many politicians, deputies, and, of course, journalists decided since the beginning of the year to deal very "harshly" with him. They do anything in their power to remove him from the political scene. Therefore, REPUBLIKA tried for a topical interview with the prime minister. [Smolec] As a journalist, I would like to ask you about the dominant topical events that are shaking our political scene. The REPUBLIKA readers are, among other things, however, also interested in whether you managed to rest on the brief vacation you took at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, and recharge the battery of your personal energy and vitality. [Meciar] If I do not take into account meetings with Cabinet members and talks with several other officials, I have really had a little rest. I have even managed to get on my skis once and to fall. There was no reporter around, but it would have been a fantastic shot with a caption "Meciar's Fall." I met a man there whom I very much respect--Mr. Kulang, a porter in the High Tatras mountain range. In 1992, he celebrated our election victory in the Tatras by carrying a record 207-kg load. I was rambling through the streets. I met young people. One of them recognized me. He called to his friends, "Hey, that's Meciar." His friends turned and replied: "You are silly, Meciar is twice as tall." [Smolec] The independent Slovakia is also your achievement as a statesman. In the struggle for a place in the sun, you stand out among the many of your "fellow travelers." Those who did not want Slovak independence are "plotting" against you now. They predicted that the first attack against you would begin in January. It did. When do you expect the next one? [Meciar] The whirlwind around me never stops. Unfortunately, there are also people who are, as you say, "plotting" against me. I have a message for these people: "I still have enough strength to face them." [Smolec] Our readers are very disappointed that even the Slovak president, who holds his post also because of you, has stood up against you. In the New Year's address, he appealed to the leading representatives of the parliamentary parties to search for personalities suitable for the government. The president is calling for a stable government that will be trusted abroad. It is an obvious casting of doubts on the prime minister, the government.... The readers are convinced that it is the people close to the president who are responsible for the conflict between the Castle and Freedom Square [seats of the president and the prime minister (government), respectively]. After all, it is surprising, to say the least, if a Christian Democratic Movement politician who had voted in the former Federal Assembly against Slovak independence is responsible for security policy at the Castle. The following postulate is gaining in popularity among the people: The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] won the elections, but the Castle was won by the VPN [the former Public Against Violence movement] members, obnoxious people, Czechoslovakists.... [Meciar] I refuse the thesis of good kings and bad advisers. In a democracy, the chief is responsible for his advisers. It is never the other way around--the advisers are not responsible for the chief. There are differences between the government and the Castle. The president pointed them out clearly on 1 January. Neither do I want to go into details, nor do we have the time. This misunderstanding is the last thing we need. I must, however, comment on certain aspects of this problem. Political parties and movements are independent of the state. A state representative has no right to interfere in the internal affairs of these parties, even if he is the president. The government is subject to parliamentary control but not to the president. The president entrusts the prime minister with the composition of a new government, but he cannot create a situation that would lead to a change of this government. There are also the political aspects. Not even the president can cast doubts on the government in the international political arena and, at the same time, interfere in its powers. There is a lot that one can criticize in these relations, and a lot more of what Ivan Gasparovic, chairman of the National Council of the Slovak Republic, has disclosed so far. [Smolec] You must certainly have analyzed your approach to date. Which steps in your decisionmaking do you consider erroneous, which do you intend to correct? To pass on the critical comments of our readers, they do not like the fact that, now and then, you react very impulsively. Your vigor is well known, but you can be also very benevolent, as you were, for instance, to the most recent visitors from Hungary (Sandor Lezsak of the Hungarian Democratic Forum). If, by his impertinent comments, a visitor interferes in the internal affairs of Slovakia, he should be taken by the collar, shown the border, and ordered never to come back. We must speak more about the demands and rights of the Slovaks in southern Slovakia. [Meciar] We have not made any substantial changes in the strategy. We could have harmonized the steps in certain critical issues differently. One example is the economic sphere. Another question is what disposable resources we had to make such corrections. We have made some mistakes in personnel work, and it should be openly admitted what these mistakes were--Knazko, Filkus, Cernak. I react only in certain specific situations beyond the limit of endurance or the limits of objective truth. Some people might not like the form but, for God's sake, they cannot demand that I should be liked by everyone. Regarding the questions of relations between the Slovaks and the Hungarians, I do not believe that we made a mistake. The opposite. The government has a concept and is implementing it. The government submitted bills to the National Council of the Slovak Republic and kept all of its promises. If these bills were not passed in parliament, it is not the government's business. Proposals different from the government ones came to parliament from the president's roundtable. That was, in essence, the beginning of the split in the parliament. It was forgotten that the legislative initiative belongs to the government or a deputy, but not a roundtable. Regarding the southern region of Slovakia, we must corroborate that Slovakia is our common home. We are building good relations and mutual respect among the citizens. No assimilation of Hungarians is taking place in Slovakia, and nothing like that is planned. The Slovaks in nationally mixed regions must be supported just as much as the Hungarians. They must not be worse off. [Smolec] In his book The History of the 20th Century, Paul Johnson considers the economic miracle of the West the most important event of the century. Approximately 300 million people attained tremendous wealth over just 35 years. The credit for this belongs, above all, to politicians with authoritarian tendencies: Adenauer, de Gasperi, de Gaulle. At a time of transition, such politicians are literally indispensable. You indicate, by answering in all seriousness the questions of a journalistic ignoramus with hooligan tendencies, for instance, that you reject all authoritarian forms of government. You even let yourself be insulted. Will that not lead to your adversaries taking ever greater liberties? [Meciar] In a democracy, power can be given to a single person, but never so much that it could no longer be taken away from that person. There have been instances of this in history. Is there such a situation in Slovakia today? I do not think so. Regarding communication, everyone defends himself to his limit of jeopardy. This limit of jeopardy, then, is perceived differently by each person, and he or she chooses the means of protection accordingly. I do not feel threatened. Therefore, I even talk to a journalistic ignoramus. I refuse to use violent coercive methods to deal with political problems. It is you journalists who should be dealing with infractions of journalistic ethics. [Smolec] A politician occasionally finds himself in a situation in which he must take on what is called historic responsibility. When have you been in such a situation? [Meciar] I remember the situation in December 1992, when all of the political parties, with the exception of the Slovak National Party, refused to support us. We needed to get three votes in the Federal Assembly in the final ballot on the demise of the federation. They asked, "Who will take the responsibility?" I got up then and said, "I take this responsibility upon myself." There are times when it must be done. I remember how the responsibility frightened even some members of the HZDS delegation to Jihlava. In effect, they left me all alone. I had more work with our own delegation than with the Czech party. Under psychological pressure and with the Czech ultimatum they retreated too far. It was necessary, then, to take personal responsibility. Following the emergence of the state, there was no state structure. It was necessary to build it, and, of course, bear the responsibility. We have now reached the stage at which this structure is being implemented. Every state, every community, every interest group should choose personalities capable of representing and defending their interests. If the personalities are removed, only the mediocre will remain. If an authoritative decision is to be made, and if the situation requires it, again, I will not hesitate. It is always necessary to consider the time and the means. For a long time now, it has not been valid that sordid means are justified by holy ends. [8 Feb p 4] [Text] We Need Democracy Rather Than "Democratizers" [Smolec] For how much longer will the enterprises depend solely on the government and not on their own management? Jefferson said that the best government is the one that governs least. [Meciar] The people themselves are feeling the direct effects of the extent of the changes. Everyone feels that a fundamental change is taking place. A gradual improvement was assumed in 1989, and the systemic change was not expected. Let us not forget that the change is taking place at a time of an economic crisis, the collapse and creation of new markets, and the collapse and creation of a new system of economic cooperation. These are the external factors. Within society, it is not just the emergence of the state but also the change of economic conditions. We have inherited 89 billion [korunas] of enterprise insolvency, a government budget deficit, inefficient state administration, and a shortage of various operations that are necessary for a functioning economic process. Therefore, it is only logical that many enterprises are waiting for the state to implement its policy. On the other hand, any policy or change in the macrostructure is predestined to fail if it is not accompanied by changes in the microstructure--i.e., by changes in the community or enterprise. After all, each enterprise has its own changes. There are changes in the management structure, behavioral changes, and adjustments to become a competitive enterprise of the market type, which is something completely different from the enterprises in a centrally planned economy. We do not have people trained for this. They are learning on the job. That is very costly for us. The relationship between the enterprise sphere and the economic sphere of the state must be a balanced one. [Smolec] History has confirmed that every society that wants to expand its freedom must make certain that it is not done at the expense of duties and responsibility. In our country, unfortunately, freedom has often been confused with anarchy. [Meciar] The freedom of action, the freedom of cognition is always limited by the limits of the freedom of another person. Under the pretext of freedom, numerous mistakes have been made in showing lack of respect for other people and violating their rights, and by increasing violence. That is not good. We need democracy rather than "democratizers." Freedom and discipline are natural sisters of the same mother. The respect for one's own freedom means to respect the freedom of others. Self-discipline is the ability to respect certain socially accepted rules. The expressions of anarchism of the type "Everything is allowed" and "You can do anything" are an expression of a lower standard of political culture, ignorance of social processes, and deformation of democracy. These "democratizers" exist. Just see how they gloat. Their ego is always above anyone else, and the value of their interests is higher than the value of interests of other people. [Smolec] With the Western style of life, unaccustomed crime, corruption, and fear came to Slovakia. The streets are controlled by criminals, Mafia. It is rumored that the ranks of the incorruptible (politicians and policemen) are thinning fast. What does the government intend to do in this respect? [Meciar] I have appealed to the citizens with the "clean hands" initiative. It is not a single action but rather an entire set of measures. The institutions that are founded must be capable of such cleanliness. It is true that precisely because politocracy is being replaced by the financial oligarchy and power of money that many people began to gauge the values of life by the value of money. The koruna expresses an economic relation, however, and not a human value. Human values should be the dominant ones. Corruption is a serious social ailment. It is necessary to fight it by creating a suitable social atmosphere and legislative rules. To be frank, I must admit that, from the vantage point of the atmosphere, we have not been successful. You can see that I am mostly attacked precisely from these "get-rich-quick" circles. Trying to hide it would be useless. The extent of contacts, links of numerous politicians to these interest spheres, is so large that I am not even certain whether they always act of their own will. Regarding the issue of measures, the government submitted to the National Council of the Slovak Republic a draft of principles of the law on conflict of interests. We will see what the stand of the parliament will be. A new law on the police was adopted. The financial police was established. We are building customs offices, taxation offices, and other institutions. The taxation offices have already begun to actively seek and prosecute dishonest methods of getting rich. This struggle probably cannot ever be completely won, but it is necessary to reduce the extent of it. [Smolec] You are not only the Slovak prime minister but also the HZDS chairman. Certain circles in Slovakia have been reckoning recently, both under cover and openly, that a road to the formation of a "broad coalition government" could be opened by splitting the HZDS, by dividing its Deputies' Club, and subsequently selecting a "suitable" person from this movement for the post of prime minister. Is it only wishful thinking, or do you admit at least some basis for such speculation? [Meciar] The attack that is currently led against me has a somewhat different background from before. It is guided by the idea that the HZDS without Meciar would be a less dangerous partner in the event of elections, or, rather, it would not be dangerous at all. It is also reckoned that the conceivable removal of the HZDS chairman will lead to the emergence of several factions. By its disintegration, the movement that today represents a genuine great political power would actually clear space for the Party of the Democratic Left, or it would facilitate an improvement in the status of the Christian Democrats. The notions of cooperation, when the opposition calls "Broad coalition yes, but without Meciar" could cause a reaction of "Broad coalition yes, but without Weiss, without Carnogursky." Is that in order? It is sick! We cannot demand that one movement give up its representatives in favor of representatives of another movement. The formation of factions in the Deputies' Club or a division of the Deputies' Club is one of frequent topics. It is obvious that it cannot be done from without. I am sorry that the president is conducting great consultations in this respect with some National Council of the Slovak Republic deputies and recommending specific alternatives. The HZDS has remained a viable and democratic institution. It must decide for itself what it will do. True, the speculation is continuing. [Smolec] In conclusion, Mr. Prime Minister, I would like to present to you a proposal or, rather, a plea of the REPUBLIKA readers. They suggest that you and also other members of the Cabinet regularly answer their questions. Will you comply with this plea? [Meciar] REPUBLIKA literally fills a great gap in our newspaper market and its offerings. After all, there were hardly any papers that would seek objectivity. REPUBLIKA has reached, in this respect, not only awareness but also the journalistic culture. Therefore, I will be glad to take the opportunity and be the first to answer the readers' questions. Moreover, I am convinced that other members of the Cabinet will be glad to accept the offer of cooperation with REPUBLIKA. * * * EDITOR IN CHIEF's NOTE: As you see, dear readers, while we were copying the interview and preparing it for publication, new and even more dramatic events accumulated. Take the opportunity provided by the prime minister's promise and send your questions on current topical issues to the address of the REPUBLIKA editorial office as soon as possible.
