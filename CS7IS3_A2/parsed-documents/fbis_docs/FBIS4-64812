The first, of course, is the issue of Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] with the prolonged impasse over ways to solve it within the framework of the United Nations. Second, there is the issue of Greek-Albanian relations, which deteriorated despite the Greek Government's intention to the contrary. On the issue of Skopje, the government is attempting a spectacular turn in the negotiating process without so far facing any serious objection or trouble by the opposition parties, or by a large part of the Greek public. This means the government appears willing and ready to discuss, still under Cyrus Vance's auspices, the issue of Skopje in its entirety, in one phase, including the final name, and of course under two conditions: - The Greek countermeasures will remain in effect. - Possible secondary agreements during the negotiations will not depend on the achievement of an overall agreement on the issue, which will include a solution to the name issue. This spectacular turn attempted by the Greek Government--which was considered almost "inconceivable" not long ago--was helped during the prime minister's talks at the White House. From the two leaders' official statements after their long private talks, it became evident that the two sides agree that there should be a new way to "approach" the issue, so that the differences between Athens and Skopje will smooth out and the negotiating process will be maintained. [passage omitted] With the new process formula under discussion, both sides could maintain the maximum of their demands. FYROM President Kiro Gligorov could claim that his demand for negotiations on all issues has been accepted, while Athens could insist on the implementation of its measures until Skopje meets the conditions it has set (constitution-flag-propaganda) before lifting them. The "secret" of this approach--if it is finally adopted--is that it offers Gligorov all the time he needs until the critical, for him, elections in the fall, while at the same time it allows Athens to maintain an active, but more relaxed, process of negotiations in New York. It is more than obvious that Athens seeks relaxation in the issue of Skopje, since a swift solution of the issue is not possible. On the contrary, and despite its desires, the Greek Government faces a serious deterioration in its relations with Tirana that does not appear about to subside as long as Albanian President Sali Berisha's side systematically attempts unilateral provocations, which, however, for the time being fall flat. The recent meeting in Zurich between Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Albanian counterpart Alfred Serreqi did not produce anything substantial toward diffusion of the crisis. Tirana's official statements and Berisha's remarks prove that the Albanian Government attempts, at least orally, to present Greece as the number one "threat" to its security. Furthermore, it insists on superficial diplomatic acts on the international scene which have already been absorbed and which have led foreign governments friendly to Tirana to "advise" it to decrease its offensive tones toward Athens. Despite all that, Tirana appears determined to "play with Athens' nerves" by exerting obvious pressure on the Greek minority but also with disguised, but perhaps very serious, pressure on the Albanian Orthodox Church and especially on Archbishop Anastasios. Maybe Tirana's continued provocative stance does not target the Greek Government, which does not seem willing to depart from its very calm policy toward Albania. It possibly targets the "sensitive nerves" of the opposition parties such as New Democracy and Political Spring. "Angry" or even extreme statements and reaction by opposition parties will give Tirana the opportunity to claim that the current government's calm policy is not a stable factor in Greece's policy toward Albania, and therefore Tirana has every reason to "be afraid" of the future regarding the Greek intentions toward it. The tour by Miltiadhis Evert, official opposition and New Democracy chairman, to the Greek minority areas of Albania [7-8 May] will perhaps be a very good opportunity to reject and dispel all the above claims by Tirana. Anyway, prior to his tour in Albania, Evert had an in-depth, but also "discreet" briefing by the Foreign Ministry.
