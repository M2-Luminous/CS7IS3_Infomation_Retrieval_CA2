If Pyongyang does not accept the international inspection of its nuclear cites before 21 February, sanctions can follow, said ROK Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. A Board of Governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] will be held on 21 February in Vienna. The meeting is expected to adopt a resolution on sanctions to be referred to the UN Security Council for deliberation. In this connection, station commentator Valeriy Surikov writes: The situation on the Korean peninsula is deteriorating these days. The three parties, namely, Washington, Seoul, and Pyongyang, are responsible for it. For instance, the United States and the ROK are planning to resume the Team Spirit--the large-scale annual joint military exercise--this year. Pyongyang regards the Team Spirit ROK-U.S. joint military exercise as an exercise aimed at northward invasion. Furthermore, the Pentagon is attempting to deploy Patriot anti-missile missiles in the ROK and even to bring back tactical nuclear weapons there. This attempt will only adversely affect the situation on the Korean peninsula, giving rise to a very negative reaction from the Pyongyang side. In the meantime, the measures taken by Pyongyang these days are not contributing to the alleviation of tension either. Pyongyang made a principled promise last December that it would permit international inspection of its nuclear sites. Nevertheless, the IAEA has not received a reply on materializing the nuclear inspection. Moreover, the DPRK stated that it could withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and give up negotiations with the IAEA by reason of the Team Spirit military exercise. A spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry has recently issued a statement clarifying the Russian position. Moscow claims that since there is still an opportunity to resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula by diplomatic means, the problem should be solved through talks. Not many days are left before 21 February. However, all the parties concerned have enough time to ponder about the right and wrong of the problem. There is still time and opportunity to find a reasonable solution. It is time they fully operated the institution of talks, rather than of pressure.
