Bratislava NARODNA OBRODA in Slovak on 3 February on page 13 carries a 500-word Bohumil Olach report entitled "Will There Be a Referendum Against Knazko's Followers?" The report includes the following passage: "In the first round of replies to questions from the audience, the prime minister said that he will not hold talks on collective rights for the Hungarian minority because, in Cyprus, too, it once started with collective rights and ultimately led to a war between Turkey and Greece. He who feels bad here is absolutely free to leave, he said, for which he earned great applause. He also touched on the differences of views between the government and the president on some issues. He said, for example, that it is not good when the president and the government both push for their own version of the law on names and surnames. The opposition operates with the cliche that everything will be better without Meciar, he continued. The president has called for the formation of a multicolor government, but the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] is ready to talk [about joining the government coalition] only when there will be early elections. The Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] and the Alliance of Democrats [AD] only want an agreement without Meciar. "And the president said that they must be accommodated," the prime minister added. "The president was awarded with `Phooey!' and the chanting of `Shame!' from a group of enraged women in the left corner of the audience in front of the stage. No one made an attempt to silence them." Bratislava PRAVDA in Slovak on 3 February on page 3 carries a 500-word Martin Krno report entitled "Our Mr. Meciar." The PRAVDA correspondent observes that, in addition to the "traditional" criticism of "the Hungarians, the Czechs, the correspondents, the head of state, and the opposition," the participants in the rally "heard also something new from the prime minister's mouth. According to the prime minister, the ruling movement is increasingly consolidated. If parliament does not approve a law under which all `disobedient' deputies must surrender their seats, a referendum will decide on this issue. Three large electoral blocs are taking shape, the prime minister said: 1. The SDL, Social Democrats, and farmers; 2. The KDH, Conservative Democratic Party, and Knazko's followers; and 3. The HZDS, together with the anti-Cernak part of the Slovak National Party, Klepac's Christian Social Union (frenetic applause), and, possibly, the Greens. It goes without saying that this last bloc will be victorious again." Bratislava REPUBLIKA in Slovak on 3 February on page 2 carries a 300-word TA SR report entitled "Vladimir Meciar: Devaluation Is Not Being Prepared." According to the report, Meciar told the meeting of 2,000 Bratislava residents that "no devaluation is being prepared, fares will not go up, and the government will do everything within its power to accelerate the sale of [community-owned] apartments into citizens' private ownership." He reportedly also "rejected speculations that the government might tender its resignation and denied reports that he is divorcing his wife."
