For the most part, it is like the agreement concluded with Finland last week, but there are better terms for the most vulnerable sector of the foodstuffs industry as well as regarding the scale of the permanent subsidy arrangements. "We can give extra support to 85 percent of the country. The measures we pushed through for [the area] north of the 62d degree of latitude we can also give to large parts of southern Norway, including parts of Hedmark and Oppland, the northernmost parts of Buskerud and Telemark, the mountainous areas of Agder and Rogaland, and substantial parts of Sogn og Fjordane, and Hordaland." Districts Safeguarded "This is a good agreement for Norway, one which safeguards what we sought to achieve all along. Employment and settlement in the regions has been safeguarded," said Gunhild Oyangen. The agriculture minister also said that she is happy with the agreements reached on the foodstuffs industry. Norway and the EU agreed on a declaration that makes provision for Norway to request the European Commission to impose a ceiling on imports of manufactured agricultural products. The condition is that documentary evidence can be provided that free imports from other EU countries are actually hindering the healthy reorganization of the Norwegian foodstuffs industry. This applies to meat, flour, canned products, animal feed, and most dairy products. These measures will be available for use over a three-year period. During this time, support for restructuring will also be given. "These measures will give us sufficient time to reorganize. And the important thing is that we have won understanding for our `better safe than sorry' principle," said Oyangen. Before the agreement had been approved, none of the Norwegian negotiators had wanted to be quoted as saying that Norway had achieved a better deal than Finland as regards protection for its foodstuffs industry. Nevertheless they indicated that they had something positive to bring home. Understanding Earlier yesterday, the minister of agriculture said that she was far from displeased with the attitude she had encountered in Brussels: "I would like to say that there are many here in Brussels who know more about Norwegian agriculture -- and have a greater respect for it -- than many Norwegians." Yesterday Gunhild Oyangen was able to present a far more detailed agreement than the Finns could last week. For Finland, it has been unclear all along how the safety clause for the foodstuffs industry was meant to work. This Finnish solution, which Norway was initially expected to receive a virtually identical copy of, was met by a storm of protests from the Norwegian foodstuffs industry. Gunhild Oyangen was given rough treatment when she returned home unable to point to Norwegian solutions that were better in practice than the Finnish ones. Over the last few days in Brussels, she and her negotiators have fought tooth and nail to gain some improvements. "It was extremely necessary for Norway to secure durable solutions, because the EU's agricultural policy is not adapted to the circumstances in Norway," said Gunhild Oyangen. She noted with satisfaction that the EU has changed its agricultural policy as a result of the enlargement negotiations.
