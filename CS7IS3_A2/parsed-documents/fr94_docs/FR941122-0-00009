FR941122-0-00009 FR941122-0-00004 The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. This order of termination is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Memphis, Tennessee, marketing area. Notice of proposed rulemaking was published in the Federal Register on April 27, 1993 (58 FR 25576), concerning a proposed termination of the remaining provisions of the order. Interested persons were afforded opportunity to file written data, views and arguments thereon. Several comments were received. After consideration of all relevant material, including the proposal in the notice, the comments received, and other available information, it is hereby found and determined that ยง1097.1 of the order does not tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. Statement of Consideration This rule terminates the remaining administrative provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, Federal milk order. A public hearing that considered proposed amendments to all Federal milk orders was held in September, October, and November 1990, pursuant to notice thereof issued July 11, 1990 (55 FR 29034). Following the issuance of a recommended decision and the opportunity for filing exceptions, the Acting Assistant Secretary for Marketing and Inspection Services on February 5, 1993, issued a final decision on the issues considered at the hearing. In a referendum held following the issuance of the final decision, the proposed amended Memphis order was not approved by at least two-thirds of the order's producers who voted. The Act requires that an order, as amended, be approved by at least two-thirds of the producers who voted in the referendum or by producers who, during the representative period, produced at least two-thirds of the volume of milk marketed. On the basis of the record of the public hearing, the comments received in response to the proposed termination of Order 97, and the results of the producer referendum, the Department issued a termination order, effective midnight July 31, 1993. The order terminated the monthly operating provisions of the Memphis, Tennessee, order, but left intact certain administrative provisions that were embodied, by reference, in ยง1097.1 of the order. The market administrator, in his capacity as the order's liquidating agent, has completed the disbursement of all of the money remaining in the administrative, producer-settlement, and marketing service funds established under the order. Hence, the remaining provisions of the order should be terminated. Therefore, the aforesaid provisions of ยง1097.1 of the order are hereby terminated. It is hereby found and determined that thirty days' notice of the effective date hereof is impractical, unnecessary and contrary to the public interest in that: (a) The termination is necessary to reflect current marketing conditions and to assure orderly marketing conditions in the marketing area; (b) This termination does not require of persons affected substantial or extensive preparation prior to the effective date; and (c) Notice of proposed rulemaking was given interested parties and they were afforded opportunity to file written data, views or arguments concerning this termination. Therefore, good cause exists for making this order effective upon publication in the Federal Register . List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1097 Milk marketing orders. For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the following provisions in Title 7, Part 1097, are amended as follows: PART 1097_MILK IN THE MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, MARKETING AREA 1.
