FR940705-2-00157 FR940705-2-00090 Equipment or material that might be damaged by high temperatures or steam shall be decontaminated by gaseous or vapor methods in an airlock or chamber designed for this purpose. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-b-(5). When ventilated suits are required, the animal personnel shower entrance/exit area shall be equipped with a chemical disinfectant shower to decontaminate the surface of the suit before exiting the area. A neutralization or water dilution device shall be integral with the chemical disinfectant discharge piping before entering the heat sterilization system. Entry to this area shall be through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-b-(6). Needles and syringes shall be promptly placed in a puncture-resistant container and decontaminated, preferably by autoclaving, before discard or reuse. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-b-(7). Supplies and materials needed in the animal facility shall be brought in by way of the double-door autoclave, fumigation chamber, or airlock that shall be appropriately decontaminated between each use. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-b-(8). An autoclave, incinerator, or other effective means to decontaminate animals and wastes shall be available, preferably within the containment area. If feasible, a double-door autoclave is preferred and should be positioned to allow removal of material from the containment area. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-b-(9). Liquid effluent from containment equipment, sinks, biological safety cabinets, animal rooms, primary barriers, floor drains, and sterilizers shall be decontaminated by heat treatment before being released into the sanitary system. Liquid wastes from shower rooms and toilets shall be decontaminated with chemical disinfectants or heat by methods demonstrated to be effective. The procedure used for heat decontamination of liquid wastes shall be monitored with a recording thermometer. The effectiveness of the heat decontamination process system shall be revalidated every 30 days with an indicator organism. Liquid wastes from the shower shall be chemically decontaminated using an Environmental Protection Agency-approved germicide. The efficacy of the chemical treatment process shall be validated with an indicator organism. Chemical disinfectants shall be neutralized or diluted before release into general effluent waste systems. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-c. Signs (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-c-(1). When the animal research requires special provisions for entry (e.g., vaccination), a warning sign incorporating the universal biosafety symbol shall be posted on all access doors to the animal work area. The sign shall indicate: (i) The agent, (ii) the animal species, (iii) the name and telephone number of the Animal Facility Director, or other responsible individual, and (iv) any special requirements for entering the laboratory. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-d. Protective Clothing (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-d-(1). Individuals shall enter and exit the animal facility only through the clothing change and shower rooms. Street clothing shall be removed and kept in the outer clothing change room. Complete laboratory clothing (may be disposable), including undergarments, pants, shirts, jump suits, and shoes shall be provided for all personnel entering the animal facility. When exiting the BL4&hyph;N area and before proceeding into the shower area, personnel shall remove their laboratory clothing in the inner change room. All laboratory clothing shall be autoclaved before laundering. Personnel shall shower each time they exit the animal facility. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-d-(2). A ventilated head-hood or a one-piece positive pressure suit, which is ventilated by a life-support system, shall be worn by all personnel entering rooms that contain experimental animals when appropriate. When ventilated suits are required, the animal personnel shower entrance/exit area shall be equipped with a chemical disinfectant shower to decontaminate the surface of the suit before exiting the area. A neutralization or water dilution device shall be integral with the chemical disinfectant discharge piping before entering the heat sterilization system. Entry to this area shall be through an airlock fitted with airtight doors. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-d-(3). Appropriate respiratory protection shall be worn in rooms containing experimental animals. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-e. Records (BL4&hyph;N) Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-e-(1). Documents regarding experimental animal use and disposal shall be maintained in a permanent record book. Appendix Q-II-D&hyph;1-e-(2). A system shall be established for: (i) Reporting laboratory accidents and exposures that are a result of overt exposures to organisms containing recombinant DNA, (ii) employee absenteeism, and (iii) medical surveillance of potential laboratory-associated illnesses. Permanent records shall be prepared and maintained. Any incident involving spills and accidents that results in environmental release or exposures of animals or laboratory workers to organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall be reported immediately to the Biological Safety Officer, Animal Facility Director, Institutional Biosafety Committee, NIH/ORDA, and other appropriate authorities (if applicable). Reports to the NIH/ORDA shall be sent to the Office of Recombinant DNA Activities, National Institutes of Health, Building 31, Room 4B11, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, (301) 496&hyph;9838. Medical evaluation, surveillance, and treatment shall be provided as appropriate and written records maintained. If necessary, the area shall be appropriately decontaminated.
