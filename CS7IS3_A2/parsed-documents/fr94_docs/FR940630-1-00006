ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM). SUMMARY: Numerous accidents and incidents attributed to turbocharger failure has prompted the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to more thoroughly investigate the conditions related to these accidents. Improper or lack of pilot action following the turbocharger failures may have contributed to many of the accidents and incidents. In order to adequately make a determination as to what type of action to take (if any), the FAA is issuing this advance notice to seek comments from interested persons regarding possible problems with airplanes equipped with turbocharged engines. The FAA will evaluate all comments and ideas and then research the situation to decide whether rulemaking is needed. DATES: Comments must be received on or before September 23, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;11&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.

Discussion From January 1986 to May 1993, the FAA received 580 service difficulty reports relating to failures of turbocharger systems on airplanes equipped with turbocharged engines. A study of a five-year time period (January 1988 through May 1993) reveals 88 accidents and incidents, resulting in 35 injuries and 6 deaths. Several reports of these accidents, incidents, and service difficulties indicate problems with installation, inspection, maintenance, service, or overhaul. After accomplishing a thorough review of these failures, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) notes that improper pilot action following the turbocharger malfunction or failure may have been a contributing factor in many of the accidents and incidents. Numerous airplane manufacturers do not provide written procedures addressing turbocharger failures. Section 23.1585 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 23.1585) consists of the following: For each airplane, information concerning normal and emergency procedures and other pertinent information necessary to safe operation must be furnished, including, *␣*␣*
