FBIS4-27626 "dreas106_d_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-106 Daily Report 1 Jun 1994 South Korea IAEA Official: DPRK Changed Over 60% of Rods IAEA Official: DPRK Changed Over 60% of Rods SK0206000594 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network in Korean 2205 GMT 1 Jun 94 SK0206000594 Seoul KBS-1 Radio Network Korean BFN [By Cha Man-sun from Vienna] [Text] An official of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] said that approximately 5,000 of the 8,000 nuclear fuel rods at a five-megawatt nuclear reactor in Yongbyon have already been replaced. The official said: In the past 25 days, North Korea has already changed approximately 5,000 -- over 60 percent -- of the 8,000 nuclear feul rods at the nuclear reactor. It continued changing the feul rods even yesterday, when the IAEA called upon North Korea not to do so. He added: In the initial stages of replacing the fuel rods, at least 300 fuel rods must be analyzed to verify the amount of nuclear materials that may have been transformed. However, with less than 3,000 nuclear fuel rods remaining, the results are unreliable. Also, IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that because IAEA inspectors could not confirm the location of approximately 40 fuel rods -- which North Korea says it has separately preserved -- and because the location of the removed fuel rods has not been disclosed, taking samples from them would not be worthwhile.
