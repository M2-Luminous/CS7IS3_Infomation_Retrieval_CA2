Far from abandoning the chosen course, we shall seek to step up the pace of reforms," Russian Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said in an interview with the CNN TV company in Davos (Switzerland) on Monday [31 January]. The Russian premier attends the World Economic Forum there. He said that Russia is now facing "difficult problems in the economy". "We know these problems and know what we should do to tackle them," Chernomyrdin stressed. "The main thing now is to focus on these problems and to remove them professionally," he added. "No matter what rumours are now spread in and outside Russia about the policy pursued by the government, I'd like to say that we shall not go astray from the course of reforms," Chernomyrdin stressed. "The advance towards democracy and market relations in our country is irreversible." Speaking of the recent resignation by Vice-Premier Yegor Gaydar and Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Chernomyrdin noted that "the departure of some members from the cabinet will not affect the strategic line pursued by the Russian leadership". "Chernomyrdin was and remains the cabinet head," he said. "There are no grounds for panic now. I'm developing an impression that some politicians alleging a departure from economic reforms, would like this to happen in real fact. "They evidently want the government to change its course to turn the clock back. I'd like to say that this will not happen. The appearance of new people in the cabinet will not lead to abandoning the plotted course. "We are heavily panned now for committed mistakes. We chose the democratic way of development and are now following it. This is the main thing. Sure, it is difficult for us, and we make mistakes. We are pursuing a new policy in a new country." Chernomyrdin said during the interview that he fully trusts Central Bank Governor Viktor Gerashchenko. "Gerashchenko is a career banker with good reputation, name and style of work," the cabinet head noted. "I cannot say that he does not support the policy of the leadership and interferes with reforms. Gerashchenko knows well the country's problems and what to do to resolve them. "I have no doubts about his high qualifications and know that he supports reforms. If Gerashchenko starts to interfere with our work, I'll be the first to insist on his resignation. I believe that this will not be the case." "The Central Bank is now doing precisely what the government and the president recommend it to do," the premier continued. "If new bills are being printed, the decision is taken by the government and not by the bank. "In this connection, I'd like to note that all the decisions on monetary and finance matters taken by the government in 1993 were agreed with the International Monetary Fund. The task facing us in 1994 is as follows: to maintain the level of inflation in the country at the level of under 20 per cent per month. "Russia has huge debts to pay to major industrial enterprises. However, we do not plan to pay them fully. We are unable to do this now. Many in Russia want the Chernomyrdin government to print more banknotes and issue credits. We shall not do this under any circumstances." "All of us should now do our utmost to start working in good earnest and produce goods in Russia," stated the cabinet head. "We can start the process of economic renovation only in this way. We are now facing spectacular tasks, the implementation of which will naturally provoke a negative response from some segments of population. "It is important for us at this critical moment to prevent the rise of nationalist leaders of the Vladimir Zhirinovskiy type. We have no right to permit this happen."
