The police deployment, which includes vehicle checks, was prompted by the National Transportation Commission (CNT), which said it will stage a huge march with 5,000 vehicles that will gather in Managua tomorrow to continue the protest against the government. Although the government has released more than 200 drivers who had been arrested in the past operations in Managua, the CNT, which called the strike, this weekend rejected the way four transportation organizations made "deals" with the government, causing them to be labeled "traitors" by the CNT. The city newspapers published reports on Managua's militarization, noting there are few cases in which street corners and crossings are not guarded by policemen who are armed with Soviet AKA rifles and ammunition, giving the impression they are going to war. Many policemen are driving state vehicles, including Transportation and Construction Ministry vehicles. [passage omitted]
