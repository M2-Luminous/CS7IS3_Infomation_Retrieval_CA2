They represent the command group, which includes the base of the organization's military wing in the central region, and the officials in charge of surveillance, finance, liaison, and implementation. In the security campaigns, seven modern vehicles of various types were seized. One of those cars was used in the assassination of martyr Major General Ra'uf Khayrat in al-Haram on 9 April and another in the attack against the officers of Abu Za'bal prison on 26 March, when explosive charges were thrown at them on the Cairo-Ismailia agricultural road. When residences of members of the command and implementation groups were searched, large amounts of explosive, chemical, and incendiary materials were found along with some sketches and information about officials on the assassination list and some cash. The source said the operation was part of activity by the State Security Intelligence following the death of Tal'at Yasin Hammam, the leader of the terrorist groups. Security operations were developed using information and seized organizational papers about all recent terrorist activities. The source said that in light of information gathered from close surveillance of some terrorists abroad and their contacts inside the country, the State Security Intelligence managed to define the general picture of the terrorists' activity and of certain internal organizations trying to support those terrorists and push them to implement their various operations. Acting on this information, the source explained, the State Security Intelligence, assisted by the various investigative agencies, continued to implement its security plan to arrest the remaining terrorist groups that by their acts are trying to prove they still exist in the country. The source said that the operation was also based on the intensive investigations and accurate monitoring carried out by the State Security Intelligence after receiving permission from the chief public attorney and in coordination with antiterrorism forces and the various criminal investigation agencies. The official security source said that, still backed by the permission of the High State Security Prosecution Office, the security forces extended the arrest operations to include those responsible for liaison and conveying assignments from the leaders of the organization inside prisons to leaders outside. It became certain that this liaison mission was carried out by two lawyers who used their profession to serve their secret organizational activities. One of these is lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Muhammad Ibrahim Madani, who was arrested and accused in connection with several extremist cases in Isna in the Governorate of Qina. Investigations and seized organizational documents proved that he was also in charge of financing the organization from funds he received from the leader of these groups, Tal'at Muhammad Yasin Hammam. The source said the suspect distributed sums amounting to 45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000. The security source pointed out that this suspect is one of the dangerous terrorist elements that played a prominent role in the recent terrorist acts. He was arrested on 3 July 1990 for his dangerous activity in the terrorist groups, and in the same year he, along with others, were charged with attacking citizens in Isna and preventing them from visiting cemeteries. He was also accused in Case No. 4116 in 1991 in Isna, when he was arrested for distributing leaflets promoting extremist thought and inciting violence. The source said the High State Security Prosecution issued a warrant for his arrest for his involvement in Case No. 235 of 1994, concerning the military wing of the terrorist groups organization, which is currently being examined. The security source said that the defendants told State Security Prosecution investigators that Madani was their link to the group's leader, Hammam. Madani was also in charge of communication between the group's imprisoned and free leaders, a task he performed under cover of his work as a lawyer and on the orders of Hammam. The source said that the defendants' confessions also show that Madani was in charge of the finances of the group. Investigators have learned of seven instances in which Madani received funds from abroad totalling 45,000 Egyptian pounds and $3,000. The entire sum was used to finance the group's terrorist activities. Security forces arrested Madani on the night of 26 April at his office in al-Haram, the source said. They took him along as they searched his home in al-Talibiyah in al-Haram. There security sources seized documents and other material. While the security forces were leading Madani to his second residence in Warraq al-'Arab, which they intended to search, he experienced difficulty in breathing and lost consciousness. He was instantly taken to the al-Manyal al-Jami'i hospital for treatment, where doctors diagnosed his case as severe asthma and kept him in the hospital for treatment. The next day, 27 April, the hospital notified us that the defendant had died of lung failure, a complication of severe asthma, the source said. The security source added that the State Security Intelligence forces continued to act on the information they had already gathered. Acting in cooperation with other security organs, they prepared plans to raid 25 hideouts of the military wing of the extremist terrorist groups in farm and mountain areas in the Asyut and Suhaj Governorates. In these hideouts, the security forces seized four automatic weapons, a pistol, 1,600 7.62-mm rounds, 300 9-mm rounds, 18 kg of TNT, 29 detonators, six timers, and electric wiring devices. The raids also led to the arrest of the deputy leader of the military wing of the terrorist groups in south Egypt. The officials in charge of communications and accommodations were also arrested. So was a group of terrorists wanted by police in connection with 40 terrorist attacks against police officials, trains, and Nile cruise boats in south Egypt. The defendants have been referred to the competent prosecution offices. The individuals who were arrested in these raids confessed to involvement in the assassination of Asyut Security Commander Brigadier General Shirin 'Ali Fahmi; and Lieutenant Colonel Mustafa Khalil Tuni and First Lieutenant Zaki Bahjat, both of the Asyut Security Department. They also admitted involvement in the attack on Bank Abu-Tij in Asyut and the bombing in al-Bunuk Square in Asyut, according to the Interior Ministry source. The security source noted that as a result of these security operations against the leaders, cadres, and members of the terrorist elements, 98 leading figures have been arrested and approximately 500,000 Egyptian pounds have been seized. In addition, a Goryunov machine gun, five automatic weapons, three pistols, three Enfield automatic rifles, a Russian-made pistol, 25 FON [initials as received] bombs, a large quantity of live ammunition, 190 kg of highly explosive TNT, a large quantity of chemicals, ready-made explosive devices and tools and material for making them, fax machines, and wireless telephones have been seized. The source noted that the Higher State Security Prosecution Office is questioning the arrested defendants. Prosecutors have also inspected all the places and dens where the defendants were arrested and have seized all items found there as part of the investigations. The source pointed out that to maintain the confidentiality of the investigations, the State Security Intelligence has not announced the names of all the defendants since more arrests are being conducted. The source noted that investigations and surveillance operations are still underway to arrest the remaining terrorists still at large, who include the following important figures: Hasan Salih Hasan Mahmud, Hasan al-Sayyid Hamid Khayri, Mahmud Muhammad Sa'id Salim, Jamal 'Abd-al-Hamid 'Abd-al-Nasir, Hamadah Muhammad Lutfi 'Abd-al-Baqi, Rif'at Zaydan 'Abdallah, Islam Ahmad Muhammad Ibrahim al-Ghamri. In addition, there are other terrorist elements whose activities are being monitored abroad. The Interior Ministry appeals to citizens who have any information on these terrorists to report it to the nearest police station. It stresses that it is fully aware of all the activities by some quarters that are supporting terrorism in one way or another to serve their own interests. These quarters use some of the incidents that may occur in the course of the confrontation with terrorists as an opportunity to boost their own image among the masses. The ministry emphasizes that it will stand firmly and decisively against these quarters should they try to act against law and order under this cover, which only aims to create unrest among the masses. The source added that the Interior Ministry is keeping a close watch on the activities of the terrorist groups while adhering to its firm stances that abide by the law. It appreciates the people's support for its decisive confrontation with the criminal and terrorist elements targeting the nation. The ministry will announce within a few days the names of a number of arrested terrorists who have repented and renounced extremism and all forms of terrorist practices. While emphasizing this strong position, the Interior Ministry calls on the people to adhere to the principles of religion and denounce the terrorist acts that run contrary to the noble Islamic faith and undermine the march of economic reform, which seeks to serve the interests of the nation and its people.
