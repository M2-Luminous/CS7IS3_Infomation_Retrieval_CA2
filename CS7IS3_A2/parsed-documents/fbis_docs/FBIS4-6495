Ex-president of Costa Rica Rodrigo Carazo Odio, heading the group, said beautiful Korea and its industrious and valiant people gave them great inspiration and strength. He said he would make sustained efforts in the future for the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula. Former Egyptian Prime Minister Aziz Sedky stressed all the functions held in Korea this time on the occasion of the 82nd birthday of His Excellency President Kim Il-song well showed how high the international position of Korea is. "The Western clamour about your country's war preparations is a lie," he said, adding that the people of Korea are expediting peaceful construction, not war preparations. Senior Vice-president of the CNN International Eason Jordan said he was deeply concerned for the situation on the Korean peninsula when he was coming to Korea, but, his feelings of strain and apprehensions have evaporated while witnessing the life of the Korean people. Executive director of the summit council for World Peace Antonio Betancourt said he expresses deep thanks to the great President Kim Il-song and the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il for the warm hospitality accorded them. The Korean people are well aware of wherein their life lies, he said, and added that their life lies only in defending the ideology of the great leader and the dear leader and upholding their leadership.
