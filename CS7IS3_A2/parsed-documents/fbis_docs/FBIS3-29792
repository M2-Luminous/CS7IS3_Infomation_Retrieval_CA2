The case in this trial, which is preliminary as well as final, involves roundabout dealings with 4,000 tons of steel designed for the construction of the north-south 500-kilovolt powerline. These dealings caused 3.1 billion dong in losses to the state budget. This afternoon -- after two and a half days of interrogating the suspects, witnesses, and some relevant public organs -- Mr. Nguyen Tien Dam, a senior officer who represented the Supreme People's Organ of Control at the trial, presented a conviction report. Afterward, lawyers continued their defense of the suspects in this case. The court will continue its session on Monday, 21 February.
