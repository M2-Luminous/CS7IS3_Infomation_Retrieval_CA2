Their discussions centered on the theme of "reform, development and stability." Close attention was also given to the current difficulties in economic development, as well as the drawbacks of the government's work in 1993. During the discussions, heads of a number of local governments said that localities should conscientiously uphold the central authority and be subordinate to the economic macro-control of the state. Chen Huanyou, governor of the economically advanced Jiangsu Province in east China, called the country's reforms this year "an uphill battle," "having risks" and "being inevitable." In order to ensure the smooth progress of reforms, local governments must "act in line with the arrangements of the central government, serve and abide by the need of the country as a whole." "Localities must not go their own way beyond the central government's policies to pursue immediate or local interests," he said. Xu Yan, female major of Nantong city in Jiangsu, said that macro-control measures that the central government adopted in the latter half of last year have had satisfactory effects on ensuring a healthy economic growth. "The central government is far-sighted and appropriate in arranging its macro-control," she said. "Enterprises are enhancing their ability to adapt to these measures." Gu Jinchi, secretary of northeast China's Liaoning Provincial party committee, said that in order to ensure social stability while accelerating reform and economic growth, local governments have to promptly solve contradictions in the relations concerning interests sharing emerging from the process of reform. Meanwhile, they have to improve the living standards of the people and crackdown on crimes. Hui Liangyu, deputy secretary of the Hubei Provincial party committee, also voiced concern over poor economic efficiency, stagnant state-owned enterprises, "bottleneck" sectors of transport and energy, agricultural production and social stability. Delegates from the People's Liberation Army (PLA), who are divided into eight groups for discussion today, said that the army must carry out its tasks spelled out in Li Peng's government work report. Zhang Zhen, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, said that the Army has a two-pronged strategy to safeguard national security and social stability. Defense Minister Chi Haotian said that the Army will unswervingly support the country's drive to establish a socialist market economy and make every effort to create a reliable environment for reform and economic growth.
