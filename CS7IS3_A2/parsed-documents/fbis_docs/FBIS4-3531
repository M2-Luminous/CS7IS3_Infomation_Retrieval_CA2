The statement was made in a press release issued after a meeting between Christiane Scrivener, the EC commissioner for tariff affairs, and Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of the Chinese foreign trade and economic cooperation. During their meeting on Wednesday, Scrivener and Gu mainly exchanged views on China's re-entry into GATT. China, one of the founding parties of the world trade body, withdrew from it in 1949 and applied for re-entry in 1986. Scrivener told Gu that Chinese membership in GATT is "the way China must take toward a greater participation in the world trade wave." Therefore, the EC commissioner said, EC will support, as it always does, China's application for membership. However, she stressed that China needs to make "very clear commitments" to meet some "specific conditions" put forth by GATT before the re-entry.
