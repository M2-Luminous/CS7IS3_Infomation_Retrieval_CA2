FBIS4-6084 "dreas074__a94023" FBIS-EAS-94-074-A Daily Report 18 April 1994 ANNEX Japan MITI To Repeal 3 Export-Related Laws by 1997 MITI To Repeal 3 Export-Related Laws by 1997 OW1504134794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 14 Apr Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1504134794 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has decided to abolish three export-related acts, including the export inspection act and the export goods design act which control quality and design of export goods produced by Japanese firms, by the end of 1997. The decision will be incorporated in a basic guideline for a deregulation promotion program, which will be compiled by the government in June. The government adopted a system of controlling export goods in the late 1950's in an effort to promote credibility of Japanese products. However, it has decided to withdraw such regulation because quality of Japanese products has been improved. The government also intends to demonstrate the shift of its trade policies both at home and abroad by abolishing these acts which have been regarded as a symbol of joint efforts by the government and the private sector to promote exports. The three acts to be abolished are: the export inspection act; the export goods design act; and the unified trademark act on products of small export enterprises. Under the export inspection act, enterprises which export designated products are obligated to undergo inspection of quality of their products. The export goods design act requires registration of design and trademarks of export products. Under the unified trademark act on products of small export enterprises, the government formulates trademarks for products of small enterprises and guarantees quality of their goods. Firms which export designated products have to pay inspection and certification fees to inspection organs. MITI plans to hold a meeting of the Export-Import Transaction Council on 15 April and a meeting of the Export Inspection and Design Council in May to obtain their consent for its decision to abolish these three acts. It will promote coordination on plans to gradually decrease items subject to the export inspection act and the design act beginning this fiscal year and to submit a bill on abolishing these acts to an ordinary Diet session in 1997. A bill on abolishing the unified trademark act on products of small export enterprises will be incorporated in a package bill on deregulation which is to be submitted to the current Diet session.
