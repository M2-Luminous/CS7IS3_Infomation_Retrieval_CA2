Mikhail Demurin, deputy director of the Press and Information Directorate of the Russian foreign policy department, said this addressing a briefing today. He said that "one of the priorities in Russian foreign policy" at present was to assist in settling the Tajik conflict and to restore peace and calm in the country. In the diplomat's words, great importance is being attached to the continuation of the inter-Tajik talks that started with the Moscow round. The world's response to its results shows that "great hopes are being linked with the progress of the dialogue." Demurin stated with regret that this approach was not being shared by everyone--the recalcitrant part of the Tajik armed opposition, supported by Afghan mojahedins, is concentrating its forces on the border. This is increasing the danger of "large-scale hostilities," the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
