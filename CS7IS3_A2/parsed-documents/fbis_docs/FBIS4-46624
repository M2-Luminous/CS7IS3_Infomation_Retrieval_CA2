It made an attempt to dispel only one myth--the supposedly high combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet and its ability to defend the interests not only of Russia, but also of Ukraine at the southern maritime boundaries. In the article offered here I would like to dwell once again on some of the persistently widespread myths surrounding the Black Sea Fleet, and express my own view of the realities. Since the time the state sovereignty of Ukraine was proclaimed, the command of the Navy of the Russian Federation and the Black Sea Fleet, many political figures in Russia and some highly placed officials in the Crimea and Sevastopol, Russian and pro-Russian, and the mass media so inclined, have obsessively and purposefully tried to instill in the consciousness of the citizenry the idea that Ukraine does not need its own Navy, that its interests, like the interests of Russia in the southern maritime regions, are soundly protected by the Black Sea Fleet. My prior article discussed the emptiness of that assertion because of the poor fighting ability of the Black Sea Fleet, which is continuing to grow weaker, and its poor current and future combat readiness. That is just one side of the coin, and not even the main one. The main one is the fact, as practice shows, that the Black Sea Fleet has not once in the last two years shown itself to be disposed in a friendly manner toward Ukraine, to be passionate about its sovereignty and state interests. Its command and certain structures, including such as the editors of the newspaper FLAG RODINY, the press center and some others, are constantly spreading--among the personnel and inhabitants of Sevastopol, Crimea and outside its boundaries--an exclusively negative attitude toward Ukraine and its armed forces, especially the Navy. This frenzied anti-Ukrainian propaganda, often based on shameless lies and disinformation, is growing stronger. It is not for nothing that the Minister of Defense of Ukraine was recently forced to declare that the press center of the Black Sea Fleet, in being transferred to the territory of Ukraine, was waging direct subversive activity against it. The command of the Black Sea Fleet, while constantly professing its readiness to protect the interests of Ukraine, acts quite the contrary when even small practical steps are required of it. When, for example, a mine was discovered recently at the mouth of the Danube, they refused passage to the Ukrainians to disarm it. The same thing had occurred in the Black Sea Fleet before, when ordnance was found on the territory of Holland. One cannot count on the Black Sea Fleet, as we see, even on such issues. But the events in Odessa and many other instances provide convincing grounds to conclude that even today, when the Black Sea Fleet is still the joint property of the two states, Ukraine not only cannot count on the protection of its interests, but is also itself in need of protection against its provocative and unfriendly actions. And what will happen when it becomes the property of Russia alone? The situation that has taken shape in Crimea and Sevastopol shows that anti-Ukrainian political forces see in the Black Sea Fleet solid support for their attempts to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and separate the Crimea from it. The Black Sea Fleet command is not only not impeding the dragging of the fleet into political intrigues, but is even encouraging them and serving as an example of them themselves. The command of the Navy of the Russian Federation and the Black Sea Fleet, trying in every way possible to discredit the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and its Navy, accusing them of supposedly forcibly resubordinating some of the subunits and units of the Black Sea Fleet to themselves. Matters have even come to such absurd assertions as, they say, an officer of the Ukrainian Navy has in some way resubordinated more than a hundred units and subunits. They are quite silent about the "prigrabization" actions of the Black Sea Fleet therein. Those, meanwhile, are quite striking, and were launched much earlier, back in 1992. They are being carried out in three directions--seizing what is others', moving things to the Russian Federation, and selling things off. The Black Sea Fleet, in unilateral fashion grossly violating the agreements that had been reached earlier between Ukraine and Russia, grabbed--so that they would not get into the armed forces of Ukraine--all of the units and subunits in the Black Sea region that used to be subordinate not to it, but rather to the USSR Ministry of Defense and the Naval Main Staff--that is, to central elements. That fate befell, for example, the test center in Feodosiya with its subordinate units stationed on a territory of 256 hectares. A shipyard in the same Feodosiya, which occupies an area of more than 30 hectares. The Metalist shipyard in the city of Balaklava was seized, with grounds of close to six hectares that belonged to it. In Sevastopol they include the 13th Shipyard (16.2 hectares), the missile and artillery weaponry repair plant (7.4 hectares), and certain design bureaus (0.72 hectares). The naval planning institutes, the general-contractor administration of the chiefs of operations, ZBI plants, plants for metallic structural elements, the directorate for production and engineering equipment and many other facilities of the navy of the former USSR in Sevastopol, Yalta, Yevpatoriya, Myrnyy, Sakakh and other garrisons passed to the possession of the Black Sea Fleet in the same manner. The Black Sea Fleet began the redeployment of a number of ships and vessels and the removal of valuable equipment and property to the Russian Federation as early as February of 1992. Decoding gear whose estimated value is approximately 120 million dollars was removed from Odessa. Three special vehicles of the medical service were sent to Moscow in May of 1992, along with five UAZ vehicles from the inviolable reserves of the Black Sea Fleet chemical service in Novorossiysk. An experimental submarine was sent for repairs in November, and has not returned to the Black Sea Fleet. A similar practice of replenishing the other fleets of Russia at the expense of the Black Sea Fleet has continued in 1993 as well. Two assault craft and the VOKhR command of the Black Sea Fleet air forces were relocated from Sevastopol to Novorossiysk in May. A small ASW ship went to the Northern Fleet. This is a far from complete list of the transfers of forces and funds of the Black Sea Fleet to Russia without the consent of the Ukrainians. That is how the Black Sea Fleet is "protecting" the interests of Ukraine. Seventy percent of the facilities from the system of communications gear uniting the 170 laboratories of the Black Sea Fleet have been commercially leased since the start of 1992 by their chief, Colonel V. Kostrov. The Samarkand small enterprise was given a hectare of land at Kozachiy Bay for the organization of its production the same month by decision of the Black Sea Fleet command. Eleven motor vehicles that belonged to the Black Sea Fleet medical service were sold to commercial structures for 300,000 rubles apiece in August of 1992, with the sanction of the commander of the Black Sea Fleet. The commander of the Black Sea Fleet approved a purchase-and-sale agreement for a fleet facility for 60 million rubles the same month. The commander of the Black Sea Fleet issued a directive for the refitting and sale of two motor vehicles of the chemical service of the Black Sea Fleet through the 115 traffic service offices in October of 1992. The chief of the OFI of the Black Sea Fleet gave written permission in 1992 to the Akhtiar small enterprise to sell as scrap metal four decommissioned submarines on which the removal of equipment containing non-ferrous metals, including precious metals, had not even been carried out. Two submarines and the PS Kuban that had been repaired in Bulgaria were left in that country, supposedly in payment for debt, in 1993 by decision of the deputy commander-in-chief of the Navy. The Donbass exploratory vessel was sold to commercial structures that same year. Ukraine is to receive 50 percent of the funds from the sale of Black Sea Fleet property in accordance with the international agreements. It has not received a single kopeck, however. That is how the Russian admirals show their "concern" for the interests of Ukraine and the combat readiness of the Black Sea Fleet; while selling off the Black Sea Fleet, they are noisily shouting that the Ukrainian Navy is encroaching on it, constantly increasing tensions so as to hide their dishonorable deeds. That is why they have offered so much resistance to the desire of the Ukrainians to inventory the Black Sea Fleet. The Russian media, from the representations of the Black Sea Fleet press center, are constantly stirring up public opinion and making attempts to accuse Ukraine and its Navy of destabilizing the situation in the Crimea and Sevastopol. Numerous instances, however, testify to something else--the Black Sea Fleet itself is doing all its can for that purpose. It is today incapable of performing the operational-strategic tasks in the Mediterranean and other areas of the world's oceans that it used to be assigned; not knowing what to do in the Black Sea, it has, based on the territory of Ukraine, selected for itself one of the main tasks of opposing the affirmation of its independence and the building and emergence of its Navy. Corrupting itself and destroying itself, it has an attitude toward the Ukrainian Navy not as the fleet of a friendly nation, on the territory of which it resides and whose waters, land and means of existence it makes use of, but rather as its enemy. Here are just a few instances of this aspect. As soon as the staff of the Ukrainian Navy [VMSU] had begun to be formed in April--May of 1992, a mobile reconnaissance system of the Black Sea Fleet mounted on a GAZ-66 truck made a systematic radio survey of the radio systems and radio emissions of the communications gear of the VMSU. A group of Marines from the Black Sea Fleet made an incursion onto the territory of a SAM brigade of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on 31 March 1993, and attacked its servicemen. Private Levchuk was beaten, and the windows in the housing complex were smashed. An Mi-8 helicopter of the Black Sea Fleet air forces made unsafe overflights and photographed the military compound of a battalion of Marines and other facilities on 2 July 1993. The patrol service of the Black Sea Fleet at a checkpoint near the entrance to the city of Sevastopol committed the illegal act, on 12 July 1993, of detaining and listing servicemen from the Ukrainian Navy, with the discovery of the numbers of their military units, ranks, positions and so on. Similar and more sweeping unlawful actions by the Black Sea Fleet against the armed forces, including the Navy, of Ukraine have not stopped. Periodic announcements to units and formations of "enhanced combat readiness," the recent attempt to attack the command post of a PPO [air-defense] unit in Sevastopol, the sending of their agents to naval subunits, the ban--by order of Chief of Staff of the Black Sea Fleet Vice-Admiral P. Svitashov--on unsanctioned contacts by officer personnel with the officers of the VMSU, the removal of some pilots of Ukrainian nationality from flights in units of the air forces of the Black Sea Fleet--this is a far from complete list of the "fraternal" acts of the Black Sea Fleet with regard to Ukraine and its servicemen. Much could be said about the dishonorable acts of the Black Sea Fleet command. And however they may strain, whatever unpleasantness and ill will some Black Sea admirals and officers may resort to, independent Ukraine will never yield the right to have a mighty, battleworthy and modern Navy on the Black Sea. As for the statements of the commanders of the Black Sea Fleet about its high battleworthiness and ability to protect the southern borders of the interests of Ukraine and all of the CIS countries as well as Russia, that is nothing more than empty talk. As the facts cited above and many others testify, the Black Sea Fleet, first of all, does not want to do it, and second, as I emphasized already in my last article, it is not--to put it mildly--battleworthy. The Black Sea Fleet had already begun to deteriorate as early as the end of 1989. As many as a hundred combat vessels have been decommissioned over the last year and a half alone. While its combat core used to be close to 350 ships, it has only 15--20 percent of that number today. The statements of Admiral A. Kalinin, the former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, are of a certain interest in this regard. He justly complained in a recent television appearance that whereas several years ago the combat might of the Black Sea Fleet was roughly at a ratio of 4:1 compared to the Turkish Navy, this year it is at 1:1 and could even fall further. The commander of one of the SKRs of the Black Sea Fleet that has been under repair for several years now declared quite candidly on that same television program that the Black Sea Fleet is aging, it is dying, that it would not be battleworthy at all in 2--3 years. And that is indeed so. Virtually all of the combat vessels of the Black Sea Fleet are 15--25 years old, and their planned repairs and dockwork are not being performed on time. Russia is not currently building a single ship for the Black Sea Fleet. They are pilfering, selling off and carrying off property, the shore support infrastructure for the ships and units. The Black Sea Fleet, as a result of all this, is already unable to perform the task of covering maritime sectors of the territory of both Ukraine and Russia. It requires protection itself now. Ukrainian PPO units are forced to provide air cover for its ships and shore facilities, insofar as it does not have its own system of air defense. The interaction of the fleet with the Odessa Military District, which is part of the armed forces of Ukraine, and with the Ukrainian naval border units has been lost virtually entirely through the fault of the Black Sea Fleet command. The financial situation of the Black Sea Fleet is very grave. It is, so to speak, in debt up to its ears. The officers and warrant officers have not received their pay for two or three months in some subunits and units, especially in Odessa, Ochakov, Izmayil and some other remote garrisons. This situation is naturally having an effect on their morale and psychological state. And they are coming to serve in the Ukrainian Navy--a new and promising structure--entirely voluntarily, without any pressure on the part of the Ukrainians and without any promises whatsoever. Some may not believe me, but the naval command has appealed to those collectives that have decided to pass under the jurisdiction of the Ukrainian fleet to think seriously about that step, warning that the salaries in the navy for both servicemen and for civil employees are lower than in the Black Sea Fleet. The commander of the Ukrainian Navy, Vice-Admiral V. Bezkorovaynyy, has moreover directed the attention of the Black Sea Fleet command to the alarming signals from the Ochakov, Mikolayevka and some of the other so-called remote garrisons. They have only promised "to investigate without fail" in the Black Sea Fleet, however. This ended with the fact that the people who did not want to be hostages to the situation, to watch as the fleet disintegrated and is sold off, made the choice in favor of the Ukrainian Navy. I can thus state with all certainty that the information that has been spread about some forced resubordination of certain units and subunits to the Ukrainian Navy is malicious slander that cannot withstand any critical analysis. Only in contradiction to any common sense could one imagine that the navy would permit the formation of its subunits from people who were forcibly transferred into them. The Ukrainian fleet is being built and developed. The fleet of Ukraine will exist despite any opposition. And only it should and will protect the national interests of its state on the Black Sea. And Ukraine, strictly speaking, has never made the request that the Black Sea Fleet protect its state or any other interests. We believe that it will not rely on such protection in the future all the more. And for granting its bases, its territory and facilities, its waters in lease to the fleet of Russia in the future, it has the right to count on a fraternal and good attitude toward it and respect for its laws, its armed forces, its citizens. How could it be otherwise? How could any lessor nation permit its own lessee to have an ill-disposed, the more so hostile, attitude toward it?
