This follows from a party resolution that is attached to the applications for membership. Former members of extreme-right rival parties who want to join the Alliance of Free Citizens need only to have left their previous organization "some time ago." The Alliance of Free Citizens, which collects an admission fee of 250 German marks, currently has only 120 members; Chairman Brunner is confronted with a charge of "sedition" because he is said to have put Bonn's European policy on a level with racism during the Nazi era. Brunner had already invited Manfred Rouhs, 29, spokesman of the new Right and publisher of the ultraconservative strategy magazine EUROPA VORN, to his party's federal assembly in Bonn the Sunday before last. Rouhs and his adherents are already beating the drum for using the Alliance of Free Citizens, which does not have many members, for the benefit of their own political objectives.
