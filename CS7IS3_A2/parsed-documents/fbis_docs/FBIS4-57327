Gen. Discua attended the inauguration of the first industrial park of Comayagua. There, he was asked his opinion of the Executive Branch's decision to strip the Armed Forces of control over Hondutel [Honduran Telecommunications Enterprise] and other government institutions, as well as to establish voluntary military service. The military chief affirmed that those decisions do not create differences between the Executive Branch and the Armed Forces. "I think that what is being done is correct," Gen. Discua explained. Discua indicated that the agencies that were administered by the military had always belonged to the Executive, adding "this must not surprise anyone; these are just agencies that come under the Executive, and the managers must be appointed by the Executive." In the meantime, Discua said he met with President Reina on Wednesday afternoon to analyze the problem of the increase of crime in the country. He concluded: "We have full support from the Executive to face the wave of criminality that has emerged."
