FBIS3-34499 "drnes027_k_94010" FBIS-NES-94-027 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Feb 1994 IRAQ Columnist Notes Shortcomings of Development Project JN0802162494 Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 30 Jan 94 p 8 JN0802162494 Baghdad AL-THAWRAH Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Hamid Sa'id article: "The Last Word"] [Text] It seems to me that the subdistricts development project, which we have rejoiced in and written about enthusiastically, has not produced all the results we had hoped for, nor has it been as successful as we have read in some of our media. It is clear to me, at least, that what has been achieved by this project has not been even in all areas of development. In some areas, the level of development and the standard of work was higher than in others. I had hoped to visit many of those subdistricts to get directly acquainted with the work that has been achieved by the development project, but it was not possible for many reasons. And in the areas I did visit I noticed that the level and volume of what we termed the development project was not as described in the news media. But I have also received letters from several subdistricts included in the development, and all of them referred to the many negative points and the artificiality of work on this project. In several cases, the citizens's basic needs in the subdistricts have remained unfulfilled. It appeared to me from some of the letters that the writer had exaggerated their criticism of the work that had been done in their subdistricts. Some of the letters said that the funds that had been spent on developing the subdistricts could have been used to accomplish something more important, but that the funds were not spent properly and some subcontractors had benefited more than the subdistricts themselves. I cannot confirm or deny what the letters said, but let me put it this way: the citizens in the subdistricts know more about their affairs than I do. Since I have not seen most of the subdistricts, and I cannot accept all that is contained in the letters either, I can only say that it is not logical to ignore what has come out in these letters. I believe that it is essential to establish honest neutral committees in order to inspect the areas where the work has taken place. I hope that these committees will be able to hear what the citizens have to say and to determine the needs and shortages of their subdistricts. We all know that work that is incomplete or ill-considered often leads to results directly opposed to what was intended. I asked a National Assembly member about his subdistrict and what he told me did not please me. He confirmed what was written in the letter I received from a citizen in his subdistrict.
