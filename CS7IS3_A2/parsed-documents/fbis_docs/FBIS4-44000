During the meeting, the brother foreign minister briefed the German minister on developments in the Yemeni Republic, stressing the Yemeni Government's eagerness to put an end to the fighting imposed by the secessionist elements when they departed from constitutional legitimacy and declared secession. He also informed him of the attempts made by the government of the Yemeni Republic before and after the situation exploded, as well as the recent efforts to bring about a cease-fire and the call to reactivate the Yemeni military committee, with the participation of Jordan, Oman, the United States, and France. Basindwah further asserted that the secessionist elements have foiled all efforts and are working to escalate the situation and violate the cease-fire each time it is announced. He added that the Yemeni Government is still pursuing efforts to find a solution within a Yemeni framework that preserves the national gains, primarily Yemeni unity, democracy, and constitutional legitimacy. For his part, the German minister of state for foreign affairs asserted his government's concern about maintaining Yemeni unity, continuing our country's democratic approach, and working to cease fire in line with Security Council Resolution 924.
