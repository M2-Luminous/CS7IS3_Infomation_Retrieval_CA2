[Correspondent A. Pishchayev] The procedure for sealing the fate of the coup plotters took no more than three hours today. But this quick verdict did not serve to change the minds of those participating in the trial. As before, the defendants continued to maintain that they were not guilty of high treason. On the subject of amnesty, they gave their full support, as this is in the name of so-called national reconciliation. Pichenkin, Yazov's lawyer, said the Duma resolution reflects the will of the people, no more, no less. He called for this will to be carried through. All the defendants called on the court to issue a resolution closing the SCSE case. Defendant Varennikov said: All is apparently quite clear and simple, but I cannot understand who is giving me amnesty and for what. I can do the forgiving -- of Gorbachev, of Valentin Stepankov, of Nishanov, of Trubin, for unlawful actions. He announced his petition requesting that criminal proceedings be started over the break-up of the Soviet Union. Defendant Shenin said he saw no point in proving his innocence to a regime which has violated the law. I believe that Soviet power will return and sort everyone out, Shenin asserted. The defendants and their lawyers said that throughout the whole SCSE trial the court came under pressure from the powers that be. Lawyer Ivanov accused Yeltsin's adviser Baturin of putting pressure on the former general procurator Kazannik, which warrants criminal proceedings, he said. After a hearing of the state prosecution which insisted on continuing the case, the military tribunal decided to end the SCSE trial on the basis of the amnesty resolution. So, the case is closed and at the flick of the Duma's finger, 1 March can now be regarded a day of reconciliation and justice.
