The Trade Department forecast no immediate impact from Thursday's announcement that the United States planned to slash China's textile and apparel quotas by 25 to 35 percent. "But if a resolution is not reached in due course, re-exports of Chinese-made textiles and clothing to the United States will be affected," a department spokesman said. It added that Hong Kong was "naturally concerned" whenever its two biggest trading partners were at loggerheads. Well over 50 billion US dollars' worth of Chinese goods are re- exported through Hong Kong to various countries every year. Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod, speaking to reporters, said the through-flow of Chinese goods would be "reduced somewhat" if the US sanctions go into place. "It would also affect Hong Kong entrepreneurs' investments in China very directly," he added. "But I think it's very early. They're very clearly in the middle of a negotiation and we'll have to see how it ends up." US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the quota slash -- to take effect January 17 and retroactive to January 1 -- was in retaliation for Chinese-made goods that are shipped illegally via third countries to avoid US quotas. Hong Kong is the biggest source of foreign investment in China, as well as a major trans-shipment point for goods made for export in the neighboring southern Chinese province of Guangdong. Business analysts said the US action boded ill for the renewal in June of China's most favored nation trading status, which President Bill Clinton has decreed will be conditional on improvements in human rights. Macleod has said that if MFN is revoked, Hong Kong's economic growth rate of about five percent could plunge by three percentage points, and that 70,000 jobs could perish.
