FR940412-2-00097 FR940412-2-00072 Determination of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance AGENCY: Department of Energy (DOE). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: DOE announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award on a noncompetitive basis a cooperative agreement to Pen Kem, Inc. The cooperative agreement is a continuation of work under a former DOE cooperative agreement and will support development of the active ultrasonic spectroscopy for shape characterization efforts which began in 1991 as a part of the PSD sensor project. DOE support is estimated at $150,000 for a twelve month period. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stanley F. Sobczynski, DOE Project Manager, Office of Conservation Energy, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC 20585, (202) 585&hyph;1878. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The anticipated objectives to be achieved include the following: _Development of methodology to infer shape characteristics using ultrasonic response measured under various imposed flow fields; _Design and fabrication of an R&D prototype slurry characterization chamber (SCC); and _Valuation of key concepts using model systems (specially prepared clays with controlled shape variations) in the laboratory and experimental evaluation of proposed techniques for monitoring delamination of kaolin will be conducted to identify practical limitations. The probability of success is high because of Pen Kem's experience and continued work with R&D in the field of colloids. Since the development of the new PSD sensor prototype, development of a new PSD sensor based on ultrasound has been reported in Europe. Preliminary market exploration of the commercial PSD instrument was conducted at the 1992 Pen Kem User's forum in Paris in November 1992. Accomplishments during the initial phase of the project indicate that Pen Kem will successfully achieve these objectives with continued DOE funding and that competition for support would result in considerable delay in achieving some of the results anticipated during the upcoming phase of the project as well as inhibit the objectives of the Office of Conservation Energy. Award is therefore restricted to Pen Kem, Inc. Issued in Oak Ridge, Tennessee on March 30, 1994. Peter D. Dayton, Director, Procurement and Contracts Division, Oak Ridge Field Office.
