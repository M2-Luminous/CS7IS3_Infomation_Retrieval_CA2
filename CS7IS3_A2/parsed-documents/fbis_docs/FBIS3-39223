Ambassador Fulci went on to argue how an eventual air-strike in and around Sarajevo, if the siege of the Bosnian capital is not removed by February 20, "should not be viewed exclusively as an act of reprisal or a response to the deadlock in the peace process, but as a means to induce the sides to return to reason and make every effort possible to come to an agreement." The Italian diplomat then went on to stress the importance of Italy's active role in the adoption of the ultimatum which represented the "point of change in the attitude of the international community towards the crisis in Bosnia" and a "catalyst for new contributions in the search for a political solution." In his address, Ambassador Fulci reiterated how Italy has put its military bases and airports at the full disposition of the Atlantic Alliance for any action in Bosnia. The Italian ambassador concluded by making a host of appeals, asking that opposing forces in Bosnia "exercise moderation and demonstrate political will to reach a negotiated settlement," extending this plea to "anyone who can influence the warring factions with renewed vigor." He then called on those countries participating in the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] contingent, humanitarian organizations, international agencies and "all men of good will" to not waiver in their efforts. "A peaceful solution for Bosnia can be found" Ambassador Fulci said, "but only if we all persevere." [passage omitted]
