Gen. Inienger told a two-man UN delegation of electoral advisers that among such obligations was the need to disarm all the combatants in the Liberian crisis (?before) peaceful elections are held in the country. Gen. Inienger reiterated that the parties to the conflict should demonstrate sufficient good faith by ensuring that the disarmament process is quickly ended to create an enabling environment for free and fair elections to be held. Gen. Inienger expressed concern over the clear reluctance of the parties to disarm as fast as it had been anticipated when the date for the general elections was fixed. An ECOMOG release says the field commander told the UN electoral advisers that ECOMOG, a multinational group of professional military men, has the responsibility of providing security for free and fair elections to be held, but noted that it was not within the scheme of duties of ECOMOG to determine for Liberians what electoral system would be most suitable for them to adopt in electing their leaders. Gen. Inienger said what ECOMOG would be most delighted to experience would be the day Liberians would once again democratically elect their leaders as they had been doing since the last century. He observed that the parties to the conflict have not made the job of ensuring a healthy environment in Liberia any easier for ECOMOG due to the internal problems being faced by ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] and fighting between the Liberian Peace Council and the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] in the southeastern Liberia. Gen. Inienger said he hoped that those problems would be solved and disarmament concluded before the 7 September date fixed for the general elections. [passage indistinct]
