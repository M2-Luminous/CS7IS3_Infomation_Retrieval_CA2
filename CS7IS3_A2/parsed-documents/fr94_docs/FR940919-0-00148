FR940919-0-00148 FR940919-0-00017 Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available, the Service has determined that the Conservancy fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta conservatio Eng et al .), longhorn fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta longiantenna Eng et al .), and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp ( Lepidurus packardi Simon) should be classified as endangered species; and the vernal pool fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta lynchi Eng et al .) should be classified as a threatened species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determined to be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the Conservancy fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta conservatio ), longhorn fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta longiantenna ), vernal pool fairy shrimp ( Branchinecta lynchi ), and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp ( Lepidurus packardi ) are as follows: A. The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of their habitat or range. All three fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp are restricted to vernal pools in California. The habitat of these animals is imperiled by a variety of human-caused activities, primarily urban development, water supply/flood control activities, and conversion of land to agricultural use. Habitat loss occurs from direct destruction and modification of pools due to filling, grading, discing, leveling, and other activities, as well as modification of surrounding uplands that alters vernal pool watersheds. Rapid urbanization of areas containing vernal pools poses a significant threat to the four species included in this final rule. In the Central Valley, at least five pool complexes that were known to contain suitable habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp were eliminated by urban development in the late 1980's. Mitigation measures were either lacking or unsuccessful. In general, the growth rate of human populations and associated urban development throughout the Central Valley is equal to or exceeds that of any other region in California. Indicative of this growth rate are proposals to develop several new towns within the ranges of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. As an example, two towns proposed in Placer and San Joaquin Counties would support 80,000 and 44,000 people, respectively, and likely would impact significant amounts of vernal pool habitat for these species (Laver 1991, Wiegand 1991). Vernal pools in the Redding area that likely provided habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp have been impacted significantly by urban development and agricultural conversion. Aerial photographs of an approximately 61-hectare (150 acre) area near the Redding Municipal Airport document that development occurring between 1952 and 1992 resulted in the loss of 62 percent and the degradation of 37 percent of the original vernal pools in this vernal pool complex (Jim Nelson, California Fish & Game, pers. com., 1993). The remaining pools at this site are inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Vernal pool areas around the airport have been zoned for enterprise, and sewer lines have been installed in anticipation of development. Several proposed residential development projects in the Redding area (e.g., Argyle West and Eagle Crest projects) also would adversely affect the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. A proposed electrical transmission line also threatens several pools in the area. Eucalyptus farms have been established on many historic vernal pool sites around Redding and future groves are planted at the rate of approximately 810 hectares (2,000 acres) per year (J. Nelson, California Department of Fish and Game, pers. comm. 1993). In the Chico area, certain areas inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp recently were ditched and drained (Patrick Kelly, Mount Lassen Chapter of the California Native Plant Society, in litt ., 1992). In addition, at least four residential developments proposed in Chico, including the Simmons Ranch, Foothill Park, Sierra Technology, and Bidwell Ranch projects are proposed that would eliminate approximately 810 hectares (2,000 acres) of habitat containing vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. No specific mitigation measures are included in these projects for this animal. Numerous residential and commercial development projects in the Sacramento area pose a severe threat to vernal pool complexes inhabited by populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp. These proposed and ongoing projects, sponsored by Federal, State and local agencies, private interests, and local governments, include, but are not limited to the closure of Mather Air Force Base, modifications to Strawberry, Elk Grove, and Laguna Creeks, two proposed surface gravel mines, and numerous residential developments including the Elliot Ranch South, Churchill Downs, Elk Ridge Estates, and Sunrise-Douglas projects. Urban development and agricultural conversion imperil populations of the vernal pool fairy shrimp and vernal pool tadpole shrimp in the San Joaquin Valley. Castle Air Force Base is undergoing closure and the U.S. Bureau of Prisons has proposed to build a prison on vernal pools at this site known to contain the two fairy shrimp. The Corps has proposed the Merced County Streams project that would facilitate urban development in many areas that provide suitable habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp and the vernal pool tadpole shrimp. Numerous projects between Stockton and Bakersfield also would adversely impact the three species, including the Mueller Ranch gravel mine in Stanislaus County, a number of residential developments in San Joaquin County (e.g., the Liberty project would affect approximately 2,000 vernal pools), the Yosemite Lake project in Merced County, and the Ball Ranch project in Fresno County. Areas in the San Francisco Bay area that contain vernal pools also are undergoing substantial urban development. Vernal pools inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp in the Livermore area of Alameda County have been adversely impacted by urban development, agriculture, and alteration of the hydrology of Altamont Creek (Alan Launer, Stanford University Center for Conservation Biology, in litt ., 1992). The City of Livermore is evaluating land use options that could result in the conversion of 3,002 hectares (7,420 acres) of natural habitat, including vernal pools that provide suitable habitat for the vernal pool fairy shrimp, to urban use for up to 30,000 people (City of Livermore 1992; Susan Frost, Livermore Planning Department, pers. comm., 1993). The proposed expansion of the municipal airport at Byron Hot Springs in eastern Contra Costa County will eliminate a number of pools inhabited by the vernal pool fairy shrimp. Other vernal pools located in San Luis Obispo County, including most of the known populations of the longhorn fairy shrimp and at least one population of the vernal pool fairy shrimp, are located in subdivided areas with constructed roads and lots for sale and development (Eng et al . 1990; Dave Chipping, Amateur biologist, in litt ., 1992). To date, some of the sites have been cleared and continued habitat loss is ongoing or impending. The Coastal Branch Phase II (Coastal Aqueduct) of the State Water Project, proposed by the California Department of Water Resources (Carol Nelson, California Department of Water Resources, in litt ., 1993), annually would convey 70,000 acre-feet of water from the Delta region of California to San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara Counties. It is unclear if this source of water would allow urban development of the Soda Lake area, however, the longhorn fairy shrimp and the vernal pool fairy shrimp may be adversely affected by commercial development made possible by this project.
