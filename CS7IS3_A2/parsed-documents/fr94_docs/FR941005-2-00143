SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: I. Background On April 14, 1994, the Executive Office of the President published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to form a 30-member policy dialog advisory committee to assist in the development of measures to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. As set forth in the April 14, 1994 notice, the policy dialog arises out of the President's Climate Change Action Plan, issued in October 1993. The committee will develop recommendations on the sets of policies that would, if adopted, most cost-effectively obtain a return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles by the years 2005, 2015 and 2025, with no upturn thereafter. This framework of achievement of 1990 emissions levels in three alternative years is intended to focus the issues and the recommendations to be considered by the committee. Decisions on the amount and timing of reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles, and the policies to attain them, remain the responsibility of the federal government. The Administration has stated that it is committed to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from personal motor vehicles. The 30-member committee includes representatives from state and local governments; the automobile industry and related parties; labor; transportation fuels; and public interest groups, including the driving public. The Committee held its first meeting on September 28 and 29, 1994 in Washington, DC. A draft summary of that meeting will be available at the second meeting, and will also be available after the second meeting on the Technology Transfer Network of the Office of Air Quality Planning & Standards of the Environmental Protection Agency. The public may also communicate with the committee and the facilitator through this facility. The system will be able to be accessed electronically (for modems up to 14,000 bps) starting October 10, 1994, by calling (919) 541&hyph;5742.
