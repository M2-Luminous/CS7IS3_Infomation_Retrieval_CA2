In the "Erlangen Model," which is to be copied elsewhere, 12 politicians from the Christian Social Union [CSU], Social Democratic Party [SPD], Free Democratic Party [FDP], and Alliance 90/Greens commit themselves not to participate in rallies to which members of the Republikaner, the National Democratic Party of Germany, the German People's Union, "or similar right-wing extremist organizations are invited as speakers or as participants in a discussion." The declaration presented today is based on the "smallest common denominator," Hans-Hermann Hann of the "Alliance of Bavarian Town and City Councils Against Xenophobia and Right-Wing Extremism" stated. The alliance, which was founded in 1992, groups about 1,500 Bavarian town and city councils. The signatories certainly can have differing positions. Thus, the assessment of the Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not unanimous. The CSU wanted to extend the declaration to the PDS and "other left-wing extremist organizations," but the other parties refused. The CSU signed the declaration nevertheless.
