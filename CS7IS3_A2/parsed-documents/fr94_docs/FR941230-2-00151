FR941230-2-00151 FR941230-2-00072 Children in Custody_$450,000 Under this ongoing collaborative program between OJJDP and the U.S. Bureau of the Census, OJJDP proposes to transfer funds to the Census Bureau to conduct the 1995 biennial census of public and private juvenile detention, correctional, and shelter facilities. The census describes juvenile custody facilities in terms of their resident population, programs, and physical characteristics. It provides information on trends in the use of juvenile custody facilities for delinquent juveniles and status offenders. The Census Bureau's Center for Survey Methods Research would also continue to develop and test a roster-based data collection system designed to significantly improve information on juveniles in custody. The Bureau's Governments Division would create a new directory of facilities. The program would be implemented under an interagency agreement with the U.S. Bureau of the Census. No additional applications would be solicited in fiscal year 1995. Research Program on Juveniles Taken Into Custody_NCCD_$450,000 The Research Program on Juveniles Taken into Custody was designed in response to a statutory requirement to produce a detailed annual summary of juvenile custody data. During the next 24-month period, the National Council on Crime and Delinquency (NCCD) will continue to implement and refine the State Juvenile Correctional System Reporting Program. It is anticipated that individual-level data for 1993 will be representative of more than 75 percent of the at-risk juvenile population. In addition, NCCD will prepare two additional reports for OJJDP. These reports will provide a detailed summary and analysis of the most recent data regarding: (1) the number and characteristics of juveniles taken into custody, (2) the rate at which juveniles are taken into custody, and (3) the trends demonstrated by the data. The 1994 data collection will expand coverage by collecting data from several small, nonautomated State systems. In order to better understand the data collected under the State Juvenile Corrections System Reporting Program, NCCD will conduct a State Juvenile Corrections Organizational Survey to identify critical dimensions of corrections administration that may explain variation in results. NCCD, in cooperation with the National Center for Juvenile Justice, will assess the proportion of all court commitments that are covered by the State Juvenile Corrections Reporting Program as compared with direct commitments by local authorities. NCCD will also conduct a pilot data collection and research effort on a small sample of detention centers to generate data and information on juveniles in detention. This program will be implemented by the current grantee, NCCD. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.
