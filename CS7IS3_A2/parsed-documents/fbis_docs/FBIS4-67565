Do you remember the words? "Sometimes people dream of blue cities with no names..." This was some prankster's big joke at our censorship, the most powerful in the world. He hailed cities that never existed on any map. But these phantom cities did have names, and their names were quite poetic: Sarov, Ozersk, Verkh-Neyvinsk, Saraklych, Zolotaya Sablya [Golden Saber]... On secret charts, however, their names sounded more boring: Arzamas-16, Chelyabinsk-65, Zlatoust-26... There also were ZATO's ("Closed Administrative/Territorial Units"). Seven cities were formed by the 17 March 1954 edict in locations which contained establishments of the Ministry of Medium Machine-Building nuclear weaponry complex. Forty years ago. (Besides the three cities mentioned above, there were Krasnoyarsk-26, Sverdlovsk-44, Tomsk-7, Sverdlovsk-45.) Three more were added a little later: Chelyabinsk-70, Krasnoyarsk-46, and Penza-16. For the entire 40 years the numbered cities existed under conditions of total secrecy. They were absent from post office directories and statistical reference books; they were also excluded every time there was an official census or when voters' lists were compiled. Every road that led into such a place was blocked by barbed wire strung along its perimeter and had a military checkpoint at the point of entry. Further on, there was the territory of a military unit with another checkpoint at the exit. Only after these two filters could one get to a "Zero city." This "close" atmosphere contributed to a specific "zero" mentality. On the one hand, for instance, these phantom cities had a high level of technical education because the defense used to draw the best graduates from the best schools. On the other hand, there was also a hysterical spy mania and a caste disassociation from the "uninitiated." On the one hand, there is patriotism deserving nothing but respect and an obsession with work (many "zero" residents do not know what vacations are and have not gone beyond the barbed wire for years). They also have strict morals typical of restricted communities and monasteries. On the other hand, there is a humanities gap borne by being so remote from any source of culture and by the restricted character of these science-towns, closed to artists' tours, congresses, festivals, student Olympics, etc. There are also GULAG traditions inherited from the prisoners who built the cities. All this results in flourishing provincial conservatism. "Zeroites" cannot stand the press media. To this day they are overly careful as they mumble "site," "item," "experiment," "building N" instead of "reactor," "bomb," explosion," "storage vault..." Meanwhile, their faces acquire an expression as if they need to go to the bathroom on serious business. Zero cities have their own specific features: the totally geometric layout of their streets, groups of marching soldiers, plenty of sports grounds and arenas. Another distinctive feature of the science-towns is their ecological unpredictability. Neither the unique underground, 250 meters deep, atomic station of the Krasnoyarsk mining and chemical combine, nor the Chelyabinsk complexes which process the exposed fuel and produce weapons-grade plutonium, nor the cyclotrons of Dubna, Protvin, and Arzamas have undergone independent ecological analysis for decades. But who used to control the radiation environment? It was the services of the same classified complex that created this radiation danger in the first place. In other words, I drink, and then I take myself to the sobering-up station too... One can imagine the results of all this. Especially considering that even in the open city of Moscow, which is as stuffed with secret sites as a Christmas turkey with apples, radiation ecologists are wandering under solid fences trying to use the wind rose, at least, to figure out the parameters of radioisotopes and other toxic pollutants emitted into the atmosphere. Moreover, radioactive sources and waste are being found in neighboring kindergartens and private apartments. One can imagine what is happening behind those fences. A new dawn is finally breaking over the phantom cities. The Russian Federation Government issued an edict on 4 January 1994 which officially assigns the following geographic names to them: Zheleznogorsk (Krasnoyarsk-26), Kremlev (Arzamas-16), Zarechnyy (Penza-19), Novouralsk (Sverdlovsk-44), Zelenogorsk (Krasnoyarsk-45), Lesnoy (Sverdlovsk-45), Seversk (Tomsk-7), Ozersk (Chelyabinsk-65), Snezhinsk (Chelyabinsk-70), Trekhgornyy (Zlatoust-26). Some of the information on these cities has been declassified. We learned that, by 1 January 1993, the population of the big 10 among Zero cities numbered 723,000 people instead of the 123 million claimed by OGONEK a couple of years ago. According to data provided by the Main Administration for Social Policy of the Minatom [Ministry of Atomic Energy], they enjoy the services of 385 kindergartens and nurseries, 149 schools, nine higher education establishments, nine vocational technical schools, 21 movie theaters, four puppet and four music and drama theaters, 10 music schools, 23 libraries, seven museums, 105 gyms, 18 stadiums, 10 swimming pools, 24 young pioneers' camps, etc. Unemployment is still rather low there--only 7,518 were unemployed as of December of last year. These data, however, do not cover other numbered locations (Shkotovo-22, Krasnoyarsk-39, Zagorsk-7, Severodvinsk, Golitsyno-2). Neither do they disclose the number of reactors, nuclear fuel storage vaults, stored total energy, radioactive waste dumps, the technology for its conditioning, methods of radiation monitoring, the number of times the Minatom dinosaurs were visited by ecological commissions of international Greenpeace, of the Doctors of the World for the Prevention of Nuclear War committee, of the Toward a New Earth movement, and other nonagency experts. However, it is not everybody that wants to make the information on Zero cities public. A representative poll of Chelyabinsk-Ozersk residents conducted by the city administration sociological group at the beginning of this year showed that the absolute majority of the people (82 percent) spoke unequivocally against "opening" their city...
