Taxpayers Support Taxation System Reform After meeting the directors, managers, and tax personnel from some enterprises, especially large and medium enterprises, this reporter's overwhelming impression was that they are good at accounts and have a detailed understanding of the reform of the taxation system, especially value-added tax [VAT]. Xu Shizhen, chief accountant at the Beijing Electrical Machinery Plant, said: This reform is a positive one and constitutes a major measure for bringing the socialist market economy in line with the international market. As VAT will not lead to duplicate taxation in the links of social reproduction, it enhances coordination among specialized departments. It also encourages direct export because the export tax rate is zero. The electrical machinery plant has the right to export its own products. Xu Shizhen estimated that exports would increase this year. In the course of implementing the new taxation system, the plant has also issued two documents to the appropriate personnel: "The Handling of Accounts After the New Taxation Comes Into Effect" and "The Points of Attention in Writing Receipts and Accepting Receipts From Outside." To adapt enterprises' internal operations to the unified VAT special receipts, the Beijing Municipal Department Store and the Beijing Municipal Medical Corporation hurriedly printed vouchers for internal delivery in late December last year. Foregoing the New Year's Day holiday, the Beijing Municipal Mechanical and Electrical Corporation carried out advance on-the-spot exercises on the method of using VAT special receipts and rushed to made seals in coordination with the use of special receipts so as to reduce customers' waiting time. In implementing the new taxation system, the nine branch factories and one company of the Guizhou Organic Chemical Plant have taken the headquarters as a unified tax-paying unit and, with some subordinate enterprises undertaking more or less tax burdens, the overall tax burden has dropped. In light of the rising prices of raw and semi-finished materials and the increasing enterprise tax burden, the plant has worked out several measures for tapping its internal potential. Because it uses bauxite as a raw material, the China No. 7 Abrasive Wheel Plant cannot enjoy tax credits and hence has to assume a heavier tax burden. The plant's chief accountant, Ma Quanbin, said: The introduction of the new taxation system has vigorously compelled us to change our internal operation mechanism and adapt to the market economy. We should budget carefully, raise efficiency by improving management, and try every possible means to internally absorb the increased tax burden. Good Order in the First Tax Collection Period The first collection of tax according to the new taxation system covers a 10-day period from 1 to 10 February. At the No. 1 tax office of the Dongcheng tax sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, this reporter discovered that most enterprises filled in the "VAT Returns" and other forms in pencil first and, after consulting those individuals specifically assigned to the task of checking them, officially filled in the forms. As these individuals asked questions and made calculations column by column and item by item, everything was in good order. The No. 4 tax office of the Chaoyang tax sub-bureau of the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau, which is responsible for over 200 large and medium city- level enterprises, extended its working hours lest enterprises should require a second consultation. They also stipulated that administrative personnel should first give guidance on how to fill in all forms and then check them before they are submitted to the tax collection department, the information is entered in the computer, and the tax invoices are printed. This can prevent enterprises from making mistakes or enduring long waiting periods to submit returns. It has been learned that during the first tax collection period under the new taxation system, the order of paying taxes has been good in most parts of the country. Taking the First Steady Step Jin Xin, director of the State General Administration of Taxation, said: There are four conditions for judging whether the taxation system reform has been successful: First, whether it will give rise to price fluctuations and soaring prices; second, whether tax revenue can grow steadily; third, whether there are numerous counterfeit VAT special receipts and tax evasions in violation of regulations on the use of special receipts; and fourth, whether the new taxation system boosts the transformation of enterprise operational mechanisms and production. Judging from the first month, the taxation system reform has not given rise to great fluctuations in commodity prices, about which people are most concerned; there have not been major problems in the use of VAT special receipts; the tax revenue maintained a fairly high growth in January; and some localities are exploring economic development strategies to adapt to the new taxation system and some enterprises are readjusting their internal operation mechanisms. Due to its vast territory, conditions differ greatly throughout China, and all trades and professions have their own special features. Given such disparate conditions, many complicated issues have yet to be solved in the implementation of a unified taxation system. However, through the vigorous coordination of various quarters and the joint efforts of both tax departments and enterprises, we have taken a steady first step in implementing a new taxation system which contributes to the sustained, rapid, and healthy development [as published] of the national economy, meets the requirements of the socialist market economic structure, and conforms to international practice and our national conditions.
