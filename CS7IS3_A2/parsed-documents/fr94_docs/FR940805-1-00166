FR940805-1-00166 FR940805-1-00017 Proposed §13.16(a)(1)(iv) repeats the statutory language of section 9308(e) of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA) (49 U.S.C. App. 2157(e)). As explained in the preamble to the final rule implementing ANCA (56 FR 48628, 48630; September 25, 1991), section 9308(e) and the implementing regulations in Part 91 apply to the operators of Stage 2 aircraft. This section would not change the penalties or procedures that may apply to aircraft operating rules in Part 91. The proposed sections also do not change the penalties or procedures that may apply to airport operators for violations of Part 158 (passenger facility charges) or Part 161 (airport noise or access restrictions). Proposed §13.16(a)(1)(v) describes the statutory limitations on the authority in §13.16(a)(1) (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv). In cases outside this authority ( e.g., in which the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000), the FAA may not assess a civil penalty. It may only seek a civil penalty under the procedures in §13.15. These limitations are statutory, and are found in sections 901(a)(3) and 905 of the FAAct as they existed on July 31, 1992, and in section 901(a)(3)(C) of the FAAct as amended by the CPAA Act. Proposed §13.16(a)(1)(vi) states the authority to assess civil penalties for hazardous materials violations. This authority is granted to the Secretary of Transportation under section 110 of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (HMT Act), and delegated to the FAA under 49 CFR 1.47(k). Because the authority to assess penalties is not granted by section 901(a)(3) of the FAAct, these cases are not subject to the limitations described in proposed §13.16(a)(1)(v). Proposed §13.16(a)(1)(vii) states the authority to assess civil penalties under section 404(d) of the FAAct, for violations relating to smoking on scheduled flights and tampering with smoke alarm devices. This authority is granted to the Secretary of Transportation in section 404(d), and delegated to the FAA in 49 CFR 1.47(q). It is not subject to the limitations in proposed §13.16(a)(1)(v). Proposed §13.16(a)(2) describes the amounts of civil penalties authorized by the various statutes for each violation. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(i) states the general authority, found in section 901(a)(1) of the FAAct, for civil penalties of up to $1,000 for each violation. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(ii) states the authority, found in section 901(a) of the FAAct, to seek civil penalties not exceeding $10,000 for each violation by a person (other than an airman serving in the capacity of an airman) who operates aircraft for compensation or hire. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(iii) states the authority, found in section 901(a)(1) of the FAAct, for civil penalties not exceeding $10,000 for violations relating to the registration of aircraft and recordation of aircraft ownership under title V of the FAAct. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(iv) stats the authority, found in section 901(c) of the FAAct, for civil penalties of not more than $10,000 for imparting or conveying false information, generally involving alleged aircraft piracy or other criminal acts. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(v) states the authority, found in section 901(d) of the FAAct, for civil penalties of not more than $10,000 for certain offenses regarding the carriage of weapons. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(vi) states the authority to seek civil penalties of not more than $10,000 for each hazardous materials violation occurring before November 16, 1990, or a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 and not less than $250 for each violation occurring on or after November 16, 1990, in accordance with section 901(a)(1) of the FAAct and section 110 of the HMT Act. It further states the factors that must be considered by the agency in determining the amount of the civil penalty under the HMT Act. Proposed §13.16(a)(2)(vii) states the authority, for violations of section 404(d) of the FAAct, to seek a civil penalty of the amount specified in the FAAct, or an amount not to exceed $2,000. Part 13, Subpart G contains the rules of practice for hearings in cases initiated under §13.16. Section 13.201 of that subpart currently provides a partial list of the statutory provisions under which the FAA may assess civil penalties. The list is not completely accurate. For instance, reading §13.201(c) together with §13.210(a) may lead someone to conclude that the FAA cannot assess civil penalties in excess of $50,000 in cases under the HMT Act. This would be incorrect, as discussed above. The FAA proposes to remove the discussion of statutory authority from §13.201, and incorporate all such information in proposed §13.16(a) (1) and (2). Standard of Review Section 901(a)(3)(E)(ii) of the FAAct, as amended by §2(a) of the CPAA Act, enacts the standard by which the Administrator reviews the decisions of ALJs. That section provides that the only issues the Administrator will consider on appeal are: (1) Whether each finding of fact is supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence; (2) whether each conclusion of law is made in accordance with applicable law, precedent, and public policy; and (3) whether the ALJ committed any prejudicial errors that support the appeal. The FAA proposes to incorporate these standards in §13.233(b). With the exception of a reference to the ``FAA decisionmaker'' rather than the ``Administrator,'' the proposed change in §13.233(b) mirrors the language of the CPAA Act.
