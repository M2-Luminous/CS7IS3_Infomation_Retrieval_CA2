Experiments were carried out on (CBAxC57Bl)F[.sub]1[/] mice in cages with wire mesh on all four sides and HeLa cell (carcinoma of the human cervix) cultures in plastic vials placed (in a roofed area) directly on contaminated soil for 1-12 days, as well as control animals and cultures kept in a clean area, with the same climate, beyond the 30-km zone of the disaster area. Cytogenetic studies were carried out to determine HeLa survival rate, number of micronuclear and giant HeLa cells, which revealed that there was enhanced sensitivity of the cells to subsequent acute irradiation, demonstrable for 12-15 generations or more after exposure in the disaster zone, and it is a function of doses of chronic and acute radiation. Genetic studies were made of bone marrow somatic cells of experimental animals and revealed the most appreciable changes in number of aberrations per cell, and in chromosome type of aberrations, as well as lesions to bone marrow stem cells, disintegration of thymus chromatin indicative of interphase death, and decrease in peripheral blood leukocytes.
