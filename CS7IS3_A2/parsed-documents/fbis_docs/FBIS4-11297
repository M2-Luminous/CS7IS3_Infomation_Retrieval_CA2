Granados: "Another Wall Shows Its Cracks"] [Text] Havana [dateline as received] -- After leaving Cuba tired of economic difficulties or moving because of ideological discrepancies, or even for the sheer adventure of it, thousands of Cubans who migrated to the United States, Spain, and other countries have agreed to a movement effort, to be carried out this month, that will attempt to reach an agreement with authorities in Havana. Almost all of them have a common idea. "We are not people who want Cuba's destruction," asserted Caridad More Zulueta, who says she left for Miami in 1980 to ease her many problems prompted by the domestic difficulties she had to confront every day. "I say that many of us who left Cuba in the past 30 years did so more for domestic than for political problems," according to Caridad, usually called "Cachita," who is the president of the Afro-Cuban Cultural Rescue Group (REWACO) [Grupo de Rescate Cultural Afrocubano] in Miami. Not only those who attribute their decision to emigrate to economic reasons, however, have agreed to travel to Havana this month and discuss the measures that could be adopted to regularize their ties with the country, institutions, and relatives with Cuban authorities. On the list of approximately 200 guests to the conference on the nation and emigration, scheduled to be held 22-24 April, there are also veterans of the mercenary brigade that the United States launched unsuccessfully against Cuba in 1961, conspirators who tried to toppled Fidel Castro's government, and individuals who maintain an aggressive hostility toward the Cuban revolution in the past. They are the visible cracks in another wall that is about to fall. Many of those people, who show clear ideological differences with the Cuban Government, have decided to distance themselves from the extremist groups that favor the U.S. policy of asphyxiating Cuba with an economic blockade and other interventionist practices that could lead the island to a holocaust. "Even if we do not like it, Cuba has created a totally different society. A sudden change in that society, as the ignorant people in Miami dream, would be catastrophic," says Luis Ortega, an old Cuban journalist who resides in the United States and is known for his lack of affection for the government in Havana. According to some Cuban analysts, this conference could open the door to some progress in normalizing relations with a wide sector of the emigrants who did not renounce their links to the country, or conditioned it to some type of personal political aspirations or group interest. The spectrum determining an invitation to the conference has been well defined. The participants invited will consist only of those groups interested in solving issues related to emigration, the country's social situation, and opposed to the U.S. economic blockade against Cuba. In addition, invitations will also be determined by these groups' decision not to attach any conditions which may decide their participation. According to Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina's explanation to the media, those groups at either end of this spectrum are excluded because they have imprinted a "service record linked very closely to those who permanently question our existence as a nation." In reference to the subject of invitations to the meeting, Robaina dismissed the participation of Miami extremist groups which he described as "hysterical." Among these he mentioned the Cuban-American Foundation, which has been classified as an opposition group lacking any credibility since "deep down it is not genuine, but orchestrated by the United States." Nevertheless, according to an early April confirmation by a Foreign Ministry official, invitations have been extended to representatives of organizations who do not sympathize with the Cuban Government, such as Cuban Change and the Cuban Committee for Democracy. Maybe it has been the time element, frustration brought on by unsuccessful efforts, or simple nostalgia of being far away from "what belongs to one" which has prompted some of these groups to overcome long-lasting hatred as well as hostilities and cross over to the side of the moderate Cuban emigrants in the United States. This has been done even at the risk of being branded as "traitors" by their rivals in the more extremist groups. At any rate, the emigrant representatives have responded immediately to their attacks. "Traitors are not those who go to Cuba to observe and to listen... traitors are those who spend their time demanding Washington tighten the embargo to cause the people of Cuba to rise up against Castro in desperation. "That is a crime," says Ortega. According to Foreign Relations Vice Minister Jorge Bolanos, this conference, which is perceived as the second chapter of a dialogue held for the first time in 1978 between Cuban officials and representatives of the emigrants, will precipitate a process headed toward normalizing relations between those Cubans living overseas and the country's authorities. The normalization process can be complex, however. The conference responds to a consensus that intertwines approval from a majority sector of the Cuban population, and doubts by some people here who, as a result of old wounds, distrust, and a lack of understanding, still perceive the emigrants as a symbol of counterrevolution. In Havana, an official spokesman recently commented that there are some individuals still connected to radical sectors of the Cuban emigrants in the United States who are equally opposed to the dialogue and an understanding because "of their sick aversion to the word normalized as it relates to Cuba and the county's future." According to some of the leaders of the groups invited to the conference, one of the issues that can attract attention to the debate is the one related to regulations blocking an increase in visits by the emigrants to their country of origin. "The blockade should not extend within one's country," states Gilberto Solis, president of the Cuban-American Professionals and Entrepreneurs (PECA), one of the emigrant groups invited to the conference. Solis and other moderate leaders of the emigrant community insist on the double nationality issue, yet Cuban officials have explained that the issue is related to what's established in the Constitution and that any modification must be proposed by the National Assembly of the People's Government (Parliament) and approved in a plebiscite. At any rate, Vice Minister Bolanos recently disclosed that the authorities will bring up their proposals and other issues during the conference. "All issues will be open to discussions during the conference sessions," he added. To the Cuban authorities, the invitation to this conference is an opportunity for Cuban residents overseas to present their "legitimate concerns and aspirations" to the country in good faith. At the same time, the Cuban authorities point out that "there is no possibility for political manipulation or opportunities to intervene in affairs which, due to their very nature, only concern those who live, work and struggle in Cuba."
