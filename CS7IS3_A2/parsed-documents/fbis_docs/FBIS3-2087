And 64.9 percent of the export volume was achieved by the export of 14 major light industrial products, which yielded 19.46 billion U.S. dollars. The export volume of timepieces, household appliances, leather shoes, toys and plastic products surpassed 1.3 billion U.S. dollars each. The export volume of machinery and electronics products registered a sharp rise of 27.2 percent over the previous year. Yu Zhen, head of the China Council of Light Industry (CCLI), said that as a pillar of China's national economy, light industry has established a production network which can not only fulfill domestic demands, but also wield a certain competitive edge on the world market. As Yu put it, China's light industry will expand international cooperation, introduce advanced overseas technology and facilities, and further improve the quality of products. About 218 representatives from China's famous light industrial enterprises today signed a declaration here, to mark the "International Consumers Day", which was set to be March 15. The declaration pledged their determination to contribute to providing more famous-brand products.
