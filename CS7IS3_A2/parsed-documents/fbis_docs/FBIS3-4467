The bonds will mainly be purchased by banking institutions rather than individuals and non-banking institutions. The bonds will include three-year and five-year bonds. The interest rates will be slightly lower than those of the state treasury bonds of the same terms. Funds raised from the issuance of the bonds will all be used to finance key construction projects specified by state policy. Reportedly, the State Development Bank now only has headquarters and will not set up branches. Its credit business will be handled by the People's Construction Bank of China. Its funds mainly come from three sources: First, the capital and key construction funds allocated by the Ministry of Finance. Second, state-guaranteed bonds issued by the State Development Bank to the general public, and monetary bonds issued to banking institutions. Third, part of the deposits taken by the People's Construction Bank of China (which will be turned into a state-owned commercial bank).
