This was Anatoliy Chubays' comment at a Goskomimushchestvo [State Committee for the Management of State Property] collegium session on Moscow's intention to do away with voucher privatization. The last of the reformers promised to protect Muscovites from the capital's government. In his opinion, Goskomimushchestvo has enough levers of power to exhibit Moscow's largest and most attractive enterprises at the forthcoming check auctions. Otherwise the authorities will have to explain themselves to the president. The collegium spent the entire session in optimistic mood, anticipating a quick finish to voucher denationalization of the state economy. Goskomimushchestvo Deputy Chairman Dmitriy Vasilyev reported that 900 enterprises a month are being sold off for vouchers at auction. Which means that before 1 July another 4,500 firms will go under the hammer and we will be able to kiss good-bye to the state sector altogether. Perhaps the most absorbing question for everyone at the collegium was this: Where have all the vouchers gotten to? A group of directors from Tula is thoroughly exasperated by the local citizens who have absolutely no desire to surrender their checks to state enterprises. Such is life! It seems the vouchers have sailed away to other, more distant climes. One of the bosses of "Alfa-Kapital" frankly confessed in his speech to the collegium that there are almost 1 million vouchers lying in his storage vaults! Other speakers calculated that the largest commercial structures have relieved people of more than 20 million vouchers alone, and approximately 900 check and investment funds of various kinds popped up in 1993. However, "Alfa-Kapital" may appositely be compared to a big and hypertrophied version of Plyushkin [miser in Gogol's "Dead Souls"], hiding its vouchers in barns and lumber rooms. Businessmen are currently backing these structures in order to tap into the tastiest industrial morsels that will soon be up for grabs. Herein, basically, lies all the tension of the present moment: Who will get their hands on the state property? The refashioning of the state sector is almost over: Sector chiefs and Moscow mandarins are about to be deprived of their strongest authority -- the right to manage real estate. This authority is about to be transferred to independent commercial capital.
