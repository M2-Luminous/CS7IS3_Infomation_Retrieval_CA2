Proceeding From the Standard Certification is "the action of a third party which makes it possible to establish the conformity of qualitative characteristics, the quality of a given product or service, to requirements established by a particular document." In civilized countries networks of certification centers specializing in various types of goods and services are quite common. They provide clear-cut landmarks for the consumer in a crowded market for products. For an honest manufacturer this is the best opportunity for fair competition. Therefore, certification is a mechanism for regulating market relations in a competitive environment. On the contrary, in the absence of such mechanisms, the unbridled and completely uncontrollable, semibarbaric market cannot shape a civilized society in which the dignity of citizens is among the principal values. At present, we are at the very beginning of the path to this society. Here is the essence of the procedure being introduced, for those who have not managed to familiarize themselves with the Law "On the Certification of Products and Services" (approved by Decree of the Supreme Soviet No. 5153-1 of 10 June 1993), the work that preceded it in the Russian Federation Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Standardization, and other institutes and establishments. The legislation envisions certification of two types: compulsory and voluntary. Compulsory certification takes into account indicators concerning citizens' health, citizens' property, and environmental protection. It goes without saying that this type of certification is more than just necessary for many goods and services! A state organ, the Russian Federation Committee on Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, has undertaken to manage the implementation of certification. Any quality parameter may undergo so-called voluntary certification. This procedure is effected on the initiative of either the manufacturer or the consumer. Therefore, the voluntary nature applies rather to the selection of parameters, the form of certification, and so on. It may be foisted on many producers contrary to their wishes. In the simplest case, any producer (for example, a regular barber shop) may, having taken the state standard, sectoral standard, technical specifications, or even a list of requirements from, say, the United States or Mongolia as a basis, ask to be issued a certificate of compliance by the quality of his services with requirements outlined in the above regulatory documents. Undoubtedly, the multiplicity of such evaluations will hardly accomplish anything for the consumer, and it will play into the hands of those who will simply be able to hustle quickly, allocating some hundreds of thousands of easy-come rubles for certification. After all, millions are now being wasted on absolutely uninformative advertisement. Any producer may, at minimum cost, receive a "certificate of compliance" with anything. The beautiful piece of paper will hang in every business. Therefore, the consumer will once again end up sadly ignorant of the genuine quality of the goods and services offered to him. However, there is another possibility: establish a uniform base for comparisons for all, and issue certificates that indicate the level of quality--the degree to which the quality of the tested sample, merchandise, or service exceeds that of the selected base. Therefore, a "Quality Certificate" is the highest degree of certificate of compliance endowed with greater rights. It was precisely this path, the path of creating the optimal system of quality certification, that we took in developing the system of quality certification. Quality-Related Services Work devoted to evaluating the quality of services, i.e. an area that has until now been a "terra incognita" in a way, has now been completed. Following prolonged debate, a generalized nomenclature of quality parameters of services has been finally specified and adopted, which has provided the foundation for selecting a basis for comparison in the system of quality certification of services developed by us. Unlike the nomenclature of quality parameters of goods, services have four strictly delineated groups: the quality of the service proper, the standard of service, consumer spending for access, and, as a rule, the indirect effect (or loss) entailed by the principal effect. With a view to establishing regional centers (in oblasts, cities, republics...), a number of certification organs for popular services--insurance, apartment exchanges, tourism, repairs of radio and television equipment, and others--have to be registered with the Methodological Center of the Systems of Quality Certification of Goods and Services. Many such centers are already working with specific enterprises, and the latter will soon be able to receive the first quality certificates in our country. Detailed information about this will be provided in the mass media. Naturally, consumers will draw the appropriate conclusions from this. Contact telephone number 241-39-03.
