Collaborate in data collection strategies and in the analyses from these projects and other related activities. 4. Provide consultation in establishing standardized data collection and reporting systems to monitor program activities. 5. Provide up-to-date scientific information about VAW prevention. Evaluation Criteria Applications will be reviewed and evaluated according to the following criteria (maximum 100 total points): A. Background and Need (10 Points) The extent to which the community and target population are victims of, or are at risk for, violence and have been affected by injuries and deaths associated with such violence. The extent to which the applicant provides statistical summaries of the target population and community including demographics, morbidity and mortality data, and the availability of existing VAW prevention services. B. Community Access (10 Points) The extent to which the applicant has demonstrated an understanding of the population at risk, e.g., levels and patterns of risk behavior, and cultural and linguistic patterns in the community. The extent to which the applicant or full working partner has access to the target population and experience in the management and delivery of interventions at the community level. The extent to which the applicant has detailed its or a full working partner's history of working in the field of VAW or with the affected population. C. Collaboration (20 Points) The extent to which the applicant has demonstrated that a full working partnership for the design, implementation, and evaluation of the project has been established between_at a minimum_a community-based organization, a university or other institution of higher learning, and a State or local health department; also, the extent which the applicant or full working partner provides evidence of other, beneficial collaborative relationships between service providers and researchers, and between government, health, and community-based organizations who are or will be involved in the design, implementation, and evaluation of the project. Did the applicant submit organizational charts of collaborating agencies and institutions? Did the applicant establish culturally relevant and linguistically appropriate linkages in the community and with paraprofessionals? D. Goals and Objectives (10 Points) The extent to which the applicant's goals are clearly articulated and objectives are time-phased, specific, measurable, and achievable; the extent to which the outcome objectives intend to achieve a results-oriented program, measure the degree to which a multifaceted intervention program reduces the risk behaviors associated with VAW, and reduces the incidence of VAW in the community setting. E. Plan of Operation and Interventions (15 Points) The quality and specificity of the applicant's proposed plan to operationalize a program of interventions to prevent injuries and deaths associated with VAW. Based on information provided in this section, how realistic are the applicant's chances of achieving the stated program objectives and for successfully delivering interventions at the community level? To what extent the proposed interventions are realistic and meet the intended purposes of the funding? To what extent does the applicant describe the interventions and their linkages, provide evidence of applicability to the target population, and explain the interventions' capacities for producing the desired outcomes? How well does the applicant ensure the availability of staff and facilities to carry out the described program plan? F. Evaluation Plan (25 Points) How well the applicant describes the proposed evaluation design and the methods for measuring the processes and outcomes of individual interventions; how does the evaluation design purport to measure the degree to which these interventions collectively reduce rates of VAW at the community level. Does the applicant provide sufficient evidence of its or a full working partner's expertise and capacity to collaborate with program staff, identify/create and test appropriate instruments, and collect and analyze quantitative and qualitative data for measuring program effectiveness? How well does the applicant ensure the availability of staff and facilities to carry out the described evaluation plan? G. Project Management and Staffing (10 Points) The extent to which the management staff and their working partners are clearly described, appropriately assigned, and have appropriate skills and experiences. The extent to which the applicant or a full working partner has the capacity and facilities to design, implement, and evaluate a multifaceted intervention project. The extent to which the applicant provides details regarding the level of effort and allocation of time for each staff position. Did the applicant submit an organizational chart and curriculum vitae for each proposed staff member? Does the applicant provide details of involving personnel who reflect the racial and ethnic composition of the target group? H. Proposed Budget (Not Scored) The extent to which the budget request is clearly explained, adequately justified, reasonable, sufficient for the proposed project activities, and consistent with the intended use of the cooperative agreement funds. Funding Priorities Funding priority under this announcement will be given to: (a) Those applicants whose primary interest is in preventing violence against adolescent (12+ years of age) and adult women by persons known to the victim rather than by strangers, and (b) those applicants that plan to undertake primary prevention activities. Public comments are not being solicited regarding the funding priority because time does not permit solicitation and review prior to the funding date. Executive Order 12372 Review Applications are subject to the Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs as governed by Executive Order (E.O.) 12372. E.O. 12372 sets up a system for State and local government review of proposed Federal assistance applications. Applicants (other than federally recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. A current list of SPOCs is included in the application kit. If SPOCs have any State process recommendations on applications submitted to CDC, they should forward them to Henry S. Cassell III, Grants Management Officer, Grants Management Branch, Procurement and Grants Office, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 255 East Paces Ferry Road, NE., Room 300, Mailstop E&hyph;13, Atlanta, Georgia 30305, no later than 30 days after the application deadline date. (A waiver for the 60-day requirement has been requested.) The granting agency does not guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' State process recommendations it receives after that date.
