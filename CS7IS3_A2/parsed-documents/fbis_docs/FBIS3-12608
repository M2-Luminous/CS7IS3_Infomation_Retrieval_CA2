The sessions addressed bilateral ties and ways to develop them further. Mr. 'Asfur and Mr. Mahmud reviewed bilateral cooperation in the areas of energy and mineral resources and the progress made in linking Jordan, Syria, Turkey, Iraq, and Egypt in an electricity grid. They discussed the electricity grid link between Jordan and Egypt as part of the five-state chain. They also talked about the use of renewable energy and tapping solar energy for heating and power generating purposes. Also discussed was cooperation in harnessing wind to generate electricity. Jordan already has two such stations in al-Ibrahimiyah and Jurf al-Darawish and, in cooperation with Germany, is working on a third with a 1.2 megawatt capacity. Radi Ibrahim and the Egyptian minister met to discuss trade and the supply situation between the two countries. The Jordanian minister briefed the Egyptian minister and his delegation on his ministry's activities. Ibrahim told the Egyptian minister he would like to see bilateral trade increased, observing that, in the past, the exchanges lacked stability. Noting that the Higher Joint Jordanian-Egyptian Committee is due to convene after 'Id al-Fitr, the minister pointed to the need to draw up guidelines to boost bilateral trade. The Egyptian minister stressed the need to boost economic ties with Jordan and called for pan-Arab economic integration. He lauded the Ministry of Supply's key function of making basic food items available and stabilizing prices.
