According to the reports, aircraft without identifying markings conducted air raids on 6 and 16 January, which resulted in the death of a woman with a child and tens of wounded. The Tajikistan Resistance Council's headquarters confirmed that there had been deliberate air bombing attacks on the camps which, according to Western journalists' data, are home to about 20,000 refugees from the former Kurgan-Tyuba Oblast. This essentially is the first armed attack on the refugees. There was an incident in the spring of last year, when an attempt was made to poison the people in the Sakhi camp near Mazar-e Sharif. As a result of this action about 100 people died and 500 were brought to Afghan hospitals. A man who had poisoned the water, which was brought to the refugees in cisterns, was apprehended. He turned out to be a Tajik doctor, who said on Afghan television after being apprehended that the action had been conceived by Tajik special services. In just one year a cemetery set up near the Sakhi camp, which is located in the steppe, grew to about 1,000 graves. A correspondent of the Japanese newspaper ASAHI, who had visited the Sakhi camp, told of the extreme hardships of refugee life. Nevertheless, conditions at least are tolerable for the refugees in the Sakhi camp since it is the only camp monitored by the UN mission and the International Red Cross. Other camps in Afghanistan get their supply of food and necessary medical supplies from Muslim countries and organizations. However, the situation that emerged in connection with the bombardment of Tajik refugee camps in Kunduz is quite explainable. After the unsuccessful storming of Kabul undertaken in the early hours of 1 January, General Dustum's units, which represent Afghanistan's Uzbek population and are actively supported by the Government of Uzbekistan, are trying to shift the strike onto the camps. Most likely it is tied to a large-scale action conceived with the purpose of liquidating Tajik opposition in Afghanistan. It is possible that the air force that conducted the raids on the camps does not belong to General Dustum, since it is known that his helicopters and airplanes are on territory controlled by Dustum's adversary, Afghanistan's former minister of defense, Ahmad Shah Massud. This happened after General Dustum ordered an air raid on Kabul but the pilots--mainly Tajiks and Pashtuns by ethnic origin--sided with President Rabbani. According to Tajikistan Resistance Council information, the aircraft without identifying markings come from the north, from behind the former Soviet-Afghan border. The coordinating center of Tajikistan's democratic forces in the CIS countries has protested this action. The document distributed by it describes this as an attempt to derail the process of preparation for negotiations between the opposition and the current government in Dushanbe. There is no other explanation for terrorism against refugees. If this is the case, it becomes clear now that General Dustum has always supported a pro-communist coup in Tajikistan. The Tajik opposition believes that the United Nations and the entire world community should urgently investigate this incident and protect the refugees from an encroachment on their lives, whoever it comes from.
