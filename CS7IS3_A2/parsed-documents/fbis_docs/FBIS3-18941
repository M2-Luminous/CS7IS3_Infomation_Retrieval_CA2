That is what emerges from the report for 1993 that Bundestag Defense Commissioner [Alfred] Biehle presented to the public in Bonn on Tuesday [8 March]. Financial cutbacks in particular, but also questions that are still unanswered about which tasks the Bundeswehr could assume within the framework of the UN, as well as administrative obstacles and injustices in the course of the unification process, have imposed a burden on the inner cohesion of the Bundeswehr. "The motivation of many soldiers has been impaired," states Biehle's report. Biehle is full of praise for the Bundeswehr troops who were deployed in Somali and Cambodia. Their selection and training proved their worth. Their ability merits recognition and extensive praise. Biehle criticized the political leadership. He complained that after unification the Bundeswehr received three great tasks, but no political direction on how they were to be fulfilled. In particular, there was a lack of clarity about the availability of financial resources. These tasks were to reduce the size of the Bundeswehr to 370,000, to develop the armed forces in the new laender, and to restructure with a view to performing additional tasks. In view of the lack of consensus about the deployment of troops abroad, many soldiers feel that parliament, the government, and society are unable to provide certainty about the Bundeswehr's future tasks. Biehle said many soldiers found it difficult to trust politicians and their superiors. There was also criticism of the leadership of the Defense Ministry. Leadership also means that one can rely on decisions that have been made. Short-term changes in stationing decisions that were described as "binding" have caused uncertainty among troops. Only 20 percent of the married long-term and professional servicemen that are being transferred would move to new locations with their families, whereas 10 years ago the number was three times higher. The difficult housing situation is also a reason for this. That is why provision of housing must be considered a "top priority," said Biehle: "A family that is intact is an important source of strength for the soldier in his daily life." The report also points out that compulsory military service enjoys little support among the young men affected by it. About 30 percent of the young men in each conscription year receive exemptions, and a further 30 percent opt to perform civilian duties instead. The remainder just about satisfy the Bundeswehr's need for conscripts. In the perception of society and those eligible for military service, the importance of military service and alternative national service as something enshrined in the constitution is continually declining. People view the relationship between the two forms of service as a rule-and-exception issue. This is because 95 percent of applications for exemption from military service are granted. Whoever pursues the matter with determination does not have to do his military service. Today, there are 150,000 conscripts doing their basic service compared to 131,000 doing alternative national service. Biehle called for "boosting" the attractiveness of military service "so that military service can be maintained at all." As part of the austerity measures, those doing military service have seen a 14-percent reduction in entitlements, which means that their entitlements have been reduced more than those of any other social group. Biehle said it was "unbearable and intolerable" that soldiers who had previously served in the NVA [GDR's National People's Army] and were by chance promoted while training in western Germany received their full salaries while their comrades in the east received only 80 percent. The return of these soldiers to the east created a socially explosive situation. Biehle's report described relations between the main branches of the armed forces as "extremely critical." With the exception of units that are intended for deployment abroad, the Bundeswehr's personnel and material situation deteriorated significantly in 1993. Biehle stated that supplies of fuel and ammunition were insufficient to train troops properly. Some forms of firing range training such as "fire for effect" had to be abandoned altogether because of a lack of ammunition. Training at night had to be stopped after a short period of time, because of a lack of lighting. According to information from the officers and noncommissioned officers responsible for training, at the present time, there is only half the large-calibre ammunition needed to achieve prescribed training objectives. Even the training of infantry in the use of handguns was, in some cases, impossible because of a shortage of ammunition for maneuvers. Marksmen have had to indicate they have fired by saying "bang!" Because of a shortage of ammunition, trainers often had to use the words "bang!" or "detonation!" to indicate that a fuse had been ignited. Both trainers and those being trained found this ridiculous, states the commissioner's report. Complex battlefield maneuvers could not be practiced often enough, because of fuel economies and the need to save materiel. To prolong the life of equipment, all Bundeswehr units that do not belong to the crisis reaction forces intended for deployment abroad had to mothball half their equipment. In the case of the remaining equipment, shortcomings in maintenance increased significantly with shortages of spare parts becoming apparent. Biehle reports that some units had to wait three months for tank brake linings and some units had to wait 22 months for maintenance work to be carried out on armored reconnaisance vehicles. The Air Force has also experienced such deficiencies. "To preserve the state of aircraft," pilots' flight training hours have been reduced. Units stationed in eastern Germany have complained about receiving large items of equipment from the old laender that cannot be used or are in a bad state. The situation is compounded by the fact that soldiers responsible for maintenance have been inadequately trained. In addition, the periods of time spent on firing ranges by units that are not expected to be used for missions abroad have been reduced drastically. There is even a shortage of office equipment. Trainers have to pay for such equipment out of their own pockets in order to be able to teach. Finally, the effectiveness of training has been diminished because of the use of officers from Bundeswehr universities who have been inadequately prepared for teaching troops and are insufficiently motivated. Occasionally, one gets the impression they do not identify with their occupation. The declining physical condition of young people also has had a negative effect on training. "The discrepancy between assignments and available resources has prompted a feeling of resignation among many officers. Trainers rightly fear they will have to accept a loss of authority."
