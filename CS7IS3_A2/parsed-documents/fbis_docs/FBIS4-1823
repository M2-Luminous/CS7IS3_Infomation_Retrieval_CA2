The comment, from the Foreign Ministry, came despite reservations in Hong Kong about the proposal from the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC). Ministry spokesman Wu Jianfan also confirmed Britain would be denied a say in choosing the leadership of the first Special Administrative Region (SAR) government. "It is clear that the right to nominate and appoint the principal officials of the Hong Kong SAR government rests with the SAR chief executive and the central Government, respectively, rather than a case in which the candidates for principal officials will be nominated by the British side and then submitted for consultation with the Chinese side," Mr Wu said. He called on civil servants to put their hearts at ease, saying China would abide by the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. "The Chinese side sincerely hopes that the civil servants working in the various departments of the Hong Kong Government will rest assured and perform their duties, and will continue to render service for the Hong Kong SAR government and for the Hong Kong people after 1997," the spokesman said. But in Hong Kong, the Deputy to the Governor, Anson Chan Fang On- sang, said civil servants did not need to declare whether they wanted to stay beyond 1997: She said both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law made clear that civil servants could expect to remain in the service after 1997. Mrs Chan said the Government stood ready "at any time" to discuss civil service matters with China and hoped the discussions would take place "sooner rather than later". Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, Michael Sze Cho-cheung, said that if China chose not to discuss a "through-train" for the civil service, the Government could not force Beijing to do so. However, he said the Government would not give up persuading China to enter into talks simply because of the statement by the Foreign Ministry. "Consultation on the subject must be in the interest of Hong Kong," he said. "Just as when we consult them, we don't necessarily have to accept their view. The final say rests with us. By the same token, the boot is on their foot. Even if they discuss with us, they don't have to accept what we say." Notwithstanding the Foreign Ministry's statement, Mr Sze said his plan for preparing the new senior-level line-up would go ahead. "If there is a vacancy, I will still have to fill the post. We will do our best to find the best person for the job," he said.
