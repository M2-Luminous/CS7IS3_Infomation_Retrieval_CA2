El Tomate, which had been denounced by a Barranquilla judge as a judicial outrage, was overturned today by the Santa Fe de Bogota judge who reviewed the case. This is the first time this has occurred following negotiations between a prosecutor and a criminal. More than 15 days ago, on direct orders of the Justice Ministry, a Santa Fe de Bogota regional judge began to examine the sentence reduction agreement that the Prosecutor's Office had negotiated with El Tomate. Serious flaws were found which did not justify the sentence reduction that had been granted. According to the deal annulled today, Juan Diego Arcila Henao's 17-year-sentence for drug trafficking, illicit enrichment, and conspiracy to commit crime had been reduced to only four years for confessing, cooperating, and providing information. El Tomate's new sentence must now be decided. This is the first time a deal with a drug trafficking kingpin has been rejected. This newscast has also learned that in order to avoid new overly generous sentence reduction agreements between drug traffickers and prosecutors, a special oversight commission will be created to review legal proceedings against important capos.
