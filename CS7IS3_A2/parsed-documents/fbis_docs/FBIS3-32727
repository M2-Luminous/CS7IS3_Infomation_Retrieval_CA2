We wanted an alliance with several parties." Asked whether this failure might favor the opposition headed by the PRD, she replied: "Well, we are an alliance of four parties. I think it is the alliance with the most parties. We are organized. We will work and tour the entire country. We are sure we are going to be the winners."

Moscoso de Gruber said that Carles "is not a threat" to the Democratic Alliance formed by her party, the Authentic Liberal Party, the Liberal Party, and the Independent Democratic Union.
