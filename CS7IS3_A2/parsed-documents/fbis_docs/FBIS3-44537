Those are two of the targets unveiled here today by Agriculture Minister Liu Jiang at a national conference on rural work. The minister said that China has set the production targets for cotton at 4.85 million tons and oil-bearing crops at 17 million tons. According to the plan, China is also expected to produce more meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit this year. "In order to materialize the plan, priority of the agriculture and rural work this year will be given to increasing farmers' income, deepening rural economic restructuring and development of rural economy," said Liu. He called for stable production increases for grain, cotton, meat, fowl, eggs, milk, aquatic products, vegetables and fruit, and great efforts devoted to the development of the rural enterprises. Liu said that "the work of increasing farmers' income should be the core of agriculture and rural work at present and for the rest of the 1990s." To steadily increase farmers' income is the foundation for stabilizing the countryside and the whole society. "While paying close attention to raising farmers' income, efforts must be continued to reduce the financial burdens on farmers and to eliminate poverty," he added. Starting this year, China will take a series of measures to push ahead the restructuring of the farm produce circulation system and market construction, including allowing the market to determine grain prices, after the government has purchased the contracted 50 million tons of grain. In addition, China has started to set up a grain price protection system, a nationwide grain reserve system and a national fund for grain risks, all designed to protect the interests of grain producers when grain prices are too low to be profitable. Liu also talked about the plans to improve the existing agriculture policies. He said the central government also decided to earmark policy- based loans for economic development in China's major grain and cotton production centers, integration of trade, industry and agriculture in rural areas and development of rural firms in middle and west China. The minister added that the investment in agricultural technology research and commodity grain production centers made by governments at all levels will be increased. "Agricultural departments all over the country should try their best to induce governments at all levels, departments concerned, township and village collective economic units and farmers to increase their investment in agriculture."
