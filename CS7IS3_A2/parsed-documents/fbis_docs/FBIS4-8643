They discussed the situation in Bosnia and Russia's new proposals on overcoming the current Bosnian crisis caused by NATO airstrikes against Bosnian positions near Gorazde. In a brief statement to the press after the meeting, the Russian deputy foreign minister refrained from revealing the content of these proposals. They relate to halting hostilities and restoring normal life in Bosnia, which is a prerequisite for a political solution to the Bosnian crisis, he said. As an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from well-informed sources, a joint meeting of the Serb president, Bosnian Serb leadership, and the Russian Federation president's special envoy can be expected in the near future to discuss Russia's new proposals and determine the Serb side's relevant position.
