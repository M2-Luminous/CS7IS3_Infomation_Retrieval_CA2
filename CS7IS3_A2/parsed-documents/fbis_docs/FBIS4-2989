However, Liu Peng-chun, commissioner of the Bureau of Entry & Exit, told the press Thursday [14 April] that the government has not restricted local people from visiting their relatives on the mainland. "Visits to the mainland are handled in accordance with the statute on relations between people on Taiwan and the mainland," Liu said. "All that visitors are required to do is report to the government prior to their departure for the mainland." Nevertheless, he pointed out, plans by government agencies, including the ministries of education and interior, to invite 700 mainland professionals here have been halted. The Taiwan tourists killed in the Qiandao Lake disaster were found dead along with two mainland guides and six crew members aboard a burned pleasure boat that had been taking them across the lake, which is in the eastern mainland Province of Zhejiang, on March 31. Relatives of the victims and Taiwan media have speculated that the tourists were robbed and murdered before the boat was set afire. The incident strained relations between the two sides after Beijing refused to allow the relatives of the victims to return their bodies to Taiwan and limited their movement on the mainland earlier this week. Also on Thursday, Premier Lien Chan again ordered relevant government agencies to help the victims' relatives seek compensation from Beijing.
