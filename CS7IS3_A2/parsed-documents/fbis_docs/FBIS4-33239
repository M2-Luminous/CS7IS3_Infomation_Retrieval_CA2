FBIS4-33239 "drlat107_t_94003" FBIS-LAT-94-107 Daily Report 31 May 1994 Venezuela Spokesman Questions Amnesty International Report Spokesman Questions Amnesty International Report PA0306043694 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 GMT 31 May 94 PA0306043694 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [From the "Union Radio News" newscast] [Text] Speaking on behalf of the executive branch, Guillermo Alvarez Bajares, minister of the Central Information Office [OCI], has denied Amnesty International's predictions that very serious incidents will take place in Venezuela because of the socioeconomic situation the country is now facing. Vicente Briceno has this report: [Begin recording] [Briceno] The OCI minister downplayed Amnesty International's report that urges the government to be on the alert for social unrest that could emerge within the next few months. According to the government spokesman, there is no reason why such incidents, which would have a negative impact on democracy, should emerge in Venezuela. In turn, he said those who are forecasting chaos are harbingers of doom. [Alvarez] These predictions make no sense. We certainly respect Amnesty International, an international nongovernmental organization, and we respect its right and obligation to monitor human rights. Amnesty International prepared a report on Venezuela and pointed out there were human rights violations in Venezuela during the past few years. We find it unusual that an Amnesty International spokesman has turned his attention to Venezuela, because currently there are a great many opportunities to exercise all democratic rights. He is telling us, I do not know based on what, that we must be on the alert because of the crises that might arise in Venezuela within the next few months. [Briceno] In another turn of events, Minister Alvarez said he was pleased with the civic Lights Against Crime campaign, whereby Caracas drivers turn on the headlights of their cars to call attention to rising violence. The movement last staged a peaceful demonstration on 31 May. Alvarez also said he is not planning to request another Special Powers Law at the National Congress, and he recalled that the previous Special Powers Law was not requested by the Rafael Caldera administration.
