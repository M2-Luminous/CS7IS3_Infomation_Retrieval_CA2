This is because during today's news conference by his socialist, former nomenclature, comrades he might be subjected to an avalanche of questions reminding the PSM leader that not so long ago -- at the time when the Tudor Mohora-Adrian Paunescu duel had not yet been won by the latter -- he had stated: "There is no such thing as a National Bloc and I will conclude no agreements with Corneliu Vadim Tudor [chairman of the Greater Romania Party -- PRM]." Among other things, the secret pact concluded last week by the two parties, which consecrated the defeat of the Mohora faction and caused dissatisfaction among the members of the two parties, also comprises a joint project intended for the future: According to this, PSM and PRM should support a joint candidate in the next presidential elections, a person that conforms with the interests of both parties. The leaders of PSM and PRM concluded that pact, hoping that in Romania, in the same way as in Poland and more recently in Hungary, the possible early elections will be won by the Communists, that is, by them, because the ideologies of the parties they lead are parts of the red doctrine. However, Ilie Verdet and Corneliu Vadim Tudor seem to ignore the fact that so far Romania has been run solely by the former nomenclature. Regarding the candidate to the presidency the two parties envisaged for the 1996 presidential elections, he is, according to rumors, none other than the "tribune" himself [Corneliu Vadim Tudor]. Of course, only if by the time the elections are held he is still at large (he currently faces a total of approximately 200 legal suits.) However, the PDSR [Social Democracy Party of Romania] will certainly take all necessary measures to ensure that when the time comes, the Communists all over the country should favor one candidate alone to the supreme office in the state, namely Ion Iliescu.
