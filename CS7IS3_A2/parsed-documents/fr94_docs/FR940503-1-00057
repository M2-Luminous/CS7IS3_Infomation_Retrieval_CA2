Appendix A to Subpart BBB_Addresses for Petitions for Consideration and for Tips or Information Subpart BBB_Awards ยง65.571 Purpose and scope. (a) This regulation implements section 113(f), 42 U.S.C. 7413(f), the ``citizen award'' provision of the Clean Air Act, as amended (the Act). As authorized in section 113(f), of the Act the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the Agency) is authorized to pay up to $10,000, as may be available from appropriations, to any person who provides information or services leading to a criminal conviction or a judicial or administrative civil penalty, enforced under section 113, for any violation of Titles I, III, IV, V, or VI of the Act. The goal of the program is to encourage citizens to cooperate with and voluntarily assist the Agency's enforcement efforts and thereby deter noncompliance. (b) Providing information or services to the Agency by any person does not create any obligation on the Administrator to issue an award or to pay compensation for such assistance. Neither the Act nor these regulations create an entitlement to the payment of an award. The determinations whether to pay an award, and in what amount, are matters which remain by statute in the exclusive and unfettered discretion of the Administrator. ยง65.572 Definitions. The terms used in this part are defined in the Act or in this section as follows: (a) Administrative penalty. Any amount finally assessed, agreed or ordered to be paid into the U.S. Treasury pursuant to an administrative enforcement action under section 113 of the Act. (b) Certification of Eligibility. A statement signed by the person to be considered for an award attesting to having read the eligibility requirements and attesting that the person is not ineligible to receive an award. (c) Criminal conviction. A judgment of conviction entered in U.S. District Court on a verdict or finding of guilty, or by a plea of guilty, including a plea of nolo contendere, in an action brought under section 113 of the Act (as defined at 28 U.S.C. 2901(f)). (d) Judicial penalty. Any amount finally assessed, agreed or ordered to be paid into the U.S. Treasury by a court of the United States pursuant to a judicial enforcement action under section 113 of the Act.
