He explained that after NATO air strikes new reports about Serbian attacks on Gorazde appeared. He then discussed the issue at talks with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic who, in his turn, contacted Karadzic and the latter ordered to cease fire. Churkin believes that the fighting near Gorazde testifies that neither the Serbian nor Muslim military can be well controlled. "It is to be remembered that it were the Muslims who were the first to begin combat activities in Gorazde despite the fact that the region was proclaimed a safety zone by the UN", the Russian envoy stressed. In general the situation has become critical after NATO air strikes, according to Churkin. "A new element has appeared - the interference of the United Nations into the Bosnian conflict. There is a tendency of moving to a greater confrontation", he said and added that the major task is to avert the tendency and conclude a ceasefire agreement. Upon a request of Milosevic, Churkin is now heading to Pale, the capital of Bosnian Serbs, to "try and bring together the fragments of the Bosnian peaceful settlement". After the NATO air strikes Bosnian Serbs announced they stop any cooperation with the UN forces. "However, during our meeting with President Milosevic today an understanding was reached that the process could not go uncontrolled, that it is necessary to reach a ceasefire agreement which the sides failed to do over the last days", he said. "The talk is about an armistice along the whole of the frontline", the Russian envoy said. Churkin regretted that neither UN nor NATO had consulted Russia before the air strikes although they had enough time for that. However, Bosnian Serbs did not consult Russia either. They responded to all Russian requests that they had no plans regarding Gorazde and that there was no necessity for Russia to resort to serious actions to normalise the situation in the town, according to the Russian envoy. "All sides could have exerted efforts so that Russia did mediate. But this was not done", Churkin said. He did not rule out that NATO may resume air strikes on Bosnian Serbs. "At present no possible combat actions can be ruled out", he stressed.
