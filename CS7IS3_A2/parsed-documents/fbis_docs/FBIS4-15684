The letter to Kristovskis and Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs, published by several day newspapers recently, complained of attempts by organized criminals to control the press. Last month, people were beaten up publicly in the Press House and offices of newspapers and the Press House administration threatened, according to the letter. The authors of the letter demand that the Interior Ministry ensures the security of the 20-storey Press House, which houses offices of numerous editions, as well as a large printing office. Kristovskis said that he had heard about the events in the Press House but received, so far, no claims as a minister. In addition, the publication of the open letter may have create wrong impression that the Interior Ministry refuses to perform its duties, Kristovskis said. Kristovskis says he read the letter only in newspapers but never received it himself.
