Among the applicants in the queue we find also the metropolitan administration's television station. According to the intentions of its founders, it will have also a public-service role, but after a time it is to become self-supporting. Gyorgy Nej interviewed Metropolitan Mayor Gabor Demszky about the plans for the TV station and, naturally, about related media matters as well. [Nej] The metropolis [Budapest Metropolitan Council] has filed an application for a frequency allocation. But recently the newspapers reported that the metropolis has received a temporary license for trial operation, valid for three days. Are we dealing with two separate matters, or do the two items pertain to one and the same thing? [Demszky] The issue is the same in both cases. The metropolis has formed a broadcasting corporation, with an initial capital of 100 million forints. The metropolis is the principal shareholder, with 99 percent of the equity, but a foundation is also a shareholder. The foundation's board of trustees comprises the metropolitan clerk and the directors of the metropolitan public utilities. The foundation was established in the late 1980's and is called Television Broadcasting for Budapest. The foundation and the broadcasting corporations have filed separate applications for frequency allocations. A combination of land-based television broadcasting and cable TV is involved in the first instance; and in the second instance, an opportunity for direct reception, to which every resident who owns a TV set and an ordinary TV antenna will be able to tune in. With the judging of the applications and the allocation of frequencies, the state's monopoly of the electronic media will essentially cease. I think it is also very much in the government's interest that henceforth nobody be ever able to say that in Hungary there is only government-operated television, financed and controlled by the state. A Media Charter From Europe? [Nej] Yet how is it possible that the five-member licensing committee consists exclusively of persons whom the government has somehow placed in office? They include the prefect of Budapest with the rank of state secretary; a close associate of the late Jozsef Antall; a deputy state secretary; a jurist from the Ministry of Justice; and someone else appointed to similar office. [Demszky] As an applicant, it would not be in my interest to analyze the government's considerations that have led to this situation. There are jurists on the committee, probably because of the argument that this is a legal question that must be decided. Of course, this is merely my assumption. Obviously, however, you should be putting this question not to me but to those who appointed the members of the committee. And you should ask also the committee members as to why specifically they have been chosen. But I believe that all this goes far beyond the committee's competence and jurisdiction, which is actually the issue here. Thus when I seek government considerations of greater importance and say that this is in the government's interest, I do so because, on the one hand, I am familiar with the international responses to the clashes in Hungary's media war, and to the government's actions in this matter. And on the other hand, because I attended the Strasbourg Conference sponsored by the Council of Europe and the European Union, where this question was on the agenda. The state of the media in the countries of East and Central Europe was discussed, on the basis of a report that presented a thorough analysis of the situation. The matter of the media in East Europe is a political issue of sufficient importance to warrant that the Council of Europe adopt an international charter to serve as a guide for these erring democracies, on how to create independent electronic media, how far government influence over them may extend, and to what that influence may relate at all. In my opinion, incidentally, government influence may relate only to financing. An international charter could spell all this out in the form of recommendations. This could be of considerable help, and not just to Hungary. After all, this problem exists in the neighboring countries as well. The charter could contribute also toward easing domestic political tensions, and the government ought to consider it for that reason as well. [Nej] On the basis of all this, how do you assess the metropolitan administration's chances of obtaining a frequency allocation? [Demszky] The metropolitan administration's prospects for obtaining a frequency allocation in the near future are very good. For the metropolis, by applying for a frequency allocation, wants to provide useful information for the benefit of local residents, as a public service. In addition, it wants to concern itself with political matters that affect the lives of Budapest residents. And there are also economic reasons why we may be hopeful. The venture is well provided with capital. A Billion Forints To Start With [Nej] Is there more money than just the 100 million forints? [Demszky] Much more. About ten times as much. Which can truly guarantee that this television station will be able to stand on its own feet and finance its own programs even during the transitional period until it becomes self-supporting. According to the television station's business plans, it will be able to support itself on revenue from commercials. [Nej] And will it be public-service television, financed by the metropolis and some foundation respectively, or will it be commercial television that is partially self-supporting? [Demszky] It will be commercial television that broadcasts also public-service programs. In other words, the television station's structure will be a mixed one. The metropolis will establish the television station and hold a certain amount of equity in it, but will not have a majority stake. We do not want to continue financing the station with ever newer grants each year; instead, we would like to see it become self-supporting. At the same time, through our share of equity, we would like to attain a degree of participation in the corporation that will enable us to prevent its dissolution. In other words, to prevent the majority shareholder from pushing through at anytime a resolution for the corporation's dissolution. And we also want to be able to influence programming policy in a way that will preserve by all means the station's public-service nature. [Nej] The Budapest Metropolitan Council's application for a frequency allocation has met with opposition from the very outset, even within the council itself. The objections against it were that the station would be oppositionist, and its promoters would include also persons like George Soros, for instance, who is not exactly popular among people to the right of our government circles. Another objection was that the television station would be using public funds, but its operation would be managed primarily by members of the opposition with liberal leanings. How can all this be organized, and where will the money come from? [Demszky] Primarily the First Hungarian Investment Fund will provide the money, although also George Soros will actually invest a smaller amount. The Budapest television station will broadcast public-service programs locally, rather than nationally, which automatically excludes the station's ability to compete with the national electronic media. And the station will not be oppositionist in the sense that the opposition parties, and oppositionist tone and ideology will be the dominant in it. It would be foolish to strive for that. And not just because the ruling party has warned against it, but also because we are learning from the bad example. Aside from all that, party television, politically influenced, proselytizing or strongly ideological television, is simply bad television. [Nej] But it can be assumed that you people would want to offset what, many people claim, is happening in the public-service electronic media. [Demszky] I wish to repeat, that is not possible. After all, our area coverage is much smaller, to begin with. The solution is simple: one has to offer good television broadcasting. [Nej] By the way, how did the Metropolitan Council vote on the proposal to establish the television station? [Demszky] The SZDSZ [Alliance of Free Democrats], FIDESZ [Federation of Young Democrats] and MSZP [Hungarian Socialist Party] voted for the proposal. The governing parties were against it. I do not remember exactly how many votes there were for and against respectively. But the proposal did pass, with a qualified majority. Anyone who expects to earn revenue from commercials cannot afford to be biased or to have proselytizing tendencies. Instead, he must strive primarily to satisfy the viewers' demands. Expo and the Metropolis [Nej] The year of Expo is approaching. This television station could easily turn metropolitan residents against Expo, but it could also support Expo just as easily. Since the metropolitan administration is not exactly Expo-friendly, what will its television station do? [Demszky] We have to get ready for 1996, to welcome the four million people who foreseeably will visit Expo. We are not denying that, and it would be foolish to do so. It is in the interest of the metropolitan administration to have the necessary infrastructure in place by then. Because, on Expo's account, the metropolitan administration will be able to obtain developmental resources [from the government]. In other words, this way the metropolitan administration will be able to build more than if the construction projects were financed solely from its own resources. This is something we have always emphasized. The problem was that the metropolitan administration did not receive any developmental resources during the past two years, because an agreement was lacking between it and the program bureau. In other words, there was no decision on who would be responsible for which investment projects, whether financing would be time-commensurate or based on performance, and so forth. Now only a hairsbreadth separates us from an agreement that clarifies these questions, and in 1994 the metropolitan administration will receive 6 billion forints for development, from the funds appropriated for Expo. In addition, the metropolis will also receive budgetary grants. We will have no objections if the television station presents these investment projects and shows that the work is actually progressing. After all, that too is news about our city. [Nej] Is it possible that you will be getting a frequency allocation merely to make the metropolis interested in staging Expo? Is this actually political bargaining? This way the metropolitan administration will also get its 6 billion forints... [Demszky] Last summer and autumn the government actually realized that the metropolis was in a bargaining position. Therefore the fiscal administration decided to provide grants for us, over and above the appropriations for Expo. Actually the metropolis is being compensated for losing its 35-percent share of the revenue from individual income tax collected on its territory. We are indeed bargaining continually. [Nej] Is the television station included in the deal? [Demszky] In the form of a frequency allocation, the television station is not a part of this deal. [Nej] From where will the television station recruit its professional staff? If someone at PESTI HIRLAP, for instance, wanted to work for the liberal metropolitan administration's television station, regardless of who controls it, would he get a job? Or would someone from a liberal workshop have a better chance of getting the same job? [Demszky] The metropolis has 290 institutions, but I have never yet interfered in their personnel policies. Nor in what activity an institution ought to pursue. Of course, there is an abundant supply of unemployed professionals on the labor market, and therefore it will not be difficult to assemble a team. Incidentally, the team has partially been assembled already. Only one name has been made public so far: Janos Betlen will be the station's news editor. Naturally, he has been chosen by the station's general manager, and not by me. Thus the metropolitan administration must be aware of its exact limits, and neither the metropolitan mayor nor the [Metropolitan Council's] media committee may interfere in questions of editorial or programming policy. Aside from enforcing one aspect: namely, that the television station must broadcast also metropolitan public-service programs. [Nej] The addressee of the temporary license for trial operation during the Christmas holidays is TV-3 Budapest. Will that be the name of the metropolitan television station also in the future? [Demszky] There is no final decision on this question as yet. That too will have to be clarified at the next meeting of the media committee. The strategic investor will also have to be consulted on what name would be acceptable to him. Regrettably, the call sign BP-1 is already reserved. That will also have to be taken into consideration in our final decision regarding the station's call sign.
