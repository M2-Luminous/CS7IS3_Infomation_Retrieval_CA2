The nation pinned high hopes on this unionist step because it rested on genuine popular and national support. The nation also took pride in the struggle of the sons of this time-honored part of the greater homeland in order to regain the unity of their homeland and bring about a new, happy birth to Yemen that would rid Yemen of the traces of the divisions that distorted its national and pan-Arab character. The nation also viewed with high appreciation the readiness demonstrated at the time to rise to the level of historic action that, alone, is enough to guarantee the soundness and success of any unionist step. The climate was favorable for this unity to proceed amid national and pan-Arab challenges, equipped with popular will and determination to overcome difficulties that could obstruct its march to build a unified, prosperous Yemen that serves pan-Arab interests. This step came in response to objective needs and aspirations cherished by everybody to transcend long decades of loss and foreign colonialism and influence. These aspirations were supported by popular will and determination to rebuild the political, social, economic, and cultural life in a manner that ensured promoting unity, overcoming backwardness, and making use of the lessons of previous unity attempts. This was meant to immunize the new step against the dangers of the return of personal whims and interests that represented fragmentation and backwardness and were the main cause for fragmentation on the level of the Arab nation. Great and intensive intellectual and practical efforts were exerted to enhance the foundations of Yemeni unity so that it would derive motivation from the national and pan-Arab spirit of the people of Yemen to develop, succeed, and express the readiness of the sons of this people to defend it with all that is precious to them. However, the remnants of the mentality of fragmentation and its interests, as well as the external forces of intervention, have played a role in obstructing well-meaning efforts and in sowing the seeds of discord and premeditated intentions to derail the unionist step. It is not easy for the nation to watch this bloody scene that jeopardizes the unity and the hopes pinned on it. The Yemeni unity revived the nation's hopes and inspired optimism on the part of the Yemeni people. However, the bloody incidents now threaten all of this and threaten the shared national destiny of the people of Yemen. Sons of Arabism in Yemen: Unity has a permanent rule, namely, the need for everybody to rise above their personal whims and interests and narrow calculations. Unity cannot be achieved and will not last as a factor of strength unless it takes inspiration from the spirit of the people and determines to contribute to the unity of the nation. Thus, unity cannot achieve its objectives unless it daily discovers formulas to embody popular will in building a prosperous homeland that achieves its national objectives through integration with the nation's objectives. The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party has always viewed itself as the party of unity and has always worked to develop the idea of unity. The party, whose political, organizational, and militant course is based on the interest of the nation as a whole, finds itself--vis-a-vis what is taking place in Yemen--dutybound to caution against the serious peril that endangers the Arab destiny. The contemporary pan-Arab and unionist struggle march records that the Ba'th Party has offered generous sacrifices and martyrs for unity and that it gives priority to unity and the unionist feeling. From this premise, the Ba'th Party announces to the nation and the Yemeni people that it supports unity and that unity is the most important and most cherished objective. The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party announces its solidarity with the struggler Yemeni people for the sake of safeguarding their unity, and rejects every reason, act, or justfication that encroaches on the entity of unity. The Arab Socialist Ba'th Party appeals to all the national forces operating in the Yemeni arena, and the Arab forces throughout the Arab homeland, to stand with Yemen's unity and with the Yemeni people, and against all foreign attempts to interfere in the affairs of Yemeni unity. O Yemenis who are genuinely patriotic and pan-Arab: We support you in confronting this danger which threatens the Yemeni national destiny. We appeal to you to abide by unity as a sacred slogan to confront this tribulation and end the sedition and the conspiracy against unity. Let abidance by unity now be a yardstick to which all of you will resort to judge the behavior of individuals and groups and to judge their stands and whether these stands are close or remote from you, and from the unionist objectives and aspirations you have for your country. Only with a national spirit and pan-Arab awareness can the sons of Yemen bury the conspiracy against their national unity and tackle the bloody incidents with a determination to transform the blood that is being shed into lessons for the assimilation of Yemeni unity and a price for moving out of these tragic events into a state of affairs that will consolidate the pillars of the unionist experiment and that will enable it to better express its national and pan-Arab essence. That's why we call on all the active and good forces and the masses of our Yemeni people who are famous for their national and pan-Arab stands to confront all that threatens unity. Noble Yemeni people, let all the windows be closed in the face of the ill-winds of the conspiracy against Yemen's unity and in the face of the foreign forces which tamper with Yemen's national fate and the foreign schemes which threaten the future of Yemen and the nation. Let the will of the strugglers unite on this basis to check this bleeding and to establish a nationalist unionist spirit that will protect Yemen and its unity, and that will embody the people's determination to enhance the entity of unity that was forged by sacrifices, martyrs, and positive efforts, and the noble aspirations encompassing national and pan-Arab objectives. Greetings to the noble and united Yemeni people. Greetings to the martyrs of the Yemeni unity and the Arab nation.
