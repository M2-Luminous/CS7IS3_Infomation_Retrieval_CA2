FR940426-1-00107 FR940426-1-00011 The agency has examined a number of different vehicles that provide some means of adjusting the shoulder belt portion of the safety belt. For example, Volvo offers a design in which the shoulder belt webbing is fed through a slot in the pillar at different angles as increasing amounts of webbing are spooled off the retractor. A number of manufacturers offer a design in which the upper anchorage can be manually moved vertically to a set number of positions. Mercedes Benz offers similar designs which adjust automatically as either the seat or head rest position is adjusted. Another design used to maintain proper shoulder belt position is a design in which the inboard anchorage is mounted on the seat and moves with the seat, while the outboard anchorage is mounted on the vehicle chassis. Some manufacturers have chosen to use both an upper adjustable anchorage and an inboard movable anchorage on the same safety belt. NHTSA believes that all of these designs offer good degrees of adjustment. In addition, some manufacturers have safety belts integrated with the seats. While the anchorages for these belts are not adjustable, this type of belt appears to provide a good fit for a wide range of occupants because the upper and lower anchorages maintain a constant position relative to the seat and the occupant, regardless of the seat adjustment. As a result of being on the seat, the upper anchorage is typically farther forward relative to the occupant than is the upper anchorage for belts that are neither adjustable nor integrated. As a result, the belt does not ride as high as it attempts to seek the straightest line between the anchorages. As discussed previously in this notice, the agency's research noted this problem with belt anchorages that were far behind the occupant. Therefore, NHTSA is proposing that a Type 2 safety belt must either be equipped with an adjustable anchorage or be integrated with the seat. Some commenters stated that a general requirement that belts be adjustable would not be effective because it would allow manufacturers to call any design with any degree of movement an ``adjustable'' belt. They could do this even if the amount of adjustability did not improve safety belt fit for many occupants. NHTSA has observed some safety belt designs that might be considered meeting a broad definition of ``adjustable'' (e.g., rotating D-rings), but which NHTSA believes do not offer sufficient adjustment to ensure that the belts would fit a wide range of occupants. Agency research found that on eight different designs of upper adjustable anchorages, the overall anchorage travel ranged from 5.8 centimeters to 10.1 centimeters. For inboard movable anchorages, the anchorages all moved more than 19 centimeters, always the entire distance of seat travel. Conversely, the rotating D-rings provide no travel. Therefore, the value of five centimeters appears to be a reasonable lower limit for anchorage adjustment. For this reason, NHTSA is specifying that manufacturers installing a means of adjustment must use designs that provide at least five centimeters of adjustability. NHTSA believes that all of the effective designs discussed above provide at least this amount of adjustment. Most of the adjustable belts currently available are installed at front seating positions. For the rear seats, NHTSA is aware of General Motor's ``Child Rerouter.'' This design utilizes a clip through which the shoulder belt can be routed to change the shoulder belt angle. NHTSA is also aware of the integrated safety belt on the rear seat of the Volvo 850 station wagon. Also, a few Mercedes Benz models (300S, 300SE) incorporate automatically adjusting shoulder anchorages in the rear seat. NHTSA requests comments on various designs that may be used to comply with the proposed requirements in the rear seats, the practicability of these designs, and the costs of these designs. NHTSA requests comments on the need for better belt fit for adults at rear seating positions. As discussed previously in this notice, NHTSA's research shows that this requirement alone will not be sufficient to address belt fit problems of small children. The agency believes that the need exists for the use of belt-positioning child booster seats or another means of achieving a good fit, adjustability of the safety belt alone is not sufficient. The agency has recently published an NPRM, also mandated by the ``Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991,'' to address issues related to belt-positioning child booster seats (58 FR 46928; September 3, 1993). The NPRM proposed to amend Standard No. 213, ``Child Restraint Systems,'' to permit the manufacture and sale of belt-positioning seats by removing the impediments in the current standard to the production of these seats. The proposal included a test procedure and labeling/informational requirements. The comments received on that notice are currently being evaluated by the agency.
