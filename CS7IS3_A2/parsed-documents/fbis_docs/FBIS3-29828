President Kim Il-song in his historical letter reviewed the glorious course of struggle covered by the Korean young people and their immortal contributions to the advance of the Korean revolution and gave a comprehensive exposition of the fighting tasks facing the Korean people and youth to meet the requirements of a new, higher stage of the developing revolution and ways for their fulfilment. President Kim Il-song said that the young people should support the leadership of the party with loyalty, united in one mind around Comrade Kim Chong-il, and thoroughly establish the party's leadership system in the league. Chairman of the Central Committee of the LSWYK Choe Yong-hae in his report at the meeting said that the letter is an immortal great programme of the youth movement indicating the way to be followed by the socialist youth movement and a highly important work giving the conviction of victory and courage to the world's revolutionary people and youth. The reporter referred to a new upswing effected in the work of the LSWYK and a great change in the ideological and spiritual traits through energetic efforts to implement the tasks set forth in the letter. "The officials of the LSWYK and the young people are now striving hard to prepare themselves to be young vanguards defending the party and the leader in the van with their lives and lifeguards and death-defying corps defending and glorifying Korean-style socialism centred on the popular masses, holding aloft the slogan `Let us uphold the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il with singlehearted unity!' and loudly singing the song `No Motherland Without You'", the reporter said, and stressed: "All the young people should firmly prepare themselves to be true vanguard fighters unfailingly loyal to the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, united around him in one mind in order to carry through the tasks set forth in the historical letter of the great leader President Kim Il-song and successfully carry forward the revolutionary cause of chuche to completion."
