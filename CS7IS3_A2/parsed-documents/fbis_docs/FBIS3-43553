He said in a SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] television interview such a move would lead to other ethnic groups demanding their own separate entities and the break up the country. "(We) will be breaking up South Africa into a number of different political entities which will destroy the economy," he said. "We are against an ethnic solution," he said, adding granting Afrikaners their demand for a volkstaat would inspire other groups whose homelands have been reincorporated into South Africa presenting similar claims. But he said he was continuing talks with Conservative Party and Afrikaner Volksfront [Afrikaner National Front] leaders discussing their demands for self-determination. He also said his organisation would press ahead with efforts to persuade the Freedom Alliance to take part in the forthcoming elections. The Inkatha Freedom Party has announced it will not take part. Asked to state his message to South Africans, Mr Mandela called for reconciliation. "We would like a spirit of reconciliation to be accepted by all South Africans. We are not here for retribution, we are here to try to contribute to the building of of a new South Africa," said Mr Mandela.
