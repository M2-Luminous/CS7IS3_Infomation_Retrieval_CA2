In this thesis, I will use the general term "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty" for the cooperative relationship concerning the security of the United States and Japan, which is based upon the so-called old security treaty and the current security treaty. This has not changed even following the end of the Cold War. But the environment surrounding the cornerstone--the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty--has greatly changed in the post-Cold War era. Responding to this change, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should change its nature. Compared to the Cold War era when security was a global concern, regional security issues are gaining importance in the post-Cold War world. Therefore, determining what part it should play in relation to regional security problems will be an important key for the future of the U.S.-Japanese Security Treaty. I want to analyze the functions of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in the Cold War era and to discuss the role the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should fulfill for the security of the Asia-Pacific region in the future. Four Functions of U.S.-Japan Security Treaty When we hear the term U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, we tend to think of defense cooperation issues between the United States and Japan. Certainly that is the core of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. But security matters today should be understood to include the economic prosperity of the people. Also, because the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has made bilateral cooperation possible in a wide area, including the political and economic spheres, it is significant for these two countries. I will divide the functions of the treaty into four groups, analyze each function during the Cold War era, and discuss the role each should fulfill in terms of regional security. (1) Maintenance of Economic Cooperation Relationship For the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, cooperation in economics is an important pillar. Article 2 of the current security treaty provides that "the parties will contribute toward the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations by strengthening their free institutions.... They will seek to eliminate conflict in their international economic policies, and will encourage economic collaboration between them." Also, in the old security treaty, although there was no prescribed article, policies the United States adopted to promote Japanese economic self-sufficiency--such as market opening for Japan, support for Japanese entrance into GATT, support for economic exchange between Southeast Asia and Japan, and so on--reflected the fundamental policy of economic cooperation between the United States and Japan. Japan had also chosen the West's free economic system to bring about the recovery of the Japanese standard of living after the war. When the old security treaty was concluded, the basis of Prime Minister Yoshida's judgment was his conviction that Japan's recovery was possible only within a Western framework, mainly of the United States and Great Britain. Even after Japanese export competitiveness became strong, and economic friction between Japan and other advanced capitalist countries had begun, the common objective of the "solidarity of the West" contained this friction within a controlled framework during the Cold War. After the "oil shock," platforms such as summits were erected, and a posture of solving economic issues by cooperation was adopted. This resulted from the recognition of the necessity for Western unity against the East. Today the combined U.S.-Japan GNP accounts for about 40 percent of the world's total GNP, so continued economic cooperation by these two countries is indispensable for world stability. But in international politics, it is not easy for two strong counties to cooperate. Since the fall of the Soviet Union and East European communism, the importance of economic strength in international politics is recognized. It is possible that economically strong countries will become more conscious of each other as rivals. We cannot be too optimistic about future economic cooperation between the United States and Japan. This tendency will become more pronounced since the goal of "Western unity" disappeared when the Cold War ended. The argument that "Japan is different"--which was popular a while ago--may be seen as one of the indications of such a trend. But when sights are shifted from the Cold War context of the "West" to the context of the Asia-Pacific region, economic cooperation between the United States and Japan has new significance. The ministers conference/unofficial leadership conference by APEC (Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) held in Seattle last November revealed how importantly economic prosperity is viewed in the Asia-Pacific region. There were certainly some differences of view about the way in which concrete economic cooperation should be achieved, as seen in the absence from the leadership conference of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir. But recognition that each country's own economic development is vital, and as a precondition that an open economic system is necessary, are becoming common ideas in each country within the region. Chinese President Jiang Zemin attended the leadership conference, along with representatives from Taiwan and Hong Kong. This symbolizes how much importance the Asia-Pacific countries place on economics. Such strengthened recognition that a peaceful international environment is necessary for each country's own economic development could become a useful tool in securing future peace in the Asia-Pacific region. In such a case, it will also be indispensable for regional security that the two economic powers--the United States and Japan-- maintain a relationship of economic cooperation. Looking at it in another way, we can point out that an expanded Asia-Pacific economy will make U.S.-Japan economic cooperation easier. First, by the expanded economy in this region, the two countries' economic relationship will shift from a "zero-sum" to a "plus-sum" situation. Both countries need markets to maintain employment and capital investment to maintain competitiveness. Under such circumstances, the most promising way to benefit the two countries today would be to expand their market in the Asia-Pacific region, and at the same time transfer funds and technology through investment and assistance. Second, it is possible the different economic structures within the United States and Japan could be reinterpreted as representing "diversity" for the region. This contains a more positive connotation. Post-war economic development was based on a horizontal trade structure among developed countries. But for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific countries, differences of contributing conditions--such as natural resources, technology, population, and so on--are providing the dynamism. In such circumstances, it may be rather desirable for the region if there are two different approaches, namely that of the United States which values the open market and investment opportunities, and that of Japan which values social stability. In essence, to maintain U.S.-Japan economic cooperation by its becoming a precondition for regional economic prosperity will result in fulfilling its role of promoting regional security. It also has the reciprocal benefit that regional prosperity will make U.S.-Japan cooperation easier. (2) Offering a Political Framework One of the pillars of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was to oppose the Communist political structure, to point the direction of liberal democratic political structures, and to cooperate for strengthening such efforts. The characteristics of this security treaty meant the Japanese political direction was kept within the "Western" framework, which was formed during the Cold War with the United States as the leader. To be in this framework brought Japan a number of benefits. First, by leaving the political leadership of international society to Europe and the United States, and by concentrating on economic prosperity, it was possible to avoid domestic political confrontation. Prime Minister Ikeda's policy of doubling income is one good example. Second, Japanese participation in the Western framework also made Japan's return into international society easier. For instance, the ANZUS [Australia-New Zealand- United States] Treaty concluded in 1951 was the price the United States paid to gain support from Australia and New Zealand for a U.S. peace treaty with Japan. As a matter of fact, in the preamble of this treaty it was mentioned that U.S. forces would be stationed in and around Japan, as well as in the Philippines and the Ryukyus (as they were referred to at that time). In other words, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was a kind of guarantee the United States gave to other Asia-Pacific countries that Japan would not depart from the Western framework, and was a part of the framework which permitted the post-war Japanese return to the international scene. Of course we cannot deny there was another aspect. That was the feeling that, in exchange for a peace treaty, Japan was brought into the order of the "West," of which the United States was the leader. This created dissatisfaction in the Japanese psyche of self-pride. The revision of the treaty carried out under the Kishi Cabinet aimed at satisfying the Japanese sense of independence by using the term "U.S.-Japan on an equal footing." The reversion of Okinawa, achieved by the Sato Cabinet, was done to satisfy the self-pride of the Japanese people. Also, the negative reaction Japanese displayed a few years ago when the U.S. Marine Corps commander in Okinawa reportedly described the significance of the U.S. forces in Japan as a "cap on the bottle" which prevented Japanese remilitarization, seemed from a Japanese perspective to be another confirmation that the United States still maintained the leadership. In fact, when we analyze the history of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, there are more than a few occasions when the United States made concessions to Japan. Despite the fact that the size of the Japanese Self-Defense Force in the 1950's was far smaller than what was required by the United States, Japan was able to receive American aid. As for Okinawa, Japan's "residual sovereignty" was recognized at the time of the peace treaty. At the time of Okinawa's reversion, Japan maintained its condition of "no nuclear weapons, the same as on the Japanese mainland." But because the stationing of U.S. forces has continued since the occupation, the original image the Japanese had of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty does not seem to have changed much. Moreover, when the relative economic strength of the United States and Japan approached parity, unhappiness both inside and outside the country increased because Japan would not seek to make politically oriented statements. When Japan was expected to shoulder burdens in the security field corresponding to its economic strength, domestic political decisions also became necessary. Other countries have also come to feel uneasy because Japan, which has a large economy, does not clarify its political positions. The system of dividing the work--politics by the United States and economics by Japan--lacks rationality, and the political role which Japan should play is beginning to become an issue. Since the end of the Cold War, the "Western" framework is losing its significance, so it is possible this trend may be further strengthened. Naturally, it is desirable that Japan actively express its political position. But it should not be regarded as a bilateral issue between the United States and Japan--i.e., the recovery of self-rule from the United States. As stated earlier, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty contained another side to begin with. This treaty was in a sense a tacit multinational treaty. To let Japan return to the international community, the United States indirectly acted as proxy for demands made by other countries toward Japan, Asia-Pacific countries in particular. The structure in which the United States acted as the coordinator among the countries in the region was rational because of the Cold War context and the scale of the hegemony the United States held in the Pacific Ocean area. But today the Asia-Pacific countries have the ability to speak out internationally for themselves, so the Japanese political role should be discussed in the context of a regional multinational framework which includes both the United States and Japan. For instance, the "ASEAN Regional Forum," the establishment of which was agreed on at the ASEAN Expanded Foreign Ministers Conference held last July, would be an appropriate place for dialogue. In such a place, the presence of the special cooperative relationship between the United States and Japan would strengthen Japan's voice. Albeit desiring an American presence in the Pacific, many Asian nations resist any special relationships as regards security. Their ideas are also different from American ideas on human rights and political systems. While guaranteeing to these countries that it would not go back to the prewar structure by maintaining its bilateral relationship with the United States, Japan can help convey Asian thinking to the United States. Japan should work to create the concept of a new political framework which would replace the "West" through a multinational dialogue of Asia-Pacific countries. (3) Preservation of a Secure International Environment For the stability of international society, the maintenance of minimum order is necessary to guarantee the security of transactions/negotiations among nations. During the Cold War, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty provided a certain order in the region in the form of ensuring American presence in the Asia-Pacific. Especially for a maritime nation such as Japan, it was significant that security of the seas where national jurisdiction did not extend was guaranteed by the United States. U.S. bases in Japan and the Japanese Government's support for them made the U.S. presence in the Pacific easier; that in turn guaranteed Japan's security for its international traffic, from the Pacific-Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Of course it was a policy based upon America's own interests to secure control of the sea in the Pacific since, an interest dating back to the days of Admiral Mahan. But the maritime peace secured by the United States meant that Japan, which had chosen the road which led to economic prosperity through international trade, could enjoy a favorable environment. As the Soviet Union strengthened its Far East Fleet beginning in the latter half of the 1970's, Japan took charge of the defense of the sea lanes extending 1000 nautical mile from Japanese coastal waters. This took the form of defense sharing with the United States. This sharing by geographic division was made in response to the Cold War. The reason was at that time Soviet naval forces were the only possible potential threat to the sea lanes in the Asia-Pacific region. It was believed the Soviet Union would attack the sea lanes in Japanese coastal waters should it decide on a world war, and would attempt a naval blockade against the entire West, including the United States and Japan, as Germany did during the First and Second World Wars. Therefore it was believed there was a strong possibility an attack against U.S. and Japanese vessels would occur simultaneously. In such a case, the defensive action Japan would take within 1000 nautical miles of Japanese coastal waters, by asserting its right of self-defense, would connect with America's securing the sea lanes beyond 1000 nautical miles. Now that the Cold War has ceased and Soviet naval power has been drastically reduced, there is no longer any nation which could conduct a naval blockade in opposition to U.S. maritime domination. But in addition to the decline of Soviet naval forces, there is an important factor which changed the environment surrounding the waters of the Asia-Pacific. First, many countries in this region started strengthening their sea and air defenses because of their increased dependency on international trade. Second, with the end of the Cold War, the arms market has become a buyers' market. For countries with smaller economies, it has become easier to improve their naval and air forces with equipment which had been difficult to purchase earlier. Recently, the Chinese are reported to be strengthening their naval power. Not only China, but Taiwan and other Southeast Asian countries attach importance to strengthening naval and air power. Third, the United Nations Treaty on Law of the Sea was concluded in 1982. As a consequence, each nation's maritime jurisdiction has expanded beyond the previous three-nautical-mile limit. To protect these maritime rights and interests, the improvement of naval and air power has become necessary. The confrontation surrounding the Spratley Islands in the South China Sea is one issue which has been increasing in importance. In other words, while the possibility of a total maritime war between the United States and the Soviet Union has disappeared, the number of countries which possess small to medium maritime and air power is increasing. This situation itself is not necessarily dangerous, but neither can we positively say the Pacific Ocean has become a "peaceful body of water." In the Pentagon report to Congress entitled "Strategic Framework in the Asia-Pacific Rim," which was submitted during the Bush administration, it is stated the United States would expect in the post-Cold War era that Japan would continue its commitment of defending sea lanes for 1000 nautical mile. But will coordination of roles in maritime security, rather than geographic divisions, become more important? As I mentioned earlier, considering the overwhelming nature of America's current maritime supremacy, staving off regional strife and avoiding danger to ships and aircraft resulting from strife, rather than securing sea lanes, will become the issue. To handle this issue, the overwhelming American naval power maintains its presence as the power ultimately responsible for preserving maritime order and also as balance for the region. At the same time, it is conceivable that in the realm of patrol/maritime surveillance, the purpose of which is primarily to maintain maritime safety in peacetime, countries such as Japan and Australia could share the task while fulfilling their international roles. Naturally, issues such as the maintenance of maritime safety in peacetime need to be dealt with through multinational cooperation and understanding. Moreover, in important regions for international sea routes--such as the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca--Japan should make diplomatic efforts so adjacent countries can make progress on confidence building and on arms control concerning maritime and air power. To produce multinational security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region where the consciousness of independence and national defense is strong, all sorts of difficulties must be overcome. But the maintenance of maritime traffic safety must be a common interest for the region, so efforts should be made to accumulate cooperation wherever possible. To build up the regional security framework described above, support for U.S. forces stationed in Japan should continue in the future. But as for its significance, a new way of looking at it will be necessary. In the past, the thinking was strong in Japan that "in return for letting Americans use the bases we will have them protect Japan." But we should rather take the position of supporting U.S. forces stationed here as a contribution to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. (4) Defense of Japanese Territory The core role of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is that the United States and Japan are to jointly defend Japanese territory. The characteristic point of the defense of Japan during the Cold War was that it became part of the greatest bipolar military structure in the world intended to deter an offense by the East against the West. In other words, fundamentally it can be said that deterring an attack on Japan was important for the defense of the entire Western world, and the degree of Japanese defensive strength was regarded in the context of how it would strengthen the deterrent power of the West as a whole. According to the "DEFENSE PLAN OUTLINE" produced in 1976, the objective of Japanese defensive strength was to independently eliminate a "limited and small" aggression. This was based on an analysis of the situation that "due to the balance in military strength, which includes mutual deterrence of nuclear arms and various efforts for stabilization of international relations, there is little possibility for a comprehensive military clash or major armed struggle which could trigger such clashes." Naturally, the actual defense against a minor aggression in case deterrence failed was also an objective of the outline. It seems that in the basic position of the Japanese defense policy, the emphasis was placed on deterring aggression against Japan by contributing to an increase in the West's deterrent ability--with American strategic nuclear power at its core--rather than on defending against aggression. Since the Cold War has ended, the nature of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty concerning the defense of Japanese territory will undergo change. First, the significance of the American nuclear restraint is gradually changing. In the past, the American position on nuclear deterrence was such that it did not exclude nuclear retaliation against large, regular military forces. Now it seems it is moving in a direction where its significance is limited to deterrence against proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction. In that case, a fundamental posture will be necessary in which conventional weapons should be used against an attack launched with conventional weapons. Second, by the end of the Cold War, the relative importance of the regional context of Northeast Asia--comprised of the PRC, the Korean peninsula, Russia, and so on--has increased. Security issues in Northeast Asia also have an aspect that they have been traditional issues for Japan since the Meiji period. But when such important factors as changes in an individual country's political system and technological advances are considered, we should regard them as new issues. Keeping these changes in mind, when we think about Japanese defense we realize there are short- and long-term problems. The focus of the short-term problem is the handling of North Korea's suspected nuclear development. As for long-term problems, it is to create a stable Northeast Asian regional security order and examine the Japanese defense policy which would conform to it. The importance the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty has in relation to both of these problems is clear. First, it is indispensable that the American deterrent against a nuclear attack on Japan be confirmed. A fully functioning American nuclear deterrent would not only directly contribute to Japanese security, it would not permit excuses by neighboring countries for engaging in nuclear proliferation on the pretext they suspect Japan possesses nuclear arms. Naturally, in the more distant future cooperation in the development of a theater missile defense (TMD) is also significant in the sense of reducing not only Japanese defenses, but also the incentive for possession of weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, what is important for dealing with the long-term problems is to have continued American participation in maintaining the peace in Northeast Asia, especially concerning security on the Korean peninsula. Because of the historical background, Japan should not directly participate in security matters involving the Korean peninsula. But if by any chance some disturbance would occur on the peninsula, Japan would be in a position in which it could not avoid being affected. It is also vital for Japanese security, in terms of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, that the United States carries responsibility for stability on the Korean peninsula. Japan should be resolved to provide support--economic support in particular--toward unity and prosperity on the Korean peninsula. We should not repeat the history of intervention in domestic disorders by Japan, China, and Russia on the Korean peninsula. At the same time, Japan should advance security dialogues with China and Russia. Considering the situation in Northeast Asia in which territorial issues and differet political systems exist, multination-based discussions will not achieve many results. Thus, we should accumulate bilateral security dialogue and confidence-building measures, and should work so that the countries will come to an understanding about a secure order in Northeast Asia. A multinational framework from which no successful outcome can be expected would be harmful. It is reported that a revision responding to the post-Cold War situation is being made in the "DEFENSE PLAN OUTLINE." But the past method for determining defensive strength levels took Western deterrence as a major premise, so this method is not necessarily the best for the future. Of course, the method for maintaining its defensive strength should be determined by Japan itself. But in the post-Cold War era, it should be conceived in conjunction with improved efforts in the international environment such as diplomatic activities, security dialogues, confidence-building measures, and so forth in the region. The objective of defense is securing the safety of Japanese territory, and defensive power is the means, along with alliances and diplomatic efforts. For the defense of Japan, the choice Japan should make under these circumstances is to secure fundamental security for Japan through the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and Japanese defense efforts, while simultaneously forming a new regional order. The Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in the Region As seen above, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty functioned in the past with the objectives of strengthening the West economically, uniting it politically, and deterring the East from aggression. Because the security treaty fulfilled its functions well, it has lasted over forty years. But in the post-Cold War environment, the comprehensive notion of the "West" will gradually lose significance, and it is natural the significance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty should again be questioned. But as we have so far analyzed, the security treaty has a valid meaning for regional security, the importance of which will increase in the future. As for the security of the Asia-Pacific region, a comprehensive idea which would be equivalent to the "West" in the Cold War will not emerge, at least for some time. As is often said, the Asia-Pacific region is complex; it is natural in the multinational framework that things should be multilayered and diverse. As seen above in the economic area, a loose organization such as APEC can work well, and in the political area it would be easier to gain consensus in a context for dialogue where Asian countries take the initiative. As regards maintaining maritime order, which means the common security of the region, it will be necessary to accumulate agreements layer by layer among the multiple countries as it is possible. In Northeast Asia, a bilateral approach seems to be more effective than a multinational framework. All such approaches should be subject to change, responding to the fluid situation. In any case, a regional order in the Asia-Pacific area is just coming into being, so flexibility rather than adherence to a certain plan will be important. But in order to be flexible, some fulcrum is necessary. For Japan, it will be the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. As previously stated, as a regional security pact becomes necessary, the framework of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is most stable. But our consciousness of the current U.S.-Japan Security Treaty is still largely regulated by the Cold War. It is necessary that we review the significance and role of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty from a new perspective. When the first U.S.-Japan Security Treaty was concluded in 1951, the Cold War had already begun. For those Japanese who had been under occupation until then, they were hardly conscious of participating in an international order which was in the background of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. The Japanese tend to view the world through the filter of their relationship with the United States. Looking at it from such an aspect, the drastic change in the international order may provide an excellent opportunity for the Japanese. Through the process of creating order in the Asia-Pacific region, both the United States and Japan may be able to reconfirm the significance of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Of course, the future U.S.-Japan relationship will be important not only in the Asia-Pacific region, but also at the world level-- for example, in the United Nations and the G-7. There may also be efforts which have to be coordinated by each country, or which must be bilaterally promoted. Such problems could not be touched upon in this article. But in the current situation, the adjustment of policies at various levels is a matter of priority, and they should not be mutually contradictory. In order to develop the formation of a future international order--which includes a regional order--the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty will continue to persist as the cornerstone.
