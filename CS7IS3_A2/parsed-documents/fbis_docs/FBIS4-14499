This may have been the reason for the many sharp statements made by Mr. Kuznetsov, military adviser to the Crimean president, in a conversation with your correspondent. The former commander of a Soviet Army corps stationed in Crimea, after his unit was placed under Kiev's jurisdiction Major General Valeriy Kuznetsov swore allegiance to Ukraine. And soon after stating that he will not fight with Russia under any circumstances, he was removed from his post. Later, in summer 1992, he was elected people's deputy to the former composition of the Crimean Supreme Soviet. According to him, the complexity of the Black Sea Fleet's position today is primarily related to the fact that as of 1 September 1993 Ukraine stopped its financing. It is done by Russia through Privatbank in Dnepropetrovsk. Meanwhile the exchange of rubles for coupons "is proceeding at a robber's rate," constituting approximately half the market rate (the commercial price of the ruble is 20 to 23 karbovanets). In addition, the Black Sea Fleet is charged exorbitant land taxes. What is more, "at the highest tax rate, although no land assessment has been made." As a result, the fleet does not have enough funds even to pay monetary allowances to commissioned and warrant officers. For its part, Kiev cannot provide even for its own five or six ships (against a hundred or so Russian ones, not counting a border guard brigade). In this connection, "Admiral Beskaravaynyy, commander of the Ukrainian Navy, proposed to Eduard Dmitriyevich Baltin to buy one or several of them." Furthermore, Mr. Kuznetsov expressed concern over the fact that since May 1992 Ukraine has substantially built up the land component of its Armed Forces in Crimea. At present its strength on the peninsula, including construction troops, is approximately 50,000 -- "half of what there was in Afghanistan." Moreover, many units have been deployed anew: a mechanized marine brigade in Feodosiya, and an air-mobile unit in Saki. And this given that under the Crimean Constitution and a corresponding Ukrainian law, any changes in the disposition and strength of armed elements, as well as the formation of new units in Crimea, is subject to coordination with Simferopol. According to Mr. Kuznetsov, the Black Sea Fleet is taking no retaliatory moves and will not violate the agreements signed. In particular there are no plans to create military structures under President Meshkov's control. Crimea's presidential adviser is inclined to attribute the actions by Kiev politicians to the fact that "they may be afraid of the processes that are unfolding in Crimea." The peninsula "slowly but surely is drifting toward Russia, without declaring its secession from the country. Ukraine will disintegrate by itself. It is economically incapable of existing as a state. De jure, it exists, but de facto, you can see for yourself. A hungry Ukraine and a bubble of nationalism that has burst. Nothing else has remained," Mr. Kuznetsov believes. Going back to the problems of Sevastopol, Mr. Kuznetsov said that there were two USSR naval schools there. One of them -- popularly known as "Holland" -- trained specialists for nuclear submarines. The other -- named after Nakhimov -- prepared missile and artillery men. Ukraine has seized both schools and merged them into one. The "Holland" school, in his estimation, costs more than the entire Black Sea Fleet with its land and sea components, and all of this multibillion equipment and property is in fact falling into disrepair. Meanwhile, this year Ukraine is going to enroll a mere 135 cadets in the school, as against 800 and more previously. Responding to a question about the morale in the Black Sea Fleet, the Crimean presidential adviser stated solemnly, "The morale in our fleet is normal, Russian. As for the Ukrainian Army, there is practically no morale there."
