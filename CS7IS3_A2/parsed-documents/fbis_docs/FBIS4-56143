Such manifestos have been published by the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF), the Independent Smallholders Party (FKGP), and the Christian Democratic People's Party (KDNP). The sixth parliamentary party, the Federation of Young Democrats (Fidesz), did not disclose such a document. The MSZP, front-runners in the elections with 32.96 percent of party list votes, states in its manifesto, "on May 8 Hungarians voted for a change and a new government because the right-wing coalition failed to properly utilize the authorization it received four years ago. The coalition was unable to solve the country's economic problems, which were aggravated over the past few years. "The MSZP champions social peace and general consensus, and strives to form a coalition government. It is convinced that the governing parties should implement their programs and fulfil their promises as equal partners. To this effect, the Socialists are prepared to accept all reasonable compromises. They propose continuous coordination and cooperation between the next government, and the employer and employee organizations to lead the country out of the crisis," the manifesto says. The Alliance of Free Democrats, which finished in the first round in second place, with 19.76 percent of party list votes, says in its manifesto, "the SZDSZ presses for a multi-party government to be formed whose policy attracts all political forces committed to civil democratic values and helps form balanced political power relations. "Should the party's prime ministerial candidate Gabor Kuncze be in the position to form a government, expertise may come to power. The Free Democrats wish to put an end to squabbling and to the political and emotional division of society. The SZDSZ is a centrist party which is able to integrate differing interests. The Free Democrats wish to eliminate corruption and lavish central spending in order to boost economic growth, create new jobs, and guarantee independence of the press, education and churches." The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the senior governing coalition party which won 11.73 percent of party list votes in the first round, says in its manifesto, "on May 8 the majority of voters decided that the MDF should play the role of parliamentary opposition during the next four years. The stake of the second round is whether the MDF will be in a strong or a formal oppositional position. Preparing for the role of the strongest opposition party, the MDF seeks to preserve the values and results created in the past four years, and represent the interests of those who received compensation for their past grievances and those who acquired property, to ensure that private property should not be threatened in the future by nationalization or expropriation." The Independent Smallholders Party, which received 8.85 percent of votes cast for party lists in the first round of elections on May 8, puts down its aims in the following points: No more policy seeking to exploit the people; humanity, security of existence, legal security; a pact-free policy resting on national bases, democracy based on guarantees; a president of the republic directly elected by the people; an unbiased and authentic press, radio and television committed to the nation; a Hungary free from corruption and mafias; education based on Christian morals, universal values, and domestic intellectual traditions. According to the FKGP's appeal, Hungary's economic and cultural renewal may only begin when it is also possible for the smallest village to develop. The document stresses crossable borders instead of border disputes, as well as peaceful political diplomacy between Carpathian nations. The Christian Democratic People's Party, with 7.06 percent of party list votes, points out in its appeal: Most electors going to the polls in the first round of this year's parliamentary elections decided not to choose the current ruling coalition but the opposition parties whose situation is easier and can, therefore, promise more. Quoting successes achieved by European Christian Democratic parties over the past 50 years in setting up social market economies, the KDNP says this is the only road that can lead to Hungary's economic, social and cultural rise. The second round of elections will decide whether Parliament continues with balanced power relations, and whether the opposition is able to exercise effective control over the ruling parties. This can be ensured by Conservative-Christian forces over the next four years, the KDNP appeal states.
