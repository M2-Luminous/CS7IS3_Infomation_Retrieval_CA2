Germany: Subdued Interest, Modest Expectations German press interest in the 12 June EP elections was diverted by the local contests in seven laender and in Munich, held on the same day. As noted in a 14 June commentary by Heribert Prantl in the Munich daily SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "On the day before the election and on the day following, Europe was mentioned as infrequently as in the entire German election campaign; the EP election in Germany was a test election for the federal parliament, with a new European Parliament as a byproduct." An article in the 14 June daily FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE observed that "...the voters in Europe have decided the composition of the European Parliament, but interest was centered not on European political concerns, but on domestic ones." Eberhard Wisdorff's article in the 14 June Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT noted that "even if the European election cannot be a test case in anticipation of the Bundestag election, it certainly was determined by domestic politics. That can be seen most clearly in the example of the FDP [Free Democratic Party], which will not be returning to the European Parliament." Hans Joerg Sottorf's commentary in the same HANDELSBLATT issue termed the EP election "in Germany, obviously a Kohl election." However uncertain the 0ctober election predictions may be, the EP election has made one thing clear: "the Republikaner remain a marginal party on the right. For democracy in all of Germany, that is the best message from the European election". A report in the 14 June HANDELSBLATT cautioned that Europeans have once again "not primarily voiced an opinion for or against the European unification process. In practically all national arenas, it was mainly an interim summing up of domestic politics." An editorial by Guenther Nonnenmacher in the 14 June FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE noted that there are no European parties toward which a barely identifiable "European public" might gravitate. The two large blocs, Socialists and Social Democrats on one side, Christian Democrats and conservatives on the other, have been dominant in the EP for years. Nonnenmacher maintained that this situation will persist, "a sign that Europe, despite much agitation in national affairs, is marked by a high measure of stability when viewed overall." France: Warnings for Future Noted An editorial in the 14 June Paris daily LE MONDE questioned whether today's European leaders will be able to maintain the ideals of the EU founding fathers, now that the major challenges of the past have been overcome. The results of the EP elections provided no clear indication of the EU's ability to meet new challenges such as resisting the revival of nationalism and avoiding marginalization as the world's "center of gravity" moves towards Asia. On one hand, the paper said, the elections had a positive result for the EU in that, except for Italy, the pro-European groups did well. On the other, the new Parliament will be "less European" because voter turnout was low, a sign of "growing indifference to the EU." France was an example of this, as the electorate expressed its doubts and confusion in voting for the "nationalist far Right," the "fundamentalist Right," and the "demagogic Left." The editorial asserted that political figures must learn from these "alarming signals." Politicians on both sides should act on their principles rather than their ambitions, before next year's presidential election. Italy: Failure for Federalism Seen In a commentary in the Milan daily IL SOLE--24 ORE of 14 June, Maurizio Ferrera wrote that the EP elections did not confirm any tendency by Europeans to proceed towards a United States of Europe. The new EP should bear this in mind, Ferrera warned, to avoid the futility and risk of setting off in the wrong direction. Except in very few instances, the campaigns were run entirely on national issues, with little space given to the EU agenda, Ferrera wrote, citing the Italian campaigns. "Did anyone hear Forza Italia or the PDS [Democratic Party of Left] state their position on the institutional future of Europe?" Ferrera asked. In countries in which the EU was mentioned during the campaign--such as Denmark, France, or Great Britain--it was only by political groups critical or hostile to the EU. In no country was there serious discussion on the essential themes of the EU, such as enlargement, federalism, and the timeframe for these. This is a sign, Ferrera concluded, that the candidates did not believe these topics were useful when it came to garnering votes. The low voter turnout was also another negative sign, Ferrera wrote, and two implications can be drawn from it: First, the legitimacy of the new EP has a small base--far from the "plebescite" for a stronger EP and a federal constitution hoped for by many outgoing deputies. Second, the Eurofederalists' claim of a "democratic deficit" in the EU was met by voter indifference. This is backed up by recent polls that show a general cooling of the voters towards integration. People are beginning to blame the EU for unemployment, higher taxes, and budget cuts, Ferrera wrote. In view of these negative signals, Ferrera continued, it would not be opportune for the new EP to strive immediately for federalism, full codecisionmaking powers, or a federal constitution, all measures set out by the outgoing parliament. Former PCI (Italian Communist Party) deputy Aldo Rizzo in a commentary in the Turin daily LA STAMPA of 13 June noted that the best news for Europe came from Austria, a majority of whose electorate voted to join the EU. With Finland, Norway, and Sweden possibly joining before the end of the year and many other countries knocking on the door, Rizzo maintained, the EU remains a highly attractive option. The election results did not show a move to the Right or the Left, said Rizzo; the Socialists and the center-right won in some countries and lost in others. The next parliament will not be "dominated by a political-ideological tendency. Were this ever to happen, it will mean that Europe has really become one state, a real political entity... Europe is questioning itself and enlarging simulataneously; it is at the same time strong and weak. The course it will follow will depend on the EP, but also to a great extent on individual member state governments," Rizzo concluded.
