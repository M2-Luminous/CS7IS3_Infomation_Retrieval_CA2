The ALF stated that it will not follow a specific policy nor abandon any form of "struggle" while maintaining its freedom to determine its policy according to the requirements that fulfill the Palestinian people's hopes and aspirations. A statement issued by the ALF -- led by Abu-al-'Abbas -- and distributed in Nabulus said that the ALF will deal with any institution that will be established through the new political reality if it becomes clear that this institution serves the interest of Palestinian society and is committed to the Palestinian people's causes, be that the Palestinian police force or other institutions whose positive role in improving the social situation becomes evident.
