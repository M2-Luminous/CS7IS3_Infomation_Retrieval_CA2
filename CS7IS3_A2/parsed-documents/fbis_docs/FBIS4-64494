At the same time, defining the new orientations for the national defense is not an easy task. While the law may not take fully into account the new threats and the means to confront them, it does end "years of irresponsibility and hasty decisions" that weakened the French defense apparatus by gradually abolishing some 60 regiments and limiting military service to 10 months, Baumel writes. The new law reestablishes a continuity that will reassure military officials and industrialists, for it envisions for the next six years a significant financial outlay of 613 billion francs in an overall context of crisis and downsizing of state budgets. Planned allocations will allow the continuation of a number of burdensome programs which are too far advanced to be stopped, but which will suffer delays. One of them is the Rafale aircraft, to be delivered at the "ridiculous" rate of one or two aircraft per year. Another is the Leclerc tank, production of which is slated to reach no more than 200 units per year. Carrying out such programs, according to Baumel, will absorb total allocations and exclude the production of sophisticated high technology weapons whose efficacy was proven during the Gulf war, e.g. stealth aircraft, satellites and antimissile missiles. Baumel contends that nationally-produced weapons programs are coming to an end and that the time has come for coproduction agreements, even though they are often "disappointing, costly and too slow." At the same time, France must strive to preserve "excellence" in the nuclear and electronic domains. The most serious repercussions of the military planning law will be felt in the vital nuclear field, Baumel continues, since the law makes no mention of nuclear testing. It thus gives the future chief of state the responsibility for making a "grave" decision on whether to continue nuclear testing in a much more difficult context, since the choice of a "second nuclear component" has been delayed until 1997. There is also a "serious gap" between the white book on defense, which presents various scenarios for intervention abroad, and the real means given French forces for fire power, air and maritime transports, and rapid action deployment. Finally, the law does not mention the capability for precise strikes on military targets with dual-use weapons, which are more precise and lighter than the heavy nuclear artillery of missile-launching submarines, in case missiles are launched from beyond the Mediterranean or the Near East. While in principle the law takes into account space activities, real-time information and the mobility of commands, this "modest undertaking" will not produce concrete results--save for the Helios system--before the beginning of the next century. France will thus remain in a "regrettable situation of dependence" on the United States as far as large-scale operations are concerned. In fact, all programs envisioned in the law will be implemented only if the armaments industry achieves a productivity gain of 2 percent a year, to compensate for the 0.5 percent increase of allocations in real terms. This will require a "strenuous restructuring, management and cooperation effort" entailing the elimination of at least 100,000 jobs, while simultaneously preserving the know-how and competence of French engineers, Baumel concludes. In an editorial in the 21 April Paris daily LIBERATION, Gerard Dupuy bemoans the fact that the "famous peace dividends" of four years ago have "gone up in smoke" and that military expenditures are again rising. This contrasts with the policies followed in comparable countries, as well as with the restrictions affecting other budget items, Dupuy contends. It also points up a lack of adaptation of French military doctrine to the new situation, since the old, nuclear-based policy is being maintained while another is "discreetly" put in place, he continues. Inasmuch as it is always costly and never practical to conduct two policies at the same time, the public will soon perceive the irony of announcing a rise in military expenditures just when the Gorazde issue reveals the powerlessness of European arms in general and French in particular. Only a success in the Bosnian peacemaking effort could have convinced a "reticent" public opinion of the utility of military expenditures. The French, Dupuy concludes, "will have the impression they are paying a high price without really knowing why."
