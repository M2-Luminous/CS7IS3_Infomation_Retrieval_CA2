It is a country with which they are having to reckon. Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus has declared this in reaction to the remark made by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who today called on NATO member countries to disperse Russia's fears that they have adopted a duplicitous attitude on this issue. Yeltsin also warned against the negative reaction of the Russian public in case the bloc is expanded. He described the arguments of those countries striving to gain entry into NATO as unconvincing. Prime Minister Klaus is conscious that Russia regards this to be a sensitive issue. However, there is no need for fear yet because, as the prime minister has said, no one has offered us NATO membership.
