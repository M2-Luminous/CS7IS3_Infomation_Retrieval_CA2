In a written statement issued today, Rasit charged that the Greek Cypriot Administration first stepped up its arms buildup within the framework of the Turkish-Greek joint defense doctrine and increased its number of troops. Now, he added, the Greek Cypriots are amassing troops along the borders and reinforcing their positions. Rasit stated that the Greek Cypriot Administration which is leading the negotiations to an impasse is trying to divert the world's attention by accusing the Turkish Cypriot side. The aim, Rasit said, is to get rid of the confidence-building measures which the Greek Cypriots claim are no longer meaningful, and to ensure that the UN Security Council passes a resolution accusing the Turkish Cypriot side. The minister of foreign affairs and defense called on the UN authorities to hold discussions with the Greek Cypriot officials as soon as possible, to prevent the tension being deliberately escalated by the Greek Cypriots from causing a confrontation, at this critical stage of the proximity talks.
