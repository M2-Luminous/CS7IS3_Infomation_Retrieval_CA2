There are at least two grounds for these concerns. The first is the socio-economic situation in the regions, leading electors not to vote for well-considered policies. The second is the democrats' lack of unity. The meeting heard the opinion that electoral legislation needs fine-tuning, in particular to provide for second rounds of voting for candidates to local legislatures. Filatov stressed that the president's supervisory agencies will set up bodies to oversee discipline in executive authorities in the regions. There will be one department of the head of state's administration to work with public organizations, with account taken of the forthcoming local elections.
