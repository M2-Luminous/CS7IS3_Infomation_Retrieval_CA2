The same boat came under another attack half an hour later near Asyut. The boat's guards exchanged fire with the terrorists, who fled in the direction of al-Badari Island. On the same day, the Islamic Group issued a statement justifying its operations by saying that they were in retaliation for the massacres of Bosnia's Muslims. The group distributed the statement in Asyut and al-Minya immediately after the 'Id al-Fitr prayers. It threatened to continue the jihad despite the military trials and arrests. Appealing to Muslim religious scholars, the group said in its statement: To our ulemas who are feigning sorrow over national unity with the Orthodox Christians in Egypt and traveling across the country to attack the Muslim youths and excuse the regime's mistakes, we say that the international news agencies have feigned sorrow over the 200,000 Muslims butchered by Orthodox Serbs, the more than 50,000 Muslim women and girls publicly raped, and the thousands of children buried alive, slaughtered, or placed in cement mixers and fodder mills. What have you done? The statement also appealed to police officers to join the Islamic Group. The statement did not refer once to the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron despite its lengthy talk on Bosnia and the mujahidin in Algeria, Tunisia, Kashmir, Libya, Burma, Morocco, Iraq, and Syria.
