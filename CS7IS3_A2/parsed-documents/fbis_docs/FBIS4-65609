They agreed that the EU summit in Corfu should discuss the railroad line through the Brenner Pass. According to Jacques Delors, the project stands a good chance of being financed by the EU. Following the talks, Vranitzky met the international press. He declined to answer questions about Austria's ideas on the next institutional reform, or who should succeed Jacques Delors as Commission president. He said he would not comment on such matters before Austria was a member. Other questions focused on Austria's security policy concept. Vranitzky said Austria had expressed its interest in helping set up a European security system. Asked about the country's possible membership of the Western European Union, the WEU, or its participation in the Partnership for Peace program, Vranitzky said that these were not urgent problems. Regarding the WEU, Austria did not rule out a role as an observer, the chancellor said. Time was not pressing, because the 12 EU member states themselves still held differing views on the future of the WEU, which, according to the Maastricht Treaties, will become the WEU's defense arm. Regarding Partnership for Peace with NATO, for which most Eastern European countries and recently also Sweden and Finland have opted, Chancellor Vranitzky said that Austria would closely examine the matter in the second half of this year. Such an examination could be made without any hurry; after all, Austria has concluded similar peace-preserving agreements with its Eastern European neighbors. Neutrality was no obstacle to such partnership, because it was not a military alliance, the chancellor said.
