It was not only the contents of the statement that aroused our surprise and condemnation. What aroused our surprise and condemnation was the YSP's exploitation of the official media to transmit the statement issued by an official at the YSP Central Committee. This represented party monopoly over the second channel and Aden radio unprecedented since 22 May 1990. While the General People's Congress Standing Committee regrets this act, it has no choice but to transmit this explanatory statement to our masses, asserting that it is forced to do this hoping that the YSP will stop this exploitation. Furthermore, the official spokesman's statement, which was embellished with flowery language concerning the document of pledge and accord, is strong evidence that the YSP views this document as a card for political propaganda and media deception. Although we, in the GPC, have always preferred that the practical implementation of the provisions of this historic document be the real test through which our people will be aware of the honest intentions, sound trends, and serious commitments, we have no choice but to explain the facts to our people without distortion, as follows: 1. The YSP statement notes that some representatives of the coalition to the dialogue expressed reservations about the document when it was signed so as to resort to them when they discuss the implementation. This shows a clear contradiction between their agreement on the document and their reservations about it. In order to explain matters and to avoid veiled words -- which will only cause fear and worry for citizens when they fail to understand or comprehend --we, in the GPC, do not hesitate to acquaint the citizens with what the Standing Committee spokesman really means. The citizens will then judge what was issued by the YSP and decide which side is telling the truth, adopts clearer stands, and is most concerned about this document which was welcomed by our masses because it is an impregnable shield that protects the unity, safeguards democracy, and strengthens popular participation: On the evening of Monday, 17 January -- that is, less than 24 hours before the signing of the document of pledge and accord -- brother Prime Minister Haydar al-'Attas, representative of the YSP who was chairing the meetings of the political forces dialogue in Aden, dropped the following paragraph -- which was registered as Number two in page 18 of the document, under the headline "Constitutional Amendments:" "Unifying the political will and enabling the constitutional institutions to assume their tasks, exercise their powers, and implement what was agreed upon in the pledge document." When the GPC representative in the subcommittee, which was reviewing the final draft of the document, insisted on keeping this paragraph, the rest of the committee members supported him. Despite this, the YSP representative paid no attention to any opinion in the committee and insisted on canceling it. This prompted the GPC representative to underscore his reservation about this behavior in front of all the members of the dialogue committee. However, the YSP representative insisted on his stand on the pretext that this issue falls within the powers of the subcommittee. In light of this behavior, and after signing the document, the GPC distributed the following memorandum among the members of the dialogue committee: Brother members of the political forces' dialogue committee, greetings: The GPC would like to draw your attention to the paragraph which had been listed on page 18 of the pledge and accord document until 17 January, when it was unilaterally dropped by one party to the committee. That paragraph reads: Unifying the political will and enabling the constitutional institutions to assume their tasks, exercise their powers, and implement what was agreed upon in the pledge document. That unilateral arbitrary measure proved beyond any doubt that as far this matter is concerned, all our efforts have been in vain. [Signed] The GPC. That memorandum was described by the YSP statement as a point of reservation designed to be used when implementation of the document is discussed. The GPC is certain that the masses of our people cannot consider the GPC's adherence to ending the crisis and all its manifestations as affirmed by its official memorandum to the members of the political forces' dialogue committee on 18 January an indication of ill intentions and noncommitment to implementation of the accord. However, it is regrettable that the fallacies that have been floated by the YSP after the signing of the accord document provide the most conspicuous evidence that the YSP views the document only as a means to continue the crisis in the face of the citizens' suffering in terms of a speedy deterioration of their living standards and the appalling price hikes. Citizens are also living in fear and anxiety over the destiny of their unity and the future of their homeland for no reason except that the YSP considers the demand for the unity of the political leadership, merging of the state institutions, and the Presidential Council and cabinet members' assumption of their executive tasks an inexcusable crime. What commitment does the YSP claim to the implementation of the pledge and accord document when its representatives in the political forces' dialogue and the state's executive authorities refuse to abide by the stipulations of the Constitution, contrary to the provisions of the pledge and accord document? Following the same deceptive tone, the YSP Central Committee source claimed that the coalition representatives in the subcommittee and the military and security committee shirked their responsibilities toward the so-called discussion of the military and security guarantees. The source also claimed that the House of Representatives refrained from supporting the pledge and accord document. We at the GPC have irrefutable evidence which puts the blame on the YSP and proves the honesty and soundness of the GPC stand in the subcommittee and the security committee which was established to enforce the seventh article of the accord document. However, we will postpone exposing the falsehood of the YSP Central Committee spokesman's allegations in this regard and concerning the House of Representatives' decline to bless the document until the political forces' dialogue committee concludes its debates on the stands of the parties represented in the subcommittee. This is out of the GPC's concern that its uncovering of that deception and falsification might embarrass the parties to the political forces' dialogue before they are briefed on all that has been included in the minutes of the meetings of the subcommittee and the security committee. Afterward, we will be free to inform the people of all facts so that they would pass their judgment away from propaganda, allegations, or statements that have nothing to do with reality. The GPC, which has expressed readiness to sign the agreement anywhere and anytime, regrets those new conditions and demands that have been set by the YSP, its partner to the coalition, outside the boundaries of the agreement. The GPC views those new conditions as a clear attempt to obstruct the signing of the agreement and to avoid commitment to implementing it. The consequences and effects of this regrettable stand will further complicate the crisis and expose the homeland to an unknown destiny.
