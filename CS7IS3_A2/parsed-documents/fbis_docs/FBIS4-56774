She said the embargo imposed by the U.S. Government violates international law. During a meeting with 142 U.S. citizens here visiting as members of the 25th contingent of the Venceremos Brigade, Allende said: "Voting against the embargo means voting for adherence to international law." Allende explained Cuban diplomacy's main goals and underscored the Cuban Government's efforts to survive despite the crisis, adapting to new global realities while keeping the achievement of the past 35 years in sight. Referrring to the people's right to free education and health, a home, and defense of national sovereignty and independence, she said: "Cuba must adapt itself to the world, seek ways to survive. We must and will change but while preserving the basic achievements of socialism." Pointing out the negative effects of U.S.'s coercive measures, she said nine out of 10 business deals with foreign enterprises fail because of Washington's pressures. But she sounded optimistic because the embargo has been rejected twice by the United Nations. In this connection, the deputy minister said another of Cuba's priorities is stimulating foreign investment, not for business' sake alone but to help spread a true image of the local situation so as to offer incentives and guarantees to foreign investors. She also said Cuba saw the effects of the embargo alleviated by the country's ties with the now defunct Socialist bloc and the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, ever since 1989 Cuba has lost three-fourths of its most important markets and outside sources of financing, to all of which is added the aggravation of the embargo via the Torricelli amendment. Among the Foreign Ministry's most immediate goals, Allende mentioned working so Cuba can never again be accused of human rights violations. To this end, the issue must be depoliticized. It is necessary to show that the embargo is the first and foremost violator of human rights. Attention to emigration, agreed upon during the recent conference between the government and expatriates, is another priority, designed to depoliticize ties with this sector, keeping it separate from disagreement with the United States.
