Statistics show that the number of returnees received by the municipality increased by 19 percent in 1993 when compared with 1992. Students studying abroad at their expense registered a drop of 40 percent in 1993 over the year before. Young people in Shanghai have been level-headed in handling the matter of going abroad in recent years, according to a service centre for returnees from studying abroad. The number of people going overseas for further study or for professional study was not in decline but those who went abroad to work and to learn a foreign language registered a sharp drop in numbers. People who went overseas to use their talents and students who finished their professional studies abroad have returned home with their eyes on Shanghai and its development and the Pudong New Zone. Following the implementation last year of a preferential policy on student returnees from overseas, Shanghai has received a growing number of them. A total of 95 people returning from studying abroad have to date been given preferential treatment by the service centre there to open enterprises. During the short period of six months, nearly 40 returnees were given a license to begin operating a business and already a number of high technology companies have made a contribution to the building up of the municipality.
