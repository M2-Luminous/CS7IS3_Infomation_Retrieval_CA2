"We have experienced a genuine shift toward plurality. This shift, which is worth consolidating, is the result of electoral reforms that the country's various political forces have effected through dialogue," he said. After closing in this Gulf of Mexico port the Second Forum on Financing and Investment Opportunities for the Southeast, Salinas said the confrontation "reveals our country's new political culture." Presidential candidates Ernesto Zedillo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], Cuauthemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party [PRD], and Diego Fernandez of the National Action Party [PAN] presented their political platforms on Thursday night. Of this debate, which was held in Mexico for the first time, Salinas said: "We can declare that the electoral process in Mexico is not discriminating. Quite the contrary, it is all-embracing." He added: "There is room for everyone in the country's legal framework." Salinas said the candidates spoke freely and voiced without restriction their opinions and proposals so they can be considered and assessed by the Mexican people. "From now on, everyone should obey the law and the Mexican people's electoral will," he finally said.
