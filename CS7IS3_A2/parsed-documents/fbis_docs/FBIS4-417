The man at the center of the controversy is former Brigadier General David Mark, one of the officers who backed the coup which brought General Abacha to power last November. In an interview in NEWSWATCH magazine last week, Gen. Mark accused the ruling council of having a hidden agenda and of planning to stay in power for another five years instead of one year as agreed before the coup. Since the coup, Gen. Mark has been retired early from the Armed Forces and is now living in London. When he came into the studio, Jeremy Skiss put it to him that he has gone public because of bitterness over the way he had been treated by his superiors. [Begin recording] [Mark] That certainly is not true because I don't have to be bitter about it. I haven't said anything personal against Abacha or any other person in the administration. I have simply said we agreed on a program and they should release that program and follow it religiously. [Skiss] So do you think you were retired because you were seen as an ally of General Babangida? You were one of Babangida's boys. [Mark] Far from that; so was Abacha, if there is anything like that. Abacha was Babangida's right-hand man. But even if that is the case, why can't this administration come up with a timetable showing when they are going to hand over. They are working on a constitutional conference; they are going to elect people into that constitutional conference; they are going to accommodate the elected members in the constitutional conference in Abuja. They haven't built the houses in Abuja yet. You don't build a house overnight. Those who are going to be elected don't even know the format of the election yet and the constitutional conference is going to be designed to stay some time before they start. At the end of that constitutional conference, we are going to have an election. There is no program, so it is common sense to see the way it is going. It doesn't take a genius to understand that. [Skiss] The government has criticized the interview you gave to NEWSWATCH in saying it's all part of a plot to destabilize the Abacha government. Would you agree with that? [Mark] Nobody wants to do Abacha government that favor. It will be a favor to that administration to destabilize it. Nobody wants to do them that favor. They should be honorable enough to quit on their own. Nobody would like to do them that favor. [Skiss] Now, since you gave the interview the editor of NEWSWATCH has been detained. What do you say to the Abacha government: Release him immediately? [Mark] Well, this is the beginning of dictatorship and that is how dictators start. They start first by dealing with journalists. They are their first victims. I have accepted and I gave an interview. Nobody is challenging the contents of the interview I have given. People are skirting round it. The government is skirting round it. They haven't addressed one single issue that I raised in my interview because those were simple facts, the honest truth. [Skiss] But the editor was arrested. Would you be willing to go back to Nigeria and swap places with the editor? [Mark] I am going back on the 30th of May because my program here.... [pauses] I am going to finish what I have come to do by the 30th and I've booked a flight to go back. I certainly would not run away from Nigeria, I would be the last person to. [Skiss] Some people would say that this interview is the beginning of your political career; your military career is now over; you are going to launch a political career. Is that right? [Mark] I have no intention whatsoever of playing politics? I don't have that intention. [Skiss] But you played politics before? [Mark] I haven't. I have never played politics. [Skiss] Well, when Abacha took over, that is what I call playing politics. [Mark] Well, I am a patriotic Nigerian and I will go for anything that will ensure the goodness of that country so if what we did was barely to.... [pauses] I mean, was just to make sure that we got the best for Nigeria, if you call that politics, yes, but otherwise I have no desire whatsoever to go into politics. [end recording]
