The delegations were headed by: on the Ukrainian side, Colonel General Ivan Oliynyk, deputy defense minister of Ukraine and chief of armaments; on the Kazakh side Major General Alibek Isymov, chief of the General Staff of Kazakhstan's Armed Forces. The prospects for extending cooperation and implementing agreements made at the level of the countries' government delegations at the beginning of 1994 were discussed. A document was signed on the results of the meeting in Almaty, in which the sides noted great interest in extending contacts between the military departments of the two countries on a wide range of issues. The principles of mutual respect and mutual confidence are to be laid down in the foundations of these relations. The Ukrainian side showed readiness for military-technical and scientific cooperation in elaborating new types of technology, modernizing armaments already in existence, and developing the missile and space possibilities of the two countries. The Kazakh side is interested in more intensive use of the repair base in the interests of Kazakhstan's armed forces. It is planned to finalize and make specific the nature of mutual settlements and to study the possibility of eliminating existing debts in the near future. As participants of the meeting asserted, this type of bilateral contact corresponds to the bilateral obligations and desires of both Ukraine and Kazakhstan not to suppress the interests of a single third country.
