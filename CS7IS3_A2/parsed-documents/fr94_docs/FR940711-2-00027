ACTION: Notice of Noncompetitive Financial Assistance Award. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules, 10 CFR 600.7, is announcing its intention to award a grant to Colorado State University, for continuing research in support of the DOE Office of Building Energy Research programs. The project seeks to develop and improve solar domestic hot water systems. ADDRESSES: Questions regarding this announcement may be addressed to the U.S. Department of Energy, Golden Field Office, 1617 Cole Blvd., Golden, Colorado 80401, Attention: John W. Meeker, Contract Specialist, 303&hyph;275&hyph;4748. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The proposed basic research will contribute to the DOE mission by assisting in the development of improved solar water heating technologies for use in buildings. Successful completion of this research would advance the goal of wide commercialization of solar water heating systems. Deploying these technologies will reduce energy use in buildings which, in the U.S., accounts for about 40% of annual national energy consumption. DOE has performed a review in accordance with 10 CFR 600.7 and has determined that the activity to be funded is necessary to satisfactorily complete the current research.
