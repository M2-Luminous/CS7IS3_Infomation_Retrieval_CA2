Australia's prime minister, Paul Keating, has described the matter as of the highest security significance to Australia and the region, renewing an appeal to North Korea to cooperate with international inspection requirements to nuclear facilities. In the national Parliament in Canberra, Mr. Keating said Australia had been most concerned by North Korea's statement last Monday threatening to set aside an earlier promise not to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. He said any proliferation of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula would pose a grave threat to the security of the Asia-Pacific region. It would also profoundly complicate Australia's security planning and that of other countries in the region, Mr. Keating said, adding it also risked the spread of such weapons to other presently nonnuclear states: [Begin Keating recording] Australia remains committed to dialogue and negotiation to resolve this problem, Mr. Speaker, but the international community cannot permit continuing North Korean intransigence. If no agreement is reached before the meeting of the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] Board of Governors later this month, the matter is likely to be referred to the United Nations Security Council. It should be clear that under those circumstances, Australia would support any action imposed by the Security Council, including sanctions. [end recording]
