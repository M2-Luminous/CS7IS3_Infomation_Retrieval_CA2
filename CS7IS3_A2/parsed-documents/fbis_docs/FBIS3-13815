Our correspondent Gadi Sukenik has the details: The contacts go on all the time with the participation of the Americans, the Egyptians, Israel, the PLO, as well as the Russians and the Norwegians. The United States has threatened 'Arafat that if he does not return immediately to the peace talks, it would veto the condemnation of the Hebron massacre by the UN Security Council. Strange as it may seem, Israel fears such a U.S. veto. 'Arafat might, so they think in Israel, dig in his heels even deeper, and the entire peace process will become even more of a mess. Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa spoke on the phone today with Shim'on Peres and suggested that a preparatory meeting be held in Cairo between lower level Israeli and PLO representatives. As we have already heard, Rabin held a long conversation with 'Arafat. Peres and Rabin met twice within 24 hours. This evening, Peres also held a meeting with Faysal al-Husayni. Everything is being done with the feeling that the situation is grave; that 'Arafat is in distress as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are under curfew or closure. Israel still demands that 'Arafat return to the negotiating table unconditionally, and only hints at a willingness to meet him part of the way on several issues. At the same time, Rabin is against evacuating the Jewish settlers from Hebron at this time, despite the fact that he had called them a time bomb and their presence there stupidity. [passage omitted] Peres stand is clear. Hence it can be gathered that, from now on, every grave incident in Hebron -- caused by either Arabs or Jews -- will be followed by an evacuation from or moving out of settlers in the city. The efforts to get Peres and 'Arafat to meet as soon as possible will continue tomorrow in an attempt to break the ice.
