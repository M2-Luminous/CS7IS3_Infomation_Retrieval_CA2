FR940721-0-00074 FR940721-0-00014 Coachmen stated that the motor vehicles it receives for further manufacture are supplied by the Big Three, which Coachmen assumed would have a domestic content label affixed to the incomplete vehicle. That company argued that individual per unit costs of implementation would be significantly higher than for the Big Three, creating a competitive disadvantage. Coachmen argued that the intent of the legislation relates to large volume producers, and that regulations should not be extended to multi-stage manufacturers, final stage manufacturers or van converters. That company stated that in addition to the interpretation as to the types of vehicles to be included, the issue of what constitutes a carline should be redefined. Coachmen stated that by using the figure of 1,000 vehicles per year as the upper limit of applicability, NHTSA has not considered the intent of the legislation. Coachmen noted that it has a van conversion division whose annual production is a small fraction of the total market but does exceed the 1,000 unit limit by a considerable amount. After considering the comments, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers, as well as all businesses that produce a total of fewer than 1,000 passenger motor vehicles for sale in the United States annually, from providing items 1 and 2 of the label (the two items that are determined on a carline basis). However, these manufacturers are required to provide items 3, 4 and 5 of the label. The agency believes that these exclusions are justified on the de minimis theory, i.e., only trivial additional benefits would be provided by not adopting the exclusions. First, NHTSA believes that the total number of vehicles affected by the exclusions is less than one percent of the vehicles covered by the statutory requirements. This is very different than the ``low end'' and ``high end'' exclusions considered above, which would each affect a large percentage of total vehicles. Second, these exclusions largely affect vehicles which are likely to be made to order and for which consumers would often not be able to inspect a label prior to making a purchase decision. Thus, even if full labeling information was provided for these vehicles, it often could not be used by consumers in making purchase decisions. NHTSA disagrees with AIAM's suggestion that the exclusion for small manufacturers be changed to apply to manufacturers which produce fewer than 1,000 vehicles to ones which produce fewer than 2,500 vehicles. As discussed above, the agency's implied authority to provide exclusions from express statutory requirements is very limited. It is the agency's judgment that the proposed limit is sufficient to cover small manufacturers which are likely to only produce vehicles to order and for which consumers are unlikely to be able to inspect a vehicle label (e.g., on a demonstrator vehicle) prior to making a purchase decision. Moreover, the concerns about carline determinations being made for only a few vehicles are not likely to be relevant. In short, the agency believes that AIAM's recommended exclusion cannot be justified on the de minimis theory. Extending the scope of the exclusion would unnecessarily deny prospective vehicle purchasers relevant content information that Congress decided they should have. For the same reasons, NHTSA is not adopting Coachmen's recommendation that the final rule exclude carlines of less than 20,000 per year and exclude recreation vehicle manufacturers, i.e., the exclusions would unnecessarily deny prospective vehicle purchasers relevant content information that Congress decided they should have. With respect to that company's recommendation that the final rule exclude van converters, NHTSA notes that many van converters are excluded as a result of being alterers. However, NHTSA has decided to exclude all final stage manufacturers from the requirements to provide items 1 and 2 on the label, rather than limiting the exclusion to multi-stage manufacturers of ``carlines'' of fewer than 1,000 vehicles. The reason for this relates both to the relatively small number of multi-stage vehicles subject to the Labeling Act requirements and the fact that key statutory definitions relevant to parts content calculations do not appear to contemplate vehicles manufactured in more than one stage. As discussed above, section 210 defines ``final assembly point'' as ``the plant, factory, or other place at which a new passenger motor vehicle is produced or assembled by a manufacturer and from which such vehicle is delivered to a dealer or importer in such a condition that all component parts necessary to the mechanical operation of such automobile are included with such vehicle *␣*␣*.'' Moreover, section 210 provides that costs incurred at or beyond the final assembly point are not included in parts content calculations. For multi-stage vehicles, it is not clear from the statutory definition whether ``final assembly point'' refers to the place where an incomplete vehicle is assembled or to the place of final stage manufacture. Regardless of which location is considered to be the point of final assembly, problems can occur in applying the statutory requirements. Assume, for example, the possibility of considering the place where the incomplete vehicle is assembled as the final assembly point. An incomplete vehicle includes, as a minimum, a frame and chassis structure, power train, steering system, suspension system, and braking system, to the extent that those systems are to be part of the completed vehicle. See 49 CFR Part 568. It might have all component parts necessary for mechanical operation. However, the vehicle is not delivered to a dealer or importer from the plant where the incomplete vehicle is assembled. Moreover, a large number of the vehicle's parts may not be included at this time. Assume instead the possibility of considering the place of final stage manufacture as the final assembly point. It might be argued that the incomplete vehicle manufacturer should be considered an outside supplier of passenger motor vehicle equipment. However, section 210 defines passenger motor vehicle equipment as ``any system, subassembly, or component received at the final vehicle assembly point for installation on, or attachment to, such vehicle *␣*␣*.'' An incomplete vehicle does not fit this definition. Moreover, if the incomplete vehicle manufacturer were considered an outside supplier of equipment, the bulk of final assembly costs (of the incomplete vehicle) would be included in parts content calculations, a result that is clearly inconsistent with Congressional intent.
