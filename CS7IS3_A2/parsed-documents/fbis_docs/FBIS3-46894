Fujii said there was no change in the timing of the package which Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed Economic Planning Agency Director General Manae Kubota late last year to compile by "around mid-January." Reports of a possible delay in the package circulated after the fourth gathering Thursday of ministers and coalition parties leaders to discuss economic problems failed to come up with a timetable. "I didn't get such a nuance" from the meeting, Fujii said, adding that the mood was to decide on the schedule. Concerning an income tax cut which is reportedly the major issue in the discussions, Fujii said that a decision on whether or not to include it in the new package has not been made but will come by mid-January, as Hosokawa pledged to the Diet. Asked about the dollar-yen rate, Fujii declined to comment on remarks by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen sounding a warning on the yen's recent setback against the dollar. Fujii said the finance ministers of the Group of Seven industrial nations agreed in September that exchange rates should reflect economic fundamentals. The agreement "has not changed and should not be changed," Fujii said, adding that he is "closely watching the market situation." Bentsen said Wednesday that "allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for Japan." His comment followed remarks by a Japanese Government official, speaking anonymously, who called for a rate of 115 yen to the dollar because a cheaper yen would have a "favorable impact" on the Japanese economy.
