From Batman, five groups of the Humanistic Union reported that they had been detained in a hotel since Friday [25 March]; until Sunday they were not permitted to use the telephone. "In Batman, we were followed by special police units at every step. They wanted to prevent any contact with the population. Those who had contact with us (even bus and taxi drivers) were threatened with arrest, torture, and death." The groups reported that, over the past year, more than 200 persons were "killed by so-called unknown perpetrators (death squads controlled by the state)" in Batman. From Diyarbakir, a group of unofficial observers, including Angelika Beer of the Federal Executive Committee of Alliance 90/Greens, faxed a message saying that they noticed "that in southeastern Turkey/northern Kurdistan those who advocate democratic rights and rights of self-determination for the Kurdish population are threatened with mass arrest, torture, and even death." Therefore, the signatories called on the Federal Government to "immediately stop any kind of deportation and expulsion of Turkish Kurds." Like the Humanistic Union, the Society for Endangered Peoples (GfvB) also accused the Federal Government of supporting the war against the Kurds by means of arms deliveries. From 1985-91 alone, Bonn delivered armament goods worth 3.6 billion German marks to Turkey, GfbV Chairman Tilmann Zuelch said in Bonn on Monday. "Unfortunately, the relentless civil war is also a consequence of German policy."
