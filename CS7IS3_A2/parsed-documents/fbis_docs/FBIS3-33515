"Our system, which is one of free market prices, does not include compulsory mechanisms. The government is not thinking of controlling market prices," the minister said, rather irritated and nervous. The government strategy regarding oligopolies, according to the minister, will be to talk with them in order to identify factors explaining all excessive price increases. Cardoso said the government decision to call on research institutes to help formulate the URV variation index has the purpose "of making clear to society that the URV is not an indicator used to manipulate results. We still have not lowered the hammer on this, but the government wants to ask these institutes to help us." According to the minister, FIPE [Economic Research Institute Foundation] President Juarez Rizzieri said the institute might have difficulties calculating the daily inflation rate, but it is willing to cooperate with the government. Cardoso believes the definition of the criteria to update the URV "is a delicate matter" that must be decided "calmly and with patience." Regarding the minimum salary, Cardoso said the way to increase the minimum salary's real purchasing power -- as the president wants -- is by increasing companies' productivity and stabilizing the price of food and other consumer goods. "Without those elements, everything will be just fantasy. We do not want to create another illusion," Cardoso said. The minister admitted the possibility of discussing the conversion of the URV with economic interest group representatives. "We can, but we have not talked about it," the minister said. Cardoso said state companies also will cooperate with the economic plan. "We are making a major effort to stabilize the economy. It is necessary for people to wait for a few month in order to achieve what we want afterward," Cardoso said.
