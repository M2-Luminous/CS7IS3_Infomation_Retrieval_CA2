This issue was discussed today at a closed session of the Duma Committee for International Affairs. The DPRK's ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Russia participated in the meeting. Vladimir Lukin told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that the discussion showed that "the North Korean position is still not quite clear." According to him, the DPRK "is either trying to `bargain' for better conditions, or gain the time necessary to conclude work on the creation of a nuclear weapon."
