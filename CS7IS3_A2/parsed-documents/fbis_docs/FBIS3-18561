This week he was making a final pitch for support in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Greece. On 9 March, when the Committee of the Regions (COR) holds its first meeting in Brussels and the 189 members vote for their president, Blanc, a French MP, the president of Languedoc-Roussillon and mayor of the tiny commune of La Canourgue, will learn whether his personal odyssey has been successful. But even before it emerges belatedly from the womb, the new committee Blanc seeks to lead seems a weakling child. The COR was designed to give the regions a voice in EU policy-making under the Maastricht Treaty. But it has been so watered down since first conceived that critics rate it the equivalent of a popgun when it comes to firing off shots at Commission President Jacques Delors and his merry men, not to mention EU governments. It has so many potential faults that some fear it could retreat into paralysis. The 189 members have been appointed in national delegations, ranging from 24 for large EU countries to six for Luxembourg. Alongside any chauvinistic differences lies the ideological divide. The COR is likely to be dominated by the centre Right, although the socialists will be the largest political grouping. But the biggest divide is likely to be the almost equal split between representatives of local authorities and those of regions, with their widely different powers and roles. For instance, the prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia with its 18 million inhabitants and a gross domestic product larger than seven EU countries, may be less than content to sit down and argue the point with local mayors and councillors. Blanc faces tough competition for the post of president. Charles Gray, a cheerful Scottish Socialist who was previously head of the EU's largest local authority, Strathclyde, has written personally to all members announcing his candidacy. Luc Van den Brande, the minister-president of Flanders, which under Belgium's new Federal Constitution enjoys considerable legislative powers, including the right to conclude international treaties, is another challenger. Finally, the contest became a four-way fight when Pasquall Maragall, the widely respected Socialist mayor of Barcelona for the past 12 years, entered the fray. There is even speculation that Jordi Pujol, the Catalan leader whose support for Felipe Gonzalez is keeping the minority Socialist Spanish Government in power, may throw his hat in the ring at the last minute, claiming that he alone has the political stature to make the early days of the COR a success. Amid these manoeuvres, Germany, the most federal EU member, is ignoring this battlefield and targeting instead the post of secretary-general, which is permanent and likely to be the seat of power. Presidents change every two years. To many it is a mystery why such experienced politicians used to wielding power at home should wish to become the figurehead of a body which enjoys neither legislative nor budgetary powers. Indeed, the COR is a far cry from the powerful body which Germany initially sought. Despite support from Belgium, Italy, Spain and the European Commission, Germany's original concept of establishing an organ to represent regional interests at the European Union level for the first time was considerably weakened during the Maastricht negotiations. To save money and curb its influence, the COR has been grafted on to the existing EU advisory body, the Economic and Social Committee (ESC). That shotgun marriage is resented by both partners. It will lead to quarrels over staff and money and has sparked fears in the largely invisible ESC, a forum for industry, business, trade union and consumer views, that it will be eclipsed by the more political COR. Both are working for an early divorce, possibly in 1996 when the Maastricht Treaty is reviewed. The COR has had a far from auspicious start to life. Last year EU government leaders decreed that it should meet by 15 January. That date was missed because of local elections in Portugal and various administrative difficulties and at least four others were pencilled in before agreement was reached to meet on 9 and 10 March. Despite the doubts, the Germans, Belgians and Spanish are treating the COR seriously. Their delegations are almost entirely composed of senior regional ministers. The COR has a purely advisory role. Under Maastricht, governments must consult it on any legislative initiative in five areas. But already the European Commission has decided to canvass its views in other areas of obvious interest to local and regional authorities, such as voting rights in local elections and immigration and asylum policy. Whether governments will listen to these views is another matter. But all the presidential candidates agree that only by putting their full political weight behind carefully crafted opinions will the COR's members be taken seriously. Many, particularly the Germans, Spanish and Belgians, will use their own national channels to ensure these views are listened to by governments. In many ways, the creation of the COR and EU treaty recognition of local and regional government is inevitable. Regionalism is a powerful force in many EU countries. About half the legislation adopted by the EU is ultimately implemented by regions and local authorities. If regions are involved in the decision making, it should, say the COR's supporters, be easier to ensure those laws are effectively applied. After the traumas of the Maastricht debate exposed the credibility gap between Europe's governments and EU institutions on the one hand and citizens on the other, many now see regions and local authorities as a means to bridge the divide. The Committee of the Regions is on probation. It has just two years before its role is reviewed in which to demonstrate to its critics and supporters why it should be taken seriously. Structure of the Committee The Committee of the Regions first meets in Brussels on 9-10 March. It has 189 members, plus an equal number of alternates, appointed by European Union governments for four years. Germany, France, Italy and Britain have 24 members each. Spain has 21, Belgium, Greece, Netherlands and Portugal have 12, Denmark and Ireland have nine, and Luxembourg has six. Budget for 1994: ECU12 million ($13.5 million). Membership ranges from regional ministers and presidents to local councillors and mayors of small villages and communes. The president is to be elected by the members at the first meeting. The secretary general is to be appointed by senior Committee members. The COR was established under the Maastricht Treaty to give EU regions a voice in policy-making. Its role is purely advisory. Governments must consult the COR in five specific areas: economic and social cohesion, including the ECU13 billion to be spent on special EU regional projects over the next six years; trans-European networks; public health; culture; and education and training. In addition, the European Commission will consult the Committee on other subjects conceived to be of regional interest.
