The ruling and opposition parties have agreed to have an assembly inspection of the suspected diversion of part of Sangmudae construction funds into political funds in late 1992. Acting DP Head Kim Won-ki said his party had decided to include in the list all those suspected of having played parts in the scandal. Among the 29 listed references were President Kim Yong-sam, former President No Tae-u and ex-rep. So Sok-chae. The witnesses selected numbered 22, who included the Rev. So Eui- hyon, disgraced ex-head of the Buddhist Chogye order secretariat; Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae; Justice Minister Kim Tu-hi; ex- Defense Minister Yi Chong-ku; DLP [Democratic Liberal Party] Rep. Kim Yun-hwan; and former Chongwadae [presidential office] Protective Service Head Yi Hyon-u. It is not likely that all of them will actually be used as witnesses or references in the upcoming probe as the ruling party is determined to use only those whose role in the alleged fund diversion can be substantiated by actual evidences.
