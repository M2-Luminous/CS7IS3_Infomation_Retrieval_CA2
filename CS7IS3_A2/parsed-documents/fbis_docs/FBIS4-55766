One thing is certain: Voters have dismissed the coalition that governed the country over the past four years, Gabor Kuncze, prime minister candidate of the Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ), told a news conference in Papa, western Hungary, today. What will be at stake on May 29 is whether voters will authorize the Free Democrats to represent their interests with an appropriate weight, Kuncze said. In his view, the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) insists on a strategy which gained plenty of votes for the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the winner of the first round of the elections. Failing to withdraw its candidates without any chance in the second round and frightening voters with a communist restoration, the MDF plays into the hands of the Socialists, and proves that it gives priority to party interests over national ones, Kuncze said. SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar, meeting reporters in Miskolc today, said the second round would decide whether a balanced political culture emerges which makes it possible to form a stable government and a coalition based on partnership for the next four years, or the MSZP gains an absolute majority in parliament. For a balanced governing coalition to be formed, the SZDSZ must fare well in the second round of the elections, Magyar said.
