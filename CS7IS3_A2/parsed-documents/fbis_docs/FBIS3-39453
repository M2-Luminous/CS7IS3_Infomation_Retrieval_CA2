FBIS3-39453 "drweu033__a94020" FBIS-WEU-94-033-A Document Type:Daily Report 17 February 1994 ANNEX Germany Nuclear Cooperation With Brazil, Argentina To Continue AU1202130794 Hamburg DPA in German 1920 GMT 11 Feb 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU1202130794 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn -- Germany wants to continue its cooperation with Brazil and Argentina in the field of nuclear energy, following Brazil's ratification of a relevant nuclear safeguard accord. The "quadripartite agreement" allows the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEO) to inspect nuclear installations of partners to the agreement. The Brazilian Senate ratified the agreement last Wednesday [9 February], apparently under pressure from the Federal Government. On Friday, the Foreign Ministry in Bonn said this "will create a stronger nonproliferation basis to allow continued cooperation in the field of peaceful uses of nuclear energy." The Federal Government hopes Brazil will shortly ratify the Tlatelolco Agreement on creating a nuclear weapons-free zone in Latin America and the Caribbean, the ministry said. The German company Siemens-KWU is building the Angra II nuclear power plant near Rio de Janeiro. According to reports in the Brazilian press, the Federal Government threatened to stop nuclear cooperation after 1995 unless Brazil admits IAEO inspectors. At the moment, routine inspections can only be carried out on appointment and in certain installations. If there is a founded suspicion of radioactive material being used for military applications, the IAEO may also examine the sensitive area of uranium enrichment. Brazil had repeatedly been suspected of being far advanced into building a nuclear bomb.
