What results is continued misunderstanding. The fact that the Thai side suggested that the Cambodian Government use diplomatic channels to resolve misunderstandings between them, rather than airing their opinions through the mass media, is a good idea. The Thai suggestion should not be directed only at the Cambodian Government, but the Thai Government itself should carry out this suggestion even if the Cambodians do not heed it and continue to accuse Thailand through foreign correspondents. An example of the Cambodian accusation concerns assistance of Thai soldiers to the Khmer Rouge during the fight for Pailin. The Thai Government should resort to diplomatic channels to deal with this issue instead of making rebuttals through the mass media. It appears that so far, the foreign media is prejudiced against the Thai military on issues pertaining to Cambodia. The way to erase this prejudice is to be open and to permit inspection. For example, after using diplomatic channels the Thai side should inform the media of its actions. The Thai Government must act to remedy the wrong understanding of the country concerned. Once such action has been taken, the Thai Government should hold a major news conference to inform the world of its actions. The Cambodian problem will occupy Thailand and create continual anxiety if Thailand ignores the problem. If the Thai Government does not correctly handle the problem, Thailand will continue to be on the receiving end of accusations arisen from either prejudice or distrust. Therefore, the solution is to be open, honest, and to allow inspection. The Thai Government must give real priority to resolving misunderstandings with the Cambodian Government and the media. It appears that we have not done so. This could be because it was felt that the problem was not that serious. It is an issue however, which will affect international trust in Thailand. The history between Thailand and Cambodia appears to be repeating itself again. The current Cambodian Government distrusts Thailand and accuses it of abetting the Khmer Rouge. The Thai Government must make a concerted and prompt effort to address this distrust. It must not ignore the problem because peace in Cambodia will benefit Thailand, particularly the Thai people along the border.
