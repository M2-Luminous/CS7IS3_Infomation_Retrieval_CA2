FR940602-1-00007 FR940602-1-00003 Backfit Analysis The NRC has determined that the backfit rule (10 CFR 50.109 or 10 CFR 72.62) does not apply to this proposed rule, and thus, a backfit analysis is not required for this proposed rule because this amendment does not involve any provisions which would impose backfits as defined in the backfit rule.
