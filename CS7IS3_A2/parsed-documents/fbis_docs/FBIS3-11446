Miguel Ortiz Jonguitud, president of the National Union of Sugar Cane Farmers under the CNPR [expansion unknown], demanded the implementation of agricultural programs to "prevent the destruction of sugar cane fields and to avoid frustrating the achievements reached so far in this six-year period." At the 15th National Congress of the aforementioned sugar cane union, Artolozaga Noriega also said the current capacity of the sector is around 5 million tons, even though the sugar cane industry has been a net exporter of surpluses. We initiated a recapitalization process, and, after noticing our prices were out of date, we realized we had neglected the area of tariffs, Artolozaga Noriega said. He said efforts are currently under way to control the marketing of sugar by means of the Sugar Commodities Market or the Trusteeship to Organize the Sugar Market (Forma) to continue efforts "to preserve the sugar cane industry." Despite all of this, Artolozaga Noriega pointed to the fact that "several sugar mills have shut down," saying they have closed "in the wake of the economic collapses specific to the regions in which they were located." He also noted that four sugar mills are about "to go bankrupt," but this does not mean they have to be shut down, because he still hopes they can be reactivated in the mid- or short-term. He added that the sugar mills that have already been closed are La Purisima in Jalisco, Juchitan in Oaxaca, and Libertad in Veracruz. Those that are about to go bankrupt are Independiente in Veracruz, Santa Rosalia in Chiapas, and Hermenegildo Galeana y Pujil in Tabasco. Meanwhile, Ortiz Jonguitud said that despite the lack of infrastructure to work the nation's sugar cane fields, Mexico ranks fifth in the world in sugar production. "As a result of a lack of new investments in various types of support programs and Mexico's transition toward a market economy, the situation in the sugar industry still has not been been rectified, and this is why we have to try to resolve this situation as soon as possible," Ortiz Jonguitud said.
