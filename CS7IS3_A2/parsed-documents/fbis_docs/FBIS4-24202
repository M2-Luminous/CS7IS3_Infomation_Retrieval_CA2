According to the prince, he has received several death threats from the KZP over the last few months. These allegations are the latest development in the war of words between Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi and the Zulu royal family on the political and financial position of King Goodwill in the Inkatha-controlled regional government of KwaZulu. Earlier this week members of the royal family issued a statement in which Mr. Buthelezi is accused of mudslinging to win Zulu support for his coalition with the ANC. In turn, Mr. Buthelezi said that certain members of the royal family are trying to drive a wedge between him and King Zwelithini. Political observers said the king has been trying to distance himself from Mr. Buthelezi since the April election.
