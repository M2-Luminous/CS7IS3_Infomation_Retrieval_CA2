About one hundred prisoners, some in warders' uniforms, escaped early on Thursday morning after breaking into the administration block and making holes in the asbestos roof. They also briefly held a number of building workers hostage inside the prison. One prisoner, convicted robber Thembelani Makeleni, was shot in a thigh and hand by a warder when he refused to heed warnings to return to his cell. Makeleni was given first aid by ISD medics before being taken to hospital. There had been minor unrest in the prison on Wednesday. On Thursday most of the staff went to Bisho to attend a court hearing on a strike in which they participated in February, leaving what one decribed as "very few" members at the prison. One of the builders, Mr David Weimers, said he was tiling cells when awaiting trial prisoners "came out" and took him and about 15 of his fellow workers hostage. The prisoners seized their angle grinder and cut open all the other cells in the mens' section. "They held us, they were standing in front of us. They didn't hit us or anything," he said. The men were freed by ISD policemen who came over the roof, fired warning shots and then lowered a ladder so they could climb to safety. They prisoners were "badly angry", Mr Weimers said. "They say they have been here too long. They haven't got a government. That's why they want to come out." The prisoners broke into a storeroom to obtain warders' uniforms used in the escape, ransacked offices, ripped metal window frames out of walls and torched several cells and the bail and fines office. After the ISD moved in, and prison staff began returning about 11AM, the prisoners moved to one courtyard at the back of the jail. After negotiations they handed over their weapons to warders, watched by ISD members. A SAPA reporter counted about 250 prisoners in the courtyard, some in convict green, others in civilian clothing. Among the weapons were warders' batons, kitchen knives, pieces of metal including tripods and a garden sickle. According to a watching warder the prisoners had said they wanted to negotiate with the jail's commanding officer, Maj W Booi, who was apparently amenable to their request. Firemen hosed down the burned-out cells.
