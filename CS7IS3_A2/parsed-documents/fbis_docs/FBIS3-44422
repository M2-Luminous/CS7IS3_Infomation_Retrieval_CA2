Despite the government ban on such links, many marine companies sail direct to the mainland coast. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will use the BOFT report in deciding whether to recommend that the ban on marine links be lifted. BOFT Director-General Huang Yen-chao said that ships sailing to mainland ports are flying foreign flags which makes them difficult to police. He said direct marine links should be considered as long as they don't involve mutual recognition problems.
