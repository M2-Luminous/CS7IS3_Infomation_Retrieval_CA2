ACTION: Direct final rule. SUMMARY: EPA approves the State implementation plan (SIP) revisions submitted by the State of Montana with a letter dated March 2, 1994. This submittal addresses the Federal Clean Air Act requirement to submit contingency measures for both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ) and for carbon monoxide (CO) for the areas in Missoula designated as nonattainment for the PM 10 and CO National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Further, this submittal satisfies several commitments made by the State in a previous PM 10 SIP submittal. Due to the completion of those commitments, EPA is approving the related rules of the Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program, as adopted by the Montana Board of Health and Environmental Sciences (MBHES) on June 28, 1991 and amended on March 20, 1992 and November 19, 1993, and submitted by the Governor in letters dated August 20, 1991, June 4, 1992, and March 2, 1994. These rules include regulations regarding inspections, emergency procedures, minor source construction permitting, open burning, and wood waste burners. EPA also approves minor revisions to the previously approved Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapters VII and VIII, as included in the March 2, 1994 submittal. Further, EPA is declining to take action on Missoula's minor source operating permit regulations. Finally, EPA disapproves Missoula City-County Air Pollution Control Program's Chapter X, Variances, which was submitted on August 20, 1991.
