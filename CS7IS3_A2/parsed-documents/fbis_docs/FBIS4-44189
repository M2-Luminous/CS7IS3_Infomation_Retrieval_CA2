In this case, however, it means a new chapter of U.S. foreign policy under the working title: Europe is "in" again. Richard Holbrooke is not just leaving, he is climbing up the ladder -- to lead the European section in the Department of State, an institution which was powerful in the past but has recently been almost forgotten, and will now be clearly revitalized with Holbrooke. He is not a reserve player in Clinton's team, but a major player -- with a good network of relations within the administration and the party. The Washington seismographs have already registered another underground event. Jenonne Walker, who is responsible for Europe in the National Security Council and was hardly doing a better job than former head of the European section Stephen Oxman, was fired in an elegant way. She will become ambassador to Prague. Her successor in the White House will be a heavyweight. Incidentally, a Washington think tank, the Economic Strategy Institute, has just published a report that reverses the traditional truth: The future of the United States is not in Asia, but in "old," "weary," "sclerotic" (these are the usual adjectives) Europe. How come -- since it has been preached for years that the fate of the United States will be decided in the high-growth Asian region, amidst the "little tigers" and "large dragons?" Titled "Europe and the U.S. Economy -- the Most Important of All Bilateral Relations," the study presents the following account: Trade with Japan and China accounts for 70 percent of the U.S. deficit, whereas the United States reaches a surplus in trade with Europe. The United States exports raw materials to the Far East and imports high-tech products from there; with Europe, it is the other way round. Regarding direct investment, Europe and the United States are mutually the largest investors, whereas Japan continues to block U.S. investment. The political upshot is this: "It is the Europeans who share the U.S. notions on the future of the world economic order most;" one should not "mistake individual conflicts for conflicts on principles." Did Secretary of State Warren Christopher not complain about the fact last year that there was "a lot of criticism" from Europe, but not from Asia, and that Western Europe was no longer "the dominant region in the world"? The three visits to Europe of Bill Clinton (in January, June, and July) speak a different language, and the reasons for the "promotion" of Europe are obvious. First, enthusiasm for the Pacific region is ebbing away. China -- with its human rights and Korean policy -- has proved to be a difficult partner, which is demonstrating its big power awareness too often through opposition to Washington. Japan remains a stubborn trading partner who is trying to ward off all attacks against its market fortress in the jujitsu style, but is also unable to give itself a stable, functioning government. Nor has the United States forgotten those "Asiatic values" that Singapore mentioned to justify the humiliating whipping of a U.S. youth. Second, Europe is not as boring or as stable as had been assumed after the end of the 40-Years War -- the Cold War. Italy, once the most reliable ally, has become a question mark following the election of Berlusconi and the neofascists. France and Britain are both suffering from progressive leadership weakness -- each country in its own way. The same holds true for Spain. In Bosnia, every cease-fire has proved to be a treacherous interruption, during which the three warring parties establish new potentials and positions for the next phase. On the other side of the Elbe river, Washington sees former communists regain strength, while Russia -- no matter how strong or weak it is -- continues to be a problem for Europe. Briefly, foreign policy, which was apparently tamed after the end of the Cold War, has got its clutches on Bill Clinton again. It could even cost him his reelection in two years -- what with Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Korea, where Clinton has not really shown brilliant leadership. Then the electorate will not deal with Clinton's scandals and love affairs any more, but will ask how he turned the superpower's talents that the United States inherited after the collapse of the Soviet Union, to good account. That is why a reshuffle has begun in the present half-time -- primarily on the classical European parquet, which seems to be much more slippery than it was one or two years ago. However, this will not be enough. On the upper floors, too -- regarding Security Adviser Lake and State Secretary Christopher -- there is growing unrest. Anyway, there is increasing speculation on their possible successors. The Europeans should welcome the new respect for the "old continent" and the reshuffle in Washington because a confusing, unsteady, and sometimes even blase foreign policy "Made in U.S.A." has never been an advantage for Europe. However, it is not the underlings who are responsible for foreign policy but their chief. He can only be exchanged by the U.S. voters.
