The candidacy was made after the withdrawal of Ireland, Greece, and Sweden, which said it will be seeking the job for 1997-98. The appointment is expected to be approved by the UN General Assembly in October. The Security Council has five permanent members -- the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and 10 nonpermanent members rotating every two years. Italy and Germany are among the countries which have repeatedly requested an enlargement of the Council.
