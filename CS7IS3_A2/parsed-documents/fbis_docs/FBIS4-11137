In many states local PSDB members support the agreement with the PFL at the national level, but they reject regional coalitions with the same party. Ceara, the state run by the only PSDB governor, is the best example of this conflict. PSDB members in Ceara State do not want to hear about any alliance with local PFL members, whom they regard as their longtime adversaries. In Ceara State, PSDB members would rather form an alliance with the PT [Workers Party] and the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. The PT could nominate the running mate for Tasso Jereissati, the PSDB candidate for governor of Ceara State. Deputy Jackson Pereira (PSDB-Ceara State) said: "There is a no-win situation here." If Cardoso comes to Fortaleza to attend a rally, the local PSDB leaders will not allow their PFL counterparts to share the same stage with them. "Either the presidential candidate decides not to come here, or we will have to hold separate rallies," Pereira added. In Pernambuco, the PSDB has two federal deputies who may have to go separate ways. Deputy Wilson Campos (PSDB-Pernambuco State) supports the gubernatorial candidacy of Miguel Arraes, who is running for the PSB [Brazilian Socialist Party]-PT coalition. The other PSDB deputy for Pernambuco is Maurilio Ferreira Lima, who favors an alliance with the PFL and the PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]. Campos has suggested that the PSDB give freedom of action to its members to vote for the candidate of their choice in the Pernambuco gubernatorial election. He said that, otherwise, he would still vote for Arraes and admitted the possibility of voting for [PT candidate Luis Inacio] Lula [da Silva] for president. In his efforts to widen his support base, Cardoso has compounded these conflicts. In Mato Grosso do Sul State, the local PSDB branch reached an agreement with the PMDB to support PMDB gubernatorial candidate Wilson Martins. The incumbent governor, Pedro Pedrossian (Brazilian Labor Party), has torpedoed the agreement. Pedrossian persuaded Cardoso that in order for the presidential candidate to obtain his support the local PSDB must endorse the gubernatorial candidate nominated by Pedrossian. This provoked a division among PSDB members in the state. There is a similar problem in Parana State. The local PSDB branch already has agreed to form a coalition with Jaime Lerner, the Democratic Labor Party candidate for Parana governor, but Cardoso has promised Popular Party leader Alvaro Dias that the PSDB would support him. Deputy Deni Schwartz (PSDB-Parana State) said: "They are going to destroy the party if they insist on that agreement." He said Lerner has always been "loyal" to the PSDB and does not deserve to be abandoned. In Rio de Janeiro, Cardoso will face the predicament of having to support one of these two candidates for governor: Marcello Alencar (PSDB) and General Newton Cruz (Democratic Social Party), who could obtain the PFL endorsement.
