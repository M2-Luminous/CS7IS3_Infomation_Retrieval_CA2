General Fabian Escalante, from the Interior Ministry, spoke at the Union of Cuban Journalists' (UPEC) headquarters to reporters from all media at the ceremony launching his book: "Cuba: The CIA's Secret War," [Cuba: La Guerra Secreta de la CIA] The event was part of a program organized by UPEC celebrating Cuban press day. The program will conclude on 14 March by honoring the 26 March anniversary of state security organizations. The book discloses the background to a series of events that took place starting with the triumph of the Revolution in 1959 and before the failed Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961. A long chain of conspiracies, assassination attempts against Cuban President Fidel Castro and other revolutionary leaders, the preparation of the previously mentioned Bay of Pigs invasion, as well as other, lesser known events, are detailed by the author. This has been based on declassified documents and statements by participants and witnesses. During his conversation with reporters, Escalante, who joined the Cuban Interior Ministry in 1960, made reference to CIA and other U.S. Special Service efforts to obstruct the profound Cuban political process, initially, and then later to destroy it. A significant number of anecdotes on the struggle carried out by the nation's newly born security apparatus, in that early period, to resist and beat Washington's plans were related at the UPEC event. At the conclusion of his presentation, Gen. Escalante explained to PRENSA LATINA, in brief statements, that only because of the massive participation of the Cuban people were they able to win such an unequal confrontation. If the people had not been on the side of the Revolution, he added, this would not have been possible, taking into account the enemy's enormous resources. Escalante indicated that in his opinion, Cuba's true history is the history written by the people in their daily struggle and in the defense of a nation faced with foreign aggression.
