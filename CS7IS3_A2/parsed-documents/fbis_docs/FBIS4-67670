Two AIDS victims who died March 6 and March 7, respectively, sent shock waves through the nation because they hid or did not know of the fact that they had been infected with the HIV virus. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs estimates those infected with AIDS across the country at around 1,000, one-third of whom are under the ministry's strict health control. The cause of death was found to be connected with the AIDS virus one day after a 36-year-old only identified as Ku died March 6, a ministry official said. And a man identified as So, 37, had been dead four days before he was diagnosed as an AIDS victim, he added. An Ethiopian seaman was ordered March 14 to leave the country after he was found to be HIV positive, the official said. He was the 43rd foreigner diagnosed as an AIDS carrier. Those foreigners are forced to return to their countries.

Of them 44 have died and one emigrated to an unknown country. HIV causes AIDS or acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
