At the least, the terrorists committed a crime by killing a Thai and putting his body in a water tank that contained explosives. Imagine how serious the damage would have been if the highly destructive bomb had really exploded. The damage would not only have affected the target of the terrorists' revenge, but also Thai people who were not the target of their vengeance at all. Therefore, we must not let this savage act pass like a trivial issue. At least their colleagues in the movement will realize that committing terrorist acts, killing our people, and causing damage in our country are unacceptable to us. They will never gain the Thai people's sympathy or support for their fight. Therefore, this terrorist act in our country has ruined any chance for friendship and understanding from the Thai people. They must keep this fact in mind. Whatever the target of the terrorist act was -- whether it involved the Palestinian-Israeli problem, the Arab-Israeli conflict, or any religious or political dispute -- if they cannot love each other the way human beings should help and sympathize with one another, and if they remain vengeful rather than reaching an understanding with each other, let them carry out their revenge somewhere else. They must not use Thai territory as a battlefield for their vengeance and destruction. Thailand is friendly with all countries. Our country is open to people of all nations in compliance with our policy of promoting tourism, which is a way to bring money into the country and encourage the country's economic growth. We do not want this open door policy to make our country a battlefield for people from one country to take out revenge and kill people from other countries, or for a follower of one ideology to harm someone who holds different beliefs. We do not want our country to be a venue for revenge. We hope they understand the Thai people's desires. They must know that committing crimes in other countries will cause them to be hated. At the same time, it will also isolate them from the world community. An isolated struggle, without sympathy from the world community, will never bring victory -- only defeat. Those who commit terrorist acts in other countries will be denied entry. Thailand is ready to deny entry and not welcome these kinds of people.
