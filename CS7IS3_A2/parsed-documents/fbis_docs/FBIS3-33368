This announcement marks the end of the Governability Pact between the opposition and national government. Laino said there is a time for everything, and the opposition has patiently waited long enough to see if the government would improve things but unfortunately it continues to be partial, represents a single party, has not allowed the opposition to participate, and has not shown any political will to fight corruption. Laino also said the party would seek new paths other than the Governability Pact to speed up the country's democratization because it believes the social situation in Paraguay is unsustainable. The former "authentic" presidential candidate said the government has no political will to respond with due dignity and respect to social demands and charged that corruption continues to plague the state apparatus. Laino added: "We believe that with only a 30 percent success in the struggle against corruption we already would have enough money to buy land and invest in the construction of hospitals and schools, which is precisely the key to the challenge we are facing." The opposition leader said the current social situation is too serious; therefore, one cannot think about long term socioeconomic plans because in the long term we will have all died. In our case, we cannot even talk about a medium-term plan, only of a national emergency plan. Laino added that the social situation is absolutely serious and if the government does not respond to the demands now, we are going to find ourselves in a situation that may turn the current system not only unstable but also make the country ungovernable. Laino then insisted again that the Paraguayan opposition must start thinking about changing its own policy regarding the government because it already has waited long enough and cannot continue waiting another seven months, and that the executive branch should be aware of this because "our attitude has always been responsible, sensible, but there are no signs of a solution to the social problems."
