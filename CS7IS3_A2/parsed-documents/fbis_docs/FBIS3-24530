The 12 compounds were 5 to 20 nucleotides long, some of which corresponded to stretches of 5S rRNA of E.coli. Oligonucleotides bearing 2'-amino-2'-deoxyribopyridines withstood acid hydrolysis, with the amino groups undergoing acetylation and reacting with FITC to form fluorescent compounds. CD spectra and melting studies showed that the 2'-amino-2'-deoxypyridine moieties destabilized DNA-duplexes. Comparative evaluation indicated that such derivatized oligodeoxyribonucleotides with a high G:C content may find application as hybridization probes; similar arguments apply to derivatives with modifications on the 3'- or 5'-ends of the oligonucleotides.
