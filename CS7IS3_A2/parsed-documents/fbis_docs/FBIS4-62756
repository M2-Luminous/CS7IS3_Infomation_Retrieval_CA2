The correspondent says that Russia has declined an invitation to take part in a meeting of the Paris Club of the country's creditors on 2-3 June. The correspondent reports that at a news conference on 17 May, Shokhin said that he considered the recent granting of credit by the IMF as sufficient reason for concluding a new agreement with the Paris Club. In a recording, Shokhin says that two weeks would not be sufficient time to work out repayment proposals based on Russia's budget. Shokhin says: "It is necessary to hold preliminary consultations with the members of the Paris Club so that the meeting, itself, should produce results. We do not yet have the basic concept for restructuring the 1994 payments and we are simply physically unable to draw up this concept by 2-3 June. And for this reason we have asked for the meeting to be held in mid-June." Shokhin concludes by saying that the important thing is for a realistic repayment figure to be reached.
