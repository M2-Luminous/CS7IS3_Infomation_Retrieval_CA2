The PDC communique pointed out "one can never choose one's adversaries; reality determines them." This organization is composed of liberals, social democrats, and Christian democrats. This communique was issued in response to the decision by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Assembly of the People's Government to reject PDC participation in this dialogue because its members do not number even "three dozen people" and because, according to the committee, this group has worked for the CIA. The PDC called these accusations "false" and "useless" and attributed them to sectors of the Cuban regime. The PDC "has enough support and popularity inside and outside Cuba to play an essential role (...) to bring about, without bloodshed, a definitive end to the crisis facing the country." the communique stated.
