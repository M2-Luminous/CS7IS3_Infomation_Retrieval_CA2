SC of the United States, here this afternoon. Founded in 1913, the Chicago-based Arthur Andersen Company is one of the six accounting and consulting giants in the world, whose services span the globe. The Chinese premier voiced appreciation for the company's vital China business activities in the past 15 years. China's economy is growing rapidly and there is great potential for it to expand foreign economic and trade cooperation, Li noted. "We welcome direct foreign investment," he said, adding that China has advantages in labor, consumer market, resources and other aspects. Economic development makes it all the more necessary for China to set up a modern enterprise system, Li said. China is ready to draw from advanced foreign experience and willing to conduct cooperation with reputable financial, accounting and consulting companies, Li said. The country hopes to get their help in asset evaluation, accounting and the raising of foreign funds, he noted. During the meeting, Li also briefed Weinbach and his party on China's stance on Sino-U.S. relations and the issue of the most favored nation (MFN) trade status. Weinbach assured Li that no matter what happens, his company will not change its commitments to China. China's reform and opening-up and its economy have achieved a lot, attracting an increasing number of enterprises from all over the world to cooperate with China, he said. The U.S. business community holds that it is abnormal for the U.S. and China, two of the world's most influential countries, not to maintain good ties and support the extension of MFN to China. They will make efforts to remove obstacles to the development of U.S.-China economic and trade ties, he said. His company will continue its support for the improvement and development of bilateral relations, Weinbach noted.
