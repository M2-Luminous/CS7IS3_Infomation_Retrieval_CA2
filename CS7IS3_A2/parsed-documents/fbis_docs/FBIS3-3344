The letter, signed by a previously unheard of group called the Association of Chinese Patriots and sent to Japanese news agencies in Beijing, hails Hosokawa's visit and asks him to continue the efforts started last week by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on human rights and democracy. "The Chinese people have long carried in their hearts a bad image of the Japanese Government," the letter said. "This is not only because of the history of the Japanese invasion. But more importantly because all previous Japanese Governments have paid scant attention to democracy and human rights in China." While blaming Japanese aggressors for killing millions of Chinese 50 years ago, the letter attacks China's "one-party dictatorship" and accuses it of allowing "tens of millions of unlucky Chinese citizens" to perish in a series of disasters brought on by the Communist Party. "We sincerely hope Your Excellency Morihiro Hosokawa, who was able to end the long-term rule of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, will also be able to end a Japanese diplomatic history which has paid no attention to human rights and democracy," it said. During a welcoming banquet at the Great Hall of the People on Saturday, Hosokawa urged China to improve its human rights record, saying the international community recognizes human rights as a universal value. Hosokawa made the call after Premier Li Peng briefed him about exchanges that took place between Christopher and Chinese leaders over human right. The Japanese prime minister, who is currently on a three-day visit to China through Monday, met Li again and then President Jiang Zemin.
