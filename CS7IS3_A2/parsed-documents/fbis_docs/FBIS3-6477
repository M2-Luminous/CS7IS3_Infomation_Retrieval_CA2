The chairman of the National Executive Committee of the Left Revolutionary Union of Peru, Angel Castro Lavarello, received the Korean ambassador on March 9. He said the United States should honestly implement the agreed conclusions, and added: "The third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks must be held as scheduled and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula must be resolved in a package deal as proposed by the DPRK." The chairman of the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party, Narayan Man Bijukchhe, released a statement on March 4 saying that the "nuclear issue" on the Korean peninsula had been invented and scenarized by the United States and it had rendered the situation of the Korean peninsula strained against the interests of the Asian people. He voiced firm solidarity with the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people in the consistent efforts they are making for the relaxation of the situation of the Korean peninsula through talks, maintaining a principled stand, undaunted by the U.S. pressure and threat.
