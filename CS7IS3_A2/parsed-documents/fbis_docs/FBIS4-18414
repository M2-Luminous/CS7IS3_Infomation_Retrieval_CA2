Even the Rhine-Westphalian Institute for Economic Research (RWI) in Essen, the smallest of the empirical economic research institutes in the old laender, can feel the pinch. "At the moment there are many good researchers to be had on the market, so you really feel bad about not having the money," says Paul Klemmer, the RWI's president. There is no denying it: the situation is getting tighter. The basic subsidy granted to the institutes by the Federal Government and the host land increases only nominally. In fact, the RWI got less this year than the year before. This is why Klemmer is looking for solutions internationally--in keeping with the recommendation of the Scientific Advisory Council composed of representatives of the Federal Government, the laender, and science which sets the guidelines for the German research community. One of the plans being drawn up is a cooperative venture with China, financed by the Federal Government. The RWI is to provide the Chinese with know-how on preventing carbon dioxide emissions. In exchange, Klemmer hopes to obtain data about the PRC "which is not normally available." In Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia an RWI team is looking into the chances for the middle class. In the case of on-site studies, the RWI researchers work jointly with local institutes. But before they do they must "separate the wheat from the chaff," Klemmer says in describing the difficulties in determining who is who in research in Central Europe. Klemmer's researchers cannot rely on already available data. "You might as well burn" the statistical material, he says. The Advisory Council would like to see the institutes increase the amount outside clients spend on research. This includes all the money earned from studies commissioned by public sector agencies and business firms. The total RWI budget for 1992 was 9.04 million German marks (DM). Outside commissions accounted for DM2.4 million or 26 percent and in 1993 the third-party share rose to 28 percent. Like the other institutes on the so-called blue list, the RWI receives a basic subsidy. That subsidy which increased from DM6.07 million in 1992 to DM7.29 million in 1993 was cut 3.3 percent this year to DM7.06 million. Income from membership fees (the RWI is a nonprofit organization), publications, and rentals accounts for about 6 percent of the total. Third-party research projects raise problems for Klemmer in personnel planning. Currently, the RWI has a staff of 72, of which 40 are professionals. The better the researchers, the longer the contracts Klemmer must offer them. If he operates on a tight budget, personnel costs which account for about 70 percent of the total budget force him to "chase after every contract" even if it does not fit into his research portfolio. Klemmer does gain some flexibility by farming out occasional research projects to university professors. The economics ministry in Bonn is the RWI's principal client. In 1993, it paid the RWI DM440,000 for its work on the joint economic forecast alone. The ministry's total RWI research contracts amount to almost DM1.8 million. One particular RWI niche is regional economic analysis. Klemmer believes that this is the direction in which the industrial base debate will go. These days the question no longer is whether an investor can be lured to Great Britain or Germany. Competition now is more among regions or large cities such as Frankfurt or Milan. Researchers have looked into regional opportunities for Baden-Wurttemberg, the city of Muenster and the Bernau area. Klemmer considers it "exciting" that hard factors such as geographic location account for only 30 to 40 percent of the attractiveness of a given region. As for the rest, it is the region's image that counts--which is hard to alter. As far as regional research is concerned, the RWI team can draw on the institute's past experience. Although the RWI celebrated its 50th anniversary in May 1993 it was really founded in 1926 by Ernst Wagemann, the president of the then-Berlin Institute for Economic Research (today's German Institute for Economic Research) and was then known as that institute's "Western Department." Most Departments Work on Environmental Economics Situated in the center of the Ruhr region, the institute's principal emphasis was on coal, iron, and steel. When it became an independent institute in 1943 the RWI began to concern itself with extraregional issues as well. Since 1978 the Essen institute has been issuing reports on economic structure in rotation with the other research institutes. In 1988/89 the RWI gained negative publicity when the board of directors was accused of tax fraud. At that time, Horst Siebert was set to take the place of RWI President Hans Karl Schneider but eventually decided in favor of the Institute for World Economics in Kiel. In early 1989 Paul Klemmer took over as head of the RWI. Klemmer, 58, an expert in regional economics, brought his specialty to the RWI from his professorship for economic policy at Bochum's Ruhr University, a chair he still holds today. A native of Freiburg, Klemmer characterizes his political outlook as "pragmatic liberalism." Like Siebert, he is interested in environmental economics which has a bearing on the activities of all eight RWI departments. Klemmer would like to see the other institutes to "stand up and be counted" on the ecology issue. As for the RWI itself, he calls it "not really tax friendly," taking a rather dim view of ecology-oriented tax reform. One traditional focus of RWI's interest are the crafts. The institute has put out an annual report on that sector of the economy since 1954. In addition, it regularly publishes the RWI Economic Reports and Economic News.
