The Cabinet of Ministers at the last moment changed the draft budget, proposing an increase in resources for the defense forces. Please specify what steps are anticipated to improve the condition of the defense forces. [Turlais] Unfortunately I cannot say anything, because Latvia is ruled by a unique situation: the commander of the army does not participate either in assesssing the needs of the defense forces, nor in dviding up the budget, that is, deciding who needs the most. In truth the government disinforms the taxpayers: The sum alloted for defense also includes financing for various state institutions unrelated to defense. People conclude that the army is alloted large sums of money, but I cannot tell exactly how much. No one has provided an overview of how much has gone to the army in the previous two years, nor do I know how much there will be. It seems to me that the main problem is that the Finance Ministry has a rather murky idea of what the defense budget should look like, what it should include, and what its organizational structure is. The Finance Ministry ought to have a department, or at least a section, which works with the military budget. There is no way that a "Soviet" accountant can develop a state defense budget! The second problem is that the defense budget, by virtue of its very size, becomes political; ideology, rather than practical needs, becomes the determining factor. [Stamers] Aleksandrs Kirsteins, chairman of the Saeima Foreign Affairs Commission, has expressed the opinion that as Latvia's first priority it is essential to secure real control over our territory, and he has suggested that defense be offered the means to obtain an anti-aircraft defense system: ground-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons. Do you believe that that is a priority? [Turlais] Yes. We have discussed these questions with Mr. Kirsteins. You must understand that a country's borders include not only the dry land and the sea, but also air space is included in a coutry's territory. That does not mean that we must shoot everything down to the ground, but we must know, must control who finds their way into this airspace--with or without our permission--and we must implement also security operations. In turn, about land forces armaments, if there are no anti-tank devices, we cannot talk seriously about our defense forces, the Home Guard. We will not challenge tanks with clubs, sticks and Molotov cocktails alone. [Stamers] Estonia has decided to buy weapons, this same kind, from Israel. When Latvia decides, will it also be Israel? [Turlais] That's not of primary importance. The question is a different one: "Why is Latvia do nothing?" We both started at the same time, but now the Estonians have both anti-tank and anti-aircraft systems and armored transport. The Estonian army has the technology; they have mobilized battalions that are able to function. The Lithuanians are also armed; they have ships, airplanes with missiles. They are capable of doing something. Why are we implementing almost nothing? Why have there been no final decisions on my initiatives to manufacture cartridges, to purchase weapons? [Stamers] Do you no the answer to this question? [Turlais] I think that everyone knows how many shrill politicians we have who are able to philosophize and talk about anything, but really do nothing, only create a situation in which the government does not take practical steps. That is to an extent the weakness of the government, that everything is done looking backwards: What will be the reaction? Who will criticize us? But the country's security interests cannot be based only on popularity. The election campaign must be forgotten. We must remember that now there is a government and it must take responsibilty. It can only be taken by doing. To do nothing would be irresponsible. [Stamers] In your opinion are the chief culprits the indecisive ministers who prepare the budget? [Turlais] Without a doubt! No one else has state authority to supply the army, to purchase weapons. We could go down a different path, trying to reach an agreement with "Pardaugava," to find out if that concern needs an army. If the government decides to attach the army to some firm, then this firm could be given the authority to buy weapons, to supply the army. Only one must ask whether the army would defend the state's interests in such a case? [Stamers] Let's discuss the defense forces themselves. Everybody remembers that there was a review carried out to clarify their readiness for battle. What has been done since that time to decrease the length of time necessary for the army to be ready for battle after a declaration of emergency or war? [Turlais] I do not know who decided that the length of time was too long and who wants to set the criteria. To review battle readiness one must know at least the basics of what that means. If battle readiness is evaluated based on how quickly and and in what direction a soldier runs when someone whistles, then the saying comes to mind: "A running officer in peacetime provokes laughter, but in wartime he provokes panic." [Stamers] So then, what are the criteria for battle readiness? [Turlais] First of all, the extent to which the army's material-technical needs are ensured, to execute its assignments. Secondly, the human factor, or how high is the level of training for any soldier, from army commander to infantryman; how well do they understand their assignments, how prepared are they to carry them out. Thirdly, the effectiveness of the leadership system. There three factors also establish battle readiness. If one of them is zero or at only a low level, then the level of battle readiness, regardless of how high the other indicators are, will not exceed the level of the lowest factor. Therefore, if the army is not armed, then the rest of the conditions for battle readiness will not save them. And similarly, if there is no leadership, then an armed army also cannot do anything. To perceive battle readiness in such an illiterate way as was done is shameful and unseemly. It does not reflect on the level of the army, but rather on the level of the Saeima commission, to examine in such a way and not to draw any conclusions regarding what the legislators must do to change the situation. [Stamers] Do you assert that neither the Saeima, nor the government is taking into account that battle readiness must be resolved with a complex approach? [Turlais] I think that they are practically not working in that way. [Stamers] A question related to the 10 Jaunuary [1994] incident. The proposed national security policy, which was developed by the defense ministry, stated that one possible security threat to Latvia is the conflicting lines of authority of the Latvian armed services. As was exemplified by the aforementioned incident, the fact that the municipal police were given an order by a municipal leader could have led to a military conflict. What would you suggest and what is being done to change the situation? [Turlais] Currently, according to U.N. data, it seems that there are 186 countries in the world and Latvia, I think, is the only country in which the armed forces are not led by the defense ministry, the government. There are no alternative solutions: All armed forces must be under the control of the defense ministry. Then at least there will be a specific responsible official. If a conflict arises, then the defense minister alone will be able to resolve the problem, that would be his responsibility. But right now, for example, to disentangle a conflict, first, one must find the Home Guard, persuade their chief that they have not acted properly and then the chief tries to recall or influence the Home Guards. Or also one must seek out the municipal police chief and try to persuade him that the municipality alone does not make policy, but that the government, too, has a word. After that there appears a third power: the municipality chairman, who has established his own guards and armed them himself. [Stamers] But in accordance with the Constitution the President is formally the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. [Turlais] It is up to him, no doubt, to achieve that in reality, as well as formally. [Stamers] Your ministry is developing the state defense policy. When will deputies and the press be able to see it? [Turlais] The mass media also does everything possible to disinform people and to preclude that to which we aspire. We have rejected the former Soviet armed forces and security model. We have turned toward Western Europe, to the democratic states model, but our consciousness is still hobbling along on both legs; we think like Communists. You, speaking to me as the commander of the army, are always asking me, "What is the defense ministry doing?" I do not know! The defense ministry is a government institution, which is above the defense forces as civilian political control. It is concerned with planning defense policy, with planning and implementing budgets, with control of the army. The army is not a component part of the ministry. It is time to forget the Soviet model! We have only the Home Guard under the "Marshall principle," in which there is nothing above the "Marshall." That is not right. Above all military forces must be civilian political control. The armed forces themselves may not establish policy, influence goverment decrees and dictate conditions. [Stamers] Good. I will give the previous question to Minister Pavlovskis. [Turlais] Of course, defense policy interests me, too. And as a professional I want to say that it should not be exaggerated with an ominous analysis. I say, if we do not have that, then we can do almost nothing. In the world everything changes; both our domestic and our foreign policies are dynamic. What would happen to ominous analyses? In the time it takes to draft them, print them, while it goes through the bureaucratic apparatus and comes to examination to adopt it a month has gone by and the situation is completely different. In place of that we must try to look at the future strategically. There must be people responsible for the country's security: the Prime Minister and his cabinet, the Saeima, which must pass laws so that the government, the Prime Minister and the armed forces can operate. But it cannot be that each deputy dictates to me to do what he views as the best. Deputies have the right to use their votes to develop laws, but not to dictate a stance or their fancies. I would like to find another among the 186 countries in which a deputy arrived at headquarters and sounded an alarm.
