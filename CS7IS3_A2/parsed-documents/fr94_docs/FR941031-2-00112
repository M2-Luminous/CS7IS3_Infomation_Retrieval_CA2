FR941031-2-00112 FR941031-2-00080 Policy _The FAA intends to consider requests for Letters of Intent (LOI) under the Airport Improvement Program (AIP) (or successor programs) at primary or reliever airports only for airside development projects with significant capacity benefits. This focus is intended to maximize the systemwide impact of capacity projects, especially given the limited amounts of funds available for LOI projects. The FAA will use this policy in considering all future LOI requests. The FAA's decision to approve an LOI will be made based primarily on a benefit-cost analysis. This analysis will consider local and systemwide benefits in terms of annual aircraft delay savings, measured as the avoided costs of operating delayed aircraft and the value of passenger time associated with avoided delays. In addition, the net value to airlines, the airport, and the public from additional air transportation service will be considered. Project costs will be apportioned among Federal AIP discretionary funds, Federal AIP entitlement funds, and nonfederal funds. Financially sound projects will be selected for LOI approval in a manner that leverages Federal AIP discretionary funds to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with rational investment decisionmaking. The best candidates for approval will be those projects for a new airport, new runway, or major runway extension at cities or metropolitan areas where the primary airport exceeds or is expected to exceed 20,000 hours of annual air carrier delay. Apron development in support of terminal work is considered airside development. Federal environmental findings must be complete and the project work must be imminent. Starting in fiscal year (FY) 1995, applications for LOI's are to be submitted to the local FAA office no later than March 1 of the current FY for FAA decisionmaking during that FY. Applications received after March 1 may not be decided upon until the following FY. This policy does not apply to outstanding LOI's already issued to airport sponsors. The FAA will apply this policy to all other LOI requests. FAA Review of LOI Requests The FAA will consider each proposed project in accordance with the following selection criteria. Each of the following three items will be reviewed for an LOI request. 1. Project Effect on Overall National Air Transportation System Capacity The FAA will analyze the project(s) effect on overall national air transportation system capacity in accordance with agency methodology and modeling capabilities. To do this, FAA will analyze the airport for which the LOI is requested and estimate the current hours of annual flight delay. The FAA will then determine the systemwide impact of the project(s) in terms of reduced annual aircraft and passenger delays at current and future airport activity levels. The FAA may request information from sources at the airport or may visit the site to collect data needed to model the proposed airport improvement. The FAA will also review any capacity analysis conducted by the airport and submitted with the application. The data requirements will be airport/terminal airspace specific and will be collected by the FAA. The data required will include, but are not limited to: The approved airport layout plan; type of operations; fleet mix; peak hour airfield mix by class; runway occupancy times; taxiway exit percentages; noise, obstruction, terrain, aircraft departure, and aircraft arrival constraints; air traffic arrival and departure streams; minimum vectoring altitudes; aircraft separation by aircraft type; length of and approach speeds on common approach by aircraft type and weather; converging and/or parallel runway dependencies; aircraft arrival and departure dependencies; and the different runway use configurations in the various wind and weather conditions. The data available or to be collected are very similar to those data assembled for FAA Airport Capacity Task Force and Capacity Design Teams studies. Many of the proposed capacity improvements have already been modeled and calibrated during FAA Airport Capacity Design Team studies and would only require updating. The updating would include any new national air traffic approach procedures, separation standards, and capacity initiatives implemented by the specific airport traffic control tower or airport authority. 2. Project Benefit and Cost Analysis will involve a detailed review of future benefits and costs for each year of the project's expected life, discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate. The FAA will measure benefits in terms of annual cost savings attributable to reduced delays, to be measured as the avoided costs of operating delayed aircraft (e.g., fuel and oil, crew, and maintenance savings) and the monetary value of saved passenger time. In addition, the net value to airlines, the airport, and the public from additional air transportation service made possible by the capacity project will be considered. Costs will be estimated for planning, construction, operation, and maintenance of the project, and will be apportioned according to origin of funding_Federal AIP discretionary funds, Federal AIP entitlement funds, and nonfederal funds. To be eligible for further consideration, the proposed project must have present value benefits that exceed present value costs and must have appropriate sponsor financial commitment (see section 3 below). The FAA will select among eligible projects with the object that Federal AIP discretionary funds will attract funding from other sources to the maximum extent feasible, consistent with rational investment decisionmaking. To accomplish this objective, the FAA will consider various measures of project financial viability (e.g., net present values, benefit-cost ratios, and rates of return) relative to the amount of Federal AIP discretionary funds requested. Eligible projects to be funded entirely with Federal AIP entitlement funds will be approved for LOI's if FAA concludes that entitlement funds will be available. 3. Financial Commitment, Including Project Timing The FAA will determine the airport sponsor's financial commitment in terms of the airport capital improvement plan and associated financial plan over the lesser of the life of the LOI of 5 years. The plan should include by FY a list of the projects to be implemented, both LOI and non-LOI; and, for each project, the total project cost with a cost breakdown by source of funds (AIP entitlement, AIP discretionary, passenger facility charges (PFC), sponsor, State, and other, including available cash reserve accounts). The amount of funds to be obtained through selling bonds should also be indicated along with the bond rating, if available, and status of issuance.
