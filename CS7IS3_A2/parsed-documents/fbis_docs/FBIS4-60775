In addition, the government set up the country's delegation for the April 30 Moscow summit and considered the amount for rent for the radar facility at Skrunda. The ministers decided that Russia should pay for Skrunda 130 million U.S. dollars per year but it could also remunerate the worth of the sum in natural gas, Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told reporters after the government session. Latvian officials are now negotiating the proposal with Russian counterparts in Moscow. In another action, the Cabinet decided to announce a competition for the dismantling of the new building of the Skrunda radar compound. For the purpose, foreign countries have already extended 3 million U.S. dollars. Birkavs prognosticated the interest in the dismantling would be large. The task, however, may pose technical problems because the building was constructed safe against nuclear attacks. The government also ruled to form a working part to create a repatriation fund for Russian war pensioners. Birkavs said that the U.S. Government allotted for the fund 2.5 million dollars in housing vouchers. Consequently, the officers won't be able to use the money for other purposes, Birkavs noted. Commenting on the agreement signature, Birkavs said Latvia would propose that it is signed by two representatives of each country. Birkavs described Russia's commitment to submit Latvia a list of military retirees as the principal achievement of the additional protocol.
