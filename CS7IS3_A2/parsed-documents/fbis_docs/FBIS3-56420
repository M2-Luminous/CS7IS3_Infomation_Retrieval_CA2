The Goals of the Prime Minister and Those of the President Diverge Again"] [Text] After Boris Yeltsin appointed Anatoliy Chubays deputy prime minister, bypassing a lengthy process of forming a government, the question of differences between the prime minister and the president has taken on a new intensity. Did the prime minister know about Anatoliy Chubays' appointment? If not, then the war of position inside the executive branch is becoming clearly threatening in nature: The president is betting everything, and this suggests that the old cabinet's volatile balance will remain in the new one. Apparently, soon we should expect Boris Fedorov's appointment. This, in turn, will mean the reemergence of characteristics of the old confrontation -- the Finance Ministry against the Central Bank and the government against the parliament ("Russia's Choice" will not be able to take the budget commission under control). The only thing one can state with assurance so far is that the prime minister's line toward forming a manageable and effective government will depend on his consultations with the president that are to follow Anatoliy Chubays' appointment and will be under way until Monday. The goals of the president and those of the prime minister have somewhat diverged. Chernomyrdin needs hard-working, not politicized, executives. Yeltsin, apparently, needs a steady reform course. Boris Fedorov's fate will be a decisive indicator at this stage.
