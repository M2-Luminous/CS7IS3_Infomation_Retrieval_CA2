Even now, in the early phases of the economic boom, great ecological dangers are looming on the horizon. An opportunity for the environmental technology industry: only ecologically sound businesses will save from China from an eco-disaster. China's economy is heading for record heights: it led the world last year with a growth rate of 13 percent. But the period of frantic economic growth is coming at the expense of the environment. In the report ``Environmental Strategy for Asia,'' the World Bank is now sounding the alarm. It emphasizes that in China the destruction of natural resources has already reached a level which endangers further economic development. China expert Vaclav Smil of the University of Manitoba in Canada also paints a dark picture: ``There is no doubt that in spite of advances in certain areas the condition of the environment in China will be more alarming in the year 2000 than it was in 1990.'' Chinese scientists are also aware of how serious the situation is. In the proposal of the environmental report for 1992 the director of the Chinese environmental agency NEPA (National Environmental Protection Agency), Qu Geping, lamented: ``Environmental protection in China cannot keep pace with the reshaping of our economy from a planned economy to a market economy.'' There it is considered a success if air and water pollution rise more slowly than economic growth. The emission of sulfur dioxide rose by ``only'' 3.9 percent to 16.85 million tons, dust yield rose by 7.9 percent to 14.14 million tons, and sewage increased by 9 percent to 36.65 billion cubic meters. Four-fifths of the air pollution is to be blamed on coal as an energy source: 1.1 billion tons are burned annually, accounting for 75 percent of Chinese energy use. Two-thirds of the coal used is burned in industry or for home heating without further treatment; flue gas treatment is virtually unknown. According to official reports the permissible average value of 300 micrograms of particles per cubic meter of air is being exceeded in 50 of 55 cities investigated. By comparison, in Germany the maximum average annual value is 150 micrograms per cubic meter. As a result of the economic boom, environmental stresses have also begun to have an effect at ground level. Since the legalization of private business thousands and thousands of small businesses have arisen in the villages, and while they work with high economic efficiency--at the moment they are producing 30 percent of the gross national product--because of their primitive technical equipment they emit waste gases and sewage unfiltered into the environment. Oskar Weggel of the Institute for Asian Studies in Hamburg gives a vivid description: ``Innumerable mini-factory chimneys pour coal dust into the atmosphere, and industrial sewage flows from a labyrinth of waste pipes into the country's streams and rivers.'' It is not that there are no laws in China against environmental pollution. Environmental protection is even anchored in the constitution. But officials on the provincial and district level have something else on their minds besides maintaining environmental standards. Last year the central government was forced to send teams of inspectors through the provinces to ``raise consciousness about obeying the law.'' A summary of the results of the investigation stated: ``Many local politicians are sacrificing the environment in order to make economic profits.'' But the wretched state of the environment should not be blamed solely on the rampant uncontrolled growth of the private sector; the inherited burdens of a planned economy have just as harmful an effect. According to a NEPA list, approximately 3,000 businesses, most of them still the property of the state, account for 60 percent of industrial environmental pollution. Many of these companies have been so mismanaged that there is no money available for environmental investment. The leading environmental problem in China is water pollution. It is true that initial progress was made in the treatment of industrial wastes in 1992; for instance, arsenic and cyanide contamination dropped by about 23 percent. But the treatment of communal sewage is in a very bad state; drains exist only in the large cities. Of the 13.3 billion cubic meters of sewage gathered there annually, only 10 percent is superficially cleaned. In Shanghai, a city of 13 million inhabitants, only 4 percent of about 2 billion cubic meters of sewage is cleaned; the rest goes into the Huangpu River untreated. Since the groundwater is also frequently contaminated in many places, often 50 million people have only polluted water to drink. ``Chinese water services are vitally endangered,'' is the evaluation of the authors of the report ``Environmental Protection in the People's Republic of China,'' which was recently presented at the first German-Chinese environmental symposium in Bergheim, near Cologne. For the report the Research Institutes for Water and Waste Management in Aachen and Erfstadt (FiW) and the Institute for Community Water Management of the RWTH in Aachen evaluated numerous Chinese sources. Water pollution is even slowing down further economic development, regionally speaking. Reiner Fonteyn, chief executive of the FiW, explains this point with an example from Shanxi province. There a coal factory cannot be expanded because the cooling water from the river is already too polluted. Economic pressure has now forced the construction of a purification plant for the city of Yangquan, which lies upstream. ``China has no other choice than to invest massively in environmental protection,'' according to Fonteyn, whose institute has now signed cooperative agreements with several Chinese research institutes about the planning of purification plants. In theory, this opens up absolutely unlimited sales possibilities for German manufacturers of ecotechnology. But access to the Chinese market is anything but easy. In North Rhine-Westphalia, companies from the ecotechnology sector--supported by the Land government--have formed the association ``Pro Asia e. V.'' to make entry into the market easier through exchange of information and experience. The region around the Rhine and the Ruhr is taking on the role of an outrider in German-Chinese cooperation: it supports partnerships with three Chinese provinces. As soon as February the governer of Sichuan province will visit, accompanies by economic experts, and in March a joint delegation from the environmental and economic ministries in Duesseldorf will travel to Jiangsu. But good relations do not necessarily turn into business deals. Financing is always a significant hurdle in project negotiations. The Japanese are emerging as powerful rivals, facilitating the financing of investments with favorable credit rates, according to Pro Asia's chairman, Dieter Wunderlich. Still, German industry is not pursuing a forlorn hope. According to statistics from the Federal Agency for Foreign Trade Information (BfAI) in Cologne, German export of ecotechnology to China has increased in the last few years and reached a value of DM392 million in 1992. Half of this amount consisted of high-tech products from the metrological, regulating and control technologies. By the year 2000 the Chinese government hopes to have invested a total of 200 billion yuan, approximately DM40 billion, in environmental protection. But in the opinion of experts that will only suffice to eliminate the worst damage. China's environmental crisis cannot be overcome by environmental repair alone. As early as 1989 the Institute for Ecological Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences issued this warning: it is not an increase in the gross national product but planning for the future that must be the highest political goal. So far this admonition has fallen on deaf ears: between 1989 and 1993 economic growth increased from 4 percent to 13 percent.
