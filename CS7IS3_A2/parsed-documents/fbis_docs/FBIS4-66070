The new foreign minister made his decisions shortly before leaving for the United States, but these are minor moves, at least for the time being, and they do not touch the fundamental structure of the Foreign Ministry. As cabinet chief, Martino has appointed Emanuele Scammacca, previously ambassador to the Holy See and then "exiled" to represent Italy in Belgium. His deputy will be Giancarlo Aragona, a security policy expert and in recent years diplomatic adviser to the Ministry of Defense. The appointments have given rise to a series of remarks in the corridors about the "Messina lobby" which has installed itself at the Foreign Ministry. The minister is from Messina, as is the secretary general, Ferdinando Salleo (also his cousin), and Aragona, and, according to malevolent tongues, Scammacca too. "But what do you mean?" a smiling diplomat intervenes, "Scammacca is from Catania and, as an ambassador's son, a citizen of the world." Another "heavy" appointment is in the Press Service, which has been entrusted to Maurizio Moreno, previously cabinet chief to Emilio Colombo and then coordinator of Somalia policy at the height of the crisis in Italy's intervention in this African country. Piero Francese, who was then in charge of the service, should become private secretary to the minister, a task which traditionally goes to an "outsider" to the ministry. Under Salleo's leadership, the recently renewed structure of the general directorates remains unchanged for the time being. Mouths closed, for the most part, including the large number of civil servants detached as diplomatic advisers to the various ministries. With the exception of Aragona's very delicate posting at Defense, the others ought to remain substantially unchanged. In particular there are no plans for changes in the office of diplomatic adviser to the prime minister's office, where Ambassador Sergio Vento remains for the moment, in the post to which he was called by Prime Minister Giuliano Amato and remained also under Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Only in the coming months, once the new ministers' teams have been put to the test, could we expect rotations. At that time, something could also change at the Foreign Ministry.
