Estonia at the latest round of talks for the first time formally accepted Russia's proposal to pull its troops from the country by Aug. 31, said the Estonian Ambassador to Russia, Juri Kahn. He said the only issue on which the parties had failed to reach a final agreement was that of paying compensation. The topic has to be settled at the level of heads of state. Russia has said it would agree to call a summit meeting of the two countries' leaders only after Estonia provides social welfare guarantees for the retired Russian military under the conditions set by Russia. Kahn quoted Russian officials as saying their side would not present a detailed timetable for the withdrawal of units from Estonia until the two countries have agreed on the issue of social welfare guarantees for the military who retired after Aug. 20, 1991. The ambassador said this latest stance was causing bewilderment to Estonia, as the countries earlier had agreed to solve any problems one at a time without linking them to one another. Kahn dismissed Russia's allegations of Estonia's unwillingness to resolve the border issue as groundless. "Russia's wish to establish the border along the line where its border guards now stand is unacceptable for Estonia," he said. He added that Estonia on many occasions had sought taking international law as basis for discussion of the border issue. The next round of Estonian-Russian talks is to be held at the beginning of March. It is possible that Estonian Foreign Minister Juri Luik will meet Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitali Churkin in the meantime, Kahn added.
