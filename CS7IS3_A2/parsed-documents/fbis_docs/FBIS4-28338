China, which holds the key to economic sanctions, is still taking a position against economic sanctions while distancing itself from those nations. How will the economic sanctions be dealt with in the future? Will the economic sanctions be effective without China participating in them? As is seen in the DPRK's past diplomacy, North Korea has frequently changed its stand, and the possibility still remains that North Korea will seek compromise through dialogue. If the United Nations is to impose economic sanctions on North Korea or a group of nations is to impose them, they will adopt the method in which economic sanctions were imposed on South Africa and Iraq. The economic sanctions are primarily aimed at halting the flow of "money," "goods," and "personnel." Measures considered to be effective as part of economic sanctions are a trade embargo, a ban on capital transactions, a freeze on assets and means of payment, and the halt of remittances to the DPRK by ethnic Koreans residing in Japan. North Korea's trade with China, Russia, and Japan accounts for more than 60 percent of its total trade. The DPRK's imports from the three nations account for 73 percent of its total imports. North Korea has increased its dependence on China for its imports of energy resources such as oil and coke since the Soviet Union disintegrated. The DPRK's imports of energy resources from China make up 80 percent to 90 percent of its total imports. In particular, North Korea imported 1.006 million tons of oil from China in 1992. The DPRK, which is a state of economic devastation, is suffering from a sharp fall in its food self-sufficiency rate. North Korea has boosted grain imports from China since 1991, and its grain imports from China account for nearly 80 percent of its total grain imports. North Korea imported 650,000 tons of grain from China in 1992. If China abstains from voting or exercises its right to veto the economic sanctions at the UN Security Council, the effectiveness of the economic sanctions is expected to be very low. There is also a question of how to block the flow of goods into North Korea through third nations. While the United States is continuing its efforts to garner international support for the economic sanctions, China is still taking a position against economic sanctions being imposed on the DPRK. Commenting on China's recent moves, a diplomatic source said, "It is highly possible that China will seek to maintain the status quo and refuse to join other nations in imposing economic sanctions." In explaining the reasons for China taking such a stand, the same diplomatic source said: 1) If economic sanctions cause the Kim Il- song regime to collapse, China would be flooded with a huge number of Korean refugees; 2) If the DPRK is absorbed by South Korea, the United States would then extend its influence to the Yalu River (the Chinese-North Korean border), and it is conceivable that a unified Korea will inherit North Korea's nuclear development program; and 3) The DPRK's development of nuclear weapons would not only pose a threat to China but would also give Japan an excuse to arm itself with nuclear weapons [point 3 as published]. In order to avoid facing this situation, China has no choice but to take a stand against the economic sanctions that could pave the way for North Korea's collapse. China's calculation is that if it joins other nations in imposing economic sanctions, this would harm its economy. Will the economic sanctions be ineffective if China does not join other nations in imposing them? Mr. Masaki Yabuuchi, a member of the China and North Asia task force in the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO), has said otherwise: "Even if China does not join other nations in imposing economic sanctions on the DPRK, the sanctions will gradually have an effect. If Western nations such as Japan, Germany, and Australia stop their exports of machine tools, transportation equipment, and other products to North Korea, the export embargo will force the DPRK to halt its construction projects and will make that country unable to retain its production capabilities in the long run, even though these sanctions will not generate immediate effects, as would oil sanctions. The economic sanctions will slowly affect North Korea economically."
