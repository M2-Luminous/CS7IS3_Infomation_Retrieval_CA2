FBIS4-52189 "dreas089_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-089 Daily Report 9 May 1994 North Korea Crimes Committed by Defector to South Noted Crimes Committed by Defector to South Noted SK0905112294 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1047 GMT 9 May 94 SK0905112294 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The subsidized propaganda machines in Seoul are getting over-heated these days in the anti-DPRK smear campaign through Yo Man-chol, 48, who fled to South Korea recently. No one would lend an ear to the ugly torrent of trash rolling off the tongue of insane Yo, a human dirt. But we cannot say a few words about it, because his words are so disgusting and the South Korean puppets are doing such nasty things by manipulating him. Yo Man-chol is a habitual criminal who committed acts never to be condoned under the political system of the North where a beautiful and sound life has become a social trait, all people helping each other and leading each other along. While serving as a truck driver at the material supply center in Hamhung, he stole goods of the state worth more than 100,000 won. When he was carrying materials for daily necessities by truck from Pyongyang to Hamhung in December last year, he misappropriated goods worth 30,000 won or more. This theft committed by him was disclosed in the course of an overall survey of the warehousing and delivery of materials and equipment at the material supply centre, and he had to face justice. Yo felt uneasiness and fear and this was one of the motives of his defection to South Korea. A criminal leaves a string of bad names behind him. "A mad man," "a gangster," "a drunkard" and "a sex maniac" are the words characterising the human derelict. One time he was a driver at the Hoesang District security station in Hamhung. In those days he stayed away from work quite often under the pretext of illness, and loafed about and had a fight with his colleagues frequently. In May 1983, while driving his truck, dead drunk, he hit a bus stop, inflicting heavy wounds on a number of people standing there. Still more grave is that he styled himself an officer of the traffic safety section of the district security station, going in false security officer's uniform. In July 1986, disguised as a senior captain of the public security station, he stopped many trucks on a night street for no reason and, like a robber he is, forced the drivers to do something to line his pocket. For these crimes he was disciplined and ousted from the post of the truck driver of the district security station. The fatal evil practice of Yo Man-chol is sex mania which would make even a brute blush for shame. Not only once he got it in the neck while attempting to rape married women. One night in February 1987, in nothing but pajamas, he broke into the house of a single woman in his neighbourhood unit and attempted to rape her, only to be trounced by the neighbours who came rushing at the scream of the woman. His beastliness as a sex maniac reached the climax when he attempted to rape his eldest daughter Yo Kum-chu, 20, a district kindergaderner. One day in March 1992, when his wife, Yi Ok-kum, 45, who was a photographer at the Hoesang District light labor shop, Hamhung, was gone to her parental home in Kapsan, Yanggang Province, he drank like a fish at home and threw himself upon his daughter Kum-chu who was 18 years old at that time. When she resisted, he hit her on the head with a spanner, injuring her. When his eldest son Yo Kum-yong, who awoke, tried to stop him, he beat him on the head, leaving him in a critical condition. His attempt to rape even his daughter under age, an act beyond human imagination, is enough to show what a despicable dirt Yo Man- chol is. All this glaringly proves that Yo Man-chol is a criminal, a mentally deranged person and a human dross who do every evil without the elementary morality, conscience and ethic as a human being. It is only too natural that such human derelict became a target of the accusing fingers of people. He became an object of guard not only among the neighbours but also among the Hamhung population who did not want him to live among them. He was compelled to move to Yanggang Province where his wife's parental home was. But, there also, he was rejected by people as a human rubbish. Yo's mental agony grew with the passage of time. To cap it all, his misappropriation of a huge amount of property of the state was brought to light, leaving him no room to remain under socialism of our style centered on the popular masses. What he chose, driven to the bay, was to flee to South Korea. A deer lives among deers and a dog among dogs. It is only too clear that the asylum for Yo Man-chol whose career is stained with indelible crimes and depravity, was the den of the South Korean puppet clique, the habitat of offscourings which invites and "welcomes" any human derelict, if it is for the anti-DPRK political smear campaign. Still more ridiculous is the mean act of the South Korean puppet clique in using Yo, who can hardly rank among human-beings, as a propaganda tool for their sinister political purpose. The foolish attempt of the Kim Yong-sam clique to impair the image of our socialist system centered on the popular masses, under which the people of the whole country form a big harmonious family, by using such immoral human dirt, brings into the open the moral inferiority of the puppets. Not much penetration is needed to see that the anti-DPRK smear campaign of the puppets through Yo Man-chol is underlain by the foolish and sinister intention to evade the crisis of destruction by lulling the anti-kim Yong-sam sentiments daily mounting among the South Korean people. But this will lead them nowhere. The barking of dogs cannot move a big mountain and the outcries of human rubbish will only sound like a lamentation over the "civilian regime" of Kim Yong-sam on the threshold of death.
