FBIS4-28687 "dreas113_c_94017" FBIS-EAS-94-113 Daily Report 12 Jun 1994 North Korea Arrest of Hanchongnyon Leaders in ROK Criticized Arrest of Hanchongnyon Leaders in ROK Criticized SK1206090094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0835 GMT 12 Jun 94 SK1206090094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Repressive Offensive Against Anti-war Forces" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam fascist clique recently issued an order to the puppet police throughout South Korea to hurriedly arrest some 90 leading members of the South Korean Federation of General Student Councils (Hanchongnyon) including its chairman, alleging that "the disposition of Hanchongnyon benefiting the enemy was made clear." In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this reckless repressive row kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group is a premeditated fascist offensive to suppress and stifle Hanchongnyon, the vanguard of the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle for independence, democracy and reunification, and students. The news analyst says: The repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon was launched at a time when the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique was driving the situation to the worst phase, letting loose such bellicose utterances as "tough counteraction," "retaliatory punishment" and "sanctions" under the pretext of our "nuclear issue." The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now serving the imperialists as a "shockbrigade" in their moves to take "sanctions" against us over the "nuclear suspicion." They are also getting overheated in arms buildup and nuclear war exercises in a bid to fulfil "the new operation plan 5027" they worked out with outside forces to invade the North. The reality shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is going to make a military adventure against us in league with its master, the United States. The South Korean puppets intend to suppress the pro- reunification, patriotic and democratic forces of South Korea including Hanchongnyon that they consider to be an obstacle to their criminal moves, thus stamping out the anti-U.S., anti-war, anti- nuke, anti-"government" forces at a stroke in South Korea. The Kim Yong-sam group must be mindful that the further it is hell bent on the suppression of the people and war provocation moves, the earlier the day of its disgraceful destruction will come.
