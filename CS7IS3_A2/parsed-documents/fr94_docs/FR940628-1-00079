FR940628-1-00079 FR940628-1-00014 The reduction in rollover harm for each type/size category is a summary of the reductions in injuries and fatalities for each example vehicle within the category if the tilt table angle for the category were increased a specified level. The reduction in harm associated with each affected vehicle is assumed to be proportional to its projected reduction in rollover risk. A minimum tilt table angle standard of 42.8 degrees, an increase of one increment explained above, would be expected to reduce serious rollover injuries by 13 and rollover fatalities by 8. A minimum tilt table angle standard of 46.4 degrees, the highest measurement in the range studied, would be expected to reduce serious rollover injuries by 233 and rollover fatalities by 121, if rollover avoidance were viewed as crash avoidance. A parallel exercise was done using the rollover risk predicted using critical sliding velocity as the stability metric in the logistic regression model. 3. Injury/Fatality Rate Reduction Because the agency assumed that a single vehicle accident would still occur even though a rollover was prevented, it reduced these estimates of benefits based on a comparison of the relative harm of single vehicle accidents with rollover to that of similar accidents without rollover. The comparison indicated that the overall fatality rate for single vehicle rollover accidents was 2.07 times the fatality rate for single vehicle accidents without rollover. When only accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40&hyph;50 mph are considered, the rollover accidents are 2.3 times as likely to result in fatality. When accidents on 55&hyph;65 mph roads are considered, the fatality rate of rollover accidents is 1.6 times that for other accidents. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention is equivalent to about a 50 percent reduction in fatalities for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be prevented. Likewise, the injury data indicate an overall relative rate of serious injuries (AIS 3+) 1.36 times greater for single vehicle accidents with rollover than without rollover. The ratio of AIS 3+ injuries in non-rollover to AIS 3+ injuries in rollovers was 1.38 for accidents occurring on roads with speed limits of 40&hyph;50 mph and 1.47 for accidents occurring on 55&hyph;65 mph roads. These statistics suggest that rollover prevention is roughly equivalent to a 25 percent reduction in serious injuries for the number of accidents in which rollovers would be prevented. Viewing rollover prevention as roughly a 50 percent mitigation of fatalities and a 25 percent mitigation of serious injuries leads to an estimate of net benefits resulting from the reduction in harm from rollover accidents. Net reductions of 3 to 61 serious injuries and 4 to 63 fatalities would be expected for a minimum tilt table angle standard in the range of 42.8 to 46.4 degrees. Net reductions of 3 to 68 serious injuries and 2 to 68 fatalities would be expected for a minimum critical sliding velocity standard in the range studied, i.e., 14.68 to 16.73 kph. Minimum rollover stability requirements at the levels examined would have minimal impact on the annual single vehicle accident rollover fatality toll, because the vehicles affected would be less than 20 percent of the total light duty vehicle fleet and the vehicles' stability would only be improved by a marginal amount. The great majority of rollover fatalities would be unaffected by a minimum stability standard set at any of these levels, because they occur in cars, which greatly outnumber light trucks in use, and which, with few exceptions, have significantly higher rollover stability than sport utility vehicles, pickup trucks, and vans. B. Estimate of the Costs of a Standard As explained above, the agency's analyses predicted a saving of 63 lives for a minimum tilt table angle of 46.4 degrees. This level would necessitate the modification of an estimated 87 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles and virtually all present standard vans. A minimum tilt table angle of 45 degrees, which is higher than the tilt table angle of 69 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, could save 23 lives. Similarly, a minimum critical sliding velocity standard of 16.73 kph would affect 89 percent of present compact sport utility vehicles, 38 percent of standard sport utility vehicles, and 38 percent of compact pickups, while saving 68 lives. A critical sliding velocity minimum standard of 15.91 kph would affect 71 percent of compact sport utility vehicles and 31 percent of compact pickups, while saving 34 lives. Unfortunately, inexpensive vehicle changes, such as offset wheels or modified tire and rim width combinations, cannot be counted on to improve stability without producing handling or steering problems. An increase in track width, derived from frame or suspension alterations, or a decrease in center of gravity height are the only methods of improving stability without potential safety liabilities. Such changes would require large initial costs related to the design and development of major vehicle components, if not the entire vehicle. These costs do not take into account the cost of the tests necessary to determine the tilt table angle or critical sliding velocity. Because these costs will also be associated with the proposed consumer information regulation, the testing costs are discussed later in this notice.
