This step comes in the absence of the Arab League and in the shadow of the mutual aversions the Middle East is witnessing at more than one level. Maybe the most important point in the statement -- apart from the support it provides for President Hafiz al-Asad a few days before the awaited meeting between him and President Clinton -- is that it avoids thorny issues which can be discussed at a later stage, like the Arab boycott of Israel. In this connection it seems striking that the eight states sought to come out with a position that is far removed from rhetorical oneupmanship and as close as possible to realism. In return for the statement's support for Syria, Damascus had to continue its "neutral" position on the Gaza-Jericho First agreement. Although describing the agreement as "a first step which should be complemented by steps on the other tracks" is a statement which needs to be explained and could have more than one meaning, Syria's agreement to it again means that a minimum of understanding has been reached between it and Egypt, which is sparing no efforts to make the Palestinian-Israeli agreement a success. It is clear that Syria was the first beneficiary of the meetings of the foreign ministers of the eight states in Damascus. What seems to be useful in this connection is that the statement issued by the eight ministers, which supports the United Arab Emirates' position toward Iran in their dispute over the three islands [Tunb al-Kubra, Tunb al-Sughra, and Abu Musa], has shown that the Damascus Declaration has not died and that what has actually died is a certain understanding of the declaration -- the understanding whereby it is made to shoulder more than it can bear. Once the signatories are convinced of this, it will be easy to hold meetings, adopt positions, and seek an understanding on the broad outlines of Arab policies. The statement can in itself represent a serious attempt to determine what can and what cannot be done. With the passage of time it has become clear that words have become meaningful even in the Arab world. And that it is no longer acceptable to talk about the region in the manner that existed in the past. And that every single word means something now, especially when it comes to Gulf security and the role of every party in safeguarding it. This is because all the developments that have taken place since the second Gulf war, which was the result of the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, fall within one framework, namely redefining the roles in the region, taking into account the role played by the international coalition in defeating Iraq, in addition to the role of the states surrounding Iraq and the Arab world. If this process of redefining the roles had not taken place, the Madrid conference would not have been convened or led to what it has led to.
