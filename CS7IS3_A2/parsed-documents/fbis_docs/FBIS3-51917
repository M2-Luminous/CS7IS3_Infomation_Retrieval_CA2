Rodriguez said if he finds any military officer or influential person involved in the illegal trade he will arrest him or resign from his post. "We have a limited amount of money available, while drug traffickers have large amounts. For this reason we have infinitely less resources than those available to traffickers. It is very difficult to be even in this respect," Rodriguez said. Gen. Rodriguez was appointed to the post in a surprise move. His name was not mentioned as a candidate for the post and his designation was therefore a surprise. Gen. Rodriguez told us that he was first in his class at the Military School promotion of 1955. He then entered the Military College. He went to Panama where he took infantry training courses at an U.S. instruction center. He then travelled to the United States to take general staff training courses. He retired in December 1992 when he was 3d Corps general staff chief. He confirmed that he worked for the candidacy of the present head of state in the Colorado Party primaries and the presidential race. As an example of the need to have the means to fight drug trafficking, Rodriguez said: "If I am the cook and someone wants to eat a steak, I have to get meat. If that person wants a steak and I only have rice and noodles, he will not get a steak from me." What Rodriguez means is that in his short time as Senad secretary he was able to see the need for improvements knowing that the resources are limited. He talked about the lack of radar and interceptor planes to fight trafficking by air in the Chaco. He indicated that trafficking by land in the Chaco is controlled by the military units in that zone, but even so more personnel are required. Asked about the possibility that a high-ranking military man or an influential individual in the government try to get his complicity, Gen. Rodriguez said he will have two options. First, resort to the president to implement sanctions, and second resign. "I am the boss" said Rodriguez, who pointed out that he will not allow another individual to run the institution at his will. He reiterated the support he received from the president. Previous Senad administrators said they were seriously investigating money laundering in our country. Rodriguez said the work started by the previous team continues. He was not able, however, to give details of the investigation because he did not have the information. He emphasized that for the time being he will not replace the men working with him. He indicated there may be changes in the future. Regarding drug addiction in our country, Rodriguez said this problem is not yet that serious but it could get worse if corrective measures are not taken on time.
