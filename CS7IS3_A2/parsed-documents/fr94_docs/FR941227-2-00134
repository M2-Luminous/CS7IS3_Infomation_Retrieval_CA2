FR941227-2-00134 FR941227-2-00087 VI. Conclusion The Commission believes that the NYSE's, Amex's, and NASD's proposals to adopt the Policy as set forth above is an important step toward increasing shareholder protection, thereby enhancing investor confidence in the U.S. securities markets. The Commission continues to encourage the adoption of such standards by the remaining SROs, and remains confident that such a voting rights listing standard is a beneficial step toward strengthing the U.S. securities markets. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with Sections 6(b)(8) and 15A(b)(9) 40 of the Act, which provide that an SRO's rules must not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Commission recognizes that, under the Policy, issuers with capital structures that do not conform to the requirements of the Policy will not be permitted to list or include their securities on three major U.S. markets. Nevertheless, the Commission is persuaded by the SROs' stated objectives_to enhance investor protections 41 ; and to provide investors with the protections the Policy affords and the benefit of knowing that issuers cannot avoid the effects of a market's voting rights policy by seeking an interpretation in another market 42 _that the Policy and procedures for interpretations under the Policy do not place an undue burden on competition and that any burden on competition that may result from the Policy is appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. 40 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(8) and 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3(b)(9) (1993). 41 See File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;45 at 15. 42 See File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;20 at 4, and File No. SR&hyph;AMEX&hyph;94&hyph;29 at 10. Similarly, as discussed in this order, the Commission believes the proposed rule changes do not violate Sections 6(b)(5) and 15A(b)(6) of the Act, 43 which provide, among other things, that the rules of an SRO may not be designed to permit unfair discrimination between issuers, among others. 43 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(5) and 15 U.S.C. 78 o &hyph;3(b)(6) (1988). For the reasons stated above, as well as the analysis contained in this order, the Commission believes that the protections afforded shareholders by the adoption of SRO proposals that will prohibit certain disparate voting rights plans that disenfranchise existing shareholders is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder pertaining to a national securities association and to national securities exchanges. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 44 that the proposed rule changes (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;20, SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;29, and SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;95) are approved. 44 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1993).
