China had abolished import licenses and quotas for 283 kinds of goods from January 1, 1994. The announcement was made by Long Yongtu, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, here this afternoon. The move taken by the Chinese Government this time is designed to bring its import system closer to requirements of international practice and to set up a new import system with tariffs as its major means of regulation, Long said. This marks an important part of China's efforts not only in reforming its import management system, but also in pushing forward the process of restoring its contracting status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the assistant minister told XINHUA. Long made the remarks on the eve of his trip to Europe and the United States. He will head a delegation to Brussels and Washington on Friday [27 May] to discuss China's re-entry into GATT with the European Union (EU) and the United States. The discussion with the EU is scheduled for May 30 and 31 in Brussels and the negotiations with the U.S. will run from June 3 to June 8 in Washington. The 195 kinds of imported goods from which licenses and quotas have been lifted this time cover 30 kinds of imports to be free of controls by the end of this year and 120 by the end of next year, as planned in the Sino-U.S. Memorandum of Understanding on Market Access. China's stepped-up implementation of its promise in the agreement demonstrates China's sincerity and capability, Long said. On the upcoming talks with the EU and the U.S., Long said the talks will be very substantial since a protocol package will be discussed during the period. China has prepared itself in an earnest way for the discussions and will present a large number of documents on China's foreign trade regime, he said. The assistant minister said the discussions, on a basis of full transparency, will focus on tariffs, tariff exemptions, foreign trading rights and other issues related to China's foreign trade system.
