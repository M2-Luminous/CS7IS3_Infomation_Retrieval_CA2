We are building a democratic state which, however, takes into account specific national features, he said. The main task of the country's leadership, he said, is formulated in the slogan "A Decade of Stability," which began in 1992. Niyazov said that the economic reforms carried out in Turkmenistan, do not infringe upon the interests of the majority of the population--the country's citizens use free running water, gas, electric energy. In addition, each citizen of the country has the right for 146 kilos of free flour a year. The president assured journalists that Turkmenistan enjoys freedom of speech and human rights are observed. However, he said, this should not run counter to the moral norms of the nation and centuries-old traditions. Niyazov voiced complaints to some news media in Russia, for example, to television, where on show is mainly pornography and sex. Answering the question of what he thinks about worshipping of his personality in Turkmenistan, he said that in the country there is no such notion as personality cult. I do not consider myself a special person. I am a human being like all others. Niyazov claims that since 1985 when he came to power, there was not a single case of prosecuting dissidents. We have no political prisoners, he said. He said that the country needs a leader who, together will like minded people, may take up courage to solve historic tasks. We are going through a very difficult period in our history, said Niyazov. He admitted that he was not satisfied with the admiring attitude to his personality. He said that he asked parliament not to celebrate his birthday for the period of his presidency at least. Honestly, this is a burden for me. I believe we shall come to think about this again. Nevertheless, if there is no imposition, I do not see reasons for a ban for such treatment to the state leader, said Niyazov. According to the Turkmen leader, he is tolerant to criticism if it refers to his activities. I do not like biassed personal criticism, said the president.
