An increasing number of European and Asian leaders have begun to wonder. While they put the question more politely, they are genuinely worried by the vacillation of U.S. foreign policy, which too often seems to boil down to what one of them terms an "export of national policy." This lack of a coherent foreign policy, which brings to mind certain aspects of Jimmy Carter's presidency, is even worse in a world which has lost its bearing following the collapse of the Communist bloc: It encourages today's international adventurers and will lead to more disorder throughout the world. The list of presidential fumbles is a long one; on some days, the President reportedly spends no more than half an hour on world affairs, while he has increased tenfold White House spending on opinion polls. First on the list is the Somalia debacle, where the U.S. contingent was literally ousted by the fighters of one lone warlord, General Aideed, pronounced public enemy number one by the United Nations. U.S. public opinion demanded and obtained total withdrawal; the last GI has now left the former Italian colony. Rwanda's murderous presidential guard, if not encouraged by this inglorious retreat, can nevertheless keep slaughtering cheerily, as the U.S. Administration announced on Sunday [1 May] that any U.S. intervention was out of the question, even as part of a UN operation. This overt refusal to even consider sending ground soldiers has already wreaked havoc in Bosnia, where the Serbs have known for a long time that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] troops will always be in insufficient numbers to be efficient. There too, President Clinton's main concern is to follow as closely as possible the whim of opinion polls: Yes to air strikes around Sarajevo last January and around Gorazde in April, but no engagement on the ground whatsoever, even though the Pentagon's best experts have repeatedly stated that air strikes would not do much to damage Serb forces. Indeed, this became all the more clear during the first days of the offensive against Gorazde, when Serb troops felt free to keep advancing. This episode proved particularly costly, not only for the Muslim population, but also for the credibility of NATO, whose main pillar is the United States and which candidate Clinton pledged to strengthen. All this does not keep the White House, which is incapable of choosing between negotiation and its refusal to commit itself on the ground, from advocating the end of the embargo on arms delivery to the Muslims one day, and a gradual lifting of sanctions against Serbia the next. Such an inability to devise a clearcut policy has been evident not only to Belgrade or Pale. Haiti's military rulers swiftly understood how they could take advantage of America's vacillation in Somalia. As a result, they refused any arrangement with President Aristide, whom they ousted in 1991. Vivid in everyone's memory is the sight of that U.S. ship driven back by a handful of tontons macoutes. But do people remember candidate Clinton condemning President Bush for his refusal to take in Haitian "boat people?" The U.S. President is currently pursuing the exact same policy. True, he has now pledged to alter it slightly, because of some polls showing that black Americans are increasingly incensed by it, and Bill Clinton needs their votes if he is to be reelected in 1996. One can be assured that Saddam Hussayn, who is still in power after his defeat in the Gulf war because the Americans do not want Iraq to fall apart, has been looking with interest at Washington's bogus determination, after exploiting for all it was worth the downing of the two American helicopters by U.S. fighters within Kurdistan airspace. The same may be said of Kim Il-song, North Korea's old tyrant, who has been ignoring injunctions from the United States and the inspectors of the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency and still keeps the lid on his atomic military programs. Meanwhile, China will not help as long as America has not renewed its most-favored nation status, so sure it is of President Clinton's bottomless capacity for doing nothing.
