Yesterday, the 3-80 Northern Front [FN-3-80], headed by Jose Angel Talavera better known as El Chacal, decided to stop surrendering its weapons. El Chacal's decision was his response to the government minister's announcement that the government has limitations to granting the economic benefits the rebel leader is demanding. El Chacal is asking for 3 manzanas of land for each man who surrenders his weapons. The government, however, is offering a small piece of land where a house can be built. At present, El Chacal's forces consist of 250 men who have weapons ranging from AK rifles to surface-to-air missiles. Following the announcement on the suspension of the disbandment of El Chacal's forces, the government began a series of actions to maintain talks with the FN-3-80.
