This is how Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs A. Zlenko described the present situation in the region of the Bosnian conflict after a visit to the Ukrainian battalion within the UN peacekeeping forces in Sarajevo. Our state must decide what else it may do to help heal this bleeding wound in Europe. UN representatives have repeatedly commended Ukraine's contribution to the peacekeeping process. The fact that the UN Security Council turned to our state with a request to add another 800 personnel to the battalion is proof of the prestige gained by the Ukrainian servicemen. At the same time, despite the considerable contingent of soldiers, Kiev does not have observers there. The number of officers is also small. This restricts any more extensive participation of Ukrainian representatives in untying the Balkan knot. The military contingent's main tasks in the region of conflict amount to accompanying humanitarian aid convoys to the civilian population, repairing electricity and water-supply networks, and holding, on special orders, operations to disarm the warring sides and demilitarizing the areas. During a meeting with Zlenko, commander of the joint troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina M. Rose praised the activities of the Ukrainian servicemen. (Incidentally, in view of the severe shortage of food in the city, our soldiers share their food rations with Sarajevo children, and the battalion has even adopted several orphan children.) During the talks in Sarajevo, the head of the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry stressed that a mutually acceptable variant for resolving problems in the region is only possible if all the possibilities and interests of the sides are taken into account. As well as Sarajevo, Zlenko also visited Croatia and Slovenia. For a number of reasons, the visit there had been delayed for a long time. That is why members of the Ukrainian delegation tried somehow to stress their interest in the development of relations with Zagreb and Ljubljana and held extensive consultations to find realistic ways to intensify ties with those countries, particularly in the economic sphere. A legal foundation was also laid in Zagreb for expanding contacts: Agreements on cooperation between the foreign ministries of the two countries and on consular ties were signed. A document on cooperation between the foreign ministries was also signed in the Slovenian capital. At the summing-up news conference in Zagreb, Croatian Foreign Minister M. Granic stated that a bilateral trade agreement, which will definitely be signed during his visit to Kiev, will promote economic ties. In his opinion, political relations between Ukraine and Croatia are much better developed than economic ties. It is, however, clear that every country must now pay much attention to its own domestic problems. An agreement on friendship and cooperation, which has been prepared, will be yet another step toward broad cooperation between Kiev and Zagreb. In Granic's opinion, Ukraine might have a positive influence on resolving the Balkan crisis and, in this context, on the position of the Serbs. He pointed out that the declaration on the settlement of the relations between Croats and Serbs is the first step toward normalization, but that this process depends on Serbia. The main problem is the restoration of normal life in reintegrated territories. Zlenko, in turn, stated that, on many issues, the positions of Ukraine and Croatia are very close or fully coincide. The Croatian position became clearer after the negotiations in Zagreb. Observers reacted with surprise to Kiev's activity in the Balkan region, but they pointed out that its rapprochement with Zagreb and Ljubljana is understandable: There is a common desire to cooperate, and they are all, while respecting the aspirations of others, pursuing their own interests. Therefore, Ukraine will certainly respond positively to the Croatian side's request to help in settling the Balkan crisis and in normalizing relations between the Croats and the Serbs, but it will not diverge from its principles of balanced deportment. In its contacts with Slovenia, Kiev should have long passed from words to specific deeds, since that country presents a great interest for us, first and foremost, in the economic sphere. Ljubljana is also striving to establish close cooperation with Kiev. In particular, at the proposal of Slovenian Minister of Foreign Affairs L. Peterle, entrepreneurs from the two countries will hold a business conference in Ljubljana. In addition to that, Ukraine hopes that its Balkan partners with help in putting into effect its plans for joining the Central European Initiative. However, Kiev, while trying hard to stress its desire to intensify relations with Croatia and Slovenia, is unable to open its embassies in those states. Perhaps, because of this situation, the relations between our countries have been deadlocked. I would like to hope that the earthquake that rocked Zagreb during the first day of Zlenko's official visit will shake off the dust from these relations.
