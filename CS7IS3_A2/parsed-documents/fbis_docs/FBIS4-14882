After the ceremony of signing these documents, Viktor Chernomyrdin told journalists that during the talks "we were very much interested in the reforms which are being conducted in the Czech Republic, their mechanism and results. We are also following a path of reform, and I think there are many things we in Russia can adopt from the Czech experience". The Russian prime-minister said economic relations between the two countries are now taking shape on a new, market basis and stressed that it is necessary to build up trade and economic ties. Chernomyrdin expressed satisfaction with the talks and said that the two delegations also considered the rescheduling of the Russian debt to the Czech Republic, which Russia has "inherited" from the former USSR. "We identified the mechanism of debt repayment and instructed experts to prepare the required document for signing before May 30," Chernomyrdin said. Vaclav Klaus said he was pleased with his talks with the Russian prime-minister and particularly stressed the solution to the problem of the Russian indebtedness. He said the new document, which the two countries are planning to sign soon, will contain a specific time-table of the debt repayment. Klaus said that Chernomyrdin and himself also discussed Czech investments in the Russian economy.
