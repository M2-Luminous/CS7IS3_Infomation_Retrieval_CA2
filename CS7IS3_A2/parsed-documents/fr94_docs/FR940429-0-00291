FR940429-0-00291 FR940429-0-00016 Discussion: The regulations are designed to cover all cases, including those in which the information may not be present in the borrower's loan file, and it may be necessary in some cases, for the borrower to provide this documentation. For example, the lender's information may be incomplete or destroyed due to fire, flood, theft, etc. However, in other cases where the lender already possesses this information in the borrower's loan file, the Secretary agrees that the borrower should not be required to provide the same documentation. Change: Section 682.402(c)(1) has been revised to specify that the borrower's requirement to provide such documentation only applies if the lender does not already possess it. Section 682.402(d)(1)(i) 10. Comment: Some commenters were confused by references to ``the loan'' and thought that a borrower with multiple loans would not be completely covered under the closed school loan discharge provisions. Discussion: In general, regulatory language is more precise if it is based on the singular form of a noun. In the case of a closed school loan discharge, this permits each loan to be evaluated individually, and not be dependent on factors associated only with other loans. If the borrower qualifies for a discharge of more than one loan, then each loan will be discharged. Change: None. 11. Comment: Some commenters believed that a borrower should be eligible for a closed school loan discharge for the portion of a Federal Consolidation Loan that repaid a loan that would have otherwise been discharged under the closed school provisions. Discussion: The Secretary agrees with the commenters. The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to ``*␣*␣*␣discharge the borrower's liability on the loan␣*␣*␣*'' if the student could not complete the program in which the student was enrolled because of the school's closure. Because section 437(c) provides for discharge of loans because of events that occur before the borrower enters repayment, the borrower's liability on the loan is the amount outstanding at that time, before the borrower enters repayment. If the borrower repays some or all of that amount, the discharge would be ineffective unless it includes relief from that liability through reimbursement for the amounts paid on the loan, and those amounts include amounts borrowed through a Consolidation Loan. The Secretary believes that the borrower's Consolidation Loan should be credited for the amount of the closed school loan discharge that would have been applicable to the borrower's loan before it was consolidated. Change: The final regulations have been revised accordingly. 12. Comment: Some commenters believed that the 90-day period prior to a school's closing during which a student who withdrew would be eligible for a loan discharge is too short for many students who attended correspondence schools. The commenters noted that such students frequently are considered ``withdrawn'' as of the date of the last lesson submitted by the student if the student did not submit the next scheduled lesson in accordance with the schedule of lessons established under §682.602. However, the school may not have been considered to have officially closed until more than 90 days have elapsed from the date the student would be considered to have withdrawn under §682.605(b)(3). The commenters observed that in many cases, it was the school that withdrew from the student by its failure to grade lessons or provide subsequent lessons, or to otherwise communicate with a student who attempted to learn if the school was still operating. The commenters believed that correspondence students, unlike other students who attended a school at a school's actual location, are not in a position to see an obvious deterioration in the school's ability to provide education to students. Discussion: The Secretary believes that the 90-day period generally is sufficient for all categories of students. The Secretary notes that correspondence students may actually be in a better position than other students to realize that a school's ability to provide training and services is deteriorating. The absence of communication from a correspondence school to a student is an unmistakable sign that the school is not fulfilling its part of the enrollment agreement with the student. Other types of schools may be able to effectively camouflage their deteriorating capabilities and prevent students from seeing the true state of the school's fiscal and administrative situation, but a correspondence school student cannot be so easily deceived. The lack of communication from a school is a clear fact that speaks for itself. However, the Secretary agrees with the commenters that in some unique circumstances an extension of the 90-day period may be appropriate. Change: The final regulations have been revised to include a provision for the Secretary to extend the 90-day period if he believes an extension is appropriate in a particular case. Section 682.402(d)(1)(ii)(A) 13. Comment: Some commenters noted that schools that close will frequently phase-out their operations by sequentially eliminating individual programs even though the school remains open. The commenters believed that by linking a borrower's eligibility for a loan discharge to the date that the school ceased to provide educational instruction in all programs, the regulations would penalize a borrower who withdrew from school because of a terminated or deteriorated program earlier than 90 days before the school officially closed. Discussion: The Secretary has been given authority pursuant to section 437(c)(1) of the HEA to discharge the borrower's liability on the loan if the student could not complete the program ``*␣*␣*␣due to the closure of the institution.*␣*␣*'' The Secretary has no authority to discharge the borrower's loan obligation if the student's program was terminated but the school did not close. Change: None. 14. Comment: Some commenters did not understand the reference to ``the designated agency in the state in which the school is located.'' The commenters asked if the agency making the determination that a school had closed would be the guaranty agency, the state school licensing agency, or some other agency. Discussion: The Secretary understands the commenters' concerns and has concluded that he is in the best position to evaluate the information provided by various sources concerning whether a school has closed and the date of closure. Therefore, the determination of a school's closure date will be made by the Secretary and communicated to FFEL Program participants. Change: The regulation has been amended to read ``A school's closure date is the date that the school ceases to provide educational instruction in all programs, as determined by the Secretary;'' Section 682.402(d)(1)(ii)(C) 15. Comment: Some commenters recommended that the regulations clarify that only a loan made for attendance at an eligible school could be discharged under the closed school loan discharge provisions. Some commenters also wanted the regulations to make it clear that the discharge provisions would apply only if the branch or location of the school where the student actually attended was itself ``eligible.''
