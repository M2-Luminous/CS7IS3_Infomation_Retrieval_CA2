Bolivia is currently experiencing difficult times. It has to prove the strength of its democratic system and show its ability to resolve a problem which until very recently no one would have suspected would ever happen: unproven charges that a political party, and even a former president, maintained close ties with drug traffickers and drug trafficking. This has led to other secondary issues: Bolivian ties with the United States, our degree of dependency, and our limited independence. We will be discussing this and other issues with German Quiroga, minister of government of President Sanchez de Lozada's administration. Mr. Quiroga is here with us to discuss, as already announced, if Bolivia has a strong degree of dependency, if Bolivia is as submissive as it seems in its bilateral ties, and how are we to combat drug trafficking in Bolivia. Good evening sir, and thank you for accepting our invitation. [Quiroga] Good evening, and thank you, Carlos. I believe it is important to discuss the trafficking issue, which is an increasingly growing phenomenon. Trafficking is probably the largest multinational company that has ever existed in the history of humanity. Its networks have spread worldwide. It has huge fleets of planes and sophisticated communications systems. They are excellent and powerful financial experts. Unfortunately, because of difficult conditions, Bolivia has become the second largest producer of cocaine in the world. This has compelled us to think beyond our daily limitations, beyond political parties, beyond government administrations that change every four years, and even beyond our borders. The trafficking issue compels all Bolivians, men and women, to make a joint effort to halt this harmful problem. Once we agree on the elemental principle of what trafficking consists of and its huge dimension, we have to revise many of the issues linked to the antidrug struggle. [Mesa] Allow me to ask you an odd question. In practice, is Bolivia a truly independent and sovereign country? [Quiroga] Yes, absolutely. It is an independent and sovereign country, at least in spirit. If we view the issue of dependency, it is closely tied to economic problems, to resources. From this point of view, Bolivia is a strongly interrelated country. Above a true political willingness to define specific issues -- specifically referring to resources -- there are certain prerequisites which do not allow us to put them in practice. Today we live in an incredibly interrelated world. As you might recall, there was a serious scandal a couple of years ago in the United States because some Japanese businessmen bought almost a fourth of Manhattan. One of the most prominent buildings in Manhattan, the Rockefeller Center, was purchased by the Japanese. Americans took to the streets with their placards to stage their characteristic protest demonstrations and say what was wrong with the officials who allowed the Japanese in. I mention this just to show that all countries are strongly interrelated. Bolivia is an independent country because it is capable of making its own decisions. [Mesa] But you surely agree that we should not compare Japanese-U.S. ties with Bolivian-U.S. ties. [Quiroga] Definitely. [Mesa] President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada views the situation differently. In his 9 April speech he said Bolivia is very dependent, although his words were softened when the text of his speech was published. [Quiroga] But it is not a permanent dependency, am I right? Despite the interrelation I mentioned previously, Bolivia is a very independent country because it enjoys the absolute freedom to elect its officials and to enforce its own rules and regulations. So, in spite of what you have said and the great interdependency among countries, Bolivia enjoys an acceptable level of sovereignty. [Mesa] You have just mentioned a key issue regarding dependency. You have just said that we are absolutely free to choose our national officials. Let us view the issue in context. It is obvious that the U.S. Government -- to which we refer -- does not care who is appointed social communications minister, or customs director, or director of the regional sports institute. But obviously it is interested in who is appointed to the cabinet post that is directly involved in fighting drug trafficking. This is the first issue: the difficulty of appointing officials directly involved in the fight against drugs. Moreover, there is specific evidence that the U.S. ambassador has exerted direct pressure on one president, Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada [as heard]. With or without justification, U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard specifically forced [former President Jaime] Paz Zamora to request the resignation of [FELCN, Special Antinarcotics Force, chief] Faustino Rico Toro, General Carvajal [not further identified], and Interior Minister Guillermo Capobianco. Paz Zamora said in an interview that if the U.S. ambassador disagreed with the appointment of some officials -- who, we could add, were involved in the fight against drugs -- the ambassador just had to accept them. Would you say the U.S. Embassy is today completely indifferent in this regard, are you saying it accepts and does not question these appointments with the minister of government, or is it that the minister of government and other government officials do not discuss with the ambassador the appointments of the FELCN chief or other key police officials involved in the antidrug fight? [Quiroga] I believe these are completely separate issues. The sovereignty issue, the freedom of governments and officials to appoint their government team, is based on confidence. The fact that Bolivia lost this confidence -- for whatever reason -- the process of allowing officials to lead the antidrug struggle with the absolute certainty that it was being properly handled resulted in different levels of intervention which do not exist at this time. Today we are facing a credibility problem in Bolivia. This is not just the result of what in the last few days has been described as narcopolitics, it is the result of many things which have even caused international organizations to lose confidence in Bolivian authorities. One thing leads to another, it grows and grows until it is up to the United States to decide whether the interior minister stays or goes. Under normal conditions, under conditions of mutual confidence -- because I am aware that President Clinton is absolutely certain Sanchez de Lozada will not permit these kinds of defects -- I reassert that we enjoy complete freedom to choose our officials. Probably if we make a first mistake, if we nominate an official who had ties with drug trafficking, or if we overlook some ties with drug trafficking, this confidence will be lost and we will return to this vicious circle. But this is not the case now. [Mesa] You mentioned some incidents that caused U.S. Government officials and international organizations to mistrust Bolivian officials. Would you say this has just changed following Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada's election? Would you say the Americans fully trust him, was this an automatic process... [Quiroga interrupting] No, not at all. This entails a process. The situation did not change abruptly overnight. Things do not work like that. This entails a process. It is a slow and joint effort, based on honesty, which has restored confidence in Bolivia. This lack of confidence probably halted what I choose to call the nationalization of the drug struggle. Had Bolivia, as a nation and under the previous administration, not experienced profound faults in its handling of drug trafficking and not been associated with drug trafficking, today Bolivia would probably be playing a more important role in the drug struggle. Although this was not the case in our bilateral ties with the United States or in our multilateral ties with international organizations, we are reacquiring this confidence. Thanks to the work of a team of men and women at the national level, not just at the Ministry of Government, we have been able to restore this confidence. [Mesa] Theoretically speaking, what would happen if the government, for any reason, decided to replace the current FELCN chief and appoint someone else. Would you say the government would appoint this new authority without consulting -- without discussing it, if you will -- with the U.S. Embassy? [Quiroga] I would consult the FELCN and the intelligence organizations and ask them to give me a report on the background of the person to be appointed to that post. [Mesa] Not the U.S. Embassy? [Quiroga] No, not the embassy because there is an information system. Perhaps it would be interesting at this time to define the FELCN and how it operates... [Mesa interrupting] ...yes, allow me to... [Quiroga interrupting] ...to explain... [Mesa interrupting] .... yes of course... [Quiroga interrupting] ...then, yes... [Mesa interrupting] Allow me to pose a few more introductory questions so that we may later discuss this issue which is of course very important. Another important question is whether the Ministry of Government, which you head, has any U.S. Embassy officials working inside it? [Quiroga] No, no. [Mesa] Did any U.S. Embassy officials work there in the past? [Quiroga] I do not know. But there are none at this time. [Mesa] Are there any policemen, or high-ranking personnel in charge of coordinating any tasks with the United States -- a liaison officer? Someone like "Our Man in Havana," as the novel goes...? [Quiroga interrupting] ...Well, there are coordinating activities. There are joint undertakings but at this time no one can say there is a U.S. Embassy official within the structure of the Ministry of Government. Absolutely not. [Mesa] You told me you would like people to know about the FELCN. First I would like you to explain, how is the Ministry of Government organized? What does it do? What does it encompass? What are the responsibilities of the ministry under you charge? [Quiroga] Well, the Ministry of Government is divided in two sections: The domestic control system, under the police force. This is headed by the Domestic Order and Police National Secretariat. The other section is the Social Defense Secretariat which deals with coca, cocaine, and drug prevention. These are the two main ministry branches from the operational viewpoint. [Mesa] It is important to explain that the justice system is no longer under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Government. This is very important because based on the new organization of the justice system, the Ministry of Government has ceased to be in charge of the prosecutors office, etc., is this true? [Quiroga] Yes, that is correct. [passage omitted] [Mesa] You have mentioned that many people believe the DEA is involved in FELCN operations. What is more, Bolivians believe the DEA is really in charge of conducting intelligence work and even indirect antidrug operations. Some even say the Americans arrested Faustino Rico Toro, but this is not the issue in question. The BBC has produced a documentary, which we have already aired on PAT and on which journalist Amalia Pando did some research. This documentary showed DEA agents kicking down doors in Chapare. I believe this is not part of the DEA's work. This is not our invention. It is documented in a film which shows the operations were planned in Washington in conjunction with the Southern Command, which is based in Panama, and that the FELCN chief was merely informed about the operation once it was complete. This documentary also shows DEA officials directing operations aboard a flight to Santa Ana, giving instructions to the pilots, the Red Devils, and carrying guns. This is not just theory. It is documented -- not by ill-intentioned Bolivians but by reputed and objective BBC journalists who are free of all suspicion. There is evidence that the DEA is not limiting its activities just to advisory or intelligence work. [Quiroga] As I told you a few minutes ago, the DEA works in conjunction with two FELCN units, one of them being UMOPAR [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas]. We are currently implementing a program to gradually decrease the number of DEA agents in the country. Those who are working are personnel contracted by the DEA. They are U.S. police agents, contracted by the DEA, who have had military training. The number of those advising and training our police personnel is gradually decreasing. For example, in 1992 there were 35 Snow Cap agents. In 1993, there were 21. This administration has agreed with the U.S. Embassy that there will be 11 DEA agents in Bolivia. [Mesa] This means then that there are 11 DEA agents in Bolivia. [Quiroga] Eleven Snow Cap agents. We are speaking about UMOPAR and the DEA, not the entire set up because they comprise completely different and independent units. There are 11 U.S. officers who were brought in by the DEA and who are directly working with Bolivian troops. In 1991, the year the BBC report was aired -- Operation San Ramon took place in 1990 -- there were probably about 100 Snow Cap agents. This number has decreased. At the time Bolivia did not have trained personnel or the means to conduct antidrug operations. Let me remind you that at the time we were conducting antidrug operations using hired gunmen, highly trained killers -- that is what those Colombians were. But this is not the case today. Not because Government Minister Quiroga has more leeway to make independent decisions than previous government ministers. Not at all. This is because of current prevailing conditions in UMOPAR and because of its increasing effectiveness. We now have just 11 U.S. citizens working closely with our troops. Beyond the fact that we can make more sovereign decisions, Bolivian police officers are now in charge of conducting antidrug operations. They are the ones who conduct the raids and seize.... [Mesa, interrupting] How many DEA agents are there in Bolivia? [Quiroga] Right now there are 33. The number of DEA officials vary from 25 to 40 or 45. It depends on the season of the year. Sometimes the Bolivian Government requests the presence of an expert in a specific field. Sometimes they send us one or two. They train people in their field and then leave. At no time are there more than 40 or 45 DEA agents in the country. [Mesa] Is there a specific U.S.-Bolivian agreement defining the limitations, prerogatives, and restrictions on DEA agents? [Quiroga] There is no specific agreement establishing these terms. Our ties in this area are mainly based on three documents signed by the Bolivian and the U.S. Governments. One is a general document -- the Vienna Convention -- which defines the prerogatives of representatives of foreign countries. [passage omitted]
