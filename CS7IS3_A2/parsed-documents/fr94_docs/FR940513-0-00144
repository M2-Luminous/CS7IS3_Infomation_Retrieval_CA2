FR940513-0-00144 FR940513-0-00034 Of the comments favoring a cost disclosure, only one recommended including the purchase price of the lamp in the cost disclosure. 114 Most comments that supported cost disclosures, as well as some comments in opposition and some additional comments, opposed requiring disclosure of the ``estimated total operating cost.'' 115 The objection most often offered was that manufacturers have no control over the retail price of the products they manufacture, which would make it impossible to disclose on packages a meaningful operating cost figure that includes purchase price. 114 NEPS, GG&hyph;11, 2&hyph;3. But see NEPS (Tr.), 199 (``I have put it in my comments as something to be considered, and I am very willing to back off on [life-cycle cost disclosure].''). 115 See Angelo, G&hyph;1, 3; Osram, G&hyph;4, 2; Philips, G&hyph;5, 2; Panasonic, G&hyph;7, 2; ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 1&hyph;2, 4 (retail prices vary too much to require disclosure of estimated total operating cost); MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 2 (price based cost too complicated unless Commission prescribes a table with several fixed prices for both bulb types); MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 2; LRC, GG&hyph;15, 2&hyph;3 (cost based on purchase price is practically useless); US EPA, GG&hyph;17, 3 (life-cycle cost would be the best, but it's too complicated; thus, estimated annual operating cost over a standard time period is the best compromise). The comments supporting disclosure of estimated annual operating cost favored the approach because they believe that consumers understand dollars and that operating cost would provide useful information. 116 Most of these comments recommended using a fixed unit cost for electricity, rather than the national average cost figures published annually by DOE, and a fixed usage period. 117 116 See, e.g., ACEEE (Tr.), 149 (``We think you really need a dollar cost disclosure. People understand dollars.'') 117 See, e.g., ACEEE (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 1 (But see ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 1&hyph;2, in which ACEEE advocated earlier the use of a rounded version of the DOE annual energy cost.); MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 2; MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 2; LRC, GG&hyph;15, 2&hyph;3; US EPA, GG&hyph;17, 3. Even Philips, which opposed cost disclosure requirements, agreed that, if they were required, they should be based on a fixed energy cost. Philips, G&hyph;5, 2. Of those comments opposing required disclosure of operating cost, most contended that cost disclosures would be difficult to develop and would make disclosures too complicated, regardless of whether annual or total costs were used. 118 Several comments remarked that cost disclosures in U.S. dollars would result in crowded labels and consumer confusion because of the United States' increased trade with Canada and Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''). 119 118 See, e.g., SCS, GG&hyph;16, 4&hyph;5 (``Given that the most accurate presentation of operating costs is utility district based (due to utility rates (affecting operating cost) and rebates (affecting purchase cost)) rather than national, printing operating costs directly on the product package is problematic.'') 119 IES, GG&hyph;6, 2 (``Will labeling requirements necessitate bi- and tri-language packaging to explain the (U.S. cost) information?''); Osram (Tr.), 121; (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 3; GE, G&hyph;2, (Ans.), 4, (Tr.), 140 (``The result of dollar cost operation on package would force manufacturers to make country-specific packaging. Country-specific packaging means that we are less efficient and we are not as able to meet consumer demands in the three (national) markets.''), 141 (noting that there could be special problems with products bound for Canada, which would need bi-lingual labels and, if cost were required, cost disclosures in both US and Canadian dollars).
