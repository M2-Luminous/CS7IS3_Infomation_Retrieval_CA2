Alexandru Buruian, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, declared to BASA that "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet nominated any candidate to the post of ambassador to the Russian Federation. Decisions of this type are first examined by state leaders," he mentioned. Buruian affirmed that the views of the future ambassador on the problem of the 14th Army's withdrawal will not constitute a criterion of selection for the future chief of the Moldovan diplomatic mission to Moscow. "The fact that previously the Moldovan delegation at the negotiations was headed by the ex-ambassador to Russia Anatol; scan was rather a coincidence. In my opinion, the activity of the ambassador could have been more efficient if he had not led the Moldovan party at the negotiations. The activity of the ambassador to Russia should involve all aspects of the Moldovan-Russian relations, while the 14th Army problem is just one element of these relations," stressed the Moldovan vice-minister of foreign affairs.
