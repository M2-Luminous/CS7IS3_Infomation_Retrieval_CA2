The latter held a news conference afterwards. The conference was brief and consisted largely of a statement that the recent State Duma amnesty decision reflected a spirit of conciliation between the authorities and various political forces. "If necessary, probably in the near future, the Duma will also examine a memorandum on the responsibility of state institutions and politicians for preserving civic calm in Russia," he said. Regarding his meeting with Yeltsin, Rybkin said: "I won't hide the fact we spoke about the amnesty. And I drew the president's attention to the fact that some people are lifting the resolutions out of their context within the whole package of documents and giving a somewhat loose interpretation to parts of them. "I drew his attention to the fact that in principle it was a memorandum of accord that was adopted above all else. And this was supported by an absolute majority of deputies. The memorandum of accord says that in the coming two or three months we should hold round-table talks to resolve many issues that are of vital importance to Russia: political, economic, nationalism, and social issues. And we should find a solution to many problems, especially as during the past weeks the approaches to this have been clearly defined by common effort. "In the final analysis, all these agreements should lead to an accord of civic peace, national conciliation, and close cooperation between the authorities. "The first young shoots of this cooperation and conciliation are there, but they need to be lovingly nurtured and strengthened. That's the first thing. Furthermore, we counted on the amnesty resolutions being implemented in full compliance with the procedure for conciliation, which was set out in detail in the package of resolutions. "And if anyone thinks that the authorities acted inconsistently, perhaps a little hastily, then I say this: Close cooperation does not simply happen. It comes about from hard work day-in and day-out. "These detailed stories about not being in time, hurrying with a letter, not getting an answer are, I think -- how shall I say this -- are just drawing the public's attention to goings-on in entourages. "The processes of finding accord in Russia are indeed complex and difficult for us." Rybkin also said at the news conference that he thought the conduct of the procuracy and Procurator General Kazannik's resignation somewhat hasty.
