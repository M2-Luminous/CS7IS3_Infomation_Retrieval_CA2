The volume of industrial production declined in January-March 1994 by 21 percent. Production is declining because of instability in mutual clearing between enterprises, shrinking demand for output, and lack of sufficient funds to purchase raw material and components. There are production stoppages at 50-70 percent of kray enterprises monthly; losses amount to 15 percent of the standard work schedule; 75 percent of losses stem from difficulties in selling output, and 23 percent are caused by lack of raw material and components. In the fuel and energy sector, the volume of production declined by 18 percent, including electric power generation--by 4 percent, coal production--by 29 percent, primary oil refining--by 25 percent, and, correspondingly, the output of automotive gasoline--by 37 percent, diesel fuel--by 30 percent, and boiler oil--by 19 percent. Metallurgical enterprises cut steel-smelting by 16 percent and production of rolled metal by 48 percent. Gold production increased by 41 percent. In machine building, the volume of production fell off by 46 percent, including production of gas turbines--by 76 percent, metal-cutting machine tools--by 62 percent, traveling cranes--by 78 percent, and accumulator batteries--by 20 percent. In the timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry, the outtake of commercial wood dropped by 37 percent, production of lumber--by 42 percent, plywood--by 77 percent, wood-chip board--by 55 percent, wood-fiber board--by 19 percent, cardboard--by 50 percent, and cellulose--by 73 percent. In the construction materials industry, production declined by 38 percent, including that of brick--by 18 percent, preassembled ferroconcrete components--by 39 percent, and rolled roofing materials--by 48 percent. The output of consumer goods fell by almost 30 percent, including foodstuffs--by 25 percent, and nonfood items--by 38 percent. The output of basic foodstuffs is characterized by the following data: Actually produced January-March 1994 as % of January-March 1993 Meat, including category 3,196 83 I subproducts, tonnes Sausages, tonnes 2,797 82 Ready-to-cook meat 488 86 products, tonnes Whole-milk products, 14,419 87 tonnes Canned fish, thousand 2,288 2.9 times standard cans Flour, tonnes 39,801 95 Cereal, tonnes 4,863 92 Bread and bakery items, 28,043 82 tonnes Confectionery items, 5,180 67 tonnes Macaroni items, tonnes 1,777 66 Margarine, tonnes 1,972 62 Production of alcoholic beverages declined by 22 percent. A difficult situation arose with respect to production of light industry goods. In January-March their output declined by 52 percent. The average wage in industry over March amounted to R261,000 and increased as compared to January by 20.5 percent. CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION. In the first quarter of 1994 enterprises of all forms of ownership in the kray utilized R110.2 billion of capital investment. Capital assets worth R19.1 billion were commissioned. The main source of financing capital construction is enterprises' own funds (more than 48 percent of all capital investment). Centralized funds financed out of the republic budget comprised 26 percent, local budgets--18 percent, preferential credits--7 percent, and investment funds--0.3 percent. State enterprises and organizations accounted for the greatest share of utilized capital investment (62 percent), followed by joint-stock companies (36 percent as compared to 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 1993). Within the scope of capital investment, R57.3 billion, or 52 percent, was used for construction of production facilities. In the agro-industrial complex [APK], R4.5 billion of capital investment was utilized, which is four times less than in the first quarter of 1993. Of the total volume of investment in the APK, state budget funds comprised one-third. Housing construction accounted for R35.3 billion. Enterprises and organizations of all forms of ownership, utilizing all sources of financing, built housing with a total area of 78,700 square meters, which is 22 percent more than over the corresponding period of last year. A total of 1,292 apartments were built; at the same time, 125,600 families are on waiting lists for housing. AGRICULTURE. The total volume of agricultural production in the first quarter of this year fell off by 11 percent as compared to the first quarter of 1993. Kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and agricultural enterprises (on the basis of sovkhozes) produced 6,800 tonnes of meat (livestock and poultry sold for slaughter) in live weight, which is 8 percent below last year's level; 12,200 tonnes of milk (6 percent less); and 66.3 million eggs (19 percent less). Production of meat declined at the farms of six rayons, most significantly among them the farms in Komsomolskiy Rayon--by 41 percent; that of milk--in all rayons with the exception of Bikinskiy and Imeni Sergeya Lazo; and of eggs--in all except Sovetsko-Gavanskiy Rayon. Over three months of the current year, milk yield per cow amounted to 483 kg, which is 24 kg more than over the corresponding period of last year. The yield per laying hen amounted to 50 eggs, which is six eggs less than last year. The herd of productive livestock in kolkhozes, sovkhozes, and agricultural enterprises (on the basis of sovkhozes) continues to decline. As of 1 April of 1994 it consisted of 63,200 head of horned cattle (90 percent of the first quarter of 1993), including 25,000 cows (89 percent); 164,100 swine (96 percent); and 3.736 million head of poultry (85 percent). Production of calves declined by 9 percent, that of piglets increased by 14 percent. Horned cattle mortality increased by 3 percent, and swine mortality--by 17 percent. The drop in the output of animal husbandry products resulted in a smaller volume of procurement of milk and eggs--by 5 percent and 23 percent, respectively--and amounted to 10,200 tonnes and 48.2 million units. There was 0.5 percent more livestock and poultry procured than in the first quarter of 1993--a total of 6,200 tonnes (in live weight). Farms in six rayons reduced the quantities of livestock and poultry sold to the state, most significantly among them the farms in Amurskiy Rayon--by 67 percent; of milk--the farms in 11 rayons, among them Ulchskiy--by 89 percent, and Tuguro-Chumyakanskiy--by 65 percent; and of eggs--the farms in all rayons except Sovetsko-Gavanskiy. As of 1 April there were 1,850 peasant (private) farms in the kray; they were allocated 45,500 hectares (25 hectares on average per farm). The greatest number of peasant (private) farms were registered in Imeni Lazo Rayon--467, and Khabarovsk Rayon--367. Along with new peasant farms being formed, 244 farms went out of business since 1992. In the first quarter of 1994 1,524 families received land for collective orchards and vegetable gardens. TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS. The volume of cargo shipping by all categories of transport decreased as compared to the first quarter of 1993 by 30 percent and amounted to 5.0113 million tonnes. In rail transportation, cargo shipments declined by 26.8 percent, in automotive--by 44.6 percent, and air transportation--by 25 percent; at the same time, 31 percent more cargo was moved by river transport enterprises. In pipeline transport, 49,300 tonnes of petroleum products (20 percent less) entered the pipeline at the point of origination. In rail transport the volume of loading of almost all most important categories of cargo declined, including bituminous coal--by 38.3 percent, oil and petroleum products--by 26.5 percent, timber--by 26.2 percent, and grain and products of milling--by 24.9 percent. Loading of chemical and mineral fertilizer declined dramatically--by 97 percent. Loading of cement increased by 3.5 times. In the first quarter of this year, 226,000 tonnes of cargo--63 percent less than in the first quarter of last year--were delivered to the Vanino railroad transfer station, which is a gateway shipping point for cargo destined for the regions of the Far North and areas equated to it. In air transportation in the first quarter, as compared to the first quarter of last year, despite rate deregulation the passenger flow increased by 9 percent, and in automotive transportation--by 3 percent. Automotive carriers moved 68.038 million passengers, and air carriers--576,000 (105 percent and 128.1 percent, respectively, as compared to the first quarter of last year). Because of the insufficient pool of the rolling stock and its poor technical condition, the situation with respect to city and suburban transportation services for the population remains difficult. Each month more than 16 percent of scheduled bus, trolley bus, and streetcar runs in Khabarovsk are not performed. Expenditures for repairs of roads and structures amounted to R2.879 billion. Over the first quarter of 1994, communications services enterprises earned R27.4608 billion from their main activities. Communication services provided for the population accounted for R5.9335 billion of earnings. The physical volume of most important categories of communication services declined considerably: newspaper and magazine subscription and retail sales--by 28.3 percent; letters, postcards, and small parcels--by 33.2 percent; and money transfers--by 28.5 percent. On the other hand, 1.7 times more declared-value parcels were sent than in the first quarter of 1993. THE CONSUMER MARKET. In the current year the trade sector continued to adapt to new conditions. Retail turnover, including public catering, for January-March amounted to R269.5 billion, which in current prices is 6.4 times more than the corresponding period of last year, and in comparable prices--20 percent less. State-owned trade enterprises accounted for 52 percent of the turnover (65 percent in January-March 1993), privately owned--34 percent (7 percent), and consumer cooperatives and enterprises of other types of ownership--14 percent (28 percent). The turnover structure has changed as compared to the first quarter of 1993. The proportion of foodstuffs increased from 61 to 64 percent, and the proportion of nonfood items dropped from 39 to 36 percent. Public catering turnover amounted to R20 billion and declined in comparable prices by 20 percent. This was caused by the decline in the number of public catering enterprises. Continuous market saturation with goods is characterized by the current inventories in trade; there were R163 billion worth of inventories, which is enough for 59 days of trading. A year ago this indicator was equal to 45 days. The volume of for-fee services provided to the population amounted to R52 billion, which is 8.9 times more in current prices than last year, but 56 percent less in comparable prices. The volume of services provided for the population by privately owned enterprises accounted for 3 percent of the total volume of services. Consumer services account for 12 percent of the total volume for for-fee services. Their actual volume was R6.1 billion. In current prices this is 7.3 times more than over the corresponding period of last year. However, the real volume of consumer services declined by 50 percent. FOREIGN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES. In the first quarter, the kray's foreign trade turnover amounted to $131.3 million. Kray enterprises exported $97.1 million worth of products as compared to $39.7 million over the corresponding period of 1993. The geography of shipments abroad changed somewhat. While in the first quarter 1993 the greatest share of exports went to China (33 percent), during the period under review these exports accounted for only 5.6 percent. Japan remains constant as a traditional consumer of timber; exports to this country in the first quarter comprised 67 percent as compared to 27.5 percent in the first quarter of 1993. Exports to the Republic of Korea dropped somewhat from 8.6 percent to 6 percent. Exports to the United States grew from $40,000 to $2.2 million; to Australia--from $2.1 million to $7.9 million. Contacts with Israel, Turkey, and other countries are expanding. The structure of exports remains practically unchanged with minor fluctuations. The proportion of timber comprised 56.7 percent, ferrous metals--14.4 percent, oil products--12.8 percent, and nonferrous metals--3.6 percent. It should be noted that the proportional share of deliveries of various transportation equipment purchased outside the kray borders has dropped (from 4.1 percent to 0.6 percent). Imports were brought from 23 countries and their value in the first quarter amounted to $34.2 million. Goods from China account for the greatest proportion of imports--69.5 percent, from the Republic of Korea--10.9 percent, and from the United States--6.3 percent. The bulk of imports are light industry goods (48.3 percent) and foodstuffs (46.7 percent). The rest of imports are represented by a variety of goods. PRIVATIZATION. Since the beginning of the year 107 enterprises (facilities) have been privatized, and overall since the beginning of privatization--1,046 enterprises. In the current year, 33 percent of privatized enterprises were in industry, 29 percent--in the trade sector, and 18 percent--in consumer services. Enterprises privatized through conversion to joint-stock holding comprised 38 percent of the total (41 enterprises). Of the three versions of privatization, labor collectives preferred the second option, which allows them to keep the controlling share. "Small-business" privatization is carried out mainly by way of selling enterprises through commercial bids (74 percent) and auctions (12 percent) and by buying out leased property (14 percent). The greatest number of facilities sold were in Khabarovsk--48, and Komsomolsk--23; among the rayons: Vaninskiy--10, Amurskiy--six, and Nikolayevskiy and Solnechnyy--five each. Privatization of enterprises generated in the first quarter (including money received for enterprises privatized earlier) R4.893 billion in monetary revenue and brought in 115,900 privatization vouchers. Of the total revenue, R389.7 million [as published], or 80 percent, was transferred into the budgets of all levels. In January-March 1994, 9,439 apartments in the kray with a total area of 480,700 square meters were transferred to the private ownership of citizens. Apartments were privatized in almost all rayons, except Nanayskiy and Imeni P. Osipenko. The Khabarovsk universal exchange Bizon, which operates on kray territory, in the first quarter conducted 24 tradings at which 197 deals were concluded. The exchange's turnover comprised R738.8 million. PRICES. As compared to December 1993, consumer prices for consumer goods and for-fee services in March increased by 32.8 percent, including by 28.5 percent for consumer goods and by 92.5 percent for for-fee services. Over the quarter the rate of price increases for consumer goods and for-fee services declined, and in March amounted to 6.3 percent (12.8 percent in January, and 10.8 percent in February). Prices for producer goods rose by 26.1 percent. Of foodstuffs, the greatest price increases were registered with respect to bread and bakery items, flour, and eggs--1.5-fold; macaroni items, cereals, legumes, and canned vegetables--1.7-2.2-fold; milk and milk products, sausages, fish products, confectionery items, vegetables, and potatoes--by 30-40 percent. At the same time, prices for butter, vegetable oil, margarine, meat and poultry, tea, and salt rose by 6-20 percent. Prices for citrus fruit dropped on average by 15 percent. Prices for nonfood items rose as compared to December 1993 by 31.4 percent. Prices for goods for children continued to rise: those for footwear, clothing, and underwear went up 1.5-1.7-fold, including a threefold increase in prices for preschool children's footwear. Prices for fabrics, footwear, furniture, clothing, and underwear, electric goods, hosiery and knitwear, fur and items made of it, rugs and carpeting went up by 20-50 percent; those for headgear (except made of fur), metal utensils, and jewelry--1.6-twofold; and office supplies--3.3-fold. Of construction materials, prices increased the most with respect to wood-fiber board, cement, and roof slate--2.3-fold. Gasoline prices went up 1.7-fold, with the price per liter reaching R267. Prices for the same goods differed perceptibly in March between kray's cities and rayons. The gap between maximum and minimum prices measured a factor of 1.6 with respect to butter, 2.7 with respect to milk, 1.4--eggs, 1.5--sugar, and 1.6 with respect to bread. Prices and fees for for-fee services for the population increased in March by 92.5 percent as compared to December 1993, which is 50 percentage points higher than the rate of increases in consumer goods prices. The cost of communications services went up the most (2.6-fold), and among them subscriber fee for residential telephone services and telegraph services--3.3-fold. The cost of passenger transportation more than doubled, while suburban train fares increased 3.2-fold. While the cost of municipal services increased 1.9-fold, rent in municipal housing increased eightfold. The cost of stay in sanitariums, resorts, fitness facilities, and health care institutions, cultural facilities, parents' share of the cost of keeping children in preschool facilities, and consumer services increased 1.6-1.9-fold. Following the increase in fuel and energy prices, expenses for freight transportation increased (1.8-fold). Freight rates went up especially perceptibly in air (2.4-fold) and rail (1.8-fold) transportation. Prices for producer goods in March as compared to December 1993 increased by 40 percent. In electric power generation, as well as the timber and woodworking industry, prices increased 1.8-fold; in the petroleum refining industry, and lifting and transportation machine-building--by 40 percent. The cost of production of wood-chip board increased 2.4-fold. Wholesale prices for consumer goods rose at a somewhat lesser rate than those for producer goods. Prices in bread-baking and meat-packing industry increased by 20 percent. The greatest price increases were noted in the dairy industry--by 40 percent, including for milk and fermented milk products--1.6-fold. The rate of price increases declined in light industry (97.9 percent) and liquor distilling (97.8 percent) industries. FINANCES. Overall, the kray's economy over two months of the current year produced about R50 billion in profits; as compared to the corresponding period of last year, profits increased 2.1-fold. The slow growth in profits stems mainly from the problems in product distribution and the shortage of financial resources at a score of enterprises. Almost 31 percent of enterprises in all sectors of the economy operated at a loss. The greatest proportion of unprofitable enterprises was in the municipal services sector (46.7 percent), transportation (41.9 percent), material and technical supply (35.7 percent), and trade (35.4 percent). Vyazemskiy Rayon enterprises operated at a loss--the proportion of unprofitable enterprises here comprised 56.3 percent--as well as those in Verkhnebureinskiy (52.9 percent), Nikolayevskiy (47.6 percent), Komsomolskiy (40.0 percent), and Okhotskiy (46.2 percent) Rayons. The insolvency problem in the economy remains acute. According to data received from enterprises and organizations in industry, agriculture, transportation, and construction on the territory of Khabarovsk Kray, their total liabilities to supplier enterprises in February 1994 amounted to R759.3 billion--an 8.7-percent increase as compared to January of this year. Past due liability to suppliers amounted to R426.3 billion (58.1 percent of the total liability). Industrial enterprises account for 71.8 percent of all liabilities, construction--13.3 percent, transportation--13.2 percent, and agriculture--1.7 percent. A considerable share of past due liabilities results from not receiving timely payments for products shipped to consumer enterprises. Customer liability for the goods shipped amounted to R659.0 billion, including R379.7 billion (57.6 percent) past due. Industrial enterprises account for the greatest share of customer liability (70.4 percent). The financial situation of enterprises and organizations is exacerbated by the poor state of mutual clearing in the economy. Total accounts payable amounted to R806.4 billion and increased as compared to January of this year by 6.1 percent, including past due accounts payable--R381.9 billion (47.3 of the total due). Industrial enterprises account for the greatest share of accounts payable owed (75.8 percent). Debts to suppliers amount to R586.4 billion, of which 49.1 percent are past due. Loan debt amounted to R10 billion, and the debt of bank credit--R189 billion. The volume of enterprises' back pay and other pay-related liability is growing. As of 1 April obligations with respect to the issuance of consumption funds at industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises amounted to R42.7 billion. Enterprises in Khabarovsk, Komsomolsk-na-Amure, and Sovetsko-Gavanskiy and Amurskiy Rayons account for a considerable share of money not paid out on schedule. Back pay owed to workers in industry amounts to R25.7 billion, in construction--13.6 billion, and in agriculture--R3.5 billion. The greatest amounts are owed to their employees by the AO [joint-stock company] Sea Resources in Sovetskaya Gavan--about R2.7 billion; AO Shipbuilding Plant in Komsomolsk--R2.0 billion; industrial-construction association Khabgrazhdanstroy--R395 million; and AO Heating Equipment Plant--R385 billion. The main cause of past due liabilities are the high rate of inflation and low payment discipline in the economy, which makes it more difficult for enterprises to form the necessary financial resources for production expansion and social development. THE POPULATION'S INCOME. The monetary income of the population over the first quarter of 1994 amounted to R764 billion and increased 10-fold as compared to the first quarter of 1993. Of the total amount of monetary income, the population spent about R370 billion on purchases of goods and services, which is eight times more than in the first quarter of last year; taxes, various contributions, and other types of expenses amounted to R87 billion; and R200 billion were deposited in bank accounts and used to purchase securities. The main source of monetary income for the majority of the population is wages. The average monthly wage in kray economic sectors in the first quarter amounted to R239,000 and increased as compared to December 1993 by 2 percent. The average wage in industry in March amounted to R261,000, in construction--R275,000, in sovkhozes--R162,000, in transportation--R374,000, in communications--R403,000, in health care and social security--R211,000, education--R177,000, culture and arts--R173,000, and in science and science-related services--R184,000. EMPLOYMENT. In the first quarter, 568,000 persons were employed in the kray's economy. The nonstate sector, where currently more than 20 percent of the labor force are employed, is beginning to play an increasingly greater role. The number of workers in the main sector of the social complex--education, health care, housing and municipal services--has increased. There is a stable growth in employment in the credit industry and state insurance, tax inspectorates, notary offices, and legal services, evidence that an infrastructure typical of a market economy is beginning to form. The number of workers in science and science-related services and design organizations has declined. A total of 12,600 persons were without work and actively looking for it in the first quarter. Of them, 9,302 had the official status of unemployed. As compared to the beginning of the year, the number of unemployed increased by 60 percent. The problem of unemployment is especially acute for women (about 70 percent of all officially registered unemployed). Young people under 30 accounted for 3,473 unemployed (37 percent). Of the total number of officially registered unemployed, 81 percent receive unemployment benefits. The number of those who have been unemployed for more than four months has increased: By the end of the quarter their share in the total number of unemployed was 35 percent. EDUCATION. There are 234,000 pupils continuing education in general education schools. Of them, 10,900 school students are preparing to take 11th and 12th grade graduation exams. According to the data of a snapshot selective-sample survey, 80 percent of those studying in city schools plan to continue their education in institutions of higher learning after they graduate. To the question: "What would you like to achieve in life?" most place material well-being first; having a good family comes second, and an interesting profession--third. One-third of the respondents named as their future field of activities management and trade. Thirty-five percent of respondents have already been earning pocket money, and 3 percent currently combine work and study. MORBIDITY. In the first quarter, 1,870 incidents of acute intestinal infections were registered, 98,700 incidents of acute upper respiratory tract infections, 28,600 incidents of influenza, 163 incidents of syphilis, 1,426 incidents of gonorrhea, and 1,493 incidents of pediculesis. As compared to the corresponding period of last year, the incidence of venereal diseases increased: syphilis--threefold, and gonorrhea--twofold. THE DEMOGRAPHIC SITUATION. As of 1 January 1994 the population of Khabarovsk Kray numbered 1,608,200, of whom 1,295,900 live in urban areas and 312,300--in rural areas. Overall, the kray population decreased as compared to the preceding year by 12,800 (0.8 percent). This is the result first of foremost of outward migration and the decline in the birth rate in the kray itself. The democratic situation is not improving in the current year. Over the three months, 3,862 people were born in the kray, which is 186, or 4.6 percent, less than over the corresponding period of last year. At the same time the number of deaths increased by 252 (5.1 percent) and numbered 5,206. The natural population decline was by 1,314 persons (876 in 1993). The number of births per 1,000 population declined from 10.2 to 9.8, or 3.9 percent as compared to the analogous period in 1993, while the number of deaths increased from 12.4 to 13.1 (by 5.6 percent). The main causes of death still are cardiovascular disease (53.5 percent of the total number of deaths), trauma and poisoning (20.6 percent), and new growths (13.3 percent). As compared to last year there has been an increase in the number of deaths from tuberculosis (by 14 percent), digestive tract diseases (by 16.5 percent), and trauma and poisoning (by 5.8 percent). A sharp increase in the number of fatalities from traffic accidents (a 26.5 percent increase), murders (23.4 percent), and suicides (18.8 percent) contributed to the growth in mortality from unnatural causes. Over January-March 1994, 2,400 marriages and 2,300 divorces were registered in the kray. As compared to the analogous period of last year the number of marriages declined by 8.1 percent and the number of divorces increased by 3.7 percent. CRIME. Over the first quarter of this year the kray internal affairs organs registered 11,600 crimes, which is 3.4 percent less than over the corresponding period of last year. One in five crimes is of a grave variety. Overall, the number of grave crimes fell by 8.8 percent. The number of murders increased by four--to a total of 134, and the number of rapes--by nine (49). There were 4,452 incidents of theft of personal property, including 2,390 apartment burglaries (a decline, respectively, of 11.2 percent and 11.6 percent). The number of thefts from warehouses, stores, and cars increased by 21.6 percent. The incidence of swindling increased 1.5-fold, of bribe-taking--by 16.7 percent. There were 320 registered economic crimes (a 22.6 percent increase). There were 2,818 crimes committed in public places, including 1,478 in the streets; 940 group crimes were registered, and 959 crimes were committed by juveniles. One in five crimes was committed by people who do not work and in a state of alcoholic intoxication. An increase in crime has been registered in Tsentralnyy and Krasnoflotskiy Rayons in Khabarovsk (by 8.1 percent and 9.7 percent), Vaninskiy (by 13 percent), Khabarovskiy (by 8.9 percent), Nanayskiy (by 14.2 percent), Imeni Lazo (by 35.1 percent), Vyazemskiy (by 16.8 percent), Bikinskiy (by 26.7 percent), Verkhnebureinskiy (by 10.3 percent), Okhotskiy (by 8.2 percent), and Ulchskiy (by 12.8) Rayons. Six instances of theft of weapons were uncovered. Half of all registered crimes were solved.
