Heightened police effort forces drug addicts into treatment, he says. Drug addicts would continue to use drugs even if police ceased going after pushers. The police offensive against drugs on the street forces many addicts into treatment. That is what Jorgen Green, director of the County Youth Center in Storstrom County told BERLINGSKE TIDENDE. Ever since the 1960s, when hard drugs made their impact, Green has been working with drug abusers and their addiction. "The police have been wrongfully made the whipping boy. People say that police raids on drug dealers on the streets are responsible for the death of drug addicts. I do not feel that there is any proof of this. It has not been our experience that this is what is happening," he said, "The drug treatment facilities will simply have more to do if the police do not constantly make inroads on the drug trade," he said. Green feels the rise in drug use is due to the fact that drug addicts do not receive the treatment they need; that their average age has risen; that AIDS is the cause of a number of deaths; and that drug addicts are psychologically and physically run down. "Drug addicts die because they do not get into treatment or are refused treatment. The moment the police are on the street we find more drug addicts asking to get into treatment," said Green. He strongly opposes stopping the police actions against drug dealing and pushers in places such as Vesterbro. "I know very well what the inhabitants of Vesterbro will do if the police withdraw. They will get hold of some baseball bats and they will drum both drug dealers and addicts out of the Vesterbro quarter. If the police leave, they will become the victims of local justice," he said. These remarks come two weeks before Health Minister Torben Lund (Social Democrat) is expected to make a drug policy statement.
