Deputy Government Minister Adolfo Reyes explains the agreements reached tonight inside the National Palace. Can you explain the agreements to our listeners? [Reyes] It is fortunate that once again through dialogue-- without any violence and in compliance with the law and Constitution--we have done our work. We have met with the five Fenasep leaders who are here in my office. We are drafting a document that includes a point on the resumption of talks; this will take place on 1 March, starting at 1500, when the president will hold a special meeting with them. Other points are nonviolence and a revision of dialogue. They have maintained their request for a 40-percent salary increase. In addition to the people gathered outside the main square, there was no violence, fortunately. The police are remaining watchful, protecting the people, and preventing incidents. When we sign this document, which we hope will be in the next 10 minutes, the union leaders promised us they will withdraw peacefully. We will meet again on 1 March at 1500. That is all I have to say. [Guatemala City Cadena de Emisoras Unidas in Spanish at 0155 GMT on 24 February cites Fenasep leader Armando Sanchez as saying: "We are going to proceed to leave the building, because we reached an agreement to meet in a new process of negotiation with the government on 1 March."]
