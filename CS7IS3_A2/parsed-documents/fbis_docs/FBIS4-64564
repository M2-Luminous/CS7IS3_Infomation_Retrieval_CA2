This gray coalition can count on a slight majority with 78 seats. The CDA and VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] managed to survive for four years, from 1977 to 1981, with one less seat, so why not? There is no shortage of alternatives. But many are not realistic and have already been ruled out by those in question. This is true, for example, of a national government of the four major parties. What is sure is that any majority government must include three parties. A coalition goverment of only two parties is out of the question. More than anything else, this shows the weakened position of the CDA, which has been used to governing alternatively with the PvdA and the VVD. Reasonably sure, too, is that the D66 [Democrats 66] is going to play a crucial role in the formation of any new government. A government which does not include Hans Van Mierlo's party is virtually inconceivable. In this respect, the position of the D66 is in theory stronger than that of the three other major parties. There are in fact just three serious possibilities. The least probable is a government of the Right including the CDA, VVD and D66, which would have 89 seats in Parliament. For tactical reasons, however, Van Mierlo is reluctant to exclude this option, but it is difficult to imagine that the D66, which is constantly pressing for government reform, will be prepared to go down in history as the party which assisted a majority government of the Right. This would most probably annul yesterday's gains at future elections, at the very least. The party still remembers how the electorate judged the summer government of the CDA and D66 back in 1982. That leaves two options. One is the purple coalition of the PvdA, VVD, and D66. Such a government would have a solid parliamentary majority with 92 seats. Finally, there is the center-left option, with a government of the PvdA, CDA, and D66 with 95 seats. It is still going to be difficult to choose. The D66 is a great supporter of a purple coalition and this party's opinion, which was the big winner at the elections, naturally carries a great deal of weight. The advantage of such a purple coalition is that it would also include the election runner-up, the VVD. During the election campaign, VVD leader Bolkestein already stated that the two winners should sit together in a future government. He left the question open as to whether the third party should be the CDA or the PvdA. The advantage for the CDA as a non-participating party is that it could seek the shelter of the opposition ranks in order to solve its leadership crisis. With a loss of 20 seats and a discredited party leader, its further participation in the government, as if nothing had happened, would be difficult to justify. The disadvantages of a purple coalition, however, are just as numerous. There are a number of major problems in terms of political programs. How will the PvdA and the VVD be able bridge their differences on the future of the social security system? And what about the conflict over education for illegal immigrants? Bolkestein has already made it clear that these are subjects which must be discussed. A center-left government of the CDA, PvdA, and D66 seems somewhat easier. The differences, in particular in the financial-economic area, are not insurmountable. The D66 will want the concession from the PvdA that the social security system is not sacrosanct. But is a government of three parties in which two of the parties suffered serious losses at the polls really acceptable? The CDA and PvdA together have lost a total of 32 seats, a loss on an unprecedented scale. The PvdA has the trump card as the biggest party. It will probably be given the first initiative [to form a government]. But probably not alone. Also in the game is D66. It is still possible that two persons, one from the PvdA as the largest party and one from the D66 as the winning party, will be designated to test the ground for the formation of a government. They would first of all look at the possibilities for a purple coalition. This would appeal to the D66 in particular, which would certainly make concessions to its program to achieve it. A purple government is Hans Van Mierlo's dream. His PvdA colleague Kok is much less enthusiastic, but cannot quickly disregard the possibility. To reject it would automatically mean bringing in the Christian Democrats and giving them a trump card to play, because the CDA also knows that, if a purple coalition does not work, the PvdA has only one other remaining option: a center-left government. Moreover, in such negotiations, the D66 is likely to adopt a much tougher stance than in a purple coalition. The party has repeatedly stated that it will not simply fall into line with the CDA and PvdA. Whichever of these two coalitions will actually come to power, one of the bizarre results of these elections may be that the man who has imposed two legislative election defeats on the PvdA and who has brought it to a an all-time electoral low may well become the first social democrat prime minister for 17 years.
