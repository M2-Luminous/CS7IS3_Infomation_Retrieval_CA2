The decision was made at today's meeting of the NDS Central Council. Cernak had been chairman of the nationalist Slovak National Party (SNS), from which he was expelled in February "for consistent gross violation of the statutes." Cernak said that the offers made to his party by the DU and the Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) of Jan Carnogursky were equal. The NDS has opted for Moravcik's party because the DU's major priority is the creation of a centre bloc, he added. The KDH is clearly right-orientated. Another reason were, Cernak said, the results of public opinion polls which had shown that the membership and voters of the two parties were "compatible." According to the latest poll, the DU has a 6 per cent voter support, while the NDS would not cross the 5-per cent parliamentary border. Cernak said that the final decision on the participation of his party on the DU slate would be made by the DU National Council next week. The elections are scheduled to take place on September 30-October 1.
