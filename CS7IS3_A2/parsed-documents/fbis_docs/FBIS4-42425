A previous UN request was refused by the government, because the Netherlands had already provided enough soldiers for UN peacekeeping operations. The situation in Rwanda is also too dangerous, as Netherlands soldiers are likely to be mistaken for Belgians. Belgian soldiers have already been killed in Rwanda. The Second Chamber found the latter argument unconvincing.
