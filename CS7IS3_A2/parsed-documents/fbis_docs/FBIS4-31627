Intelligence services work with secrets on the preservation of which the security of the state depends. On the other hand, secret services pose a potential danger to human rights. The system of control over them has to take these two peculiarities into account. In our country, this mechanism has been worked out for only the Security and Information Service [BIS]. The intelligence service and the Army's intelligence departments are working safely hidden under the shell of the Interior Ministry and the Defense Ministry, where they are based. According to BIS director Devaty, however, it is very unreasonable to reject parliamentary control. Parliamentary control most efficiently disperses suspicion that, under the lid of the intelligence pot, a dark soup of intrigues and political conspiracy is boiling. It is usual in the world that primary control over the work of secret services is performed by the government, who also uses secret services' information to make decisions. Audit is a strong tool in this respect. The very fact that funds are being allocated to them on the basis of specific assignments keeps a tight hand on the intelligence service members. It is difficult to imagine that agents would finance possible subversive actions from their own funds. Intelligence activity, however, closely touches upon the human rights guaranteed by the Constitution. In the BIS case, the applicable law allows imposing limitations on them. Independent judges (as regards utilization of intelligence gathering technology, for instance), as well as a special parliamentary body, keep an eye on the respect for this law. This arrangement is usual in a number of European countries; it is not a rule, however. In the Netherlands, for example, this supervision is performed by a commission of selected ministers. Our experience with the former State Security has led us to establish permanent and preventive parliamentary supervision over BIS, unlike in Great Britain, for instance, where the appropriate institutions inspect secret services only on the basis of a specific complaint. In France, there is no control over counterintelligence, which is part of the police. Our deputies have at their disposal all of BIS's internal regulations (on record-keeping, internal control, etc.), and, thanks to that fact, they know how to proceed. From the accounting documents they receive, they can get a rough picture of BIS activities in individual spheres. They conduct their audits directly at workplaces of the secret service, and they can demand any data from the archive without any limitation. The principle of hierarchic limitation on access to information does not apply to them. Anyone at BIS who wants to see his colleague's folder must give a specific reason for that. The Czech secret service introduced these barriers after its bad experience with the former Federal Security and Information Service. It was precisely its benevolent internal regulations that made it easy for Wallis to dig into secret files. Actions that are in progress, however, are the prohibited zone, where the secret service refuses to admit the deputies. The results of the secret service are always directly proportional to the extent to which the leak of information can be prevented. The service employees themselves do not know agents other than those to whom they directly give assignments. The law on BIS requires that the security of these people be protected, and data on them must not be divulged, not even to deputies. Devaty concluded a gentleman's agreement with deputies that, at their request, he would close any file to allow them to inspect it. At the same time, he requires from the deputies that they assume their burden of responsibility for the possible consequences this could have on the security of the state or the lives of BIS members, who could be endangered by the deputies' indiscretion. Nothing like that has happened, however; on the other hand, no case of a well-founded complaint about the violation of human rights has been recorded. A secret service worthy of that name will certainly never admit anyone from outside into its most intimate places, which are the files of the agents and cases in progress. If some law forced them to make these documents accessible, the intelligence staffers would rather keep their knowledge in their heads or somewhere else, leaving empty folders for the controllers. On the other hand, it is in the interest of all of the secret services to be as open as possible to parliamentary control (by opposition deputies, above all), if it is possible from the viewpoint of their operation. However, absolutely nontransparent military and police intelligence departments are hiding in the shadow of BIS, which is controlled by parliament and which operates according to law. This is not to the benefit of the credibility of special services as a whole.
