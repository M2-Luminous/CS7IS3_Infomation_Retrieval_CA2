Amat accompanied Premier Li Peng on a recent visit to Inner Mongolia. Established May 1, 1947, Inner Mongolia was China's first autonomous region. It has a long history of solidarity among nationalities. In the 1950s a large number of intellectuals and construction workers from other parts of China went there to help with the construction of the region. The late Premier Zhou Enlai praised the region as "a model autonomous region" in 1959. With the implementation of the reform and open policy, Inner Mongolia reached a new stage of solidarity and economic exchange in a stable social environment. Under the guidance of the state nationalities policy and the autonomous law of the minority-nationality regions, Inner Mongolia passed a series of regional laws to meet the needs of the reform and open drive. To train officials from minority nationalities for regional management is a key task. So far, there are 157,000 such officials. Agriculture and animal husbandry have developed rapidly in Inner Mongolia in recent years. In 1993 the gross product, per capita income of urban residents and net per capita income of peasants and herdsmen were up 8.12, 6.26 and 5.45 times, respectively, compared with the figures for 1978. Science and technology, education, culture and health care have likewise made great progress.
