FBIS4-55926 "dreeu101__a94016" FBIS-EEU-94-101-A Daily Report 20 May 1994 ANNEX Hungary Police Blame Horn's Driver for Car Accident Police Blame Horn's Driver for Car Accident AU2005133394 Budapest MTI in English 1237 GMT 20 May 94 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU2005133394 Budapest MTI English BFN [Text] Budapest, 20 May (MTI) -- Borsod-Abauj-Zemplen County police are conducting proceedings against Istvan Mosolygo -- the driver of the car that crashed while carrying Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) Chairman Gyula Horn from an election rally in Miskolc -- for having allegedly caused a road accident by careless driving, says a statement issued by the National Police Command (ORFK) simultaneous to its Friday [20 May] press conference. According to the police briefing, the Saab-9000 driven by Mosolygo, en route from Miskolc to Budapest, crossed the bisecting line of the road and hit an IFA-type lorry, which was parked in the opposite lane because of a defect in the trailer's right rear tyre. The accident occurred on May 5 at 8.45 P.M. [1845 GMT] on highway No. 3 between Nyekladhaza and Emod. Mosolygo, Horn, and his escort, retired police-major Jeno Zsidey, sustained serious injuries in the accident. According to investigations so far, neither Mosolygo nor the lorry-driver were intoxicated. The police survey of the scene of the accident showed that the lorry stood on the left side of the road, 0.7-1.2 meters from the bisecting line. The passengers in the Saab observed no oncoming traffic, nor did they see any pedestrians, cyclists, or animals nearby, and only Zsidey claimed to have seen a sudden flash of light. Mosolygo cannot remember what happened before or during the crash. There was no witness to raise suspicion that the crash had been caused deliberately, the National Police Command told reporters at the press conference called in Budapest on Friday after investigations into the accident came to an end. In response to questions from reporters, the National Police Commissioner, Brigadier-General Sandor Pinter, said that on March 25 the ORFK had offered personal escorts to all eight parliamentary parties, but none availed themselves of the opportunity. He made it a point to stress that the car carrying the person under police escort never goes ahead, as was the case with the convoy of three cars accompanying Horn on his return from Miskolc. Prior to the accident, Horn received several threatening telephone calls, and police patrols had been assigned to regularly check the vicinity of the MSZP chairman's residence, Pinter said.
