FBIS4-6930 "dreas080__a94017" FBIS-EAS-94-080-A Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ANNEX Japan NTT, IDO Compete in Cellular Phone Market NTT, IDO Compete in Cellular Phone Market 942A0134A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 15 Apr 94 p 6--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942A0134A Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese CSO [Text] Outright sales of cellular phones were initiated in Shizuoka Prefecture in April amidst lively competition between NTT's Tokai Mobile Network (NTT Dokomo [Anywhere]) using digital technology and Nippon Ido Tsushin (IDO) using Motorola's TACS [total access communications system] technology. NTT Dokomo systems are being promoted in terms of the applicability of digital technology in the multimedia age, while the IDO Motorola cellular units are being promoted based on instrument variety and low price. Between this summer and next spring, two more digital-based companies are scheduled to enter the market, sharply increasing interest in cellular phones in Shizuoka prefecture. Yotaro Hoshiyama, director of NTT Dokomo's Shizuoka regional office, displays enthusiasm as he says, "We intend to aggressively stress the value-added aspects of digital technology in that it is applicable to personal computer communications." Connections for NTT Kodomo's digital services network were completed in April for the northern Kanto, Tokyo metropolitan, Tokai and Kansai areas. Intraprefectural calling areas are now restricted to Gotenba, Numazu, Shizuoka, and Hamamatsu along the Tomei Freeway, which is smaller than the area covered by analog systems, but it will be extended to urban areas surrounding Hamamatsu and urban areas of East Izu during fiscal year 1994. Director Hoshiyama states that the digital network is being expanded beyond the areas covered by the analogue system to "accommodate requirements of urban area residents who have a frequent need to use cellular phones while traveling on business or pleasure in the Shizuoka area." The reason NTT Dokomo is emphasizing digital technology is that it can be connected to communication services using integrated services digital network (ISDN) being installed by the NTT group, while cellular phones will be one phase of an overall high-technology communications network. However, of the cellular phone orders received in the first 10 days of April, only 10 percent were for those using digital technology. According to director Hoshiyama, "We need to suggest effective uses of the technology to business firms," reflecting the intent to continue with efforts in expanding use of the technology. On the other hand, IDO has expanded its analog network, which was the topic of U.S.-Japan friction, in Shizuoka Prefecture. Shizuoka branch manager Tetsuji Nomura stresses, "Motorola cellulars can be used any place in the country by connecting to the Cellular Group. There are eight different models available in terms of cellular phones and they are about 30,000 yen cheaper than digital models." He is poised to compete head-on with digital systems whose service areas are now limited to Kanto and Kansai areas and whose cellular units are priced higher. IDO handles NTT analogue cellulars too, but manager Nomura states, "We will sell the Motorola units aggressively in the future." IDO's subscribers now total about 300,000 for the NTT system and about 10,000 for the Motorola system, but manager Nomura expresses determination as he says, "We hope to bring market shares to a 50-50 point in two years." New marketers of the digital system are preparing to enter the foray. Two-Car Cellular Tokai of Nagoya city which is scheduled to start operation in July, established branches in Shizuoka and Hamamatsu cities at the end of March. It will also appoint more than 30 dealerships which will serve as the direct outlets to customers by the end of April. Tokai Digitalphone of Nagoya city plans to commence services in Shizuoka prefecture by the first part of the spring of next year, while positioning its Shizuoka branch to begin sales by June 1994. As of the end of 1993, about 49,000 cellular phones were in service in Shizuoka Prefecture. Market penetration stood at 1.3 percent, which was 0.3 percent lower than the national average. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications estimates that the units installed will increase sixfold by 2002, which means that there is room for additional market participants. Late market entrants have received approval for lower initial installation rates than for NTT's digital rates and, as a result, optimistically look for initial year new subscriber market share of 33 percent in the case of Two-Car Cellular and 25 percent in the case of Digitalphone. According to the Shizuoka branch, IDO, whose market share is running at 30 percent, is determined to take the initiative in waging a successful sales campaign as sources say, "We hope to corral as many new subscribers as possible before the new competition comes on stream." The same source states, "Since entering April the number of potential customers visiting the sales offices have doubled to 50 a day," indicating a favorable market trend. According to the NTT Shizuoka branch, "Since March, 70 percent of the visitors to the sales offices have asked about cellular services. There has been a definite increase in the interest shown for cellular phones. According to IDO sources, "Customers that appear at sales offices also have catalogues from other vendors." It appears that users are being careful in their evaluation of services available. Sales of cellular units are not expected to take off until after summer, because it is difficult to predict just how much prices will be falling in the near future.
