Addressing a National Party gathering in Johannesburg's southern suburbs last night, Mr. Botha said the ANC [African National Congress] was so busy with its internal political work that it was forgetting about the world. He said a new government could not afford to have large budget deficits or loans that the economy could not carry. [Begin Botha recording] Not only South Africans possess holiday homes. A vast number of overseas investors possess holiday homes. A vast numbner of people from abroad have farms in this country. They have invested in this country. Business corporations, business companies from all over Europe and from America have game farms, they have holiday homes, and the government that touches those rights will get into trouble with the governments of those citizens whose rights are in this way affected, and tax everybody out of existence. [end recording] Mr. Botha went on to say that the ANC was to blame for the problems experienced within the peacekeeping force. [Begin Botha recording, in Afrikaans] That is the kind of thing you get with the aggressive insistence of the ANC to get its way over us. Let the ANC have its way, and the whole defense force will end up like that peacekeeping force. [end recording]
