A total of 1,318 days of the tyrannical blockade imposed on the Iraqi people has passed, pulling away the masks and exposing the real faces behind them. The roles of many of the "minor forces" have been exposed. These forces have colluded with the "major powers" and have dropped the world into a maelstrom of bribery, corruption, intrigue, sabotage, and premeditated murder, thus turning the days since 6 August 1990 to this day into phases soaked with the blood of the Iraqi people and with their steadfastness in the face of an unjust blockade. This blockade has blackened the history of all those who claim to be civilized and humane and who preach justice and the right of peoples to live honorably and peacefully. Since the enemies imposed their tyrannical blockade, the Iraqi people have become accustomed to the "farcical review" that takes place whenever the Security Council holds its "sessions" to debate lifting the blockade imposed on their country and to examine the provisions of the unjust resolutions. In these sessions, the U.S. and British representatives alternate roles ordinarily, and the other members tag behind, one time with threats and another with inducements. The same "cliche" that is announced by the Security Council every two months is proclaimed anew, namely that Iraq defies Security Council resolutions and international consensus and is determined not to carry out its obligations! What follows is a resolution to carry on with the blockade imposed on Iraq. As for the Iraqi people's hardship: the sick who seek drugs and children whom death snatches by the thousands because they cannot find milk, medicine, or food to keep the ghost of death away; as for the "unjust" resolutions that Iraq has implemented; as for the facilities Iraq has offered, and the cooperation Iraq has shown to all UN committees, including the "inspection teams"--cooperation shown despite the "arrogance" and the "disdain" displayed by many of these teams, which are often supported by CIA officers, such as U.S. Intelligence Officer David Kay, Karen Jansen, the woman who initiated the Department of Agriculture crisis, her colleague, Mark Silver, and others--as for all this, it has no place in the Security Council's calculations, thanks to the power of the Americans and the British who run this council and who do not see any ethical or legal motive to lift the blockade against Iraq. What is Iraq required to do in order to persuade the Security Council to lift the blockade? The answer demands more than a pause to recall numerous junctures of the course of Iraq's relations with the Security Council and to underline the goals of the 30-state aggression against Iraq and the ability of the Iraqi people to stand fast and firm in their national battle. To begin, one must say that U.S. domination of the UN Security Council is the seat of the malady. This council, which came into existence initially to be the refuge for every needy and the supporter of every oppressed, has turned with time into a mere caretaker of the U.S., Zionist, and imperialist interests. This council waits for its resolutions to come from the U.S. Department of State because it is an agency that follows this department loyally. When the aggression against Iraq started with the ill-reputed blockade Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990, the Security Council was declaring very explicitly and openly its full alignment with the U.S.-Zionist scheme to strike Iraq, to kill its people, and to destroy all that the Iraqi people had accomplished economically, politically, and scientifically. Perhaps what happened during the military aggression against Iraq is the best proof of the ugly exploitation of the Security Council which issued the official resolution authorizing the aggression states to use all the means of death, devastation, and destruction invented by their sick minds to damage gravely 84 percent of Iraq's infrastructure with 88.5 million kg of explosives dumped on Iraq during 1,008 hours of uninterrupted military aggression. Their main goal was to destroy whatever pertains to life on Iraq's soil. What Do They Want? Again, we return to the question: what do the Americans want of Iraq and what does the Security Council want in order to lift the blockade? The facts assert that the United States has used the Security Council to implement its evil schemes from the time the blockade was imposed and throughout the subsequent phases of aggression that followed, and up to this day. Perhaps, a review of some of what happened between the council and Iraq will clarify the premeditated schemes against Iraq. At the outset, they said that Iraq had to implement Resolution 687 on the destruction of weapons and that the Security Council would then implement what is required of it, as shown by paragraph 22 of the said resolution which calls for lifting the blockade against the Iraqi people as soon as it is determined that Iraq has implemented the other paragraphs of the resolution. Ambassador Rolf Ekeus came repeatedly to Iraq (as an envoy of the UN secretary general and as chairman of the special committee) to supervise personally Iraq's implementation of this resolution. He acknowledged repeatedly in July 1993 Iraq's implementation of 95 percent of the resolution. Ekeus also asserted through the committees he supervises that Iraq is free of plants that produce "chemical weapons" and that it has no capability to produce "biological weapons." But what was happening at the Security Council? The council was listening to none of this. In every meeting it held (every two months) to debate lifting the blockade against Iraq, it extended the blockade, alleging that Iraq had not adhered to the resolution. When they found that clinging to the same cliche became laughable, they said that Iraq had to implement Resolution 715 on future inspection and followup. To create tension, last July they sent an inspection team led by U.S. Intelligence Officer Mark Silver who sealed with red wax two Iraqi plants that produce missiles within the permitted range. They then proceeded to allege that Iraq rejects future observation. At this point, the enemies' preparation to launch a new aggression against Iraq had been completed. So, Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf notified the Security Council through a documented letter that Iraq does not reject the principle of future inspection in accordance with Resolution 687 but that it awaits the Council's acknowledgment of its rights that are stipulated in the same resolution, in paragraph 22 specifically. These rights are supposed to lead to lifting the blockade against Iraq when it implements the provisions of this resolution, and Iraq has done so. Ekeus returned to Iraq to "contain the crisis" they fabricated. He made statements in Baghdad before Arab and foreign media, asserting his full conviction that Iraq had adhered to Resolution 687 and saying that he would submit a report to that effect to the Security Council so it would consider lifting the blockade. But barely had Ekeus arrived in Bahrain when he made statements contradicting what he had said in Baghdad. So, the Security Council continued to reiterate the same phrases about Iraq's failure to adhere to its resolutions, thus supporting statements made by U.S. and British officials (Clinton, Christopher, John Major, Douglas Hurd, and others). Fallen Goals Meanwhile, Iraqi diplomacy moved along more than one axis to explain the true nature of the matter and to expose the Security Council's false allegations and its procrastination in implementing what is required of it, considering that Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz went again to the United Nations and explained in a detailed and precise manner all that could possibly reflect the true picture of the situation. "Specialized technical" Iraqi delegations did the same. Thus, it was time to compel the Security Council to welcome Iraq's approval of the resolution on future observation. Ekeus came to Iraq again and said afterward: we have discussed everything and nothing noteworthy is left. So, what should the Security Council have done? Is it not its duty to issue a resolution lifting the blockade? What is the U.S. and British goal behind the continued fabrication of crises between Iraq and the United Nations, and what is the objective of their subsequent threat (and then execution of the threat) to make their evil alliance strike Iraq again (which it did in two repeat aggressions)? The answer can be concluded by defining the U.S.-Zionist objectives behind the 30-state aggression against Iraq: First, the aggression sought to tell Iraq, and through it the Arab nation and all peoples aspiring for the independence of their political and economic decisionmaking, that the U.S.-Zionist-Western alliance is an alliance that possesses enough power to deter whoever tries to deviate from this alliance's policies and to stray from serving the "U.S.-Zionist-Western" interests, which according to their allegation guarantee world stability. These allegations have been proved false beyond the shadow of a doubt, especially since the aggression against Iraq and the subsequent U.S. unilateral control of the world. This aggression has been followed by the Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia issues, by the U.S.-drafted Gaza-Jericho accords, and by the subsequent procrastination in acknowledging the Palestinian people's rights. Second, the U.S. political ruse has been exposed. The Western media has tried to promote this ruse, which is embodied in the attempt to incite the Iraqi people against their national leadership and to separate the Iraqi leadership from its people during the "direct" military aggression, during the phase of treason and treachery, and during the continued blockade. Whoever acquaints himself with the dimensions of the destruction that has hit the Iraqi people's homes and factories and all their cultural and scientific accomplishments realizes without any doubt that the Iraqi people are the target of all phases of the aggression. Third, the Iraqi people's realization that the blockade will not be lifted by a resolution as long as the objectives of the aggression remain unaccomplished has driven the enemies to "employ their malice in all kinds of ways." From time to time, they have confronted the world with new demands not mentioned in Security Council resolutions. When they encounter an Iraq standing fast in their faces, they begin to reiteterte, "Iraq wants to test our resolve. It is still far from implementing the Security Council resolutions." But the world has realized that these allegations are false and illegitimate. What Iraq has not agreed to is to be divided into three parts, which is what the enemies want to do with central and southern Iraq now that circumstances have helped them spread their control over northern Iraq, where this control can never last. What Iraq has not agreed to are the ill-reputed latitudes and longitudes, and Iraq has the right to defend its soil and to protect its borders. As our Leader President Saddam Husayn said in his historic speech on occasion of the 73d anniversary of our valiant army, the main reason that will lead to ending the blockade is that the "deluded who are embroiled in treason and whose eyes have been blinded by transgression imagine that lifting the blockade against Iraq is a malicious political game or a lowly diplomatic act which can be obstructed with bribery and with the illicit spending of money. These people do not realize that the main reason that will lead to ending the blockade is the Iraqi people's steadfastness, their firm belief in their principles and rights, their adherence to honor and virtue, and their loyalty to their noble national, pan-Arab, and human goals." They Are Aware of Their Frustration In an endeavor to discover the secret behind Iraq's steadfastness and behind the failure of the objectives of the aggression, the U.S. Department of Defense assigned Patrick Clawson [name as transliterated], a strategic researcher, to study the effects of the economic blockade on Iraq. Clawson's conclusion was that Iraq has succeeded in achieving some sort of economic stability without giving up its national pride. In an endeavor to answer the question of how Iraq has been able to accomplish this, Paul Lewis, a well-known U.S. journalist, said in an article published in the NEW YORK [reference not verified] some time ago that it is the Iraqi genius that has culminated not only in digging a 565-km river but also in rebuilding all that was destroyed and adding new structures and projects and, moreover, in Iraq's ability to provide a security net for every Iraqi family by distributing a reasonable amount of foodstuffs that meet survival needs. Is it reasonable that the international community should continue to deal with a deep-rooted people such as the Iraqi people in the poor manner the U.S. administration wants to perpetuate? The facts concluded from the actual developments that have occurred from since the military aggression was launched against Iraq to this day; our leadership's awareness of dimensions of the ceaseless battle against the enemies; and this leadership's constant educating of the people with what the various phases of the aggression entail have strengthened the calm Iraqi logic, turning it into a clear method which deals with the facts most precisely and in a manner that serves Iraq's steadfastness. All this has made the world realize that Iraq can never be a meaningless figure. The legal justifications for a continued blockade against Iraq have fallen. Here is France, which took part in the alliance of aggression against Iraq, affirming these days through a number of its officials, including Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, that Iraq has made great progress in implementing UN resolutions. At the same time, French political and information circles assert that France, along with a number of Security Council members (China, Russia), does not want the United Nations to invent new obstacles every time Iraq surpasses an old obstacle. Numerous diplomats accuse the White House of promoting these actions, which will inevitably encourage French and European leaders to look for new horizons through which to approach Iraq and its national issues, dealing with it at least from the perspective of their national interests, which have been harmed greatly by the blockade and the continued aggression against Iraq. Blockade Will Not Last Now, with the Security Council scheduled to debate the continued blockade against Iraq in a couple of days, what more can we say? The truth is that even if U.S. policy manages to extend the blockade for another period, the ultimate outcome will confirm that the blockade has begun to narrow, to vanish, and to be destroyed, especially since the world has realized that Iraq has not stood idle throughout the past period of the unjust blockade, which had been planned to kill Iraq's people with starvation and disease, and since the world has also realized that Iraq can do a lot to confront any new imperialist step that adds another lock to the doors of the tyrannical blockade. The doors of hope are as open to the Iraqi people today as they have never been open in any of the 1,318 days of the blockade. Through their action against the aggression and the continued blockade, the Iraqi people can teach the enemies lesson after lesson in the battle to end the tyrannical blockade and to regain their distinguished role in life now that their country has remained united and strong despite all the means of treachery, aggression, and oppression used by the enemies against this country. The milk embargo against Iraq's children; the drug embargo against Iraq's patients, and the bread embargo against Iraq's citizens will not last. All those who prevent the Security Council from fulfilling its obligations to Iraq "will reap the results of their ridiculous and malicious positions," as Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz asserted a few days ago.
