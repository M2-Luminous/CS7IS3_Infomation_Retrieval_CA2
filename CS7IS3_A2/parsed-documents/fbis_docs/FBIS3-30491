We will now broadcast President Izetbegovic's comments on the next round of the peace talks scheduled for 10 February in Geneva, the opening of Tuzla Airport, and on the possibilities that UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] and the UNHCR might withdraw from Bosnia-Herzegovina. [Begin recording] [Izetbegovic] I am reluctant about going on the scheduled date. When they asked us whether we agree to the resumption of the talks on 10 February, I told David Owen that I most probably would not be attending these negotiations. Namely, I assessed at the time -- and I still do -- that this will be another futile attempt, a waste of time. Of course we have to take part. I am not sure whether we all have to go and waste time. I told them that Silajdzic would come with a delegation, fully authorized to negotiate. I might join in if I see there has been some progress and if Silajdzic informs me that things are going well. I have many responsibilities here, so does Silajdzic, but someone has to stay; I believe it is me. Silajdzic is younger, so he can keep up with the pace. The pace at the negotiations is terrible, indescribable. Sometimes one works for 13 to 15 hours without a break -- working, negotiating, haggling, and so on. The negotiations so far have shown that there has been very little progress. I reckon that no miracle will happen on 10 February, but on the other hand that is not ruled out. Now there is this four-part initiative from America, England, France, and Germany. It is expected that they could propose something new which would make a breakthrough at the negotiations possible. If that happens -- the details of the initiative have not yet been revealed -- I might decide to go, and the complete delegation will go to try to solve [word indistinct]. [passage omitted]
