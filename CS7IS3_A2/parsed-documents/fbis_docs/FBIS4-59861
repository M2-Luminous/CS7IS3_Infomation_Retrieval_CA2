In the interview Mubarak described the Muslim Brotherhood as "an illegal group supporting most of the terrorists' activities." Mubarak's statement provoked varying reactions on the Egyptian political scene. Counselor Ma'mun al-Hudaybi, spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood, has denied the existence of any link between the group and the extremists. He also denied that it supports violent and terrorist actions. He told AL-HAYAH that violent and terrorist actions have occurred over 25 years, and investigations have proved that the Muslim Brotherhood has no link with the extremist organizations whose members carried out these actions. He stressed that the Muslim Brotherhood "has never been implicated in supporting, inciting, or participating in actions violating the law. So it is strange for accusations to be leveled at it without any evidence." Al-Hudaybi added that "Interior Minister Major General Hasan al-Alfi, who is responsible for following up security conditions and pursuing those who violate the law, announced in a news conference about a month ago that the Muslim Brotherhood has nothing to do with any violence or any link with terrorist actions. And former Interior Minister 'Abd-al-Halim Musa said the same thing." On Mubarak's statement on conditions in Algeria, Al-Hudaybi said that "what happened in Algeria was not the result of aggression from the groups calling for reenforcing the Islamic Shari'ah. It was the result of a military coup against the will of the people, who had chosen the Islamists through free elections." On the national dialogue called for by Mubarak, Al-Hudaybi said: "We have no information about the dialogue issue. [Government] officials have announced openly that the Muslim Brotherhood will not participate in it. We do not believe it is a serious matter, as it was first mentioned eight months ago, and no measures have been taken so far to initiate it. If the government believed it was important, it would have taken steps to initiate it and ensured the participation of all the political forces on the Egyptian scene." He said that the dialogue "will produce no results." Al-Hudaybi said that the Muslim Brotherhood is subjected to security harassment, "and from time to time members of the group are arrested and interrogated in imaginary cases, even though our position on violence and terrorism is clear and declared."
