He stressed that the PLO will not accept Israel's interference in Palestinian internal affairs nor linking the meetings with the negotiations. In an exclusive interview with AL-NAHAR, al-Agha said that the meetings are continuing and will not be halted and that the two sides are keen on continuing them because they serve the supreme Palestinian interest. Al-Agha added that the aim of the meetings is to create a somewhat good relationship and ongoing coordination in order to overcome any problems and differences that arise between the two sides -- as a service to the Palestinian people. The Palestinian official cautioned the Israeli media, which are trying to split the Palestinian rank. He denied the existence of any agreement under which Fatah is to carry out political action and Hamas military action. Al-Agha stressed that Fatah's relationship with Hamas is a crucial Palestinian strategy that concerns every Palestinian. The two sides will defend this strategy with all their power. Al-Agha rejected Israeli threats against the PLO's cooperation with Hamas. He said that the PLO rejects any dictate from any party. Al-Agha also rejected Israel's attempt to link the continuation of the negotiations with putting an end to the meetings with Hamas. He said: This is blackmail that we reject and do not accept. No Palestinian will accept it. [passage omitted]
