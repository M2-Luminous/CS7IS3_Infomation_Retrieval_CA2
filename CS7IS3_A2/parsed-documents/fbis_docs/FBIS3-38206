The slammer is being built inside a prison here and will consist of 12 cells, each with a minimal floor space of seven square metres (74 square feet). Suspects will appear before the International Court on Crimes in the Former Yugoslavia, the court's president Antonio Cassese said. "The new cells should be handed over to us at the end of June," Cassese said, adding that a new international penal code would have to be drawn up to regulate the prison. Dutch police will be responsible for transferring the prisoners to and from the jail but, once inside, their security and that of the court's judges will fall to armed UN guards. Sentences handed down by the court will be served in the prisons of UN member states. France and Italy have already offered to take in some of those convicted. [passage omitted]
