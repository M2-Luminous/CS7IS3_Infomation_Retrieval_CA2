Currently in the discussion phase, a possible partnership in the satellite domain between Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace is stirring intense anxiety in the trade unions at the Aerospatiale plant in Cannes (Cote d'Azur). In an unusual gesture on 14 January, the inter-union issued a joint communique on the subject signed by FO [Workers Force], CFE/CGC, CGT [General Confederation of Labor], and CFDT [French Democratic Labor Confederation]. The Cannes inter-union--with the support, it claims, of unions at the other facilities in Mureaux and Aquitaine--"opposes the creation of a joint company" to integrate the space activities, especially the satellite activities, of Aerospatiale and Deutsche Aerospace; it also opposes what it terms "subsidiarization of the Cannes facility." The unions believe such a move would be "the first step towards loss of human, technological, and material patrimony" along with "loss of Aerospatiale Group's identity." They add that such a partnership would lead to "abandonment of our national independence in the sensitive sector of military intelligence satellites." In support of its position--and it threatens to call a strike eventually, "if the views of organized labor groups are not taken into account"--the Cannes inter-union published what it said would be the "financial structure" of the joint satellite subsidiary. Emphasizing that Aerospatiale would control "less than 50 percent" of the company while DASA would control "more than 50 percent." It also claimed Aerospatiale and DASA have parallel plans for cooperation on missiles, in the framework of another schema that is identical but for the fact that in this case the French group would have a controlling share. Sources at Aerospatiale headquarters say the satellite partnership "is still only in the early stages of discussion; formal negotiations have not even begun." According to the spokesman for the French group, "no apportionment (of shares in the partnership) has yet been proposed, because the scope of activities is still being evaluated" with respect to the satellite partnership. On the other hand, Aerospatiale management acknowledges that the missile partnership is "further advanced" and even "approaching closure." Not that any announcement is expected in the very near future! Louis Gallois, Aerospatiale's CEO, said in early January there were "two sets of discussions under way with DASA, one on space and another on missiles," with the objective of establishing "a balanced structure in which neither side would swallow the other"---a structure which he said might be based "on the Eurocopter model." As for when it might all come to pass, he "hoped" (but that is all) for 1994! But Gallois's problem is how to create a "balanced" dual partnership with Deutsche Aerospace when Aerospatiale is in a much better industrial position than its German partner, especially in satellites. So one can begin to appreciate the anxiety felt at Cannes by the unions--and workers--knowing the facility currently has a "full order-book." And should continue to have one, even after delivering the four Eutelsat and Turksat satellites that Ariane is supposed to launch in 1994. Broadly speaking, Aerospatiale's Space and Defense division is in relatively good shape. Michel Delaye, head of the division, told us recently that with manpower cut back to 4,725 (from 5,600), the division last year produced Fr8 billion in sales and Fr9 billion in orders, with satellites alone responsible for Fr3.2 billion of orders and Fr2.4 billion of sales, almost double the volumes for 1992!
