[passage omitted] In other developments Friday, Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic hailed an agreement signed Tuesday between Belgrade and Zagreb to normalize their relations, saying it could be a turning point in the peace process. Speaking after returning from Geneva, he said that the agreement "could serve as a solid base for re-establishing peace." "We are ready to take part in a peace process on a new basis of mutual recognition of former Yugoslav republics which have already been internationally recognized," he said. In Bosnia itself the situation was calm on most fronts for a second successive day, according to officials. UN Protection Force spokesman Bill Aikman said Thursday had been the calmest day for months. However Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said that Bosnian Moslems were preparing to attack Serb positions across Bosnia-Herzegovina. He made the comments in a letter to Greek officials who had invited him to Athens Friday. He cancelled the trip at the last minute because of what he called the "new difficulties." "A vast Moslem attack on all our positions is being prepared... I must work at the same time for peace and work to defend my country," he said, excusing himself from the Athens trip.
