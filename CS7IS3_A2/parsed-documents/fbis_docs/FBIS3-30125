The outline, which has served as Japan's basic defense policy since 1976, calls for the government to maintain security arrangements against large-scale attacks and also to build up Japan's own defense capabilities to repel limited-scale invasions. Aichi told a news conference that the panel will review the outline in line with the debates of a similar advisory panel to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, which will hold an inaugural session on Monday. Aichi said, "We must review the outline from both the medium- and long-term points of view." The Defense Agency panel, chaired by Aichi, comprises parliamentary Vice Defense Minister Natsuo Yamaguchi, Vice Defense Minister Shigeru Hatakeyama, four top uniformed officers and two administrative officials, officials said. Hosokawa's nine-member group will discuss ways to adapt to the changed international situation following the end of the Cold War. Since his inauguration in August last year, Hosokawa has advocated that with the Cold War now ended, Japan should trim the size of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) and review the outline.
