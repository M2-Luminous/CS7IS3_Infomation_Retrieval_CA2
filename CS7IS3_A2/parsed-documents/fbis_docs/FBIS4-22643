Budnitskiy, sector director of the RF Economics Ministry's Council on Productive Forces: "Russia, Do You Know This Itch?: What We Have, We Don't Hold on To"] [Text] More and more oil, natural gas, copper, and nickel are being exported to the West from Russia for next to nothing. The income is coming to rest in foreign banks. Who is going to put a halt to this economic self-exhaustion? And how? According to the author of this article, we must restore legislatively the state monopoly on the mineral trade--if only for 10 years or so. Reform of the Russian economy started out to the slogan about the need for structural perestroyka. What is its intermediate result? In 1993, the raw materials component of Russian exports to the far abroad rose to 86 percent, whereas in 1990 the proportion of raw materials in exports was a little more than 60 percent. This means that structural perestroyka still has a strongly expressed negative significance. The increase in the export of raw materials from Russia is proceeding at the expense of domestic consumption. Domestic consumption of oil over the last three years has declined by 40 percent, and of natural gas by 22 percent; nonetheless, official export (not counting contraband export) of these products for this period increased by 4 and 20 percent, respectively. An analogous situation is taking shape with metals, cellulose, ammonia, mineral fertilizers, and so on. Export from Russia is going to grow. The increased cost of imports will tend to limit the number of solvent purchasers and, consequently, to cut the volume of imports themselves. If these processes are not halted, the physical volumes of raw materials exports will grow--to the point of completely exhausting our reserves of the types of raw materials, semi-manufactured items, and metals being exported. In addition, we are seeing a relative increase in the cost of capital stock in devalued hard currency and a decline in the price for manpower. The foundations for any possible industrial development will be undermined in that part and the private sector. Russia has been in a similar situation before, during the NEP (New Economic Policy), when private entrepreneurship was choked out precisely due to a lack of raw materials. In those years, up to 80 percent of the raw material resources were exported from Russia. Liberalization of foreign economic activity led to the majority of enterprises in the mining complex, independently or through the SP [joint enterprises], MP [small enterprises], and so on, entering the foreign market. The foreign economic turnover of these enterprises is subject to virtually no accounting. According to various data, export of hard currency received primarily from the sale of nonrenewable resources and primary output from them totaled $40-45 billion over the last two years. The scale of sanctioned and contraband export of raw materials resources is leading to a sharp decline in prices for many types of raw materials resources. Prices for copper, nickel, and aluminum on the London metals market have fallen in 1993 in comparison with 1990 by 22, 42, and 31 percent, respectively. Most worrisome, however, is this: the normal work of the oil and gas, metallurgical, fuel and energy complexes, and chemical and lumber processing industry--the main suppliers of hard currency to the Russian Federation (RF)--depend to a significant extent on imported equipment and spare parts for that equipment. Due to the "price scissors" (low prices for raw materials and high prices for equipment), the quantity of raw materials being exported is growing steadily. The increase in the cost of imported equipment is simply frightening. If in the years 1976-80 equipment worth $12 billion was bought for the Russian raw materials complex, and in the years 1981-85 about $20 billion, then in the last 5-7 years, according to specialists' calculations, about $100 billion was needed. Actually, the export of raw materials from Russia was also practiced immediately after the conclusion of the civil war. In the years 1933-34 (at the end of the Depression in the West), this process reached maximum proportions. Only in 1936 did a decisive decline in raw materials export begin. For approximately 10-12 years after the end of World War II, raw materials were virtually not exported abroad from the USSR at all. This specifically may have been one of the reasons for the complete restoration of the USSR's industrial potential by 1954, something the majority of Western analysts thought would take Russia at least 30 years. An equally alarming situation is taking shape in what is for Russia a new economic process--the sale of the rights to prospect for and work mineral deposits, or simply--the sale of our depths. At the present time, it is in the raw materials sector of the Russian economy that elevated investor activity has been noted. However, Russian interests are virtually not considered at all in raw materials plans, which envisage taking abroad the raw materials and the profit received from their sale. Reinvestment of the profit into Russia's economy is not being considered at all in these plans. The absence of an elaborated mechanism for holding competitions for the right to prospect and work Russian mineral deposits leads to incompetent, frequently only recently organized companies that are interested not in exploiting the deposit but in the resale of the licenses to work them receiving licenses. The loss of state control over utilization of the mineral and raw materials base and over reliable resource provision for the country is becoming very real. This could lead to the total collapse of Russia's economy and, as a consequence, to the loss of the state's economic and political independence. Russian legislation on regulating mineral use is limited essentially to the RF Law "On Mineral Wealth" and a series of resolutions by the Supreme Soviet. In the United States, on the other hand, a country with developed market relations, the number of laws actually reinforcing the state's priorities in the use of the national raw materials base is almost 10. I will list only a few of them: the law on national policy in the sphere of materials and minerals; the Mining Code; the law on strategic resources. . . . The Bureau of Mines, which is part of the Department of the Interior, takes care of the planning ("marketers," who shudder at the mention of this word, should forgive me) for prospecting and for opening up national mineral and raw materials resources in the United States. Within the framework of forming and implementing RF raw materials policy, the state must be secured by law the priority right to dispose of mineral wealth. In all joint and wholly foreign plans for opening up Russian mineral wealth, the portion of the raw materials and profit that is going to be taken out of Russia must be carefully discussed in order to allow us to determine the volumes of funds for reinvestment into Russia's economy. In prerevolutionary Russia, foreign entrepreneurs were allowed to take out a little more than 12 percent of the raw materials they mined or the profit received from their sale. Naturally, no one could take the remainder of the profit away from them: legislation proposed that they use this capital for the development of the Russian economy. And they agreed to this. Many even took Russian citizenship. In order to avoid mistakes in taking decisions on large-scale raw materials projects, it is essential, first of all, to determine how the exploitation of a given natural deposit corresponds to Russia's long-term financial, social, raw materials, and other interests. This has to be done on the basis of a study of the current state of affairs in the market, taking into consideration the Russia's changing requirements for a given type of raw material and their reserves. Secondly, to assess the geopolitical aspect, taking into account the influence of the working of a specific deposit on the world production of any resource now and in the future. When these issues are decided, a group of deposits will be determined whose exploitation will not substantially affect Russia's domestic and geopolitical interests. This group can be put up for auction. But in such a way that Russia set its own conditions, and the companies compete in offering the conditions most advantageous to us. The most decisive step must be taken in the sphere of foreign trade. The state monopoly on foreign trade in mineral raw materials must be restored legislatively for a minimum of 10 yeas. The need for this step can be explained by the fact that in the current situation only a state monopoly will permit the halting of what is essentially the contraband export of capital from the country on a scale that is at the very least humiliating for a great country. I think that our raw materials giants have to realize the complexity of the situation and reconcile themselves to the necessity for a state monopoly on foreign trade in raw materials. Otherwise, in the event of Russia's loss of economic and political independence, these joint-stock companies, concerns, and so on will be transformed, in the best case, into branches of Shell, BHP, and others of that ilk. One of the main lines of use for this money, undoubtedly, is conversion. Not "landslide" conversion, like now, but sensible conversion. A gradual decrease in the volume of equipment imported for the raw materials complex, to be compensated for by the production of it in enterprises of the military-industrial complex, will make it possible to decrease the share of mineral-raw material and fuel-energy components in the structure of Russian exports. The prerequisites for the development of a progressive structure for the RF economy will appear. State raw materials policy must become (and one would like to believe necessarily will become) the basis for real structural perestroyka.
