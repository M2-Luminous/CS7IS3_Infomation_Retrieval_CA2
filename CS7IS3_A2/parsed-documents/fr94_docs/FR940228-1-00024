FR940228-1-00024 FR940228-1-00003 Shielded position means the location within the radiographic exposure device or source changer where the sealed source is secured and restricted from movement. (In this position the radiation exposure will be at a minimum. This position incorporates maximum shielding for the radioactive source.) Sievert means the SI unit of any of the quantities expressed as dose equivalent. The absorbed dose in grays multiplied by the quality factor is equal to the dose equivalent in Sieverts. For comparison 1 Sv=100 rems. Source assembly means an assembly that consists of the sealed source and a connector that attaches the source to the control cable. The source assembly may also include a stop ball used to secure the source in the shielded position. Source changer means a device designed and used for replacement of sealed sources in radiographic exposure devices, including those also used for transporting and storage of sealed sources. Storage area means any location, facility, or vehicle which is used to store or to secure a radiographic exposure device, a storage container, or a sealed source when it is not in use and which is locked or has a physical barrier to prevent accidental exposure, tampering with, or unauthorized removal of the device, container, or source. Storage container means a device in which sealed sources are stored. Temporary jobsite means a place where radiographic operations are conducted other than the location(s) of use authorized on the license. §34.4 [Removed] 7. Section 34.4 is removed. 8.
