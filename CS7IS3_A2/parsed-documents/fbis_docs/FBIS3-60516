[Perez] Currently, we have 979 patients who are seropositive to the Human Immunodificiency Virus [HIV] in Cuba; of these, 71 percent are males, and 29 percent females. Of this group of patients, 230 have developed Acquired Immunodificiency Syndrome [AIDS] since 1986; of these 230 patients, 144 have died. [Cavada] We have been told, and other sources we have consulted have told us, that there are only slightly over 80 patients in Cuba right now. [Perez] Yes. If you subtract the 145 deaths from the 230 AIDS cases, the result is exactly 83 patients. That is the number alive today. In Cuba, the number of HIV infections to date is 85. The main goal of the Cuban program is to identify people before they become ill. This is in contrast with other programs in the world that identify seropositive individuals after they have already become ill or when they go to the hospital, or by chance. The goal of the Cuban program is to detect seropositive cases as early as possible as to give counseling and also do preventive work so that this disease does not spread. This is the reason our figures are much smaller than those of other countries. We never have had an unchecked geometric growth of this infection. We have had a small mathematical growth in the number of seropositive cases since 1987. In 1986 we detected a number of cases accumulated from prior years.
