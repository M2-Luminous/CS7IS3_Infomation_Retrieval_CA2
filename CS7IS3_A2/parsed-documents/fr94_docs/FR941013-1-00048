FR941013-1-00048 FR941013-1-00006 In recent years, the Congress notes that the Indian arts and crafts market, with several hundred million dollars in annual sales, was expanding and experiencing a greater frequency of fraudulent sales. The Congress requested a special report from the Department of Commerce, which in 1985 determined that significant losses were incurred by the domestic Indian arts and crafts market due to unmarked imported imitations. As a result, the Congress included in the 1988 Omnibus Trade Bill, Pub. L. 100&hyph;418, a direction to the Customs Service to address the issue of misrepresentation. This led to the promulgation of regulations to require permanent country-of-origin marking on imported Indian-style jewelry and other arts and crafts products. Thereafter, the Congress shifted its attention to problems originating in the domestic market and passed Pub. L. 101&hyph;644, the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 is essentially a truth-in-advertising law designed to prevent products from being marketed as ``Indian made,'' when the products are not, in fact, made by Indians as defined in the Act. Because of the truth-in-advertising nature of the Act, the drafters of the proposed regulations have tried not to restrict truthful statements that might be made in marketing a product. In respect of tribal sovereignty, the drafters do not require uniform criteria or procedures or documentation forms for tribal certification of individuals as Indian artisans, although such uniformity would be a great convenience to businesses and consumers in the market. Section-by-Section Analysis Section 309.1 This section outlines the purpose of the regulations. Section 309.2 This section defines terms used throughout the regulations. The definition of ``Indian product'' is central to these regulations. It explicitly includes handcrafts because the core of the market consists of such products, and the term ``handcraft'' carries substantial economic value when attached to a product. It excludes products made before 1935 because, in passing the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990, the Congress was concerned with fraudulent sales in the contemporary market. The Indian Arts and Crafts Board's mission as an agency is to promote the development of the contemporary market. The 1935 cutoff date was chosen because that was the founding year of the Indian Arts and Crafts Board, and the Act is an amendment to the Board's organic act. Definitions of ``Indian,'' ``Indian arts and crafts organization,'' and ``Indian tribe'' are provided in the statute. A current list of Federally-recognized Indian tribes was published in the Federal Register on October 21, 1993 (58 FR 54364), by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department of the Interior. The Department of the Interior does not maintain a list of state recognized tribes that qualify under subsection (b)(2). Section 309.3 Subsection (a) of this section is particularly important because it states how the unmodified use of the word ``Indian'' or the unmodified name of an Indian tribe will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board as a representation of an Indian product for enforcement purposes. The Act specifically addresses the situation of people of various degrees of Indian ancestry who are active in the art market, but are not members of tribes for whatever reason. The Congress provided in the Act that tribes could decide to certify such people as Indian artisans. There may be instances in which a person is not a member of a tribe and has not been certified as an Indian artisan, but nonetheless is of Indian ancestry. A different identification issue arises among people who make products that may appear Indian-made, or may be intentionally styled after Indian products, but who have no intention of misrepresenting them as Indian-made. The regulations need to identify a reasonable boundary between marketing statements that are simply truthful, and should be permitted, and statements that are clearly misleading, and should be prohibited. Comments are especially encouraged about what is reasonable and how best to establish a boundary. As proposed, the regulations provide that the unmodified use of the word ``Indian'' or of the name of a tribe in connection with a product would necessarily be misleading if the maker was not a member or certified artisan of a tribe. Foreign products have been a major concern of the Congress, and the fundamental purpose of the Act is to protect Indians, as defined, who are resident in the United States. Subsection (b) clarifies how certain marketing conduct related to products of Indians of foreign tribes will be construed by the Indian Arts and Crafts Board for enforcement purposes. Section 309.4 This section states the statutory prohibition against a tribe imposing a fee for certifying an Indian artisan. Section 309.5 This section states where the statutory criminal and civil penalties for violations may be found. Section 309.6 This section provides the address where complaints about alleged violations of the Act may be submitted.
