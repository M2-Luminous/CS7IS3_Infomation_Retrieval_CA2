During this session, both the president and the Majles speaker spoke about the views and stances of the cabinet and the Majles on the most important political, economic, and social problems. The remarks by the heads of the executive and legislative branches focused on efforts to ensure the public welfare by compiling and executing laws, in accordance with the line of the founder of the Islamic Republic and the esteemed leader. These two points, which were jointly stressed by the president and the Majles speaker, speak of the common objectives of the executive and legislative branches in the Islamic Republic. In view of these common objectives, which pave the way for understanding between the Majles deputies and the cabinet members, contacts between the members of the two branches can help bring their views on the implementation of plans closer. With these contacts, which allow the exchange of expert views between the Majles deputies and the cabinet members, and more careful help in listing priorities in the compilation and implementation of programs, the approval and implementation of laws are further accelerated. Under the present conditions when discussions on the Second Five-Year Plan are under way and when the cabinet and the Majles have the approval of the 1373 [year beginning 21 March 1994] state budget in front of them, the joint session of the executive and legislative branches is of significance. With the exchange of views between the Majles and the cabinet, modes of implementing the Second Plan as well as the 1373 budget bill will be further clarified, and the two branches can--in view of existing potential--compile a more applicable program that can overcome existing problems and fulfill the objectives of public welfare.
