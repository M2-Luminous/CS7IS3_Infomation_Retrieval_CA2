Chi Haotian said: China attaches importance to its relations with the United States and hopes that the spirit of the Sino-U.S. summit in Seattle will be carried forward. It is not strange that differences exist between the two countries. So long as both sides adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit and of respecting each other, Sino-U.S. relations will certainly be improved and developed. The development of friendly and cooperative relations between China and the United States is not only beneficial to both sides but is also beneficial to stability in the Asia- Pacific region. Turning to China's military strategy, Chi Haotian said: China's armed forces are defensive in nature, serving economic development. China poses no threat to any country. Brzezinski spoke highly of China's achievements in economic development, believing China is an important factor for stability in the world. He said current difficulties between the United States and China are transitional in nature, that the strategic interests of the two countries are long-term ones, and that the American people's friendship for the Chinese people is sincere. He expressed the hope that China and the United States will continue to work hard to stabilize and develop bilateral relations. He said he is optimistic about the prospects of Sino-U.S. relations. The U.S. guests came at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs.
