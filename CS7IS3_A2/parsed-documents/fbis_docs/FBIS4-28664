"President Kono is the LDP's best candidate," said Koichi Kato, an ex-chief cabinet secretary of a now-deposed LDP government, at a news conference. "But it is impossible for the LDP to form a government by itself and we need to put together a coalition," he said. "We should therefore seriously weigh the possibility of installing someone from non-LDP forces (as the next premier)." Kato, who heads a policy study group within the LDP dubbed, "Group New Century," is a known archrival of Kono and has been a staunch critic of the current LDP leadership. Describing the current administration of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata as a weak regime that cannot win trust domestically or internationally, the vocal lawmaker said the LDP should map out a clear-cut strategy for creating a new, stable government and demand Hata's resignation. To fashion a fresh government with the participation of broader political forces, the LDP, ousted from power last summer for the first time in 38 years, needs to discuss with other major political parties whether they can govern together, Kato said. But he took a dim view of the LDP's tie-up with Shinseito unless Ichiro Ozawa, the ruling coalition's back room deal maker, gives up the idea of running politics from behind the scenes.
