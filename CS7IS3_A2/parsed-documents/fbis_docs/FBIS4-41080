He has advocated the creation of the republic's own peacemaking units, so as to have the possibility of participating in the settlement of conflicts in neighboring regions. He proposes to form battalions of "blue helmets" on the basis of the National Guard and the recently disbanded military police. At the same time Kitovani ignored the question of where it is proposed to find the funds to maintain them.
