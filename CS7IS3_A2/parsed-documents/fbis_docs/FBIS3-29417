The announcement was made Friday [11 February] afternoon to the daily, THE MORNING TIMES, by a relative of MNLF Commander Abdulnasir Samputu Kahalum. The chief of the Marine Forces in southern Philippines, Brigadier General Guillermo Ruiz, belittled Kahalum's claim that he led the ambush. He said that, as far as the military is concerned, all the attackers were "plain criminals, not MNLF rebels." "We have never had a lost command in our area; all our men are MNLF regulars," the man said. He said the MNLF attackers in Tuburan still have the firearms, uniforms, boots and other belongings they took from the slain Marines and militiamen. "If General Ruiz says Commander Kahalum did not lead the ambush, how come Kahalum has the Marines' things?" the informant said. Ruiz earlier belittled the claim of Kahalum that his group was responsible for the massacre of the 21 Marine soldiers and four militiamen at Sitio [village district] Badunggan, Barangay [village] Candiis, Tuburan. Ruiz, who now heads the government panel in the joint cease fire committee with the MNLF, said he did not want to drag the name of the MNLF into the incident. "In so far as we in the armed forces are concerned, the attackers are all criminal elements, whatever group they belong to, whatever creed they profess to, whatever sect or religion, they are criminal elements and we have to run after them," he said. The general's reaction came after Kahalum, in an interview with radio station DXLL, confessed that he led Moro fighters in last year's massacre. Kahalum said they ambushed the Marines in "self-defense." He said the Marines were guided by six volunteers of the Civilian Home Defense Force and were poised to attack their camp at Badunggan. "We had no choice but to defend our camp and prove to the Marines that we could resist them," Kahalum told broadcaster Jose Mari Bue. Kahalum made the confession in order to clear the names of Tuburan Vice Mayor Rajid Sahabat and Tuburan Councilor Alih Sulaiman, who have been implicated in the ambush. He said his purpose was also to let the truth come out. Sahabat has been hiding since the court issued a warrant for his arrest, saying he could not pay the P450,000 [Philippine pesos] bail. The 31-year-old Sahabat, who has sought refuge with the MNLF regulars, said he will turn himself in to the authorities as soon as he has money for bail. Sahabat said he wanted to surrender even if he had to go to jail but was afraid of what the Marines might do to him. "I want to go back to my work as vice mayor and to prove in court that I'm innocent," he said. Councilor Sulaiman said their being implicated in the ambush was politically motivated.
