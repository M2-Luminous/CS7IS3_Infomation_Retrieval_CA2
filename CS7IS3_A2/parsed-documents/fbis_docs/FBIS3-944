However, the homeland military forces "should no longer remain intact." "Since independence, the record of these armed formations has been blighted by the incidence of intervention and instability." Mills says the homeland armies should be disbanded as "distinct ethnic units," and instead, the emphasis "should be placed on regimental and not political or ethnic allegiances." BUSINESS DAY De Klerk `Shied' Away From AWB -- "It is time to halt the AWB's [Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging; Afrikaner Resistance Movement] paramilitary posturing and to end its delusions of martial grandeur," declares a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 16 March. "The Bophuthatswana excursion should have convinced government or the Transitional Executive Council that the AWB's activities must be stopped. That does not mean banning it. Like any other organisation, it is entitled to meet and propagate unpopular views -- but as civilians." "Despite the challenge at the World Trade Centre, despite confrontations which have cost lives in Ventersdorp and now Mmabatho, President F.W. de Klerk has shied away from dealing with this fascist force. The next government will not be so timid, but the time to pull the AWB's claws is now." SOWETAN `Expedience' in AWB, CP Link With Black Groups -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 16 March in a page-10 editorial believes "there is enough evidence to show that many Afrikaners do not support the hysteria evinced by the factions under Eugene Terreblanche [AWB leader] and Ferdi Hartzenberg [leader of the Conservative Party]. What makes their so-called link with black conservative groups odious, is that it is based more on expedience and opportunism in the fight against the ANC and its allies than coalescence of conviction."
