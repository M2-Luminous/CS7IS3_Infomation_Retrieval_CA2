However, he rejected the possibility of renewing a dialogue with Baghdad and criticized Saddam Husayn's regime, describing him as a dictator. In an interview with AL-SAFIR, Talabani said that the Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are meant for domestic propaganda. Talabani's remarks came the day after his arrival in Paris, where he will meet for the first time with the leaders of the French right in addition to President Francois Mitterrand, who stressed in their meeting one year ago that he supports the proposal for a Kurdish federation within Iraq's territory. On relations with Israel, Talabani said: "We have not found any Israeli who has penetrated Iraq's Kurdistan. No Israeli delegation has visited us. But I want to ask why it is all right for the Israelis to visit Cairo, the capital of the Arab nation and the citadel of Arabism, but they are not allowed to visit part of Arab Iraq or part of Iraq's Kurdistan? Why is it permissible for them to hold talks with the Arab leaders but they are not allowed to come to us?" He continued: "I want to ask with more frankness. We, the Kurds, have been historically known to support the Palestinian people in their just cause and are more than proud of this support. But are we more Palestinian than the Palestinians themselves? Do we care more for the Palestinian cause than Mr. Yasir 'Arafat? He met, talked, and even embraced Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. Why shouldn't a Kurd do the same? Are we more royalists than the king?" Talabani added: "It is true that there are no relations now. But I would not be surprised if such relations were established one day. As we know, relations between a number of Arab countries and Israel have become semi-normal. Iraq has informed Israel in secret memos on relations of its desire to establish ties with the Hebrew state, and Kurdistan is part of Iraq. Why shouldn't the Kurds have the right to do so when the Arab countries are competing to establish ties with Israel and when King Hassan II, chairman of the Arab Jerusalem Committee, receives Israeli ministers?" He said: "The talk about Israeli penetration is primarily based on the Iraqi regime's lies and on the appearance of an organization for the Jews of Kurdistan in Israel. The Jews who went from Kurdistan to the Hebrew state carried with them good memories of the hospitable and tolerant Kurdish people, who treated them humanely and with dignity. Kurdistan's Jews have established a society to defend the Kurdish people and strengthen ties with Kurdistan. This society has carried out some activities in Israel. There has been talk about the existence of a relationship. I personally do not rule out the establishment of a relationship in the future. I do not think that this will be strange, since the Arab brothers have legalized the relationship with Israel." Regarding how relations with Israel will benefit the Kurdish people, Talabani said: "It is in the best interests of the Kurds to establish relations with everyone and not be hostile toward anyone in the world because, as the proverb says, one thousand friends are a little but one enemy is too much. If the Arab brothers are accusing us of establishing ties with Israel, then they are establishing better ones. If a Syrian-Israeli peace settlement is achieved on the basis of a comprehensive peace in return for a full withdrawal, then we will welcome it, especially if Syria retrieves the Golan. Kurdish-Israeli relations will begin then." Talking about "the impossible dialogue" with the Iraqi regime and about some Kurds' desire to establish some form of autonomy, he said: "The Kurdish people are committed to the Iraqi people's national unity. We are committed to Iraqi unity, but we want a democratic, federal Iraq. We believe that dictatorship poses a great danger to Iraq's independence, unity, and existence. Therefore, we want to change the dictatorial regime and replace it with a democratic one." The PUK leader added: "It was the current Iraqi regime that ruled out the dialogue. It refused to introduce any democratic changes and submit to the will of the Iraqi people, both Arabs and Kurds. It also rejected the Kurdish people's minimum demands. The (regime) became very arrogant for several days following the Russian military coup, and this prompted it to give a negative reply to the simplest demands presented by brother Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the negotiating Kurdish delegation in Baghdad. The delegation had no choice but to return and the negotiations were aborted." He said: "I personally have much experience in negotiating with successive Iraqi Governments. I have been negotiating with them since 1963. I believe that the experience proves that negotiating with a dictatorial regime is futile and will not lead to results. Therefore, I personally rule out negotiations with a dictatorial government. This is not just my personal opinion, but also that of the Kurdistan Front, which believes that action is necessary for the sake of a democratic Iraq. This is also the view of the unified Iraqi National Congress." Asked to comment on reports published in some newspapers citing Turkish officials who stressed that Iraq is ready to resume a dialogue with the Kurds, Talabani said: "I believe that this is a new Iraqi lie to deceive the Turks because the Turkish Government likes to get rid of the Kurdish problem in Iraq's Kurdistan. It fears the presence of a federal Kurdish entity and consequently fears the internationalization of the Kurdish problem. It wants a solution to be found within the Iraqi framework. Hence, the Iraqi Government is deceiving the Turks and dropping hints of its desire to resume the dialogue. But I ask: If (Baghdad) is serious, why doesn't it do so directly?" Talabani expressed doubts about Ankara's information on the losses of the Kurdistan Workers Party [PKK], against whom Turkey is undertaking military operations in northern Iraq. He said: "The Turkish figures that are always given about Iraq's Kurdistan are exaggerated. There are no people, villages, or human beings in the area invaded by the Turkish forces. If there are some PKK members there, they have most probably come from Turkish territories, not to set up permanent bases but to flee from the Turks." He stressed: "There are no permanent PKK bases all along the Iraqi-Turkish border. The `joined' Kurdish forces [Talabani's PUK and Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party] can control the border areas. The Turkish Government's objectives in its operations are to use them for domestic propaganda." Regarding the reason for the West's nonrecognition of the political institutions in Iraq's Kurdistan, such as the parliament and the government, Talabani said: "The reason is that the Kurds themselves are not asking the West to recognize the Kurdish government because they do not want an independent government and they have not announced one. They only announced federal measures within a unified Iraqi entity. A federation does not mean division of the state's institutions, and an example of this is Germany, Belgium, Canada, the United States, Pakistan, and India. However, the West has recognized the elections and democracy in Iraq's Kurdistan." On the nature of relations with Syria, the Kurdish official said: "Syria has always been a shelter for free Kurds and free Iraqis. Since the corrective movement launched by President Hafiz al-Asad, Syria has been backing the struggle of the Kurdish people and the Iraqi opposition forces to establish democracy in Iraq, end the dictatorship, and build a plural and democratic Iraq. Syria has always been and continues to be friendly with the Kurds." He denied that Mas'ud Barzani had set conditions for visiting Damascus. He added: "Actually, my information is the opposite of what the newspaper AL-HAYAH has published. When I was in Syria, I met with a representative of brother Mas'ud Barzani, who made a request explaining Barzani's desire to visit Damascus without prior conditions." Reviewing the ties linking the Kurds with the United States, Talabani pointed out that the "U.S. position toward the Kurdish cause is friendly. The democratic administration under President Clinton and Vice President Gore has repeatedly reiterated its commitment to protecting the Kurdish people from the dictatorial aggression, helping them rebuild their region, and getting involved in our issues in general. Even if we take the U.S. stance regarding the Turkish Kurds, we will find that in his latest message to the Turkish prime minister Clinton urged her to find a political and peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue in Turkey. Thus, the U.S. attitude toward us is friendly and positive." Asked if the Kurds want the United States to overthrow the Iraqi regime, Talabani said: "As an Iraqi Kurd, I cannot accept the dictatorial regime's being removed by foreign hands. Had the Gulf war resulted in the downfall of the regime, we would have been happy, but I believe that the main task lies with the Iraqi people." Talabani talked about his current European tour. He explained that before visiting France he had met in Germany with Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, leaders of political parties, and leaders of the Bundestag, particularly the chairman and leading figures of the Foreign Relations Committee. In Greece he met with leaders of PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement]. On his current visit to France, he said: "Tomorrow we will meet with French Defense Minister Francois Leotard, party leaders, and French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe. On Friday we will meet with President Mitterrand. They will be the first meetings with the French right, and the atmosphere surrounding the meetings seems to be one of understanding and amity. As for the meeting with Leotard, we will express condolences over the death of the French military official who was killed in the U.S. helicopter incident. Leotard was and still is sympathetic to our cause. I repeat that France remains committed to its position regarding the need for Iraq to implement all the UN resolutions. President Mitterrand has responded positively to our federation proposal. He is the one who proposed such a solution for countries with multiethnic groups." In another development, Talabani announced that he will participate in a seminar entitled "The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Minorities and the Middle East Peoples" to be held in Cairo 12-14 May. It will be attended by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali and a number of Arab figures, including Minister Walid Junblatt, Minh al-Sulh, Karim Paqraduni, Ghassan Salamah, Karim Muruwwah, and Muna 'Ubayd from Lebanon. It will also be attended by Ait Ahmed, leader of the Algerian Socialist Forces Front, and leaders of the rebellion in southern Sudan.
