Today, it seems, there are slim chances for the parties or political groups to agree on and support joint candidates. RZECZPOSPOLITA reporters have asked politicians from the PSL [Polish Peasant Party], UD [Democratic Union], the PC [Center Accord], and UP [Union of Labor] whether, in their opinion, it would be possible for the parties to change their minds in that regard, and if the possibility exists, as the election draws closer, for eventually having two major candidates, one from the right and one from the left. Some of the political parties are faced with a difficult decision. For UD, it is whether to put forward Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Jacek Kuron, or Hanna Suchocka as its candidate. The PSL has to make a choice between Waldemar Pawlak and Jozef Zych. The ZChN/PC/PL [Christian-National Union/Center Accord/Peasant Accord] coalition is considering nominating Wieslaw Chrzanowski [ZChN chairman] or Adam Strzembosz [president of the Supreme Court]. These dilemmas may become more obvious closer to the election. The SLD [Democratic Left Alliance] candidate will be Aleksander Kwasniewski. UP is looking for a person not affiliated with any party and also prefers a woman; perhaps it will be Ewa Letowska [a former ombudsman]. Other political parties also have their candidates. It is not yet known whether President Walesa will seek reelection, although many observers of the political scene maintain "he has made up his mind to run." [passage omitted] Would it be possible, despite everything, to have in the presidential election two serious candidates--a candidate of the right and a candidate of the left? [The following are responses to this question.] Janusz Piechocinski (PSL) I do not see this as a possible outcome. The presidential election plays a significant role in building and popularizing the political parties. [passage omitted] I think that there will be many candidates in the first round of the election. Every important party will see a chance for itself to have its own presidential candidate. At this point, the interests of the right or the left blocs differ from those of the political parties. The access to the media, the possibility to introduce the party's program--these are opportunities that are too attractive not to take advantage of. I think no division into Solidarity and non-Solidarity candidates will be taking place. It is rather unthinkable for UD to have a candidate together with the right. Andrzej Celinski (UD) A lot depends on the constitutional provisions in this area. If the president is going to be elected by the parliament, neither Walesa nor Kwasniewski will run, in my opinion. If the president is to be elected in a popular election, two strong candidates are a likely possibility. In my view, there is a strong possibility that post-Solidarity parties will back the same candidate. Then it would be Walesa. I cannot exclude the possibility of a third candidate--not a party candidate but, rather, a person of great authority in society. Here we can learn something from the number of votes Professor Religa gained in the Senate election [a famous cardiologist who received 503,304 votes]. Obviously, at this point in the discussion, every party talks about its own candidate. Jaroslaw Kaczynski (PC) I think this is rather difficult but not impossible. This is the only way if we want to win and not allow the left to win. It would have to be a person who is able to gain the support of the strongly anticommunist electorate as well as that part of the electorate that holds moderate views. In the second round of the election, this person will have to be able to get a substantial number of votes from the rural electorate. I do not see such a person in the political parties. I do not think Walesa could be such a person. From the PC's point of view, this is out of the question. I am convinced that he [Walesa] would be defeated. [passage omitted] Ryszard Bugaj (UP) I do not see this as a possibility. I think there will be many candidates. The choice in the election between two candidates--as I understand it, they would be Walesa and Kwasniewski--would be destructive, and I am convinced that, in spite of everything, this will not happen. Our [UP] candidate will be a nonparty individual, possibly put forward together with other parties.
