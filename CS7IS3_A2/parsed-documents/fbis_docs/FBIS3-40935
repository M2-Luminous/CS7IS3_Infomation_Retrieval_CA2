Will it help resolve the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe and on CIS territory? Is this primarily a new step or not? Third, to what extent will it help Ukraine's economy? Kravchuk: The document is a continuation of the Ukrainian Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the reservations that it put forth were about compensation for tactical and strategic nuclear weapons, their technical maintenance, financial and technical aid, and [security] guarantees. These, approximately, were the main reservations of the Supreme Council. When you read that document, and it will be published, you will find that all of those demands were met. In other words, we can positively state that the executive branch has not been acting contrary to the Supreme Council resolutions but acting toward fulfilling the reservations put forth by the Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this fact so that no one thinks, as some try to imply, that the president and the parliament were following their own separate courses. We did satisfy the reservations. I said in the past -- and I am confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine, which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance, Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways. If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the main issue for all the European and world community. By taking this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image, we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable. [passage omitted] Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper: Leonid Makarovych, I have a question. The answer to it concerns many people: Will our state's national security be consolidated after today's signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so, what changes for the better can be expected? Kravchuk: It will be consolidated in the following aspect: We have already experienced a completely different attitude toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have seen a different attitude toward us by the United States during the U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO countries have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the bit of information which we still have to think over today. This way, the international environment and our neighbors have accepted Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to live in friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other countries. This is the first point. Second, you understand that it is an illusion to say that the weapons we have owned were a deterrent. I have already told you about this deterrence; this is just a danger of deterrence rather than the deterrent [as received]. Because we are unable to produce, operate, restore, or service them--because we have nothing: neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of deterrence can we talk about? This is an illusion of deterrence, but it was hammered into people's heads. The weapons have not been a guarantee of security, but a source of threat--and not only to Ukraine. This way, having won support from certain people and states, including powerful states, we have obtained security. Security does not mean signed documents. You know how many pacts have already been signed in history, how many other documents have been signed. However, they have been insufficient because a state policy has been against what has been signed. We want our policy to be implemented in real terms, in line with our civilized and anticipated concept, which has been approved. I am convinced that we have obtained security and opened the path to economic cooperation. We have also achieved a state's image. We have acted in line with our Supreme Council, and I am convinced that the majority of the people of Ukraine want this. Reporter: At the recent news conference with Moldovan President Snegur you said something like this: The danger coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has increased. If such factors in the policy of our neighbor dominate, how do you think the signed agreement can be fulfilled and what mechanism of ensuring our national security do you see as the head of state? Kravchuk: Well, first, I said this a little differently. I said I felt anxiety. [sentence indistinct] However, the words danger and anxiety have subtle differences in connotation. Danger means that this is somewhere here... [pauses] As far as anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and every person must feel it when complicated processes are under way. However, I will repeat that this is not a state policy but a political trend. Political trends have occurred in history, you know about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we will find different trends in all spheres of social life: spiritual and political spheres, and this is a normal democratic phenomenon. However, such a tendency must not become a state policy. To prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with Russia. There are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine. Difficult processes are under way in our country too. One should not attribute them only to Russia. They are everywhere. Revanchists, nationalists, national patriots reveal themselves everywhere; they are coming out, because such is the time now. Let us prevent them from standing in the way of progressive development. This is a democratic way. However, to prevent this from becoming a state policy is our responsibility and our common concern. When we say that we have signed an agreement by three presidents today, this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation begins from this point: politically, economically, and spiritually. Those forces that today are in opposition will remain there. Opposition must exist, and there is nothing scary about this. However, one must not allow aggressiveness, and antipeople, antihumanitarian moods, hidden under patriotism, to dominate in society. We must not allow this. That is to say, I feel anxiety but I also have hope, because 14 January is a new page of understanding our problems, and a page comprised of new steps. I believe that these steps are aimed against what makes all of us apprehensive.
