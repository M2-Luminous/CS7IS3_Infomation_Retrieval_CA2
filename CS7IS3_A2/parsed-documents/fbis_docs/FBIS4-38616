"It goes without saying that these documents will help promote business activity in the country," he noted. Touching on relationships between the Russian Federation and Kuwait, the speaker said that their cooperation "could be more resultative and effective", including in the sphere of parliamentary contacts. "Frankly speaking, both sides have still not used all the available opportunities," he added. Head of the Kuwait delegation Ahmad 'Abd-al-'Aziz al-Sa'dun, chairman of the Kuwait National Assembly, thanked Russia for its stand of principle vis-a-vis Iraq, which had unleashed an aggression against his country. "We want this stand to remain immutable," the guest noted. Rybkin assured the Kuwait MPs [members of parliament] that the Russian attitude to the friendly Kuwaiti state was irreversible. "We want all the resolutions of the [UN] Security Council, linked with the Gulf war, to be fully implemented," he stressed. "At the same time," Rybkin stated, "we are perfectly aware that it is impossible to live in conditions when there is no peace and no war. It is necessary to achieve a situation when the two peoples would live in conditions of good-neighbourship and peace. The Russian MPs, together with their Kuwait colleagues, must do their best in this noble effort."
