He pointed out that at present, Fujian has a special economic zone, as well as some economic and technological development zones, Taiwan businessmen development zones, bonded zones, and nearly 100 small zones designated for comprehensive development by foreign businessmen; Fujian is one of the provinces with the largest number of opening spectrums, the most complete set of opening functions, and the biggest area covered by opening up. If Fujian wants to accomplish new feats, it must continue to give play to its strong point in land and marine resources, as well as its strong point in ties with overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; it must adapt to the situation in which China is about to rejoin the GATT, and stretch its economic antenna to the broader international market. Among the 13 bonded zones in the country, two are in Fujian. Fuzhou Bonded Zone has a planned area of 1.8 square km, and the first-phase development, which occupies 0.8 square km, has been in operation for more than a year; Xiamen's Xiangyu Bonded Zone has a planned area of 2 square km, and the first-phase development, which occupies 0.6 square km, was established last November and began operation at that time. Fuzhou Port, home to Fuzhou Bonded Zone, is only 149 nautical miles from Taiwan's Keelung Harbor, and is one of the mainland districts nearest to Taiwan; scholars generally hold that the bonded zone there should become an important base for interactions between the two sides of the straits. KAIFANG CHAO, a large-scale bimonthly economic journal jointly run by Fujian Province People's Government Opening Affairs Office, Special Zone Office, and the Leading Team for Foreign Investment Work, is mainly for research and exploration into the theory and practice of opening up to the outside world. The journal will be published on 28 of every even-numbered month, and the trial issue to be published this month is a special issue on Fuzhou Bonded Zone.
