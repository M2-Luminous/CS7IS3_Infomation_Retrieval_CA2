Negotiations to free the two Italian aid workers held hostage by Somali bandits in a village some 80 km from Mogadishu will resume tomorrow. There is talk of a ransom demand of $50,000. Achille D'Amelia reports. [D'Amelia] The two Italian aid workers kidnapped in Somalia remain in the hands of their captors, at least for tonight. The elders of the village of Timare, where the men were kidnapped, are giving assurances that all will be resolved upon the payment of the $50,000 ransom. However, things may not necessarily turn out that way. A ransom has not been paid in other cases, and hostages have been released. Italian Foreign Ministry Under Secretary Carmelo Azzara and the diplomatic delegation that was visiting Somalia on another mission related to the safety of the Italian contingent during their withdrawal have ceased their other activities and have said that they will remain here until the release of Sergio Passadore and Gianfranco Stefani has been obtained. The original mission has been suspended. The under secretary and Ambassadors [Maurizio] Moreno and [Mario] Scialoja were scheduled to go on to Nairobi, Addis Ababa, Asmara, Djibouti, and Cairo. In fact, they were scheduled to meet General Aidid in Nairobi.
