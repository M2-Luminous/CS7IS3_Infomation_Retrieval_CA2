[passage omitted] "We noted with satisfaction that NATO has confirmed the existence of a relationship between the security of its member states and that of the countries of Central and East Europe," Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said in a speech at NATO headquarters. "In my view, this contributes to the consolidation of the external security of those countries," he said. "And it is also important for the fundamental reforms which are being carried out in those countries." Poland, which had expressed great reservations about participating in the Partnership because of its desire to join NATO quickly and to secure security guarantees from the alliance, referred to the need to develop economic exchanges between East and West. "While putting into practice the Partnership for Peace in the sphere of political and military cooperation, we ought to try to create a Partnership for Development, a multifaceted cooperation between North America and West, Central, and East Europe, a cooperation among different structures, governmental and nongovernmental institutions, regional and local cooperation," Pawlak added. In his view, such cooperation should take place in particular with the countries which are on the way to a market economy: "It ought to contribute to the activation of growth, increase the feeling of stability, the promotion of economic restructuring, and the dissemination and strengthening of the market economy throughout the area of the Partnership." "We regard the Partnership for Peace not only as a means of having closer contacts with NATO. We want to use the possibilities opened up by the program to maintain a good partnership with our East European neighbors," he said. In his view, "the Partnership has the potential for becoming a broad and practical basis for cooperation among European countries in favor of their mutual security." "The recent NATO summit (10 and 11 January in Brussels) did not live up to all our expectations, but we appreciate the declaration of NATO's openness with a view to developing cooperation with the partners and creating prospects for accepting new members in the future," Pawlak added.
