The statement was issued in connection with the summit of G7 countries which will be held in Naples on 9-10 July. The summit will be attended by Russian Federation president Boris Yeltsin. The results of the economic section of the forthcoming summit meeting will depend in many respects on whether there is a readiness to set about real implementation of agreements reached at previous summits on support for reform in Russia, a readiness to take practical steps to intensify and develop them. The statement stresses that "without Russia's participation it is difficult to see how many global economic problems, including the problem of foreign debt, can be effectively resolved. It has to be recognized that Russia is not just a debtor but also a creditor. Russia, which has inherited the huge debts owed to the former USSR by developing countries, is entitled to participate in the evolution of approaches to this problem by other creditors of third world countries."
