The ASAHI said the public disapproval rate for the Hata cabinet was 32 percent. The national daily added that the initial support rate for the Hata cabinet is 10 percentage points lower than the approval rate for the Hosokawa cabinet's last stage as scored by the ASAHI survey in February. The ASAHI said a new cabinet usually holds a higher approval rating than that for the last stage of the previous cabinet. The newspaper conducted its nationwide survey of 3,000 eligible voters on Sunday and Monday. The response rate was 80 percent. Only 19 percent of the respondents expected brighter political prospects with the establishment of a minority government, down 24 percentage points from the September survey last year, it said. Regarding the next general election, 11 percent of those polled supported an immediate general election even before the Diet's passage of the government-proposed fiscal 1994 draft budget. Twenty-three percent called for a general election under the current electoral system as soon as the Diet approves the draft budget, the ASAHI reported, while 26 percent said the general election should be conducted after the new electoral system takes effect. Some 31 percent said an early general election is not necessary, according to the survey. The public support rate for the Japan New Party led by former Prime Minister Hosokawa plummeted to 5 percent, a decrease of 7 percentage points from February. The Shinseito of Prime Minister Hata gained a 14 percent of approval rating, an increase of 3 percentage points from February.
