Eight factions and one deputy group, made up of slightly more than 400 deputies, have been formed. Some remained "on the loose"--those who could not form their own groups because of the high "threshold" requirement but did not want to join the existing ones. Russia's Choice became the largest faction, with 76 deputies; interestingly, Zhirinovskiy's faction was pushed back to third place by the New Regional Policy group of 65 deputies elected from one-seat districts. The LDPR [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] was two deputies behind in numbers. Now the faction and group leaders together with the speaker form the Duma Council. The setting up of parliamentary committees also proceeded without particular cataclysms. Actually, all the struggles took place behind the scenes: Even before the session the factions divided the portfolios by striking deals as to who would get which committee, and then took to the plenary session a coordinated draft distribution of responsibilities to be adopted as a package. Which it was. Zhirinovskiy's dream of becoming chairman of the International Affairs Committee did not materialize--the chairmanship went to V. Lukin. Two committees--defense and national security--attracted special attention. S. Yushenkov (Russia's Choice) and V. Ilyukhin (Communist Party of Russia), respectively, were elected chairmen. M. Zadornov (Yavlinskiy's bloc) took charge of the Budget, Taxation, Banking, and Finance Committee. V. Isakov, a former Supreme Soviet deputy and one of the leaders of the irreconcilable opposition, on the other hand, essentially kept his old job as chairman of one of the key committees--on legislation and judicial and legal reform. So what is the current disposition of forces? There will be a total of 23 committees in the Duma. Five of them are headed by LDPR representatives; four by Russia's Choice; three each by representatives of the PRES [Party of Russian Unity and Accord] and New Regional Policy; two each went to the APR [Agrarian Party of Russia], KPR [Communist Party of Russia], and YaBL [Yavlinskiy-Boldyrev-Lukin bloc]; and one each to Women of Russia and the DPR [Democratic Party of Russia]. This distribution more or less corresponds to the proportional weight of Duma factions, which did not keep one group of deputies, among whom the best known was S. Baburin, from lodging a protest. They did not like the fact that nine committees went to representatives of reformist blocs. Overall there is a perceptible desire on the part of a certain group of deputies who brought to the Duma their old confrontational attitudes to push these blocs aside. Although it is quite obvious that with the current disposition of forces only an effort to work together and take into consideration the opinion of others will enable the Duma to function normally. At the same time the first votes showed that three factions--APR, KPR, and LDPR (165 votes)--clearly form a bloc, at least when it comes to personnel appointments. It is hard at this point to judge the leanings of the New Regional Policy group--they will become clear only when political and economic problems come up for substantive discussion. In any case, the reformist blocs (which are not all that united among themselves), which account for only 133 votes, should be interested in cooperation with these factions, as well as with Women of Russia faction.
