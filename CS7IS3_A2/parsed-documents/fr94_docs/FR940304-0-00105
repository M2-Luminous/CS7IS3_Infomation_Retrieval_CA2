FR940304-0-00105 FR940304-0-00020 (2) Until March 1, 1996, other Federal Reserve Offices may continue to provide some savings bond services, but such services will be phased out over the period prior to that date. Appendix to Part 321 [Amended] 14. The appendix to part 321 is amended as follows: A. Paragraph Number 4 is revised to read as follows: * * * * * 4. Paying agent code numbers. [§§321.3(b) and 321.13] The appropriate Federal Reserve Bank will assign a four-digit code number to each agent it qualifies. A separate number will be assigned to each branch authorized to redeem and submit redeemed securities for its own account to a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch or to a Regional Check Processing Center. At the paying agent's request, only one four-digit code will be assigned for use by all of its branches. The presenting institution's ABA number will be used in the adjustment of discrepancies and in the computation and payment of fees for securities transmitted in separately sorted cash letters. * * * * * B. Paragraph 5 is amended by removing ``the Federal Reserve Bank'', and replacing it with ``the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank referred to in §321.25''. C. Paragraph 9(a), first sentence, is amended by adding ``referred to in §321.25'' after ``a Federal Reserve Bank''. D. Paragraphs 13(a), 13(b), 14(a), 14(b), 14(d), 18, 23(a), 23(d), 23(e) and 27 are amended by removing ``Federal Reserve Bank'' and replacing it with ``the appropriate Federal Reserve Bank referred to in §321.25'', wherever found. E. Paragraph 14(e) is revised to read as follows: * * * * * 14. *␣*␣* (e) MICR-encoding of payment information. [§321.13] An agent shall MICR-encode the redemption value in the ``Amount'' field on the face of each security or arrange to have this service performed by another financial institution. If the agent transmits securities in mixed cash letters, it must also MICR-encode the routing/transit number assigned to the Bureau of the Public Debt's savings bond activity in the ``R/T'' field on the face of all pre-October 1957 paper securities and those punch card securities on which it does not already appear. The Bureau's routing/transit number is 000090007. Care should be taken in repairing MICR-encoded items so as not to obliterate any data in surrounding MICR fields or elsewhere on the face of the security. * * * * * F. Paragraph 15 is revised to read as follows: * * * * * 15. Transmittal of securities to Federal Reserve Bank. [§321.14] An agent shall transmit and receive settlement for redeemed securities via EZ CLEAR, i.e., the Check Department of a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, or the Regional Check Processing Center. Redeemed securities may be transmitted in separately sorted or mixed cash letters to the Check Department of a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch, or to a Regional Check Processing Center, either directly, or via a parent office or correspondent institution. An agent shall transmit redeemed securities under cover of the appropriate transmittal document. Securities redeemed in exchange for Series HH bonds must be transmitted for settlement via EZ CLEAR at the same time as the exchange application (PD F 3253) and any additional cash needed to complete the transaction are forwarded to the Fiscal Agency Department of the servicing Federal Reserve Bank referred to in §321.25. Securities redeemed on exchange may be commingled with cash redemptions in mixed or separately sorted cash letters.'' * * * * * G. Paragraph 16 is revised to read as follows: * * * * * 16. Transmittal of securities to Federal Reserve Bank via fiscal agency system. [§321.14] The Fiscal Agency Department of a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch will not accept for settlement securities an agent has redeemed.'' * * * * *
