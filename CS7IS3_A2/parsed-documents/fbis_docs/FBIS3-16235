The Russian Naval Forces press center said this today in response to a request by an ITAR-TASS correspondent for a comment on a report by the Japanese paper MAINICHI. The paper reported today, citing Valeriy Danilyan, the chief of the Pacific Fleet Chemical Service, that Russia could resume the dumping of waste in the Sea of Japan in May this year unless foreign countries, including Japan, provided financial help with building facilities to use and store liquid radioactive waste. The Russian Naval Forces press center said that this was the personal view of one of the Pacific Fleet leaders. However, the government has so far not made a decision on the dumping of waste in the Sea of Japan. [passage omitted] Only the use of special facilities for rendering the waste harmless can solve the problem. A Finance Ministry representative recently said at a session of a government commission that the issue of allocating money for these problems will be resolved very soon. It should be noted that Russia has not received the help promised by Western countries for the construction of the facilities. And the tanker for the storage and transportation of radioactive waste offered by Japan turned out to be wholly unsuitable for use.
