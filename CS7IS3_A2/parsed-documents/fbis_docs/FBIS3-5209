It is generally thought that, with the end of the Cold War, the United Nations has become very active and has begun to play a new role in world security. First of all, we would like you to tell us about the current problems facing the United Nations as you see them. [Hatano] I often say that the United Nations faces five important problems at present: First, peace-keeping operations; second, refugees; third, human rights; fourth, humanitarian aid; fifth, the environment. These five problems have two aspects -- Japan can do much in one respect and can do little in the other. As far as peacekeeping operations are concerned, the Japanese have the fundamental problem that they are reluctant to go to dangerous places. The problem we face with the issue of refugees is that although Japan provides aid for their assistance, our contribution is limited as far as the acceptance of refugees is concerned. On human rights there is sharp contrast in values between Asia and the West. Asia hopes Japan is well placed enough to be sympathetic to its point of view, while the West hopes that Japan, as a developed nation, will share its point of view. On the positive side, Japan can mediate between the two; on the negative side is open to criticism from both sides. On the issue of humanitarian aid, Japan provides a large amount of aid. But its philosophy is based on the idea that helping those who help themselves is good assistance. At present, however, those countries which can help themselves have mostly been helped. For those countries which are still unable to help themselves, Japan is often one step behind other nations in providing funds, even if it does so in the end. Somehow, Japan does not give the impression that it will provide aid of its own volition. Only on the issue of the environment does Japan take the lead without restraint. However, there is the problem of the weight the country carries in the United Nations. Unless a country makes a considerable contribution in the first four areas, it will find it rather difficult to take the initiative in the fifth. The first four problems are, in many cases, discussed in the Security Council when concrete, urgent countermeasures are needed. It might be thought that the Security Council discusses only security issues. Recently, however, the definition of security has become so wide that it has come to include human rights, refugees, and humanitarian aid. The original Security Council resolution on Bosnia in the former Yugoslavia, and on Somalia, was to dispatch peacekeeping forces to support the smooth implementation of humanitarian aid. In that sense, many of the important problems dealt with by the United Nations are discussed in the Security Council. Important UN elections, such as those for secretary general and judges of the International Court of Justice are also conducted in the Security Council. Therefore, the easiest way to make a contribution to the United Nations is to have a voice in the Security Council. If a country is not a member of the Security Council, it has no chance to give advice or put in a word no matter how hard it tries. [Yoshikawa] The peacekeeping operations of the United Nations were successful in Cambodia, but they met a severe ordeal in Somalia. What is the current view of the United Nations on peacekeeping operations? [Hatano] UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali said that the United Nations had had two crises. The first crisis lasted until four or five years ago, during which no hopes had been entertained for the United Nations. In my opinion, nobody in the world at that time thought that the peacekeeping operations of the United Nations could ensure the security of the world. The second UN crisis which Secretary General Butrus-Ghali referred to is the period in which undue hopes had been entertained for the United Nations, and it lasted until recently. The establishment of a just peace by the United Nations through the Gulf war prompted successive requests to the United Nations from all over the world for the dispatch of peacekeeping forces to their places, thus raising undue expectations. In answer to these expectations, peacekeeping forces were dispatched to various places of the world, such as Cambodia, Yugoslavia, and Somalia. However, the results fell short of our expectations, except for Cambodia. Meanwhile, the expenses have become so great recently that the so-called United Nations fatigue and a tendency toward self-examination -- the dispatch of peacekeeping operations cannot be continued in this manner; or whether it is proper to continue the dispatch -- has been born, to my thinking, in the United Nations and the Security Council. However, there are successive requests from all over the world for the dispatch of peacekeeping forces at present, and the United Nations is racking its brains to cope with these requests. If Japan expresses a negative view, it is refuted: "Although Japan promoted peacekeeping operations in Cambodia, is it against them when they are conducted outside of Asia?" It is often said in the United Nations that there are two kinds of peace in the world: one is "peace with justice" and the other is "peace without justice." If the United Nations had not intervened in Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, a peaceful situation might have been produced, at least on the surface. However, a peace of this kind would have been the product of Iraq's unlawful annexation of Kuwait. The idea of the United Nations is that it cannot tolerate such peace without justice. Recently there have been a large number of countries where an excessive violation of human rights is being practiced, famines have broken out, and refugees have come into existence, not to mention the invasion by Iraq. The insistence and self-confidence of the United Nations are that it must not remain indifferent to such a situation without justice and that it must actively intervene in such a situation on its own initiative. I would like to add a few words here that there are people who say that in Japan every peace is peace with justice despite the fact that there are two kinds of peace as mentioned above. Demand for Transparency in the United Nations [Yoshikawa] In my opinion, many readers of this magazine think that the United Nations is doing something very difficult, and they have no idea how the United Nations reaches a decision. Now, you have served as Japanese ambassador to the United Nations for the past four years, and you have also attended Security Council meetings every day these two years as a member of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us about how the Security Council comes to a decision, about what kind of role the ambassador and the permanent mission on the spot play, and about the atmosphere of deliberations at the Security Council. [Hatano] It is said that the United Nations has three classes of members: the first class is the five permanent members; the second class is ten nonpermanent members (note: the permanent members are China, France, Russia, Britain, and the United States; the nonpermanent members as of the end of 1993 are Japan, Brazil, Cape Verde, Djibouti, Hungary, Morocco, New Zealand, Pakistan, Spain, and Venezuela); the third class is the other 169 members. The customary practice is that when the Security Council makes a decision, first of all only the five permanent members of the first class hold a conference, make their plan, and submit their plan to a conference of the ten nonpermanent members for deliberation. The mutual cooperation among the five members is very close. At the stage of a conference by the five members, one or two members of them may oppose vigorously. But, once an agreement is reached by the five members, it is supported by the five members in a body both at unofficial and official conferences of the Security Council. Then the ten nonpermanent members find it very difficult to oppose the agreement. These permanent members have a veto. In actuality, a veto is rarely exercised, but they exercise a right called "the pocket veto" in the sense that they can exercise their veto when the occasion demands. A proposal advanced by a nonpermanent member may be rejected, but the same kind of proposal advanced by a permanent member is accepted in compliance with its request so that the permanent member will not exercise its veto. Since these five members with special power make a plan without the participation of the ten nonpermanent members, the ten nonpermanent members can hardly oppose the plan. Japan was well consulted on the problem of Cambodia and most of its opinions were accepted in the end. However, Japan did not participate in the discussions conducted by the five permanent members, but took the form of effecting a liaison with the five members when they conduct discussions, from outside of the five members. Concerning the ten nonpermanent members, five of them are nonaligned nations, which form a "nonaligned caucus" alias "the caucus" and adjust their opinions. The remaining five members are called "the non-nonaligned caucus," to use the jargon of the United Nations. In the caucus, there are five nations, including Japan, but their interests do not coincide nor do they belong to the same group. They belong to a group which is not a group in the strict sense of the word; therefore almost no adjustment of opinions is made among these five nations. And so they do not make a plan as a group or oppose other nations' plans in cooperation with each other. That makes them easier to be defeated one by one, which is of course generalization. The rest depends upon the ability of individual ambassadors. Last, there are relations between the 15 nations which are the members of the Security Council and the 169 nations which are not members of the Security Council. The other day a Western ambassador said at an important meeting that in the United Nations there are now 15 nations that make a decision and 169 nations that conform to the decision, and that such a system must be changed. To my mind, this opinion probably represents all the 169 nations. The non- Security Council members have requested that they be allowed to participate in Security Council meetings, even if indirectly, and that they should at least be informed of what is going on in the meetings. These are, what is called, requests for transparency, and there is a growing consciousness among the current Security Council members that improvement of the situation is necessary. [Yoshikawa] You served as chairman of the Security Council in January 1993. Please tell us about your experiences as chairman. [Hatano] The chairman of the Security Council works twenty-four hours a day. Since there is a time differential, the chairman must negotiate at midnight over the telephone with the foreign minister of a foreign country or its president when the occasion demands. The chairman is often awakened in the dead of night. During my chairmanship, there were various problems, of which the problem of the U.S. attack on the missile bases of Iraq and the problem of seating the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in the United Nations were serious ones. In the end, the two problems were settled off the Security Council floor. It was three o'clock in the morning when I talked with the U.S. ambassador over the telephone about the attack on Iraq. I negotiated with the Iraqi ambassador a number of times. I had a number of conferences with the foreign minister of Greece, and the president and the foreign minister of "Macedonia" [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]. I spent a lot of time on the elections in Western Sahara, on the Palestinian refugees, on the conflicts in Angola, as well as on former Yugoslavia, Somalia, Cambodia, and others. An unofficial plenary session of the Security Council is held almost every day, and when the session begins the chairman must make an effort to put the ideas of all the members in order and to reach a consensus. However, the chairman has full power over whether a particular agenda item should be taken up and when it should be taken up if at all. If the chairman sends an agenda item to a meeting of the Security Council when the time is not ripe for action, that will only complicate the matter. In that sense, the harder the problems, like the problems of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Iraq, the more likely they are to be solved off the Security Council floor. In short, the chairman is most active before an official plenary session, and the ability of the chairman is determined by how an adjustment is made over the telephone and when and what kind of tentative plan is shown by the chairman to persons concerned. On the other hand, the chairman, attempting a compromise in this way behind the scenes, must pay attention to the request for transparency. I was attentive to the relationship with the media. I was obliged to keep company with the television from all over the world for more than 30 minutes every day. If I failed to do that, I would end up being misreported or criticized. I fully realized how dreadful the media was. It Is Impossible To Play the Leading Role Without Policy [Yoshikawa] For the past two years, Japan had been in the Security Council as a member of the second group. Since Japan's term as a nonpermanent member of the Security Council expired on 31 December 1993, it now belongs to the third group. How do you evaluate and grade Japan as a nonpermanent member which participated in meetings held by the Security Council almost daily? [Hatano] It is difficult to make a self-evaluation of the activities of Japan, but I think that Japan had always played the leading role in Asian problems. Although Japan did not directly participate in the conferences of the five permanent members concerning the problems of Cambodia, it spoke a lot and what it said was always reflected in the Security Council's resolutions. I do not think there was any instance in which Japan's will was overridden by the five permanent members. Although the problem of North Korea (the Democratic People's Republic of Korea) is not yet a topic of discussion in the Security Council, Japan's opinion on the matter has already been asked time and again. On the other hand, concerning problems outside of Asia, naturally, Japan's opinions are listened to if it is involved in the problems. For example, Japan has donated $100,000,000 to Somalia, and Japan's voice carries weight in its own way. Concerning areas to which Japan has not made a great contribution, it is making a contribution in the form of giving advice. In my mind, the most important thing for Japan to do is to establish a policy of managing each conflict. What is Japan's idea for solving the conflicts in Tajikistan, in Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia, Burundi, Rwanda, and Liberia? The most desirable thing for Japan to do is to give advice upon establishment of a policy of solving a particular problem after a close study of each problem. Unless Japan has such a policy, it cannot play a leading role. It would be meaningless for Japan, even if it could. [Yoshikawa] You have pointed out that a country cannot play a leading role unless it has a policy. That is a valuable suggestion. We would like to consider problems outside of Asia as our own problems and establish a policy to cope with such problems. On the other hand, this is not a which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the-egg question, but Japan is compelled to express its view because it is given the chance to do so at the Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan will come to have its own views on the various problems of the world you have just pointed out . On 3 December 1993, a General Assembly resolution was passed concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, and the problem of how to reform the Security Council will be discussed in earnest in the United Nations early in 1994. This is a matter of great concern in Japan because this is related to the problem of what kind of position Japan will occupy in the Security Council. We would like you to tell us about the significance of the current decision of the United Nations and about your view on the progress on this problem. [Hatano] Concerning the which-came-first-the-chicken-or-the- egg question, you may be having a hard time in Tokyo. But, seen from New York, it is a little different. I think it is wrong for Japan to have its own view because it is compelled to do so. It seems to me that Brazil, Spain and New Zealand, which are currently members of the Security Council, have their own assertions concerning each problem mentioned above, not to mention the United States, Britain, and France. Concerning the reorganization of the Security Council, I think there are two problems. The first problem is: Japan and Germany are the second and third largest contributors to the United Nations; according to the Western style of thinking -- no taxation without representation -- it is quite natural that Japan and Germany, as great political powers, should be made permanent members, because they are not only great contributors, but they are also politically influential seen from the world as a whole, whether they like it or not. The second problem is: there were 51 member nations when the United Nations was established in 1945, of which 11 were the members of the Security Council at that time; the number of the member nations has increased to 184, but the number of the permanent members has increased from 11 to only 15; moreover, at first the member nations of the Security Council were mostly the so-called countries in "the North"; thereafter, the number of member nations has increased due to the joining of largely so-called independent nations in "the South," but the balance between "the North" and "the South" has shown almost no change since the establishment of the Security Council. Therefore, the second problem is how to rectify the imbalance between the North and the South. I think that the second problem mentioned above has been the main force in the reorganization movement of the Security Council. The central idea of Japan is apt to be: "What are you going to do with Japan?" Although the United Nations fully understands the first problem, judging from the atmosphere of the United Nations as a whole, the solution to the problem of the representation of the countries of the South, which comprise more than three-fourths of the member nations of the United Nations, seems to be the main stream of the reorganization of the Security Council at present. From the standpoint of "the South," Japan is not only the most important donor country, but also the friend of "the South" who understands the claim of "the South." And "the North" supports Japan not only because Japan shares the same sense of value as "the North," but also because what Japan says is close to the claim of "the North." I think that Japan is now in the middle of the stream of the reorganization of the Security Council, created by "the South." The UN secretary general says that Japan should become a permanent member of the Security Council and that would benefit the United Nations. It is not impossible for Japan not to become a permanent member of the Security Council, contrary to the current of the times, by refusing to be a Security Council member. But, in that case, Japan would be criticized for avoiding its responsibility. Japan is by no means aiming for the position of permanent member by overstretching itself or through maneuvering. The position of a permanent member cannot be gained through such means. Japan cannot be a permanent member unless the general atmosphere of the United Nations expects Japan to become a permanent member. Since such an expectation actually prevails now, Japan's negative attitude toward that will only invite disappointment and criticism. Reorganization of the Security Council Was the Pandora's Box [Yoshikawa] Then, can we say that the success of reorganization of the Security Council depends on how the wishes of the countries of "the South" are reflected? Various countries have already expressed all sorts of opinions at the United Nations, and it will take some time, in my mind, to put these opinions in order. This is a problem we have to think over without haste, is it not? [Hatano] That is right. I think the solution of this problem will take considerable time. Japan's problem is not so serious, but there will be considerable trouble among the countries of "the South" in making plans for the participation of "the South." "The South" itself must put its opinions in order before "the North" expresses its opinions. Looking back over the past two years, I find marked progress. Only one and a half years ago, the five permanent members used to say that the problem of reorganization of the Security Council is a Pandora's box. They had consented to open the Pandora's box, pick out only Japan, and make it a permanent member. But they had opposed this by saying that opening the Pandora's box would produce so many problems that they would become uncontrollable. I think that now all the permanent members take the reorganization, as well as the admittance of Japan and Germany to permanent membership, for granted. Although things are moving relatively fast and there is a mountain of problems to be solved, the problem of reorganization may certainly move toward solution in 1995. The reason is that 1995 is the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations and many countries are thinking of doing something memorable and conspicuous on that occasion. I think it is important to place great value on this opportunity. [Yoshikawa] In Japan, it is pointed out that an adequate discussion is not being conducted on the effect that Japan's permanent membership in the Security Council will produce on Japan's course and its form of existence. On the other hand, it seems that this problem has been taken up by the media and others since the summer of 1993 and has become, so to speak, a topic for public discussion. I think that Japan should display initiative in the international agency called the United Nations, which has 184 member nations of the world and which covers political, economic and social problems, whether or not Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. We would like you to tell us your opinion about what Japan should do in the United Nations on the basis of your experience to the present day. [Hatano] In Japan, there is a tendency to think that the United Nations is like a noble world federal government, that Japan must give its cooperation to such a government, and that Japan should be pleased that it has been given a chance to give its cooperation. Such a tendency is welcomed by those of us who take charge of the United Nations, and yet I think that such an idea is wrong. Japan is an important member of the United Nations, and it is we ourselves who constitute the United Nations. Therefore, Japan's concern is not to make its contribution to the United Nations, but how to make use of the United Nations. I think United Nations diplomacy is not for the purpose of making a contribution to the United Nations, but to make use of the United Nations. Concerning the relationship with the Security Council, Japan would have a decisive voice in the reform and reorganization of the United Nations if it becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. In that sense, it is one idea to make a contribution to a reformed United Nations and to a reformed Security Council; but I think it can also be said that it is better to become a permanent member of the Security Council if Japan is to make reforms. For example, the ultimate nature of peace-keeping operations will be determined, after all, through a succession of Security Council resolutions. And Japan will have a decisive voice in the discussion of that problem if it becomes a permanent member of the Security Council. Therefore, I think it desirable for Japan to become a permanent member of the Security Council to reform the United Nations at the initiative of Japan. [Yoshikawa] As you have just said, I think we should not forget the fact that the United Nations does not have a different existence from us, does not exist on the other side of the river, in other words, is not "an outsider," but is "an entity of which we are a part."
