It was the 11th Communist Chinese airliner hijacked to Taiwan since 6 April last year. According to sources, there were 120 passengers and eight crew members on the Boeing-737 airliner bearing the serial number B-2599. At 1018, aviation control units from our Air Force spotted the airliner deviating from its route. The Tainan Air Base sent two F-5E fighters to guide the airliner to land. The authorities have instructed through proper channels that the matter be handled in accordance with the established principles. Since the ninth Communist Chinese airliner was hijacked to Taiwan late last year, the government has lowered the level at which it will comment on airplane hijackings.
