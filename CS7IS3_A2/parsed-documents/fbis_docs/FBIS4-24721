Executives pledged to "return" to the News and Public Affairs Department the power to decide whether the film would be shown as planned on Saturday night, the fifth anniversary of the military crushing of the pro-democracy movement. Chief Executive Officer Mark Lee Po-on told the journalists who had resigned that the news team were to "have the final say" on the matter. But the six -- all holding key positions in the department -- have yet to decide whether to withdraw their resignations. They will meet the management again today to discuss questions related to the independence of the News Division. Deputy Chief Executive Clarence Chang Ching-po, who has overall control of the News Division, will probably be absent from the meeting. Mr Chang flew to Taiwan on a business trip on Monday afternoon. His announcement last Friday morning that the film should not be screened triggered an outcry within and outside the station about media self-censorship in matters sensitive to China. The 40-minute Spanish production contains about seven minutes of footage of the situation in Tiananmen Square between 4 am and 7 am on June 4, 1989. The film, shot from the Monument to the People's Heroes, is the first visual record to show what happened in the square during the three-hour news ban. It supports the long-held version from Chinese officials that there was no killing in the square. The management reportedly was of the view that there was nothing special in the film, and that it failed to show the "overall situation" in Tiananmen Square. They also apparently held that it would do no good to Hong Kong to discuss the issue again. Yesterday, however, the management insisted the incident in the newsroom had arisen from communication problems. Mr Lee said the management and the News Division had different views on when the Spanish production should be scheduled. The News Division intended to screen it on the current affairs programme News Magazine while the management preferred it be shown in One Day, a programme looking back at historical events. "Management has now decided to let the News Division have the final say in this matter, by leaving it to those in charge of the programme to decide when and how it should best be presented," Mr Lee said. Assistant Controller of ATV's Public Relations and Publicity Department Lu Fung claimed that it was the management's intention to preserve the independence of the News Division. She insisted that the company had still been in the course of discussion with the journalists regarding the programme when the resignations were submitted. It had been decided to"return to the department the rights of decision", she said. But Ms Lu did not explain why a promotional segment of the programme had been withheld late last Thursday. Assistant News Controller Selina Li Yuk-lin, one of those who resigned on Monday, rejected the management's explanation that the whole incident was due to a misunderstanding. "My understanding is that at one point, a decision was made to ban the programme," she said. Executive editor Lo Wing-hung said Mr Chang had told the news team that the management would not change its mind, despite the resignations. The management offered the alternative screening in One Day only on Monday, after she and Acting News Controller Poon Fu-yin indicated they would resign, Ms Li said. "But the point is that it should be up to us to decide when and how to screen programmes," she said. Mr Poon said the news team would stick to the original plan and run the programme at 10.30 on Saturday night, almost the exact time the military began their crackdown five years ago. The television station's initial decision to suspend the programme came under fire from a number of social groups. Ten people, including pro-democracy activist Lau Shan-ching, staged a protest at the ATV building in Broadcast Drive, Kowloon Tong. They shouted slogans to condemn ATV management for tampering with the freedom of the press. Spokesman for the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China, Cheung Man-kwong, also criticised the move. He said the screening would give a clearer picture of the situation in Tiananmen Square and should not be banned for commercial or administrative reasons.
