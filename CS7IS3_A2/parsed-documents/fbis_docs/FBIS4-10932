The capture was made on 18 April by the corvettes Espora, Rosales, Spiro, and Parker, which were patrolling when they discovered the foreign vessels fishing in Argentina's exclusive economic zone, some 190 miles east of Port Deseado. The Argentine units captured the fishing vessels "Petero 301," "Petero 303," and the "Jaiwgon," and later the "Dongwon 311," all of them flying the Korean flag. When ordered to heave to, the "Dongwon 311" did not obey the Espora's order to stop, and continued to flee despite the firing of warning shots until it decided to heave to. The vessels' crews were taken to port and placed at the disposal of authorities, who will take the appropriate measures in accordance with the law.
