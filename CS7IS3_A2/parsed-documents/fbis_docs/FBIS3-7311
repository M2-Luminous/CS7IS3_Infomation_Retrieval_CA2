Two interparty policy forums on foreign affairs and education will soon be set up, a move aimed at accelerating Hosokawa's attempt to establish a policy study group, believed to be a preliminary step before forming a seven-party joint parliamentary group, the sources said. Three key coalition figures -- Hosokawa, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito Secretary General Yuichi Ichikawa -- held talks on March 13 and agreed to launch the study group with a view to the forming of a new party, the sources said. They are eyeing setting up as early as April a seven-party study group which could ultimately develop into a new party after absorbing the two forums and establishing a parliamentary group, they said. The seven coalition components remain divided over how to fight off the leading opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) in the next general election for the House of Representatives. The LDP, which was ousted from power last August, still retains the largest number of seats in the Diet of any single party. The next general election is expected to be held under a new electoral system mixing single-seat constituencies and proportional representation. Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and Komeito, both core coalition parties, are advocating the necessity of uniting the seven coalition parties to defeat the LDP. The Social Democratic Party (SDP), which is the largest member of the coalition bloc, the new party Sakigake [Harbinger] and the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) are in favor of a multi-party system. The SDP and Sakigake are opposed to Hosokawa's plan to establish a joint parliamentary group among the seven coalition parties. Hosokawa, head of the Japan New Party (JNP) which is closely tied with Sakigake, has recently tilted heavily in favor of the Shinseito-Komeito line, coalition sources said. Earlier this month, Hosokawa said the coalition would be at a disadvantage in the next general election unless it overcame internal rivalry and agreed to back a joint candidate in each of the 300 single-seat districts. Hosokawa is expected to dissolve the next House of Representatives for a snap general election some time before the four-year term of the incumbent lower house expires in July 1997.
