"I regret that chairman Kim made remarks of a kind not fitting to a government policy and our public sentiments, causing various problems," Yi said. Kim is said to have stated during his stay in the United States that even if North Korea possesses several nuclear bombs, it doesn't pose any problem. In a comment, Deputy Premier Yi who is also national unification minister said that if North Korea comes to have any nuclear arms, military and political balance between South and North Korea would be shattered outright, bringing about a serious problem to the national security of South Korea. "Our government stand is that North Korea should not possess even a single nuclear weapon and that if they have any, it should be destroyed under all circumstances," Yi said. The deputy prime minister also rejected as "improper" Kim Tae-chung's idea of inviting Kim Il-song to the United States and sending Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to North Korea as a special envoy. His proposition cannot be of any help to the government policy of resolving inter-Korean issues through talks between the direct parties involved, namely, South and North Korea, Yi said.
