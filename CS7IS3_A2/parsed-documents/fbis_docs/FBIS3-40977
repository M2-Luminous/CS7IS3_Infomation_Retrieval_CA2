U.S. President Clinton's first visit to Russia has passed off very fruitfully. It could not have been otherwise: we know one another too well, there was too much that had to be done, and our peoples too were expecting much of us. This visit is based upon the realities of today, and at the same time looks to the future. As regards the difficult past, the U.S. President and I closed that book very firmly back in Vancouver. The work in Moscow proceeded at a tense pace, and purposefully. Specific accords and agreements have been reached which are important both for Russia and for the United States--and for the whole world. The negotiations took place at a crucial time for our country. The old habits and stereotypes are crumbling, an active search for something new is under way both in our country and in the United States. We could be said to be in the throes of a common Russo-American revolution. The citizens of the Russian Federation approved a new constitution at free and democratic elections, and for the first time elected their own parliament without duress. I do not agree with those who think that our first attempt was a flop. If one looks deeper than the individual names and popularist slogans, then all in all, the people have opted for a better life, for legality, and for predictability. This is a lesson which we all still have to learn from in order to prevent mistakes being repeated. I confirmed quite definitely to the U.S. President that our course is aimed at the development and deepening of the reforms, and with stepping up social orientation. I am sure that the country will gain more stability and a sound social peace. Bill Clinton has expressed a subtle understanding of the peculiarities of our situation. You see, the Americans have experienced and are experiencing quite a lot, too. We can count on complete support for the reforms being carried out by the Russian president, the Government, and the reformers in the new parliament. I have talked about both the problems in our economy, about the positive changes in it, and about the elements of stabilization. I stressed that at the present time it is not humanitarian aid that we need but full-blooded cooperation, taking into account the transitional nature of the young market economy of Russia. Specifically I find that, together with the Tokyo package and with Clinton's package in Vancouver, that the most tangible support for Russia would be for the American market to open up to our exports, be it raw materials or machines. I am very content that today an agreement on uranium has at last been signed after two years of talks. Cold war restriction must be removed altogether, restrictions like the Jackson-Vanik Amendment. Artificial barriers imposed under the pretext that Russia is dumping should be removed. And let's just say that the case with our uranium is more likely just fear of competition from more advanced technology and cheaper material. Bill Clinton has done much since Vancouver. He has kept his word as regards dismantling the economic obstructions of the cold war. Discriminatory restrictions have been removed from U.S. internal legislation, or most of them. About 5,000 types of Russian goods are no longer subject to increased taxes. The U.S. President has done much to introduce Russia into international financial and economic organizations. I do not think it will be long before the G-7 becomes the G-8. Russo-American relations have finally moved into the phase of mature, strategic, global partnership in all spheres during these talks. The partnership has opened the way to general understanding, both of the new prospects ahead and of the new problems. We are both convinced that the modern world should be democratic, open, and integrated. As regards equality, mutual benefit, and accounting for each others' interests, there is no need to talk about this anymore, it goes without saying. This principle vector of our partnership is set out in the Moscow declaration which we have signed. It reflects and reinforces the historical improvement in Russian-American relations in Eurasia and the world as a whole. Our mutual activities aimed at strengthening strategic stability and security are taking on new substance. Thanks to them, in the last few months alone the world and our countries have avoided many traps and errors. There is also an evident positive result--the strengthening of cooperation in the sphere of security and disarmament, peace-keeping, cooperation, and economic openness. The ground-breaking step which has finally been taken in Moscow is a denouement in documents leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons in Ukraine. I consider the document which was signed today by the three presidents to be historical. Everyone wins from this, first and foremost the Ukrainian people themselves. The agreements reached at our trilateral summit meeting save resources, get rid of disagreement, and give a good example to other countries. They are reinforced by the Russian-American statement on strengthening all regimes for the non-proliferation of weaponry of mass destruction. And the durability of non-proliferation is at present, as is well known, being seriously tested. The U.S. President brought us right up to date on the 'Partnership for Peace' concept adopted in Brussels. The idea is seemingly from NATO, but it contains a primordial element of Russian-U.S. joint creative work. This concept is an important step in the creation of a security system from Vancouver to Vladivostok, which rules out the formation of new divisive lines or zones of unequal security. We see in this idea one of the options for building a new Europe -- one of them, but not the only one, of course. We shall put specific content into this channel of cooperation, including in the military sphere. And in doing so we shall not, of course, forget the other collective security structures in Europe, above all the well-tried institutions of the United Nations and CSCE. I briefed the President in detail about the integrationary processes that have got under way on the territory of the former Soviet Union, and in particular about the latest summit meetings within the context of the CIS. There need be no fear of any neo-imperialist lust here--Russia's only interest is in stability. It is undertaking honest mediatory efforts to extinguish the hotbeds of conflicts on the perimeters of its new borders. We are ready to cooperate widely and even to coordinate our actions here with the United Nations, the CSCE, and with the entire international community. Unfortunately, the international community itself has not as yet shown a great deal of enthusiasm. There has been a wary reaction to our specific proposals, whether in Abkhazia, Nagorno-Karabakh, or in Tajikistan. I think that the United States and ourselves will now have a greater understanding on this very important question. I firmly raised the question of human rights violations among national minorities, especially in the Baltic area. There should be no double standards here, whether it is taking place in Haiti or in the Baltic area. As a result we adopted a statement with teeth on ensuring human rights, and the President confirmed that he personally would adopt corresponding measures on contacts with the Baltic countries, so that discrimination against the Russian- speaking population there will ultimately be abandoned. I do not want things to sound too upbeat. That does not reflect the nature of our frank and businesslike conversations. There were, and will be, disagreements. But the main thing is the desire to seek understandings, which is later embodied in specific policies. Such is the flight assignment for the Russian-American partnership. It will be a good replacement for the flight assignment for strategic missiles, which will now not be aimed at one another. Thank you.
