ACTION: Notice of Partial Termination of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to a request from IPSCO, Inc., the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of IPSCO, Inc. on September 8, 1994. On October 7, 1994, IPSCO timely withdrew its request for an administrative review of the above referenced order. Because there were no other requests for review of this company from any other interested party, the Department is now terminating this review with respect to IPSCO, Inc. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Elizabeth Patience or Art Stern, Office of Agreements Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20230; telephone (202)482&hyph;3793. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 30, 1994, the Department received a request from IPSCO, Inc. to conduct an administrative review of the antidumping duty order pursuant to ยง353.22(a)(2) of the Department's regulations (19 CFR 353.33(a)(2)). On September 8, 1994, the Department published in the Federal Register a Notice of Initiation for this review (59 FR 46391). On October 7, 1994, IPSCO, Inc. withdrew its request for administrative review. This withdrawal was made within the time limits established in ยง353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations. No other interested party has requested an administrative review of IPSCO's entries in this proceeding. In accordance with ยง353.22(a)(5) of the Department's regulations, the Department has determined to terminate this administrative review for IPSCO, Inc. Absent a review, we shall instruct the Customs Service to liquidate IPSCO's entries. Furthermore, because IPSCO was a previously investigated company, the cash deposit rate will continue to be the company-specific rate found for IPSCO during the investigation, as amended pursuant to an order of the U.S.-Canada binational panel. See Amended Final Determination Pursuant to Binational Panel Order; Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate from Canada, 59 FR 15373 (April 1, 1994). This notice is published in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5). Dated: November 16, 1994. Joseph A. Spetrini, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance.
