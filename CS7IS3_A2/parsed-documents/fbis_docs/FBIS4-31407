[Lecki] Indeed, this does present a rather difficult problem. A voivoda cannot see himself as a representative of local self-government structures. Local self-government has its own representative bodies. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] But surely a voivoda can support in Warsaw the recommendations formulated by self-government activists? [Lecki] There are local self-government assemblies in voivodships that were set up especially to represent regional interests. But the crux of the problem is elsewhere. To what extent should a voivoda represent the interests of the region and to what extent those of the state? By definition, most voivodas hail from the regions in which they hold their office. They are local patriots who have the interests of their voivodships at heart. It is the same with me. For example, I constantly fight for allocation of higher outlays for investments in the local roads network. The Poznan-Pniewy highway is already overloaded to the limits of its possibilities. Decisions involving its modernization are currently in the balance. I would very much like to be able to help in this particular matter, among others. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Do you have much influence? [Lecki] All I can do is formulate my recommendations. For example, a large new residential estate recently developed in Swarzedz is linked by a new road to Highway 2 by a highly dangerous junction, on which many traffic accidents have already been recorded. I have made several written representations in this matter, and they were successful. During this year, the dangerous road junction will be redesigned and reconstructed as a so-called level crossing. The reconstruction will cost 30 billion zlotys [Z]. I had asked for a split-level crossing, but that would have cost Z100 billion, which would be beyond our budget's capacities. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] You take part in the Council of Ministers sessions as a consultant. The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], which belong to the government coalition, claim with increasing insistence that they have differing visions of the planned state administrative reform. Where do you stand with reference to these differing positions? [Lecki] During the government sessions, no differences in the proposed ways of state administration are apparent between the ministers hailing from the SLD and those representing the PSL. The Council of Ministers sessions are conducted in a very open manner, and I believe that the ministers who participate in them do say what they think. We often have polemical arguments, even between ministers from the same political group. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] So do members of the Waldemar Pawlak Cabinet want decentralization, or are they not interested in it? [Lecki] They do want it. The only thing is that they are after a different option. The Suchocka government wanted to reform our state administration from the bottom up. To begin with, they prepared the so-called pilot program, which has already been implemented. The next stage was supposed to be the introduction of the new district scheme. But Minister Michal Strak, head of the Council of Ministers Office, intends to reform the state administration starting from the top. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Which of these concepts was more to your liking? [Lecki] I would have preferred a reform starting from the bottom structures. The majority of local self-government bodies in our voivodship carried out their program very rationally, according to what they should and what they could do. The creation of districts will automatically present us with larger self-government structures, whereas Poznan Voivodship has both small and large parishes: The smallest one has 3,000 residents and the largest 600,000. If the district project does go through, the local authorities would have all of the specialist services at their disposal--for example, the health service, the land-surveying services, housing construction, education, and so on. I believe that such a system would function most efficiently. My position on this subject is influenced by my knowledge of the functioning of the district system before the war. In our part of the country, they proved to be very effective indeed. Even after the war, despite the restrictions of the totalitarian system, the district scheme worked well, creating a sense of local patriotism and commitment. On the other hand, I am well aware that, in Poland's eastern regions, they are not particularly keen to see the introduction of the district system. So the government really finds itself between a rock and a hard place. [passage omitted] [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Minister Strak insists that local self-government works well only in small parishes and in residential estates. Anything larger is not genuine local self-government. According to him, the problem is that small-scale local self-government serves mainly to promote the interests of small local elite groups and individual self-government activists. [Lecki] I suspect that there is some reason for Minister Strak's claims because there is indeed a group of self-government activists who promote the thesis of the inevitability of conflict between government and local administration. Personally, I believe that this thesis is incorrect. From the example of my own voivodship, I can state that, in the case of a decided majority of local self-government structures, there is no conflict at all. At the present moment, a political conflict has superimposed itself, as it were, on the apparent conflict between the central and local administration, the supposed existence of which has been postulated by certain politicians. The government is of a left-wing persuasion, whereas local self-government structures are largely represented by people who cherish right-wing views. I remember a number of sessions of our local self-government structures at which Prime Minister Suchocka was present. You could always count on spirited argument and debate during those meetings. On the other hand, the debates that took place recently at the Arena Hall were, in my opinion, below certain adopted parliamentary standards. Such levels of aggression, encouraged from two sides, are harmful also for the future of local self-government structures. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How did your cooperation with the Voivodship Assembly go? [Lecki] That was during the first term of office of the newly revived local self-government structures and, naturally, also the first term of office of the Self-Government Assembly. The assembly's range of competence was rather unclear and that was why, especially during the first stage of our cooperation, certain controversial issues arose. But, by the end of their first term of office, the common plane of cooperation between the voivoda and the Self-Government Assembly became much better defined and more clear. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] What have you done to prevent the possibility of corruption in the Voivodship Office? [Lecki] We have our own monitoring system. We treat all information, including even anonymous messages, most seriously. I must stress that, over the past four years, I received only one message informing me that an official in our office had taken a bribe. In any case, it was such a ridiculously small sum of money that it reminded me of a prewar joke: "You must be especially careful not to offend a civil servant with a bribe that is too low to match his position." The Planning Department is the most frequent ground for leveling accusations of corruption against our officials. This is because that department usually has to decide in contentious cases, where the losers usually then accuse the officials involved of dishonestly and corruption. On the other hand, privatization is protected with such watertight regulations that practically no scope for corruption is left. [passage omitted] [GAZETA POZNANSKA] How much do your officials earn? [Lecki] I pay salaries of Z7-8 million gross to my directors. Other employees get much: The average salary is about Z4 million. [GAZETA POZNANSKA] Where is the limit of your loyalty as a government official? [Lecki] I would like to serve as voivoda for as long as I can personally endorse the government's policy. The policy tenets of Prime Minister Pawlak's government are not, on the whole, much different from those of Prime Minister Suchocka's government. There are, of course, certain subtle differences, but they concern details. As for privatization, the principles of its implementation are no different from those mapped out by Minister Lewandowski.
