As expected, during this final meeting the two parties' delegations agreed on a document of around 20 pages which will be published today after the meeting of the UDF political office followed by an extraordinary meeting of the RPR political office. "We have reached agreement on a document which will constitute the joint UDF-RPR platform in the European elections," RPR Secretary General Alain Juppe said, expressing the view that this is an "extremely positive step." Stressing the significance of this "responsible approach," UDF Secretary General Francois Bayrou added: "We have chosen not to compete with each other on the European plan" and to find an agreement on "the slight differences between our two parties." This document, which is "pragmatic" according to Pierre Lellouche (RPR) and which deals with many subjects (the expansion of the Community, the institutions, the Economic and Monetary Union, unemployment, defense), advocates "a Europe which is stronger in its political decisions," UDF spokesman Jean-Pierre Raffarin explained. Only by reading the document will we know what concessions each party has made with a view to this agreement, whose significance is primarily political. At all events, the pleased expressions on the faces of the various negotiators prove that everybody is satisfied by it. Alain Juppe stressed that all the right conditions had now been established for "the joint RPR-UDF list to be drawn up." "We have the same concept of Europe," the RPR secretary general said, and "we have pledged to sit in the same group in the European Parliament." That leaves the question of who will head the list, which has still not been decided, although Jean-Francois Deniau, currently the big favorite, was at rue de Lille yesterday, as was Dominique Baudis, another standard bearer of the European cause.
