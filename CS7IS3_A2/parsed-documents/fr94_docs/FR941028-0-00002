FR941028-0-00002 FR941028-0-00001 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;78&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9052; AD 94&hyph;22&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 Series Airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes, that requires modification of the power transfer unit (PTU). This amendment is prompted by reports of fatigue cracks found in the drain port housings of the PTU's on several airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the PTU housing due to fatigue cracking, which could result in the loss of both hydraulic systems (until the PTU is shut off). DATES: Effective October 28, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 28, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Dept. L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Los Angeles Aircraft Certification Office, Transport Airplane Directorate, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Walter Eierman, Systems and Equipment Branch, ANM&hyph;131L, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Los Angeles ACO, 3229 East Spring Street, Long Beach, California 90806&hyph;2425; telephone (310) 988&hyph;5336; fax (310) 988&hyph;5210. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1994 (59 FR 38146). That action proposed to require modification of the power transfer unit (PTU). Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposal. Two commenters requested that the proposed compliance time of ``14,300 flight cycles on the PTU or 9 months after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later,'' be extended. These commenters are concerned that they will be unable to modify their affected fleets within the proposed compliance time due to a possible problem in the availability of an ample number of required parts from the manufacturer. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request to extend the compliance time. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the availability of required parts and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. The FAA has been advised that an ample number of required parts will be available for modification of the U.S. fleet within the proposed compliance period. However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA will consider requests for adjustments to the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level of safety. The applicability of the final rule has been revised to delete the reference to Model ``DC&hyph;9&hyph;84 (MD&hyph;84).'' This inclusion of this reference was in error; no such model of airplane exists. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 1,074 Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;80 series airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 578 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $2,912 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,752,496, or $3,032 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.
