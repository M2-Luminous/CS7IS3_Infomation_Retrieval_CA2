With the pride in having carried out the Third Seven-Year Plan (1987-1993) under the changed situation and manifold hardships, the Korean people have risen up again in a fruitful struggle to carry through the revolutionary economic strategy of the party. At the 21st plenary meeting of the sixth Central Committee, the Workers' Party of Korea, on the basis of a profound analysis of the changed situation and actual demands of socialist construction in our country, set two or three years to come as a period of adjustment in socialist economic construction and put forward a strategic policy of directing primary efforts to agriculture, light industry and foreign trade in this period. "Let us bring about a great upsurge in economic construction in the spirit of Chollima spurred on by the `Speed of the 90's'!" In response to this militant slogan of the party, the Working People of Korea are hardening their determination to carry through the new strategic policy of socialist construction. The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il said: "Just as we have advanced so far, upholding the revolutionary slogan of self-reliance and hard struggle, so in the future we should hold high this slogan and smash the anti-socialist moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries and accomplish the socialist cause." Still alive are the spirit and the stamina with which they brought about a great upswing of Chollima in response to the resolution of the historic December, 1956, plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the party calling them to maximum production and economy in the days when the internal and external situation was grim after the war. The revolutionary banner of self-reliance and hard struggle was the only banner that we had to hold high when we were reconstructing the economy with bare hands on war ruins. Our people, upholding this revolutionary banner, shattered the silly talk of the enemy that Korea would not be able to rise again in a hundred years and turned Korea into a socialist industrial state from scratch in the spirit of Chollima that gallops ten steps, nay a hundred steps, when others take one step. By effecting another great upsurge in socialist economic construction in this revolutionary spirit, the Working People of Korea are building our-style socialism into an invincible bulwark, resolutely smashing the moves of the imperialists and the reactionaries to blockade and stifle the DPRK economically. The whole country is seething with revolutionary enthusiasm, though it is not long after the new policy of socialist economic strategy was set forth. Mass meetings to carry through the resolution of the plenary meeting were held in all parts of the country. More than 100,000 Pyongyang citizens held a mass meeting and resolved to take the lead in carrying through the new strategic policy of the party. In accordance with the strategic policy of the party, the agricultural working people are pushing ahead with the work for completing the technical revolution in the countryside set forth in the rural theses and carry on farm work on a scientific and technical basis as demanded by the farming method of chuche so as to place all sectors of agricultural production on a new, higher level. Well-planned operations have been launched to modernize light industrial factories still further, expand the variety of consumer goods and decisively improve their quality. And a thorough-going organizational work has been undertaken to increase the production of exports in all fields of the national economy and actively explore foreign markets for a new turn in the development of foreign trade. The work of economic organisation is geared to the new economic strategy. The working people of Korea are making energetic efforts to create "the speed of general march of our-style socialism" with confidence in victory and optimism, undaunted by any political and ideological offensive of the imperialists and the reactionaries and their economic blockade.
