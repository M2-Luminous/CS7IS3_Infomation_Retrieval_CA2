ACTION: Amendment of NOFA and announcement of OMB control number.

Jones, Office of Resident Initiatives, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 7th Street SW., room 4233, Washington, DC 20410; telephone (202) 708&hyph;4233.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Because of unforeseen circumstances, the availability of the application kit for the funds announced in this NOFA has been delayed. Therefore, the Department also is extending the deadline for applications accordingly. In addition, this amendment issues an interpretation that is the result of inquiries following the publication of the NOFA, and publishes the control number assigned by OMB for the information collection requirements associated with this NOFA.

The Youth Development Initiative will be a grant competition under FIC, as a part of ``Operation Safe Home,'' a major Clinton Administration Initiative that addresses the larger problem of violence in America's low-income communities. Five $1 million grants will be awarded to Public Housing Authorities for innovative strategies for curbing crime among youth, and for youth leadership and development programs that will provide young individuals in public housing with better access to comprehensive education, employment opportunities, and supportive services to achieve self-sufficiency.
