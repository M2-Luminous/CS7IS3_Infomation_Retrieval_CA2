A short while ago I had a telephone conversation with Professor Petrov, head of the Military Medical Academy, who informed me that after a thorough checkup and examination today at 0800, the medical team of the Military-Medical Academy's Lozenets Hospital in Sofia established that the condition of Professor Lyuben Berov, who suffered a heart attack yesterday, is slowly stabilizing. The basic symptoms of the heart attack have been overcome, and the patient is in good spirits. There will be a news conference with the Lozenets Hospital medical team at the Governmental Press Center at 1400 today regarding the health condition of Prof. Lyuben Berov. With your permission, I would like to add something. I want to officially deny the nonsense -- to put it mildly -- published in some of today's newspapers regarding the prime minister's condition. I would like to invite correspondents to the news conference to learn about the prime minister's condition. Apparently some of them would like the prime minister to be in much worse condition than he already is. One more thing: No one has been fired at the Council of Ministers. A newspaper today even claimed that Georgi Nedev, the chief of the Prime Minister's Office, was fired yesterday. I want to deny this report. Nothing similar has happened, and I hope nothing will happen because the government is functioning normally. The prime minister's scheduled meetings with representatives of various Bulgarian and foreign institutions will be carried out by his deputies. As you know, the prime minister yesterday signed an order according to which, during his sick leave, he will be replaced by Deputy Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev. Thank you very much.
