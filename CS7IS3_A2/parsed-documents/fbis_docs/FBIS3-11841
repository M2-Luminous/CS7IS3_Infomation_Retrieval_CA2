Less than 5 percent of this immense amount of drug was seized and destroyed in 1993 despite the Armed Forces joining the fight to eradicate this scourge. Powerful international market forces have consolidated a demand that pressures -- in the face of the lack of real and competitive alternatives, besides many other factors -- humble coca-producing peasants who have gradually become cocaine base producers. Given the business' illegal characteristic, the "firms" and organized gangs that stock cocaine base and transport it either domestically or abroad are the ones that obtain the greatest percentage of the "added value." This is so because the risk of transporting this particular kind of merchandise to Colombian laboratories where it is transformed into cocaine hydrochloride is very big. This business requires armed groups for protection and for administering an efficient and modern corruption network at all levels. The latter is much more important than the former to ensure the business' success. That is why new "clandestine" airports are opened as soon as others are closed down. The solution to this problem has social aspects and presupposes very large financial investments. It also requires efficient and intelligent police repression. But no matter how you look at it, there is no justification for military intervention in drug enforcement. If the power of drug trafficking to finance terrorism has been clearly established, it is senseless to allow -- now under the current situation of subversion -- the Armed Forces to assume the main responsibility for fighting this scourge in the drug trafficking zones. The risks are very big and the consequences very serious. Once I heard a high-ranking Army officer commissioned to the Huallaga Front say: "...my officers go out with very high morale; they are willing to confront the subversives and fight under the most difficult conditions, but I am not sure they can resist an envelope with $10,000." The case is that if a battalion officer engages in criminal actions, he is interested in involving other soldiers to ensure their silence and avoid sanctions. A wrongly understood comradeship could end in complicity. Those who do not accept such complicity can be the object of arbitrary sanctions or persecution by other officers involved in drug trafficking. There are also many other honest officers who do not accept getting involved but prefer to remain silent in order to avoid problems. The case of "Vaticano" has negatively affected the Armed Forces' image, especially the Army. Why must the Armed Forces continue doing a job that strictly pertains to the police? Would it not be better to look for another Ketin Vidal [police officer who arrested Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman] to fight drug trafficking?
