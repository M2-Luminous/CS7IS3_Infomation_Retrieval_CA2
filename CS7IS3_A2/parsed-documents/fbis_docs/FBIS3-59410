Do you think that the AC is addressing itself to all of Romanian society? 2. How would you evaluate the effectiveness of the AC? 3. Could it be more effective? What has prevented this? 4. What do you think the AC will be like five years from now? And what will civil society in Romania be like? Gabriel Andreescu, chairman of the Civic Alliance, responded: 1. The Civic Alliance is addressing itself to the entire Romanian society, but this does not mean that the entire Romanian society is receptive to the AC. However, the principal values that it would like to impart--human rights and freedoms, the principles of the state of law, the "humanistic" rationality of social and political life--are, certainly, general problems. 2. The ensuring of a convincing selection system in regard to the candidates for president in September 1992 was a concrete success. But, certainly, there are indirect results. We must not forget that the AC provides humanitarian assistance, through its medical-social center, as well as juridical and other assistence. 3. The AC could be better than it is. The failure of the cooperation between the AC and the AC [as published -- probably the PAC (Civic Alliance Party)] seems to me the most important obstacle. 4. The optimistic response is: The civil society is an independent reality in a Romanian society in which institutional mechanisms, which are certainly imperfect, develop, nevertheless, in the direction of democracy. The pessimistic variant is: Heroic groups of the civil society are operating in a society dominated by a Latin American type of oligarchy, accepting sacrifices to the point of the physical elimination of members so that the mechanism and human dignity will resist in this new form of historic bankruptcy. According to the two variants, the AC will either be the shield of a variety of civic institutions (for example, "the Institute for the Study of Totalitarianism") or it will signify the street revolutions of December 1989, and June 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993.... Ana Blandiana, member of the Steering Committee of the Civic Alliance 1. Yes. It definitely addresses itself to the entire society. The impression that it might address itself to only side comes from the fact that its obvious impact is in that part of society which accepts the rules of the democratic game. Through its activity, the Alliance is trying to make this part of society larger. 2. The nomination of a candidate for president or the creation of a party regardless of how relations have developed with this party --or activity within the framework of the Democratic Convention, of which I was one of the founders. The true success is, I believe, the existence throughout the country of branches which live and breathe even under these conditions, in which difficulties of all types affect not only the people themselves but also their ability to associate and join together in organizations. These branches, with everything around them, are nuclei, seeds of a civil society, which are essential for democracy. 3. Yes, indeed. The way in which it began three years ago showed more promise. But then came the difficulty of organizing a group of people under conditions in which we did not have any headquarters -- as of now we have only three rooms, which we have subleased in Bucharest -- or basic material resources. The fuel on which we operated was and is nothing but moral drive. 4. If I were optimistic, I would have to imagine that, in five years, there will be the solemn moment of the dissolution of the Civic Alliance because the civil society no longer has any need of it. The Alliance has as its principal tasks the teaching of the alphabet of democracy, the transformation of the mentality of a population that, for years, has voted for its masters, into that of a sentient electorate which must vote for its servants, whom it can recall if they do not fulfill their contract with the civil society. Alina Inayeh, coordinating chairman of the Pro-Democracy Association 1. I do not believe that it addresses the entire society. 2. It does not seem to me that the activity of the AC has been effective since it has not addressed all the segments of society. 3. If it had known how to use the immense political capital which it had and the confidence placed in it when it appeared on the scene, then the message of the AC would have been able to penetrate into the entire society. 4. The role of the AC in five years depends greatly on the AC itself and if it is able to recover the confidence lost. Otherwise, there is a danger that its importance will be diminished even more. As for civil society, in general, it will continue the process of crystallization without achieving a perfect society. Bogdan Hossu, chairman of the "Alfa" cartel, deputy chairman of the World Confederation of Labor 1. We hope that this is the role of the Alliance and that it includes all segments of the civil society. 2-3. I could not say right now. The only thing which comes to mind is a good meeting that they had. I know of several roundtable sessions which they had with representatives of the executive branch, the governing party, and the opposition. You should know that civil society has taken a big step forward through this initiative. 4. I hope that civil society will be much more deserving and more aware of its strength. The leaders of the Students' League hesitated to make a statement about the AC, on the grounds that they have belonged to the League for only one year, during which time they did not have any cooperation with the AC. In addition, the AC lost points for being caustic and radical. Dan Martian from the Party of Social Democracy of Romania politely, but firmly, refused to give any statements on the occasion of the anniversary of the Civic Alliance but provided us, instead, with pertinent definitions of the concept of civil society.
