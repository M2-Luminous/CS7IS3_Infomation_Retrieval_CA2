FBIS4-50971 "drchi100_n_94009" FBIS-CHI-94-100 Daily Report 24 May 1994 Economic & Agricultural Official on Multinationals' Headquarters in Beijing Official on Multinationals' Headquarters in Beijing HK2405073594 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS in English 24 May 94 p 25 HK2405073594 Hong Kong EASTERN EXPRESS English BFN [By Wang Xiangwei] [Text] China is drawing up policies to lure foreign multinational companies to set up their regional headquarters there, according to a senior official with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade & Economic Co-operation (Moftec). Ma Xiuhong, deputy director general of the ministry's foreign investment administration, also said yesterday that the ministry would allow foreign multinational companies to set up investment vehicles to make direct investments in the country on a trial basis. They would also be encouraged to invest in capital and technology-intensive projects. Analysts said last night that the new policies would pose a serious challenge to Hong Kong and Singapore where foreign companies currently base their regional headquarters to direct their investment and trade in China. Although Ma did not give any further details, analysts said that the new policies signalled China's efforts to shift its focus from attracting small and mid-size foreign companies to multinationals for their deep pockets, advanced technologies, and management experience. Ma said that last year foreign investors spent U.S.$ 27.5bn (about HK$214.5bn), up 150 per cent over 1992. But that figure is only one fifth of the more than U.S.$110bn total foreign investment committed to China in 1993. To date, China has approved 174,000 foreign-funded projects with the contract value of foreign investment amounting to U.S.$221.8bn, of which U.S.$61.8bn has already been invested. Meanwhile, Zheng Silin, vice minister of Moftec, said that China's foreign trade is estimated to reach U.S.$1,000bn in the next seven years. Last year, foreign trade was U.S.$195.8bn, of which imports accounted for U.S.$104bn. Both Zheng and Ma made the remarks at a seminar, part of an on-going trade and investment conference organized by Moftec and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. The event, which lasts until Thursday, is the largest of its kind held in the territory.
