"Giving tribute to the competence, courage and the contribution which Yegor Gaydar made into the course of economic reform, I understand the arguments and motives which made him offer to resign", Yeltsin said in a statement received by TASS. "Accepting this resignation I would like to stress the irreversibility of the course of reform aimed at a deep and democratic transformation of the Russian society, its economy and political institutions. The policy of reform will continue proceeding from democratic principles which are the basis of the new Russian Constitution and with account, first and foremost, of the national and strategic Russian interests", the president said. "I express conviction that while working in the State Duma Yegor Gaydar will proceed from the supreme interests of serving Russia like he did in his previous activities", according to the statement distributed by presidential spokesman Vyacheslav Kostikov. This is the second time that Gaydar has to abandon his post in the government. In December 1992 Yeltsin replaced him with Viktor Chernomyrdin after a severe conflict with the parliament on the course of reform. Gaydar returned to the government as first deputy premier in the middle of September 1993. After December 12 parliamentary elections Yeltsin said at a press conference that Gaydar will remain in the government and reforms will continue.
