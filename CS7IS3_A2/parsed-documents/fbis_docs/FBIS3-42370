They can happen anywhere. I don't believe this incident will deflect the Jordanians from the correct course and the wise policy pursued by the king. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Is it true there was a political message to the Jordanian regime behind the incident? [Abu-Talib] According to my own analysis, the motives for the incident were political and were intended to harm both Jordan and Lebanon. The perpetrators were criminals supported by agent regimes, which still resort to such incidents. [Correspondent] Who are these agent regimes? [Abu-Talib] I cannot identify them. As I told you, those who committed this criminal act did not serve the interest of Lebanon or the Arab nation. [Correspondent] Are they Arab or non-Arab regimes? [Abu-Talib] Soon you will start interrogating me. [Correspondent] Today's reports say the culprits are Palestinians, do they not? [Abu-Talib] I heard what you heard. [Correspondent] Have you confirmed this? [Abu-Talib] We have not. [Correspondent] Do you suspect any particular quarter? [Abu-Talib] We hold nearly all the main leads. But we cannot tell the press because we do not want to infringe upon Lebanese security or the judicial authorities in Lebanon and play a role that is not ours to play.
