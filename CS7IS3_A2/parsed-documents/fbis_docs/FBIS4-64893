"We should make it clear to Turkey that it cannot become a member of the European Union," Schaeuble told a meeting of Christian business people in Mainz. By doing so, one would do Turkey a favor and support the nonfundamentalist approach in Turkish politics. In Schaeuble's view, only such countries that are based on the Christian-Western tradition could be considered for membership to the European Union. This is why Russia, which apart from its European part also consists of an Asian part, cannot join the European Union either. At the same time, Schaeuble spoke out in favor of letting Turkey participate in the economic advantages resulting from the process of European unification. He also welcomed Turkish membership in the Council of Europe in Strasbourg. Hermann Rappe, chairman of the trade union of chemical workers, also ruled out Turkish EU membership. In the long term, however, membership of Central European countries would be possible.
