First, whatever its type, no foreign trade or industrial and trade enterprise can use a registerer's trademark without his permission, with such excuses as having "shared" the use of the trademark or having been its goods-supply unit. Second, a trademark registerer must adopt effective measures to protect his trademark properly. If he finds his trademark rights are being violated, he can -- upon obtaining necessary proof -- file a suit with the Administration for Industry and Commerce and a law court or with an administrative organ for economic relations and foreign trade. Third, all levels of administrative organs for economic relations and foreign trade must act strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Trademark Act and should render necessary support for the complaints lodged by a unit the trademark rights of which are violated. They must deal with trademark violators sternly, whether they are units that supply trademarked goods, or not. Enterprises that abuse the trademarks of others to a serious extent or that do not change this practice after repeated warnings must be punished. Persons with the main responsibility should be given necessary administrative punishments. [Signed] 20 March 1992 The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade
