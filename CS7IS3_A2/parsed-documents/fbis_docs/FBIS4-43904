Headed by SPD Chairman Rudolf Scharping, the party leaders want to set the final course for the one-day congress on Wednesday. Before the meeting, leading Social Democrats expressed the conviction that the party congress will put the SPD on the offensive again after the defeat at the European elections. Chairman Scharping, who is to be officially elected as the SPD's candidate for the chancellor's office in Halle, will be strengthened for entering the conflict with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen. "I expect the party congress to give a strong signal that we accept the challenges and dare a new beginning for a policy of reforms and renewal." The European election is over; the struggle for the majority in the Federal Government is starting only now. The party leadership also expects with excitement Scharping's speech on Wednesday, with which he wants to motivate the SPD again for the struggle for the change in government in Bonn. In addition to Scharping's election, the approximately 500 delegates intend to adopt a government program. If the party leadership has its way, a coalition debate will be avoided at any cost, even though delegates have announced motions for an alliance with the Greens. After the Presidium meeting, the Executive Committee and the Party Council will meet in Halle in the afternoon. In the evening, the SPD top politicians plan to intervene in the Landtag election campaign in Saxony-Anhalt by holding several rallies. A new parliament will be elected there next Sunday.
