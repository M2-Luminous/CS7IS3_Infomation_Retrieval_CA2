Is It a Group of a Dozen Persons or 10,000-20,000 Persons as Claimed by the Enemies of the Nation?"] [Text] The enemies of the nation have always cursed Democratic Kampuchea, a force that has been fighting the aggressor Vietnamese to defend the Cambodian nation, race, independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity for the past 15 years. Some of them have claimed that there were just a dozen Khmer Rouge; others said there were 10,000-20,000 Khmer Rouge without any popular support, and so on. The Americans, the French, the Australians, the communist Vietnamese, the puppets of the communist Vietnamese, and the puppets of the Americans have also made the same claim. They have never ceased to praise themselves and their own associates. Although they have failed in their repeated attempts at gratifying themselves, they have not stopped trying to do so. What is Democratic Kampuchea? How is Democratic Kampuchea? To understand what Democratic Kampuchea really is, let us take a look at the successive wars. 1. Just in the Vietnamese war of aggression from 1978 to 1991, how many aggressor Vietnamese were killed on the Cambodian battlefield? The command of the aggressor communist Vietnamese admitted that 30,000 aggressor Vietnamese troops were killed and 150,000 others were wounded. These are the figures officially and overtly admitted by the communist Vietnamese themselves. In reallity, no fewer than 100,000 aggressor Vietnamese were killed, no fewer than 100,000 were wounded, and no fewer than 100,000 others deserted. In the original war when the communist Vietnamese first attacked Cambodia at the end of 1978, the aggressor communist Vietnamese used 250,000 troops. After that, beginning from 1980, every year the aggressor communist Vietnamese brought in three to four additional 10,000 to 12,000-strong divisions. Therefore, there were no fewer than 600,000 communist Vietnamese troops involved in Cambodia's invasion. Besides the soldiers, there were 50,000 civilian experts who were controlling their administrative apparatuses. Consequently, there should be no fewer than 100,000 killed, no fewer than 100,000 wounded, and no fewer than 100,000 deserters. 2. Wonder is expressed at how a few 10,000 Democratic Kampuchea troops were capable of defeating the communist Vietnamese. Analysts in general have clearly observed that Democratic Kampuchea has always been close to the nation and people throughout the country like flesh and blood or fish in the water. They have received all kinds of support from the people, especially from the peasants. The Cambodian nation and people have also made the same observation. Therefore, if the enemies of the nation attacked Democratic Kampuchea it was the same thing as if they attacked the entire Cambodian nation and people, especially the nearly 7 million peasants. If they wished to carry on the war, they would surely meet the same fate as the other aggressors before them. National opinion in all circles, be it in Phnom Penh or in the provinces, as well as international opinion and particularly the countries in the region clearly see that the attempt to continue kindling the war by the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, and their two categories of puppets cannot crush the Cambodian national resistance; it can only make their difference with the nation and people more acute and make solving the Cambodia problem impossible. Therefore, the way to bring genuine peace back to Cambodia is to achieve national reconciliation, which is like using water to put off the flames of war and not adding fuel to them.
