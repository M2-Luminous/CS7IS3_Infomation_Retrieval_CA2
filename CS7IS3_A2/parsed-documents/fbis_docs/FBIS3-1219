In an interview with our political news staff Mr. Botha said there were fears for the life of former Ciskei military leader, Brigadier Oupa Gqozo. He said the South African Defense Force had been deployed and was on full alert to intervene if necessary. The South African ambassador to Ciskei, Mr. Piet Goosen, has been appointed interim administrator until the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] appoints two administrators to take over the running of the homeland. A crowd of about 8,000 people has gathered at the stadium at Bisho to be addressed by Brigadier Gqozo. Brigadier Gqozo was supposed to be at the stadium at 1100 but didn't arrive. A delegation of the Transitional Executive Council which has arrived in King William's Town will decide later if Brigadier Gqozo will address the people at the stadium.
