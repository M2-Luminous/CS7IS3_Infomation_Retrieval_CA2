The UNPROFOR representatives have established that heavy arms had been withdrawn to the appropriate distance and that there were no obstacles to the functioning of the agreement signed in Zagreb. [Dusan Loncar, general in the Serbian army of the Krajina] In a military and tactical sense, by withdrawing to a distance of 1.5 km in some places, we have primarily safeguarded the safety of our residents, so that nobody within the reach of the infantry arms would be endangered, which does not mean that a sort of demobilization is starting now. On the contrary. The basic stance of all officers and members of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps is that we must continue strengthening our combat readiness. [Gajdosevic] The UNPROFOR representatives did not hide their satisfaction over the signing of the agreement, emphasizing that their task is not over yet. [Vim Van Dyke, commander of Sector East, in English with superimposed translation] UNPROFOR in the Sector East is ready to help the sides in the implementation of the agreement. [Gajdosevic] The representatives of the Serbian army of the republic of Serbian Krajina emphasized that the village of Mirkovici is mostly under the control of the army of the republic of Serbian Krajina. [Vojislav Stojkovic, colonel in the Serbian Army of Krajina] One of the most difficult and most controversial points in the zone of responsibility of the Slavonija-Baranja Corps was precisely Mirkovici. I think that through these talks we have succeeded to resolve this issue and, therefore, the separating line will not be such as drawn in Annex D of the cease-fire agreement, signed in Zagreb on 29 March, but will be considerably more favorable for the residents of Mirkovci. [Gajdosevic] The Serbian village of Karadzicevo has ended up in the so-called security zone. However, it is emphasized here that the Serbian people will be safe. Beside UNPROFOR, 75 of our policemen will take care of them, while the army of the republic of Serbian Krajina will be 1 km away. [end recording]
