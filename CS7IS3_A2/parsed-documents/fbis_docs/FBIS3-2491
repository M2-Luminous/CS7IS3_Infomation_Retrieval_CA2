Wang was pulled in for questioning at 7:00 p.m. (1100 GMT), friends said, adding that he was released several hours later. His interrogation followed the broadcast Monday of an interview Wang gave to the American ABC television network regarding last week's police sweep of dissidents in Beijing and Shanghai. "If the government continues their widespread arrests then we will at least have to engage in collective protest," Wang said in the interview. Wang had been picked up last Wednesday and held for 24 hours, during which time he was told to leave Beijing ahead of the annual session of the Chinese parliament which opens Thursday. Wang was released from prison on parole in February last year after serving two years of a four-year jail term for his leading role in the 1989 pro-democracy movement. His latest interrogation came as tension between Washington and Beijing over the dissident crackdown intensified, with harsh words flying between the two governments just days before the visit here of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher. China indicated once again that it would not tolerate external pressure on the issue of human rights, slamming U.S. condemnation of its ongoing police sweep and accusing Washington of interference in its internal affairs. China has detained at least eight activists in the past week, including the country's most celebrated dissident Wei Jingsheng. Some dissidents, including Wei, have been released while others are thought to have been escorted from the capital to their hometowns.
