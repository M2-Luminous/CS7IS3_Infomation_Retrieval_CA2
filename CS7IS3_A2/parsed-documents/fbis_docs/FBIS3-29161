Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the influential Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said, "overall, the budget plan attaches importance to the need to stimulate the economy and improve social infrastructure." Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said the budget is well balanced. "Although austere in general, it allows for more than 4.0 percent growth in expenses for public works projects," he said. Inaba said, however, that the outlay for public works should have been weighted toward projects that improve citizens' livelihood. "The administration of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa should have exercized more political leadership if it wanted to achieve the reforms it has pledged," he said. Inaba called for early implementation of the budget, and said the government should also be prepared to respond to any volatile movement of the yen on foreign exchange markets or a slide in stock prices. Hiraiwa also stressed that it is important for the government to introduce appropriate measures in a timely fashion. He expressed concern that the sharp appreciation of the yen against the U.S. dollar in recent days may weaken the intended effects of the third supplementary budget for fiscal 1993 and the budget for fiscal 1994.
