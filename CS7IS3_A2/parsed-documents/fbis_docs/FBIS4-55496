[Granic] Very positively. I believe that this is a key step in the implementation of the Washington Agreement, that is, it is a key step [words indistinct] federation [word indistinct] the Croats on (a fair basis), which will be [word indistinct], and which will be to the mutual interest of both the Bosniaks and the Croats, and the other citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Of course, we want this to be a firm federation that will be in a confederal relationship with the Republic of Croatia, and again to mutual benefit and interests. There can be no [words indistinct] confederation, mutual interests. We talked about this a lot, and [word indistinct] the talks with certain agreements [word indistinct]. The primary problem is the problem of the humanitarian convoys, the problem of energy facilities, transportation, refugees, and so on. Of course, this [words indistinct] through better cooperation. [Hodzic] Do you believe that what has been agreed in Vienna will be successfully implemented on the ground? [Granic] Well, I am an optimist. Both sides have to make maximum efforts. There will be individual resistance to the agreement, and one has to expect that, but if [words indistinct] then the agreement will be implemented. [Hodzic] How much does the ministerial meeting in Geneva respect the agreement from Vienna? [Granic] Well, in any case it is not against the Vienna agreement, and it is primarily directed at the third side, that is, how to get the Serbs to the negotiating table, how to achieve a cease-fire, and how to implement the agreement. As for the main part of it, that is, the territories, [word indistinct], and so on, [word indistinct] is the negotiating position. I heard today that [Bosnian Serb official Momcilo] Krajisnik has said that even 51 percent for the federation is too much. That is their negotiating position. The international community has presented its negotiating position. [Hodzic] How would you comment on what the ministers here agreed on as far as the solution to the Bosnia-Herzegovina situation is concerned? [Granic] I think it is all right in principle, which means that a (contact) group has been formed to monitor the cease-fire and the negotiations, and that is what Croatia supports. [Hodzic] Mr. Granic, thank you.
