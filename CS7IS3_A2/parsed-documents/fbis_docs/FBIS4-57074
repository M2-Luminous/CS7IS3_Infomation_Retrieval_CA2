How can this plan be implemented when no progress has been made in the constitutional revision process concerning tax reforms and the streamlining of the state, and when expenditures continue to be greater than revenues? These doubts, which have overwhelmed economic agents and have provoked two days of sharp declines in the Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo stock markets, were only temporarily dispelled yesterday when Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero announced that the date and details for the implementation of the real will be announced on 9 May. JORNAL DO BRASIL has published a study by economist Eduardo Felipe Ohana, former deputy secretary in the Finance Ministry and an expert in public finances, who has shown that it will not be possible to obtain a budget surplus this year, despite former Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso's assurance that a budget surplus would be guaranteed by the economic stabilization and deindexation plan, through the creation of the real. According to Ohana, the 1994 draft budget that was just submitted to Congress will not yield the expected $7 billion surplus but will, rather, result unexpectedly in a $15 billion deficit. The reasons for this unexpected reversion of trends are the excessive increase in personnel and health spending that was transferred from the social security budget to the federal budget, and the excessive growth in payments to federal government employees and social security beneficiaries. By contrast, economic deindexation and the reduction of monthly inflation to virtually zero will do away with financial speculation. Consequently, fiscal revenues from the IOF [financial operations tax] and IPMF [provisional tax on financial operations] will decline markedly. Ohana estimates this drop, which was not duly measured by the formulators of the budget, in $3.5 billion. To make things worse, the government will have to adopt a tighter monetary policy, with high real interest rates, to prevent a flight of savings toward consumption from stimulating demand and from pushing prices in reals upwards. This will put an additional burden on public debt servicing. Some economists, including some of those working for the government, have conceded that the failure of the constitutional revision process has jeopardized the possibility of eliminating the deficit. Following the virtual deadlock of the proposed constitutional changes in the economic area, which would entail the revision by Congress of monopolies and the treatment of foreign capital, no one believes in the possibility of far-reaching reforms concerning tax laws, such as a redefinition of the federal government's accord with states and municipalities, or a reformulation of the bankrupt social security system. A redefinition of the size and functions of the state was and continues to be fundamental to eliminating the tax burden Brazilian society would have to pay to maintain the public sector in operation. From there on, it would also be possible to make decisive progress in the privatization program, and the proceeds obtained through the sale of properties considered to be superfluous for the new Brazilian state could be used to repay Treasury debts. Because these premises appear to be no longer feasible, the path for stabilization has become narrower and more dangerous. Brazilian society is therefore anxiously waiting to hear encouraging words from Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero when he introduces the real on 9 May.
