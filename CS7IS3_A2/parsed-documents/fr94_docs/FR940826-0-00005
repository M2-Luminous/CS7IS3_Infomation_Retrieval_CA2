FR940826-0-00005 FR940826-0-00002 7 CFR Parts 907, 908, and 910 [Docket No. FV94&hyph;907&hyph;2] Termination of Provisions of Marketing Orders 907, 908, and 910; Navel and Valencia Oranges Grown in Arizona and Designated Parts of California; Lemons Grown in California and Arizona AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Termination order. SUMMARY: This document terminates the Federal marketing orders regulating the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California and lemons grown in California and Arizona. The Secretary of Agriculture has found that these marketing orders no longer tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937. In a press release issued on May 16, 1994, the Department of Agriculture announced the intention to terminate the orders for California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons, noting the division and turmoil in the industry and that the programs are not functioning as they should. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Christian Nissen, Marketing Specialist, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, Room 2522&hyph;S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456; telephone: (202) 720&hyph;5127; or Maureen Pello, California Marketing Field Office, Marketing Order Administration Branch, F&V, AMS, USDA, 2202 Monterey Street, Suite 102B, Fresno, California 93721; telephone: (209) 487&hyph;5901. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action is governed by the provisions of section 608c(16)(A) of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended [7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674], hereinafter referred to as the ``Act.'' Marketing Order Nos. 907 and 908 [7 CFR Parts 907 and 908], as amended, regulate the handling of navel and Valencia oranges grown in Arizona and designated parts of California. Marketing Order No. 910 [7 CFR Part 910], as amended, regulates the handling of lemons grown in California and Arizona. The Department of Agriculture (Department) is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This termination order has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This action will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this action. The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing of the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling. Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities. The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility. There are approximately 140 handlers of navel oranges, 125 handlers of Valencia oranges, and 70 handlers of lemons who were subject to regulation under the respective marketing orders and there are approximately 3,750 producers of navel oranges, 3,700 producers of Valencia oranges, and 2,000 producers of lemons in the regulated areas. Small agricultural service firms have been defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $5,000,000, and small agricultural producers are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $500,000. The majority of handlers and producers of California-Arizona navel oranges, Valencia oranges, and lemons may be classified as small entities. Marketing Order No. 907 has been in effect since 1953, Marketing Order No. 908 since 1954, and Marketing Order No. 910 since 1958. When order authorities were utilized, the orders provided for the establishment of weekly volume regulation and size requirements. In addition, the marketing orders authorized marketing research and development and provided for reporting and recordkeeping requirements for affected handlers.
