The certification notice will soon be published in the Federal Register . At the request of the company the Department reviewed the certification for workers of the subject firm. New findings show that the workers at the distribution center in Jackson, South Carolina should be covered for trade adjustment assistance since the distribution center only handled finished products from five manufacturing plants of Coordinated Apparel where the workers are under current worker group certifications. Sales and employment at Jackson, South Carolina decreased in 1993 compared to 1992 and in the first six months of 1994 compared to the same period in 1993. The intent of the Department's certification is to include all workers who were adversely affected by increased imports. Accordingly, the Department is amending the certification to include workers at Coordinated Apparel Group, Inc., in Jackson, South Carolina. The amended notice applicable to TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,364 is hereby issued as follows: All workers of Coordinated Apparel Group, Inc., Orwigsburg, Pennsylvania (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,364); Sewing Facility in Schuylkill Haven, Pennsylvania (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,364A); Swainsboro, Georgia (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,364B) and the Distribution Center in Jackson, South Carolina (TA&hyph;W&hyph;30,364C) engaged in employment related to the production of knitted shirts who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after September 20, 1993 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974. Signed at Washington, DC, this 5th day of December 1994. Victor J. Trunzo, Program Manager, Policy and Reemployment Services, Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance.
