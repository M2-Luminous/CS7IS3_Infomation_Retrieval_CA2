My experience that I gained in life, work, and politics and my professional knowledge enable me to determine those priorities which are essential for overcoming the difficulties and crisis phenomena that have befallen us during this difficult transitional period and, finally, change the situation for the better and inspire people with hope and confidence in the future. The first and main priority from which I will proceed concerns the needs and interests of the independent state and of the people, as well as interests of the individual. Strategic and Tactical Trends in My Program In the Economic Sphere 1. Economic Reforms -- only for the benefit of the people and not at the people's expense. I will not be guided by utopian programs, but by absolutely specific matters: -- Reform in the banking, finance, and taxation systems; -- The creation of reliable guarantees for a free development of civilized entrepreneurship; -- Struggle against price-fixing extortion and inflation; -- Balancing of prices and incomes. 2. An improvement of the course of economic reforms in such a way as to make it possible to put an end to the vulgar enrichment of some individuals at the expense of the impoverishment of the majority of people. 3. Ukraine's economic revival -- The building of a strong, efficient, and socially-oriented economy by way of its restructuring and implementation of up-to-date technologies. 4. Fair privatization by the people and the creation of reasonably equal starting conditions for every person participating in the privatization and the provision of equality of all forms of ownership and economic activity, so that every person would feel himself as a master of the means of production and of the results of his labor. 5. Comprehensive development of the agro-industrial complex, state support for both collective and individual farms, repayment of debts to peasants, and the establishment of a stable parity of prices of agricultural and industrial products. In the Social Sphere 1. Promotion of the spiritual revival of the Ukrainian people, the development of culture and language, the strengthening of the material and technological base of national education, of communal services, physical culture and sports; recognition of the role of religion in the rebirth of society; the maintenance of conditions for the development of fundamental science. 2. Consistent adherence in Ukraine to the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as of other legal acts that guarantee free and comprehensive development of the individual and his reliable social protection. 3. Gradual improvement of peoples' standard of living based on an increase in the remuneration for labor worthy of the working people and a reduction of prices of goods. The latter may be achieved with the help of reducing taxes, price additions for intermediate trade, and production expenses. 4. Avoidance of mass unemployment, creation of the system of guaranteed protection for the low-income strata of the population -- war and labor veterans, pensioners, families with many children, handicapped people, single elderly people, students, and also those who have remained without a breadwinner; establishment of pensions and scholarships that would not be lower than the living wage. 5. True compensation for the population's savings, lost as a result of inflation, at the level of the purchasing power which prevailed in 1990. 6. An increase in the production of goods for children and a better care about women, young families, and young people. 7. Creation of healthy conditions of life, provision of a clean environment, the development of forestry, national parks, and ecological preserves. 8. Ecologically-oriented approach to the planning and building of towns, villages, and settlements; curtailment of the building of new and reconstruction of existing atomic plants and hazardous industries, introduction of ecologically friendly and waste-free technologies; particular attention to the improvement of the ecological situation in those areas that have been affected by the Chernobyl catastrophe. In the Sphere of State Building 1. Building of a humane and democratic civil society, achievement of well-being and spiritual freedom for the people; establishment of Ukraine's true state-political and economic sovereignty. 2. Adoption of a new Ukrainian Constitution with a distinct statement of the principle of the division of powers and the most suitable mechanisms for interaction among legislative, executive, and judicial power for building a law-governed state having the following main characteristics: -- Recognition of the Ukrainian people as the only source of power and of the individual, his life, rights, and freedoms -- as the greatest values; -- Cultural, linguistic, and religious uniqueness of the people of all nationalities residing in Ukraine. 3. Elaboration, taking into account the national characteristics and experience of advanced democratic countries, of such a legislation as would promote the formation of a territorial structure capable of harmoniously combining general state, regional, and local interests. 4. Improvement of the representative power bodies in the form of councils as organs of people's power and their reform based on the principles of local government and creation of a necessary legal and financial and economic foundation for their activity. 5. Maintenance of civic peace and harmony in Ukraine, strengthening of law and order, intensification of the struggle against organized crime and corruption, and a reliable protection of human honor, dignity, life, and health. 6. Building of Ukraine's Armed Forces and constant concern about the well-being of servicemen and their families. In External Policy 1. Extensive economic integration of Ukraine's national economic complex, first and foremost with CIS countries and also with other states, gradual merging into the European and world economic community, and the creation of a corresponding legal base and practical conditions for that. 2. Strengthening of Ukraine's international prestige as a great peace-loving and civilized European power, preservation of its territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders. 3. Preservation of peace, prevention of armed conflicts, no matter where they might flare up, and establishment of Ukraine's status as a peace-loving, nonaligned, and nonnuclear power. I will do everything in order that our young independent state could occupy a worthy position among advanced European and world countries as soon as possible.
