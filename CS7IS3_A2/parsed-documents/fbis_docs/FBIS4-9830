The Supreme Court is drafting a communique, and I am going it to read to you. You will be the first media source to have it. The communique states the following: The presidency of the judicial branch, representing the Supreme Court of Justice, has heard with astonishment and indignation of the vile assassination of Constitutional Court President Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon. We manifest our strong condemnation and aversion for this sad occurrence, which directly attacks the state of law and the legal regime. To silence with bullets the voice of the leading authority in the defense of our Constitution directly attacks the state of law and the legal regime, the basic supports of our democratic life, and, in essence, negatively affects all Guatemalans. We state this vile and cowardly action clearly shows the vandals and assassins, who caused bloodshed in Guatemala in the past, are active and are now attempting to destroy the Guatemalan democratic process again and, with it, the defense of human rights and the demands for social justice for the Guatemalans who live between violence and poverty. The murder of the president of the Constitutionality Court threatens, in essence, freedom in Guatemala. We demand the government of the Republic, headed by President Ramiro de Leon Carpio, immediately implement each and every measures established in the Constitution to safeguard the state of law and the legal regime, which are being threatened as never before in the current Guatemalan democratic process. At the same time, it must order all civilian and military investigation offices, which the state controls, to direct all their efforts to determine promptly and efficiently the truth of the events so that the material and intellectual authors of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's murder can be punished in an exemplary manner and with all the weight of the law. With great sadness and pain, we send our heartfelt condolences to Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon's relatives and hope they will find acceptance in our Christian values. This is the Supreme Court of Justice communique, which we are finishing right now and giving "Patrullaje Informativo" as a scoop. [end recording]
