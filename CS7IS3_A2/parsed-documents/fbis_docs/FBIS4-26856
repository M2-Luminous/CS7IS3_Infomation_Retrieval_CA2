This shows that relations between the two sides have eased further, reflects Russia's strategic conception of fully participating in world affairs, and also indicates that bilateral relations will enter a new stage of development. Since the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, NATO and Russia readjusted their respective strategies and foreign policies and have reestablished their basic principles. In January this year, NATO put forth the "partnership for peace" plan to ensure its continuing existence and development in an attempt to play a central role in Europe's future security pattern so that it could build up closer political and military cooperative relations with all European countries, including the former USSR republics and neutral countries. Russia's participation in the "partnership" is an important element of its general plan for fully participating in European affairs. The Russian president will attend the European Union summit meeting on Greece's Corfu Island on 24 June and will initial a partnership and cooperation agreement with the European Union. Between 8 and 10 July, he will attend the G-7 summit meeting in Naples of Italy and will play a full role in political consultations for the first time at the "seven plus one" meeting. In order to satisfy Russia's demands, the NATO foreign ministers meeting in Istanbul, Turkey on 9 June agreed with Russia's proposal for expanding the scope of cooperation consultations beyond the "partnership for peace" scheme to cover issues such as the settlement of the local conflicts in former Yugoslavia and the prevention of nuclear proliferation. NATO also accepted the principle of "no veto and no surprise attack" and agreed to make public the documents related to the bilateral consultations on comprehensive security relations. However, NATO only admitted that such consultations were informal and not automatic and required that the relevant issues be discussed individually. It also insisted that Russia cannot veto NATO's decisions but can be notified beforehand of NATO's major decisions. On 17 June, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Churkin arrived in Brussels and held talks on the details of Russia's full security cooperation relationship with NATO. Reportedly, the Russian side put forth a draft version of the cooperation agreement, including the point that the main objective of the "partnership for peace" is to cooperate to solve crises, calm down conflicts, arrange peace-keeping actions, and establish an effective mechanism for maintaining European security and stability, with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe playing a major role. Russia also proposed that cooperation be carried out in the fields of preventing nuclear proliferation, preventing possible new nuclear threats, shifting the war industry to civilian production, coordinating the production of new weapons, fighting terrorism, and advancing disarmament and arms control. This showed that the new developments in NATO-Russian relations would have a far-reaching influence on the security pattern in Europe -- and in the world as a whole -- as well as on relations between various countries.
