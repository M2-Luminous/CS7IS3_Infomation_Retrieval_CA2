Gabunia said that talks on the agreement have been going on for two years. The section on trade in commodities has caused the greatest difficulties. The sides decided to offer each other most- favored-nation status in trade. The treaty has sections regulating business and investment activities, in particular the formation and operation of companies, the flow of capital and payments. It describes cooperation in finance, economy, culture and crime- prevention.

Under the draft the council is to assemble onece a year. Routine control will be carried out by a Cooperation Committee consisting of officials of a lower rank and experts.
