In a dramatic development, Iraqi authorities decided to stop printing the paper in Iraq after it had been printed there for more than three years. The authorities decided to ban the entry and distribution of AL-MUHARRIR in Iraq after the Iraqi Information Ministry decided to seal off the paper's bureau and to ban its correspondent Akram Tahir Hassan from sending reports to the paper. AL-BILAD's information emphasizes that the latest Iraqi measures have been taken against the backdrop of the radical changes recently introduced by AL-MUHARRIR. The Iraqi authorities stress that AL- MUHARRIR has come under the control of the Gulf regimes, except the great shaykhdom of Kuwait. The deviation of AL-MUHARRIR from Baghdad's line has deprived it from selling thousands of copies in the Iraqi market, which are printed at the expense of the Iraqi people who are still suffering from the second Gulf war and from famine that the Gulf shaykhdoms are imposing in cooperation with the new world order.
