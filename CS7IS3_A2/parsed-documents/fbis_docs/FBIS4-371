This was mainly caused by some soldiers who escaped from their barracks in anger to attack and harm people. The Armed Forces cannot tolerate such shameful criminal acts. That is why they hastened to do everything possible to maintain security. At the same time, they searched for and arrested the criminals so that by yesterday evening, this reckless behavior had subsided. The Armed Forces once again urge the people to be vigilant and to help them stop the wrongdoers. The other issue they are informing people about is that the Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers who were staying at Kimihurura Parliament building left the building and launched an attack on the Presidential Guard barracks. Their attack was repulsed. They also launched other attacks in Remera district, near the national stadium, and at King Faysal Hospital [word indistinct]. Rwandan men and women, as you can see, security has not been properly restored, but the country's Armed Forces are doing everything possible to protect those in trouble. You are also requested to support the Armed Forces so that they can continue to maintain security. Stay alert.
