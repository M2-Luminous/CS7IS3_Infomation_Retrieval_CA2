Schnehage] [Text] Johannesburg Apr 12 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist Congress [PAC] on Tuesday [12 April] welcomed international mediation to solve the constitutional deadlock involving the African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Zulu monarchy and the government. A PAC statement issued on Tuesday suggested mediators consider "dropping" clauses from the interim constitution which prejudiced certain parties "and leaving the entire matter of the constitutional future to the elected constituent assembly to resolve". "This will level the playing field and should open the way for participation by all in the elections". The PAC also suggested that all security forces should immediately be placed under joint control by the political parties, "including the IFP". "This will ensure all-round respect for law and order and increase the chances for an election which will be free, fair and without intimidation", the statement concluded.
