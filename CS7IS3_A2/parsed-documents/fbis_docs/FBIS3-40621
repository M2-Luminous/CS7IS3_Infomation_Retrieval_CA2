Mr. Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Pakistan's defense minister, is currently visiting China. Talks were held on the proposed plan of building MBT-2000 tanks. Pakistani Defense Minister Aftab Sh'aban Mirani, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Hutian, and Chairman of the Central Military Commission Liu Ho Chiang participated in these discussions. Chinese technology will be used to build these tanks in Pakistan, and these tanks will be in the same class as Russian T-72 tanks, German Leopard-2 tanks, and the U. S. Abraham. This plan has been shelved for several years because of restrictions on Pakistan's nuclear program. Mirani also visited a tank factory in Mongolia, where T-85 tanks are built for Pakistan. The Pakistani defense minister is visiting China at a time when a Chinese military deputation is holding talks in Islamabad about providing aid to Pakistan. The Pakistani army is obtaining facts in order to counter neighboring India. Pakistan is expected to get 200 tanks; however, no talks have been finalized.
