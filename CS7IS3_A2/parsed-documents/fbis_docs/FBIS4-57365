He said this move is only a measure to ease international pressure applied mainly by the United Nations and the OAS on the Republic of Haiti, but these appointments do not reflect the people's will. Yesterday, a group of legislators supported by the Army swore in a new president in Haiti, and according to international reports, this is a measure to complete the toppling of constitutional President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has been in exile since 1991. The new president is Emile Jonassaint, 80, a former magistrate of the Haitian Supreme Court, but international news dispatches indicate that his government lacks the support of the international community and of most Haitian legislators. During a news conference Cristiani also commented on the progress in peace agreements compliance only days before he concludes his term. He said that the only agreement that will be left pending pertains to public security, because, as he has stated before, the government thinks that it is necessary to prolong the transition from the National Police [PN] to the National Civilian Police (PNC) as a result of the increased crime rate in the country. Cristiani had said that the dismantling of the PN could last another six months until the PNC gets enough members to fight crime. We think that it would be a serious mistake to leave the country with 5,700 agents and conclude the dissolution of the PN," the president said. [no opening quotation marks as published] He proposed that "the PN continue operating, and of course, also reduce its size while the Public Security Academy supplies the PNC with agents." Cristiani said that public safety is still a priority, and thus, the next government will continue to support efforts in this area and to support the Public Security Academy, which is tasked with training the agents of the new security corps. As for the reports of kidnappings, the president reaffirmed that the government is tackling this problem by deploying PNC agents to Santa Ana. He added that these are not "groups of organized kidnappers that we have seen in the past but criminal groups that will not be difficult to bring to justice. We hope to be able to neutralize this wave of extortions in Santa Ana in the short run." President Cristiani today inaugurated the Second International Environmental Conference in San Salvador.
