Abu-Mazin believes it is necessary to link Palestine with Jordan, even if full Palestinian independence is obtained because Jordan represents a basic and natural extension to Palestine. He said: If a confederation is agreed with Jordan, it must be conducted in accordance with the free will of the two sides, and the confederation should be the outcome of the negotiations. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT during his visit to Abu Dhabi, Abu-Mazin said that it has not yet been agreed to hold a meeting between Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres. He said it is likely that a meeting will be held directly between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin and 'Arafat if the Cairo negotiations end this week. Abu-Mazin expects the final agreement to be signed next month. He refused to give a specific date for the signing. He said: We do not want people to get frustrated if matters are delayed at the last moment. Abu-Mazin described Rabin's statements on the settlements as very encouraging. He said that these statements represent a change in Rabin's view of the settlements, which began by differentiating between security and political settlement. In Amman, in reply to a question put to him by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, Jordanian Prime Minister Dr. 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali strongly denied that Crown Prince Hasan's call the day before yesterday for easing the administrative measures experienced by the people of the West Bank residing in Jordan carry any political dimensions. Dr. al-Majali said: "There is no political dimension for the measures. It is an administrative matter."
