We have also avoided issuing any clarification or denial of any report or "information." If we get "involved" in denying everything that is published in this respect, we will then find ourselves compelled to issue countless "denials." And if we forget to deny any report or "information," the people will think that what has not been denied must be true. Hence our party's cadres have become used to these types of "reports" and "information," particularly because these cadres know that all these reports have shaky foundations. Sometimes they are so unjust that they are useful to us because they enhance our credibility when they are proved wrong. They only increase the people's confidence in us and their sympathy for us. As for the existence of multiple trends inside the party, we stress that there are never identical views or opinions between one person and another, even if they are in the same organization or party. Differences in views are possible and are usually necessary. They are even a duty. Those who claim that there are "differences" or "divisions" inside the party must provide proof or evidence. We are not required to prove the falsity of these allegations, first, because the constant task of denial is a waste of time and a diversion from the task, and, second, because we are confident that these allegations will be automatically proved to be false with the passage of time. Our bases have sufficient immunity on this issue. The party has recently undergone important experiences, especially the events that followed the signing of the "Gaza-Jericho" option. Can any one of those who claim that there are such trends inside the party provide a single piece of evidence that there is a real division over any stand taken by the party during these important, and even grave, developments! Regarding the campaign launched by a man of religion affiliated with Iran against the Hizballah secretary general, Nasrallah said: We are dealing with this phenomenon with the same spirit and method. We are not annoyed by this. We believe that it only strengthens the confidence in the leadership and also boosts popular sympathy for the party. The people are saying: Israel is seeking the physical liquidation of the party's leaders, in addition to trying to mar the party's reputation as a whole. Israel is the one that assassinated 'Abbas al-Musawi, former secretary general and prince of the martyrs, and is targeting the new secretary general and, of course, all the other leaders. Whoever is waging such a campaign is only collaborating with the enemy, either intentionally or unintentionally. This "popular" view of the issue strengthens our self-confidence and stands. He added: This unjust "campaign" has exploited, for example, the party's decision to participate in the elections to attack us with the aim of "weakening" our stand by making these allegations before the leadership of the Islamic revolution in Iran. It was revolution leader Ayatollah Khamene'i who blessed our decision to enter the elections battle. Therefore, the opposition to the party's participation in the election became an opposition to the Islamic revolution's leader. Any attack on us over this issue is an attack on the revolution leader himself. There was one beneficial outcome of this "campaign" against us, namely some people's accusations that we were working to establish an Islamic rule or an Islamic state. This helped us because it absolved us of something that others regarded as an "accusation" and made our activities acceptable to circles that accused us of working to impose the establishment of an Islamic state in Lebanon. We do not hide our belief in the rule of Islam, but we do not want to impose our views by force. We call for following God through wisdom, example, and conviction. Regarding the allegations made in the campaign against the Hizballah secretary general that there is a trend that is following the al-Da'wah Party inside Hizballah, the secretary general stressed that those who have joined Hizballah from the al-Da'wah Party have left their former affiliation behind and have become part of the Hizballah trend, like the Amal Movement members who joined Hizballah. Even many members who were in the al-Da'wah Party might criticize the ideas and methods they adopted during their former party affiliation, as former Amal members did. Martyr 'Abbas himself was originally a member of the al-Da'wah Party, yet he was a splendid embodiment of the Hizballah trend. We told the Hizballah secretary general: We heard from you more than seven years ago that those who joined Hizballah from other organizations brought the methods and traditions of their previous organizations to Hizballah and tried to practice them within the party. Nasrallah stressed that this was at the beginning. Over time, everyone has blended into the same melting pot. One example of this is the al-Da'wah Party. Underground activity was one of its doctrines. Some of its former members who joined Hizballah carried with them the spirit of underground activity, even when there was no need for secrecy. But such habits have changed with time, as I mentioned earlier. When we told him that the presence of the al-Da'wah Party in many countries and places could, due to human nature, affect the former members who joined Hizballah, the secretary general said: Those former al-Da'wah Party members who are members of Hizballah have absolutely no relationship with those who were in the al-Da'wah Party in any other place. Those who joined Hizballah from the al-Da'wah Party are very critical of the mistakes the al-Da'wah Party made, just as any other party could make mistakes. With regard to some published reports about the fact that Hasan Nasrallah brought misfortune to the party, he said: I did not read what was written about this issue carefully. But such statements are contradictory, if not ignorant. Those who wrote such things also said that Hizballah has become stronger, has established its private economic institutions, increased the number of its members, and spread like wildfire in the south or other areas of the country recently. How could that have happened, particularly during the last two years--according to what they say--when these two years are the ones when I assumed the position of secretary general of the party, and I, according to their claims, succeeded in managing the party with skill and professionalism? And at the same time, they claim that I brought misfortune to the party. On the subject of relations with 'Allamah Fadlallah, the Hizballah secretary general affirmed that he has a distinguished relationship with 'Allamah Fadlallah and that he always meets with him, listens to his advice, and discusses important and sensitive matters with him. He has never had a real difference of opinion with him. Yes, the organizational state of the party is very different from the important religious personality, which is respected and held in high esteem by all. Due to his nonorganizational position in the party, 'Allamah Fadlallah could, for example, receive people we are not compelled to receive. He could establish relations with people whom we see no need to establish relations with. In addition, certain topics could be discussed, and we could have our own opinion on them. This is something that does not bother the 'allamah. But there was never an argument in the sense some media have been reporting. Regarding the silence on the results of the investigation into the airport bridge incident [in which the Army shot at Hizballah demonstrators], he said: We were not silent and will not remain silent. This incident has infiltrated our conscience and even the psychological makeup of our party. It will never be allowed to fade away. We are waiting for the issue to be raised on a broader and more significant dimension in the Chamber of Deputies. It is true that some sides want us to temporarily quiet what they call the exaggerated attack on the state regarding this matter, but this will not change anything for us. I was the one who, from the podium and from above the heads of the martyrs, made direct speeches about the president of the Republic and the prime minister. I held them responsible for the incident and demanded that they resign and leave if justice is not meted out in this matter. Some sides described our restrained stand after the massacre as being of the highest level of heroism. Our enemies described our stand as cowardly and hesitant. However, let it be made clear to all: We are the ones who maintain public security and general law and order. We have no time to waste on bitter condemnations of anyone. We have a project that is grander than all the narrow-minded political projects and gimmicks: confronting the dangers that are looming over our country and nation. Our fight against the Zionist enemy is a more noble goal than the fight against the insignificant sides. This does not mean, however, that the blood of our brothers and people can be shed by a murderous group. So far, they have not determined whose responsibility it was. Was it the responsibility of the president, the defense minister, the prime minister, the interior minister, or the security bodies? They have not told us anything clear about this matter. They think that the issue will die over time. We will address them in the same way that the poet Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri addressed the ruler of Iraq when the latter killed his brother Ja'far in the Battle of the Bridge in Baghdad: Whether you know it or not, Victims' wounds are a mouth, Unlike that of one giving testimony Or another begging for mercy.
