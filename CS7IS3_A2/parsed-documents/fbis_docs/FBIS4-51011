At today's session, the group discussed 17 criminal laws currently being used in Hong Kong, and initially thought that, except some terms which must be changed, they can generally be used after 1997. During the three-day meeting, the legal group will discuss more than 50 relevant judicial, law enforcement, and administrative laws. After the meeting today, Li Fu-shan, the group's convener from the Hong Kong side, said that today the group discussed 17 clauses which are all related to criminal laws, and that the group thought the original laws should remain unchanged as much as possible -- "it is better to stay put than make a bad move" -- so as to realize Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and keep from affecting the Hong Kong people's life and confidence. He said that the group discussed 17 clauses and thought they are very satisfactory, that -- except for some terms like the "governor of Hong Kong," which must be changed -- they can generally be maintained, but the group did not consider the concrete problem of how to amend them. He said that, among the clauses discussed today were the corruption prevention ordinance and the criminal laws in Chapter 200 of the Hong Kong law. Chapter 200 is about treason and the crime of instigating rebellion. The group thought that the chapter is already compact and detailed and the group was inclined to simply make some adjustments to the wording. Today's session did not discuss Article 23 of the Basic Law, an article on secessionist activity not included in Chapter 200. Shao Tianren, the legal group's convener from the Chinese side, said that, based on the demand of Article 8 of the Basic Law, the group is keeping the original laws of Hong Kong as much as possible, and that, as long as they do not contradict the Basic Law, they can be adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [SAR]. But he said that some problems within the clauses must still be further studied, including the way to handle terms and wordings that are different from the Basic Law. Some of the original laws come from the British Commonwealth or from Britain, and some powers, such as Hong Kong Legislative Council's power, come from British laws, and how they should be handled is a matter that must be looked into and discussions must be carried out to find a solution. He said that the legal group examined 53 clauses at the previous two rounds of meetings. During the first round, eight clauses were discussed, and, during the second round, 45 clauses were examined. Today's session made very quick progress, looking at a total of 17 clauses. Tan Yao-tsung, member of the legal group from the Hong Kong side, thought that the relevant clause on treason can generally continue to be used after some terms have been amended, because Britain is ruled by a constitutional monarchy, and, whether we are discussing the British Government or British sovereignty, they both belong to the Queen, and Chapter 200 of Hong Kong Law follows this spirit. After 1997, Hong Kong will become a special administrative region under Chinese sovereignty, and this clause should be amended according to the actual conditions, for example, some wording must be changed to read "central government."
