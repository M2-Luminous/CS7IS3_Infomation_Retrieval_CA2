Therefore there is a likelihood of more stable relations between the two countries. However, the problem of each country's different attitude toward other East European countries has not been resolved. Nevertheless, despite the differences in view, a consensus has been reached on Russian Defense Minister Grachev's demands concerning the extent of NATO and its role vis-a-vis the CSCE, these demands having been rejected by the allies. According to this consensus, NATO will not accept any new countries that share a border with Russia. The emergence of a new dividing line through East Europe is to be avoided by means of the PFP, but no one knows how. The most important issue in this sphere, i.e. the extent of the alliance east of Germany, remains open. Signing a partnership agreement with Russia in Brussels does not yet justify any special privileges for Russia vis-a-vis NATO, as President Yeltsin would like. The prospect of NATO admission by the four East and Central European countries was brought somewhat closer by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher at the NATO foreign ministers conference in Istanbul at the beginning of June. But this question, too, remains open. Moscow still expects an Atlantic-European gesture of recognition for its great power status for the benefit of European security, with this recognition assuming a concrete, binding form. Russian Foreign Minister Kozyrev has merely agreed to NATO assurances to seek a broader basis for a relationship with Russia. German Foreign Minister Kinkel has been saying cautiously in public that the "discord" between Moscow and NATO on this issue was "reduced" in Istanbul, which means that this discord still exists. A special protective and order-creating function by Russia within CIS has also not been recognized by NATO. NATO and the remaining East European countries have forced their wishes upon Moscow on the subject of all these controversial issues. On the other hand, Kozyrev won a major concession in Istanbul on the central issue of an eastward expansion of NATO. According to this concession, NATO is to postpone any decision concerning the acceptance of new member countries. A clause describing the significance of such NATO partnerships for the future admission of individual countries to NATO was deleted from the draft communique at Istanbul. The effect of this is that the admission of new countries to NATO is more doubtful than the efforts of aspiring East European countries would have us believe. The framework of strategic cooperation for a broader Russian relationship with NATO, which is what Kozyrev wants, basically conforms to the "strategic partnership" concept presented by U.S. President Clinton and NATO Secretary General Woerner in Moscow early in the year. Kozyrev's remark that this cooperation would take place without mutual vetoes and reservations indicates a deep-lying compromise formula -- no prerogatives on either side. U.S. Secretary of State Christopher has described this compromise in the following terms: "This is the most creative strategic innovation since NATO's inception." However, he made it plain that "neither new demarcation lines nor new spheres of interests" may emerge in Europe. No country may claim for itself a role that is not compatible with international norms, according to Christopher. And: European stability is conditional on a respect by all countries of the independence and territorial integrity of the countries of the former Soviet Union. The indication of a rejection of the Russian demands repeatedly expressed by Yeltsin and Kozyrev since 1993, and therefore of the Russian doctrine whereby Russia bears special responsibility toward the "near abroad," i.e. the countries of the former USSR, could not be clearer in diplomatic terms. But the failure to resolve the problem of a hierarchy of interests between the United States, NATO, and the remaining partners has been made equally clear in Polish Foreign Minister Olechowski's warning of a "marginalization of smaller countries in the region." The various interests must first be brought down to a common denominator if a new European balance is to be created. This is also the reason that there is going to be great interest in Russian relationships with the G-7 countries at the world economic meeting whose political part will be attended by Russian President Yeltsin in Naples this year. That is also the main reason for Yeltsin's rapid agreement to the Istanbul compromise formula. After the establishment of a possible "G-7 plus one," everything else would follow smoothly.
