The country is on the verge of famine. If it were not for the help from the United States, we would have real famine now," Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said. Speaking at a business meeting at the Overseas Private Investment Corporation in Washington on Monday, on the first day of his two-day visit to the U.S., Shevardnadze said that the disintegration of the Soviet Union was a painful blow to Georgia which had been left without traditional energy and medicine supplies. Only humanitarian aid, mostly from the U.S., keeps 300,000 Abkhazian refugees alive. The amount of such aid reached 225 million U.S. dollars in the last two years, he said. The Georgian leader stressed that his government "firmly follows the path of peaceful settlement" of the Abkhazian conflict and expressed "the absolute confidence" that "positive results" will be reached in the near future. "The threat of the resumption of a civil war has passed," he said. Shevardnadze assured American business people that there is a favourable climate for foreign investments in Georgia. "Within a year or two there will be a change for the better. I would not be here if I were not absolutely sure that Georgia's movement to free markets and democracy is irreversible," he said.
