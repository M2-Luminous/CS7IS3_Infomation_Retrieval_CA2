Within six months, the Ministry of Defense will work out a proposal describing its expected contracts with Czech arms producers. One group of items will contain those with direct effect on the country's security interests. The other defined group will involve less government attention, Klaus said. He noted that the state does not plan to organize arms exports. It will simply ensure that competition in the arms industry is not lessened, and that no laws are broken. Defense Minister Antonin Baudys said before the ministers' meeting that Czech companies will be allowed to participate in the country's arms conversion process according to their abilities. Discussions with them will start once the ministry has drawn up its proposal. Arms conversion in the Czech Republic could be carried out over five to ten years, Baudys noted. Most important, said Deputy Foreign Minister Alexandr Vondra, is for the Czech armed forces to state their modernization needs and for the state to be ready to cooperate with arms producers. The issue of re-equipping is not the only path to compatibility with NATO, he added.
