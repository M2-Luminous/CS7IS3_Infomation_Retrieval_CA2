"We have stated our readiness to help Russia in its joining all European structures which are important for it at present -- the Council of Europe, GATT. We also intend to support your country in joining the trade regime, which will be set up after the elimination of Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Control], and surely, (in joining) the `Partnership for Peace'", he told reporters describing his talk with Boris Yeltsin. The problem of mutual restitution of cultural valuables seized during the Second World War was also raised. "We understand the delicacy with which the Russian side treats the issue. But I once again drew the attention of the president to the great importance of the problem for us", Kinkel told TASS.
