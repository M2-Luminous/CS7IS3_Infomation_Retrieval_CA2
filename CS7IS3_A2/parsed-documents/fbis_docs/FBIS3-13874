The Khalil al-Rahman Society and some Palestinian camps near Amman recently staged mammoth popular demonstrations, during which the demonstrators chanted against the old man ['Arafat] and demanded him to cancel the Oslo and Cairo agreements. The Jordanian newspapers, both independent and party papers, also launched a campaign in which they called for the cancellation of agreements with Israel. Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] said during the Palestinian leadership's meeting in Tunis that this campaign is directed against him personally, as well as the PLO leadership. He blamed the Jordanian Government for not quelling the demonstrators or preventing columnists from writing against him. AL-MUHARRIR has learned that 'Arafat's anger was about to express itself in practice when he proposed transferring 15 Palestinian leaders from Jordan to Tunisia. However, leading Palestinian politicians rejected this proposal and considered it an attempt to strain relations with Jordan for no convincing reason. The proposal was thus frozen pending discussion in future meetings.
