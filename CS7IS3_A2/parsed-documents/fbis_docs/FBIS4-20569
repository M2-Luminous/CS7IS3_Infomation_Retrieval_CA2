K. Uematsu (Nagaoka University of Technology) A novel method was developed to characterize powder particles in alumina powder compact. This method consists of the liquid immersion technique coupled with polarized microscopy. New features found in the green body include huge particles and orientation of particles. The significance of these features on the subsequent processing and properties of final ceramic is discussed. Effect of Pressing Pattern on Deformation of Granule During Compaction Process. Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, and K. Uematsu (Nagaoka University of Technology) Internal structures of green bodies compacted with spray dried alumina powder were examined by a liquid immersion technique and SEM. The samples were prepared by uniaxial pressing at various pressures and subsequent isostatical pressing at 100 MPa. The voids between granules in the green body decreased with increasing uniaxial pressure. Temperature Change of Viscosity Characteristics of Silicon Nitride Slurry. A. Umino, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu (Nagaoka University of Technology), and T. Ogata (Toray) The effect of temperature on viscosity of slurry was examined in this study at various dispersant concentrations. The viscosity of slurry decreased with increasing temperature. At all temperatures, the minimum viscosities were found in the dispersant concentration range of 2.6 to 2.8 wt%. Synthesis of _b_+_b_-Alumina by Reaction Sintering. H. Shinya and Y. Hirata (Kagoshima U.) Effects of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] addition on phase compositions and electrical properties were investigated on _b_+_b_-alumina prepared by reaction sintering of Na[.sub]2[/]O-MgO-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] at 1600�-1620�C. Addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/] of 0.1-1 mol% based on the amount of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] was effective to produce monolithic _b_ phase without decreasing significantly the bulk density of _b_-phase. Electrical conductivity was lowered by the addition of BaTiO[.sub]3[/]. Control of Pore Diameter of Anatase Porous Ceramics by Hydrothermal Hot-Pressing. K. Yanagisawa, M. Sasaki, M. Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci., Kochi Univ.) Anatase porous ceramics were prepared from the spherical particles of amorphous titania by hydrothermal hot-pressing. Pores in the ceramics consisted of large ones corresponding to interstices in secondary spherical particles, and small ones to those in anatase fine crystals. The large pores vanished at high temperature and pressure. The pore diameter distribution was controlled by hydrothermal hot-pressing conditions. Preparation of Silica Porous Ceramics by Hydrothermal Hot-Pressing -- Microstructure Control and Compressive Strength. K. Yanagisawa, M. Nishioka, K. Ioku, and N. Yamasaki (Fac. Sci., Kochi Univ.) Porous ceramics were prepared from the commercial silica gel consisted of fine spherical particles (diameter: 18 nm) by hydrothermal hot-pressing at low temperatures below 300�C. The pore diameter distribution was controlled by hydrothermal hot-pressing conditions. The relation between the pore diameter distribution and the compressive strength is described. Sintering Behavior of SiC During Hot Pressing. T. Shiroya, H. Yonezawa, K. Kijima, and T. Tanaka (Kyoto IT) Silicon carbide powders containing 1 wt% carbon and 0-1 wt% boron as additives were hot pressed at 1800-2200�C under 20-40 MPa for 1 h in argon atmosphere. Effects of amount of additives, sintering temperature, and pressure on sintered density were investigated. In this study, only 0.15 wt% boron additive can promote densification of SiC powder compacts. Fabrication of SiC/C Composite Materials by Employing COPNA Resin as a Carbon Source. M. Iio, T. Maekawa, Y. Takao, Y. Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki University) SiC/C composite materials were fabricated by firing SiC/COPNA resin or SiC/SiO[.sub]2[/]/COPNA resin mixtures in N[.sub]2[/] or Ar atmosphere at temperatures in the range of 1000 to 2000�C for 2 h. In the latter system, the SiO[.sub]2[/] content in the composite materials decreased with increasing firing temperature, and formation of whiskers was observed when they were fired at 1300-1500�C. On the other hand, no whiskers were found in the composite materials fired above 1800�C, suggesting the formation of SiC particles by the reaction of SiO[.sub]2[/] with COPNA resin, and also the potential advantage of COPNA resin in promoting the reaction sintering of SiC ceramics. Preparation of Ceramic Fiber/Alumina/Metal Composites by Reactive Infiltration Process. K. Inoue, T. Watari, T. Torikai, and O. Matsuda (Faculty of Science and Engineering, Saga University) Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al and ceramic fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites were prepared by the infiltration of Al metal into Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] or Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/fiber compacts accompanying the oxidation of Al metal. It needs the aid of glass to proceed this process. The effects of infiltration conditions such as temperature, atmosphere, the kinds of glass and porous body, on oxidation growth of composite were examined. According to this process, a dense ZrO[.sub]2[/] fiber/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Al composites could be obtained without shrinkage. Synthesis of Zirconia Dried Gel by Metal Alkoxide. Y. Shimizu, K. Kobayashi, and M. Koizumi (The University of Ryukoku) Isopropanol solution of zirconium n-butoxide was prepared by adding diethanolamine. The prepared solution was hydrolysised to form wet gel. Through syneresis process, monolithic zirconia dried gel were obtained by the careful heat-treatment. Study of Phases in Rare-Earth Modified Zirconia Synthesized by Coprecipitation Process. M. Ozawa and S. Suzuki (Nagoya Institute of Technology), C.-K. Loong and J. W. Richardson (Argonne National Laboratory, U.S.A.) The crystal structure of rare-earth modified zirconia from coprecipitation process were studied by neutron and X-ray diffraction technique. A Rietveld analysis of neutron-ray powder patterns revealed a tetragonal phase with relaxation of oxygen in Zr[.sub]0.9[/]La[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/] and Zr[.sub]0.9[/]Nd[.sub]0.1[/]O[.sub]1.95[/]. Effect of Al-Alkoxide Addition on Sinterability and Strength of Zirconia. M. Inaba, Y. Zhang, N. Uchida, K. Uematsu (Nagaoka Univ. of Tech.), K. Mori, M. Sumi (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd.) This study presents the effect of Al-alkoxide addition on sinterability and strength of YSZ. The addition of 1-3 mol% Al-alkoxide reduced the sintering temperature by about 100�C and increased the strength by about 80%. Surface Area of CeO[.sub]2[/] Powder Fabricated by Various Methods. N. Okumura, A. Akiyama, and Y. Ikuma (Kanagawa I.T.) Cerium oxide powder was fabricated from Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/] or Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/] solution to which various kinds of organic acids were added. After calcination at 850�C, the powders were characterized by SEM and BET. It was found that for Ce(SO[.sub]4[/])[.sub]2[/], dicarboxylic acid was the best acid and for Ce(NO[.sub]3[/])[.sub]3[/], aliphatic oxy acid was the best. Mesopore Control of Macroporous Silica Gels Having Phase-Separated Morphology by Solvent Exchange. K. Kitayama, K. Nakanishi, and N. Soga (Faculty of Engineering, Kyoto Univ.) Silica gels having phase-separated interconnected morphology in micrometer range have been prepared by hydrolyzing alkoxysilane in the presence of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). In order to modify the structure in nanometer range, solvent exchange treatments in various aqueous solutions have been performed. When the gels were leached in an aqueous ammonia solution, their pore size changed drastically. In basic condition, the pore size reached an equilibrium value under constant solution pH and temperature. The equilibrium pore size increased as solution pH or temperature was raised. Effect of Ultrasound on Ripening of Aluminogels (2). M. Katsumoto, N. Enomoto, and Z. Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Engin. Matls., TIT) High-power ultrasound was applied to the ripening of amorphous aluminogels in aqueous solution. When ultrasonicated at a lower power of the sonicator, the crystallization of the gels was promoted; while at a higher power crystallization was disturbed by ultrasonic treatment. It is thought that the dissolution of gels was accelerated and as a result the formation of bayerite was promoted by moderate sonication, but that the growth of bayerite was suppressed by excessive sonication. Effect of Ultrasonic Irradiation on Precipitation of Ti Oxalate From Solution (2). Hee-Lack Choi, Naoya Enomoto, and Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mater., T.I.T.) Ultrasonic irradiation was applied during the precipitation of titanium oxalate in an ethanolic solution of oxalic acid. The precipitation reaction was accelerated by ultrasound. In this report, for the better understanding of ultrasonic effect on the precipitation reaction we examined the reaction product which is unidentified. [.sup]27[/]Al NMR Study of the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Formation Process From Chemically Modified Al-Alkoxides. N. Tohge (Kinki University), K. Tadanaga, T. Iwami, and T. Minami (Osaka Prefecture University) The formation processes of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] from Al-alkoxide chemically modified with ethylacetoacetate (EAcAc) were investigated using [.sup]27[/]Al NMR. [.sup]27[/]Al NMR spectra showed that the reaction of EAcAc with Al(O-sec-Bu)[.sup]3[/] led to the formation of six-coordinated structural units. It was found that many kinds of condensed six-coordinated structural units, most of which were chelated with EAcAc, were present in the sols after hydrolysis. Preparation of Ferrite/Alloy Composite Powders Using Redox Reaction. H. Kobayashi, K. Saito, N. Hiratsuka, and T. Mitamura (Saitama University) The composite powders of nickel zinc ferrite and nickel-iron alloy were prepared from _a_-Fe[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], NiCl[.sub]2[/] and Zn under an Ar gas stream using redox reaction. Ni-Fe alloy powder, nickel zinc ferrite powder and non-magnetic zinc oxide powder were produced with increasing of Zn amount and heating temperature. The lattice constant of the ferrite was increased with dissolving Zn into the ferrite. The saturation magnetization and coercive force of the composite powders prepared were 89.7 emu/g and 78.6 Oe, respectively. Synthesis of MoSi[.sub]2[/] Powder by Carbothermal Reduction Process. Y. Ishizaka and J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu Univ.) MoSi[.sub]2[/] powder was prepared by a carbothermal reduction process using MoO[.sub]3[/], quartz and active carbon at 1400�C in Ar + H[.sub]2[/] (50%) atmosphere. Excess quartz was needed to produce MoSi[.sub]2[/] single phase without lower silicides (Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/], Mo[.sub]5[/]Si[.sub]3[/]C). After treated with HF solution, the powder was 0.5-2 �m in size. MoSi[.sub]2[/]-SiC composite powder was also obtained by adjusting an excess of quartz and active carbon.

Machida (Miyazaki University) A new approach to organic derivatives of zirconium phosphate through interlayer amidation was applied to the zirconium carboxyethylphosphonate-alkyldiamines and -alkylmonoamines systems and the applicability to both systems is discussed. Synthesis and Structure of a New Layered Aluminum-Containing Vanadium Oxide (Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/] . Y. Oka, T. Yao, and N. Yamamoto (Kyoto U.) A new vanadium oxide with a layered structure was hydrothermally synthesized. The composition of the compound was found to be (Al[.sub]x[/]V[.sub]1-x[/])[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5-4x[/](OH)[.sub]4x[/] and the X-ray Rietveld analysis revealed the double-sheet structure of the M[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] layer (M = V, Al) analogous to those of the layered hydrated vanadium oxides. The layers are held by hydrogen bonds. Preparation, Structure and Intercalation of Chalcogenides With Layered Composite Crystal Structures. Y. Oosawa, Y. Gotoh, J. Akimoto, M. Sohma, H. Hayakawa (NIMCR), and M. Onoda (NIRIM) Three kinds of selenides with layered composite crystal structures are formed in Pb-Nb-Se system: (PbSe)1.14(NbSe2)m ([A] for m = 1, [B] for m = 2, [C] for m = 3). Dependence of the product species on the preparation temperature and composition has been investigated. Rietvelt analyses of [B], [C] and their N2H4.H20 intercalation compounds with 0 0 L diffraction profile have been carried out to determine the atomic coordinates in the layer-stacking direction. Two new selenides have been found in the Pb-Ti-Se system. Effect of Neutron Irradiation on Knoop Microhardness of MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Single Crystal. T. Yano, M. Ikari (Res. Lab. Nucl. Reactors, TIT), and T. Iseki (Dept. Inorg. Mater., TIT) The Knoop microhardness of several orientations on the (100) surface of neutron irradiated and unirradiated MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystals were measured. It was confirmed that the Knoop microhardness of the MgO-3Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] single crystal was hardened by about 4-14% by the neutron irradiation. Both of the (111) <110> and the (110) <110> slip systems are simultaneously active in the unirradiated crystal, however, in the neutron irradiated crystal, the (111) <110> should be the dominant slip system. Preparation and Properties of Si Doped Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] Crystals. Shigeru Okada, Tuyoshi Nakayama, Kunio Kudou, Kenya Hamano (Kanagawa University), and Torsten Lundstrom (Uppsala University) Si doped Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] crystals were prepared by the reaction between aluminium, silicon and boron powders using a molten copper flux under an argon atmosphere. As-grown Si doped Al[.sub]x[/]Cu[.sub]y[/]B[.sub]105[/] crystals were used for the study of measurements of density and unit cell dimensions. The largest crystals prepared have the maximum dimensions of about 2.88mm x 2.20mm x 2.16mm. Hedvall Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] on Sintering Behavior of (Co,Ni)O. A. Nakajima and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo Co., Ltd.) Effect of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] addition on sintering of (Co,Ni)O was investigated. Starting Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had amorphous phase, and it accelerated densification of (Co,Ni)O by making solid solution at the temperature of its crystallization. This acceleration was considered to be caused by increasing diffusion constant as a result of crystallization of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] subsequent to increasing the amount of making solid solution. The Effect of ZrO[.sub]2[/] Addition on NiO-CoO Solid Solution. R. Suzuki, H. Nakamura, and H. Segawa (Nikko Kyodo Co., Ltd.) Relationship between density, microstructure of sintered body and the amount of added ZrO[.sub]2[/] was investigated. As a result of this investigation, when the amount of added ZrO[.sub]2[/] was 3 to 4 wt%, the density of sintered body was the maximum and the sintered body added 0.2 wt% Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] had higher density. Average grain size decreased with increasing the amount of added ZrO[.sub]2[/]. Synthesis of Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/] System Powder and Its Sinterability. S. Tanaka (Tosoh Co.), S. Nagashima and A. Kato (Kyushu University) An Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] hydrate-coated TiO[.sub]2[/] powder was synthesized by a homogeneous precipitation technique and its sinterability was studied. Densities of sintered bodies increased in calcination temperature (800-1350�C) and sintering temperature (1400-1500�C). Crystalline phase in sintered bodies were Al[.sub]2[/]TiO[.sub]5[/], _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], Y[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]7[/]. Effect of stirring rate during synthesis of powder on morphology and sinterability of product was also studied. Preparation and Sintering Behavior of Alumina-Coated SiC(w,p). H. Nakamura, K. Naito, M. Yoshinaga, and A. Kato (Faculty of Engineering, Kyushu Univ.) Preparation of alumina-coated SiC whiskers or SiC particles and their sinterability were studied. Stirring rate during coating gives a marked effect on morphology of precipitate. Stirring rate required for preparation of coalescence-free coated body depends on the volume of reacting solution. Use of alumina-coated SiC powder for sintering improved the distribution of SiC in Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], indicating that coated particles were useful for good distribution of dispersed phase in matrix phase. Effect of SiO[.sub]2[/] Addition on the Synthesis and Sinterability of Mg-Al Spinel. Insuk Yi, Naoya Enomoto, and Zenbe-e Nakagawa (Res. Lab. Eng. Mat., TIT) The sinterability of Mg-Al spinel doped with SiO[.sub]2[/] have been studied by X-ray diffractometry and Scanning Electron microscope. The addition of SiO[.sub]2[/] remarkably decrease the porosity of the specimens sintered at 1500�C for 2 h. This is due to the formation of liquid phase such as cordierite etc. during densifying. Effect of Impurities Addition on the Phase Change in Li[.sub]2[/]Ti[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]7[/]. D. Tsubone, K. Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology) Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R (ramsdellite) phase was synthesized by the melt-quenching method. The phase changes in the Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/]-added R phase occurred similarly to the non-added R phase following the route quenched-R H (hexagonal phase) S+r (spinel and rutile) R. But addition of Sb[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]5[/] retarded the H S+r successive decomposition reaction and stabilized the H phase at high temperatures. B1-Type Tantalum Nitride Synthesized by Shock Compression and Its Some Properties. Suguru Tashiro, Tsutomu Mashimo (Kumamoto University), Katsuyoshi Oh-ishi, Yasuhiko Syono (Tohoku University) Shock compression recovery experiments of the porous sample of tantalum nitride with a hexagonal structure (CoSn-type) were performed in the impact velocity range up to 1.5 km/s to synthesis B1-type tantalum nitride. Almost single phase B1-type tantalum nitride bulk body was prepared by shock compression. The lattice parameter of the shock synthesized B1-type phase was determined to be a[.sub]0[/] = 0.43363+(1) nm. The chemical formula was estimated to be TaN[.sub]0.96-0.99[/] by the instrumental chemical analysis. Coloration Due to Ni[.sup]2+[/] in CaO Matrix. T. Nakashima, N. Motohira, Y. Nakamura, and H. Yanagida (Fac. of Eng., Univ. of Tokyo) Characteristic coloration is observed on Ca[.sub]x[/]Ni[.sub]1-x[/]O (0.95 < x < 0.98) sintered at higher temperatures. Their coloration shows variation with NiO content and absorption at 490 nm decreased and 420,640 nm appeared with increasing NiO content. From ESR spectra coordination number of Ni[.sup]2+[/] is judged to vary from stable six coordination into characteristic. Sinterability and Oxygen Semipermeability of the Sintered Bodies From La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/] Powder. Y. Mutoh and T. Sakamoto (Fukuoka Ind. T. Center) K. Morinaga and N. Yamazoe (Graduate School of Engineering Sciences, Kyusyu Univ.) La[.sub]0.6[/]Sr[.sub]0.4[/]CoO[.sub]3[/] powder prepared by the thermal decomposition of acetic acids was calcinated at 800-1100�C and grinded for 1 day or 7 days in ball mill. Particle size distribution of the powder grinded for 7 days was indepented [as published] of calcination temperature. Relative density of 1200-1400�C sintered bodies fabricated from the powders calcinated at 900-1100�C was 97-100%. The relationship between the grain size of the sintered bodies and oxygen permeability was discussed. The Effect of Dispersing Medium on Mechanical Properties of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. H. Kitayama, A. Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University) By milling in organic medium, organic species were adsorbed on oxide powder surface. Effects of these organic species on the sintering process were investigated. Microstructural observation revealed that the adsorbed species had effects on the microstructure of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. Variations of some mechanical properties with the adsorbed species will be discussed. Effect of Microstructure on Mechanical Properties of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Ceramics. T. Koyama, A. Nishiyama (Mitsubishi Materials), and K. Niihara (Osaka University) Bending strength, fracture toughness, fracture energy and crack extension resistance were evaluated for Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and platelet grains. The bending strength decreased and the fracture toughness (SEPB) increased with an increase in the grain size for Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] ceramics with equi-axed and platelet grains, but the ceramics with platelet grains had higher toughness and the maximum value was 6.6 MPa m[.sup]1/2[/]. Fabrication of Functionally Gradient Ceramics by Planetary Slip Casting. H. Kobayashi (College of Industrial Technology) Functionally gradient Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] having different particle sizes and Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-ZrSiO[.sub]4[/] pipe ceramics were fabricated in plaster molds by the planetary slip casting method. The molds set on a disk revolved both round its axis and on their axis. The functionally structures were controlled by changing the casting time of each slurry during green forming and the revolutions per minute of molds. Study on Mullite-Zircon Composite Materials (Part 1). K. Hamano and U. Yanagida (Kanagawa U.) From mixture of kaolin and zirconia, zircon began to form at around the temperature of transformation of monoclinic-tetragonal zirconia. So mullite-zircon composite materials could be prepared from the mixtures of kaolin, alumina and zirconia. The maximum amount of zircon formation can be obtained at about 1500�C, and at higher the zircon was decomposed. Mechanical properties of the composites were improved with increase of ``nominal content of zircon,'' i.e., zirconia addition and raising their firing temperature up to about 1500�C, and further their thermal expansion coefficient was a little lowered with increase of ``the nominal content of zircon.'' Aluminium Titanate Formation From Mixtures of Corundum and Rutile. A. Kamezaki, K. Hamano, and S. Okada (Dept. of Appl. Chem., Faculty of Engineering, Kanagawa U.) Aluminium titanate (AT) formation between fine corundum powder and coarse rutile single crystals, or fine rutile powder and coarse corundum single crystals were observed. AT layer was formed inside of rutile phase, and grew with holding time up to about 8 hours, and then rate of the growth decreased. From the result of polarization microscope observation, a part of the AT layer was formed with parallel orientated AT grains of 10 �m-20 �m in size. Formation and Properties of Ln-Si-O-N Glasses. M. Ohashi, K. Nakamura, K. Hirao, and S.

The density, the elastic moduli and the glass transition temperature of the glasses increased with incorporation of N. The coefficient of thermal expansion, the density, the elastic moduli and the transition temperature increased with Y content. Furthermore, the effect of cationic field strength on properties of Ln-Si-O-N glasses (where Ln = lanthanides or Y) was investigated.

Tsuchiya (Faculty of Industrial Science and Technology, Science University of Tokyo) The preparation of cordierite thin films was investigated by the sol-gel process. The coordination number of Al was analyzed by NMR measurement due to the used solvent effect. Hot Compaction of PSZ Powder Utilizing Underwater-Shock Wave. R. Tomoshige (Kumamoto Institute of Technology), Y. Kakoki, K. Imamura, M. Nishida, and A. Chiba (Kumamoto University) Partially stabilized zirconia (PSZ) powder was hot-compacted by using underwater-shock wave. The obtained compacts were heat-treated at 1473 to 1873 K for 5 h. The compacts and heat-treated ones were investigated by hardness and fracture toughness tests and electron microscopy. Our experimental results are summarized as follows: (1) The compacts heat-treated above 1673 K showed higher hardness values than commercial products. (2) Fracture toughness value of 12.0 MPa (m)[.sup]1/2[/] was observed in the compacts heat-treated at 1673 K. Slip Casting of Silicon Nitride and Mechanical Properties of Sintered Body (Part 5). S. Sano, K. Oda, Y. Shibasaki (GIRIN), and K. Ohshima (Toshiba Ceramics) The slip casting of silicon nitride was studied to develop a complicated shape forming method for the fabrication of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] engineering ceramics. In this study, Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] produced by silica reduction was used as the starting powder. From the slurry containing 75 wt% solid, a high density green body (2.03 g/cm[.sup]3[/]) was obtained. The Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] sintered at 1775�C for 10 h at 0.9 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure showed high flexural strength of about 1 GPa. Microstructural Control of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] by Addition of _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Seeds. N. Hirosaki, Y. Okamoto, Y. Akimune (Nissan Motor Co., Ltd.), and M. Mitomo (NIRIM) Microstructural development during liquid-phase sintering of fine _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder containing large _b_ particles was studied. The large grains acted as seeds for grain growth and in-situ composite microstructure containing size-controlled large grains was obtained. Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Compact Prepared by Spark Plasma Sintering. M. Omori, A. Okubo, and T. Hirai (IMR Tohoku University) Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/] is the compound with martensitic transformation. To synthesize a toughened ceramic like zirconia, the growth of grains was depressed using a spark plasma sintering equipment. Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted with Y[.sub]4[/]Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]9[/], so the strength and toughness was decreased. The grain size of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was controlled under 250 �m and good for the toughness. It is necessary to suppress the reaction. Dual Phase Sialon (9). Sintering Reaction Between Y-_a_'-Sialon and _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. Y. Ukyo and S. Wada (Toyota Central Research and Development Labs. Inc.) Sintering reaction between Y-_a_'-sialon and _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was investigated by hot-pressing the mixtures of _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powders containing various amount of Y-_a_'-sialon. Shrinkage proceeded rapidly above 1600�C and amount of Y-_a_'-sialon in starting powders did not affect the shrinkage behavior. No other phase was formed during sintering. Sintered bodies were composed of _b_'-sialon and Y-_a_'-sialon of which solid solubility was lower than that of starting powders. Sintering of Ground BN Powders From a Different Starting Material. T. Hagio and Y. Yoshida (Government Industrial Research Institute, Kyusyu) BN ceramics were fabricated by normal sintering method using various BN powders which were obtained by heating a synthesized BN powder at a different temperature. The powders alone were hard to sinter with a large free expansion. The grinding alters BN powder to make its consolidated compact strong on heat treatment. Relatively dense BN ceramics was obtained from the ground powder of well-crystallized BN. Slip Casting of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-W Continuous Functionally Gradient Material. M. Hidaka, H. Takebe, K. Morinaga (Department of Materials Science and Technology, Graduate School of Engineering Sciences, Kyushu University), J. Chu, K. Hayashi (TOTO Ltd.) A continuous functionally gradient material was produced using slip casting method. The difference of the sedimentary velocity of particles within a slip due to the density difference among the species and the size difference among the particles were used to obtain a body with gradually distributed Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and W contents. Compositional gradient within this type of samples were examined by electron probe microanalysis. Properties of SiC-BN Nanocomposites and Effect of TiB[.sub]2[/]-Addition. N. Oyama, J. Hojo (Fac. Eng., Kyushu Univ.), K. Kishi, S. Umebayashi (Gov. Ind. Res. Inst. Kyushu) SiC-BN nanocomposites were produced by hot-pressing of the fine composite powder. The nanocomposites showed a remarkable improvement of thermal shock resistance compared with conventional SiC-BN composites produced from the mixed powder. However, the fracture toughness was reduced. The addition of TiB[.sub]2[/] particles to SiC-BN nanocomposite increased the fracture toughness without a serious decrease in thermal shock resistance. Strengthening of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Matrix Composites by the Addition of SiC Particles. T. Hirano, A. Nakahira, and K. Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University) Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] matrix composites reinforced by 5 vol% of SiC particles having different particle sizes were fabricated using the hot-pressing technique. The average particle size of added SiC particles were 3.50, 1.26, 0.27, 0.15 and 0.04 �m respectively. The mechanical properties and microstructure of these composites were investigated. The relative density was slightly increased, on increasing the size of added SiC particles. The maximum average strength of these composites was 1.3 GPa after the addition of SiC particles having an average particle size of 0.27 �m. Beside 0.04 �m SiC addition, the fracture toughness were independent of the size of added SiC particles.

Tokyo) Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/SiC/YAG hybrid composite were fabricated by hot-pressing. The grain size of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] monolith increased with increasing sintering temperature and sintering time, while that of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites was effectively restrained due to the incorporation of YAG and SiC particulates into alumina matrix. The mechanical properties, such as bending strength and fracture toughness of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-SiC-YAG composites were higher than that of alumina monolith. Study of Self-Reinforced Behavior of Silicon Nitride Ceramics by Reaction Bonding Methods. Yoshiyuki Yasutomi, Motoyuki Miyata, and Shigeru Kikuchi (Hitachi Res. Lab., Hitachi, Ltd.) The nitridation mechanism depends on the Si powder size. In case of fine Si powder, the Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains corresponds to size of original Si particles, which was produced by nitrogen diffusion in the Si particles. On the other hand, in case of large Si powder, long elongated Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] grains are produced in the nitrided body by vapor-liquid-solid reaction route. In this study, microstructure control of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics by using reaction bonding method with mixtures of the two type Si powder is discussed. The effect of controlling the Si powder size on mechanical properties of reaction bonded Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics was investigated.

Kondoh (GIRI, Osaka) On the fabrication of zirconia/alumina whisker composites using hot-pressing, although little improvement of bending strengths was observed, fracture toughness became higher by replacing zirconia containing 3 mol% yttria with zirconia containing 2 mol% yttria. The technique of spark plasma sintering brought on dense zirconia/alumina whisker composites at lower temperature than hot-pressing and the composites with higher bending strengths and fracture toughness than hot-pressed bodies.

These 2D composites showed the same effectiveness as carbon fiber reinforced Si-N composites. Influence of Fiber-Sheet Distance on the Mechanical Properties of SiC Fiber Reinforced SiAlON. Ueno Kazuo, Inoue Takahiro (GIRI, Osaka), Teremoto Naohiro (Osaka Elect. Commun. Univ., Undergraduate School) SiAlON composite reinforced with CVD SiC fiber was fabricated from the alternative stacking of matrix green and SiC fiber sheet with different distance between the fiber sheet, by hot-pressing at 1500�C under the N[.sub]2[/] pressure of 0.2 MPa for 30 min. Full-dense composite contains the fiber sheets with the distance of 0.56-1.0mm. Ambient temperature bending strength of the composite (ca. 350 MPa) is comparative with that of monolithic SiAlON, but high temperature strength at 1000�C is improved. The composite having the fiber sheet distance of 0.67mm shows the highest value of the work-of-fracture, that is, ca. 2100 J/m[.sup]2[/] among other composites, that is far bigger than the value of monolithic, 100 J/m[.sup]2[/].

Endo, T. Izumitani, H. Takizawa, M. Shimada (Tohoku Univ.), and S. Shin (Nat. Inst. Mater. Chem. Res.) Bismuth oxide-clay composites were prepared by the intercalation of polynuclear species such as Bi[.sub]6[/]O[.sub]4[/](OH)[.sub]8[/][.sup]2+[/] etc. formed as a result of hydrolysis of 4BiNO[.sub]3[/](OH)[.sub]2[/]BiO(OH) in distilled water at 95�C. The basal plane of the resulting composite was in the range of 16-32 A depending on the concentration of Bi-species. On calcining below 400�C, the surface area was about 180 m[.sup]2[/]/g for the 16A-composite and 10 m[.sup]2[/]/g for the 32A-composite, respectively. This result was perhaps responsible for the different stratification of Bi-species. Mechanical Properties of Cement Paste Dispersed Graphite Particles. T. Nishikawa, C. Ishikawa, and M. Takatsu (NIT) Compressive, bending strength or fracture toughness of cement pastes dispersed the non-reactive graphite particles was investigated. The addition of graphite caused the increase of bending strength, but the decrease of compressive strength. The results were discussed according to the fracture energy and the crack propagation.

Flow curves (relationship bet. shear rate and shear stress) of ink samples were approximated with an equation _ee_ = k[.sup]-1[/]_s_[.sup]1-n[/], where _ee_, k, _s_ and n were apparent viscosity, viscosity index, shear stress and flow index, respectively. It was found that n was useful and simple parameter to control viscosities of screen printing inks. Preparation of Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Thin Films by Sol-Gel Method. S.

The perovskite phase was formed in the films by firing at 600�C, while in the form of powder firing at 900�C was required to yield the perovskite phase. It has been confirmed that the use of BaPbO[.sub]3[/] having a perovskite structure as a substrate was effective to lower the temperature of the Pb(Ni[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] perovskite phase.

Synthesis and Characterization of Amorphous LiNbO[.sub]3[/] Particles Derived From Metal Alkoxides. S. Ono, Y. Nishi, and H. Mochizuki (Nagoya Municipal Industrial Research Institute) Amorphous LiNbO[.sub]3[/] particles can be produced from the dehydration of LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/] particles by heat-treatment at 200�C for 2 h. LiNb(OH)[.sub]6[/] particles precipitate by hydrolyzing the lithium and niobium double alkoxides solutions under the controlled H[.sub]2[/]O concentration in the range of Rw(H[.sub]2[/]O/LiNb(OEt)[.sub]6[/])4.0-7.5. Particles radii varied from 40 nm to 100 nm with increasing the H[.sub]2[/]O concentrations and showed narrow size distributions. Preparation and Crystallization of Fine Alkoxide-Derived Mullite/SiC or Mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Composite Precursor Powders. H. Suzuki, H. Nishiuti (Toyota Technological Institute), and H. Kamiya (Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology) Fine composite precursor powders of mullite/SiC or mullite/Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] were prepared by spray-drying the precursor solutions with uniformly dispersed SiC ultra-fine powders or Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] whiskers. This novel process will allow distribution of SiC or Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] in the raw powders, leading to the high-performance composite ceramics by sintering these precursor powders. This paper describes the morphology and crystallization behavior of composite precursor powders prepared by this novel process. Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] reacted at relatively low temperature with mullite precursor in the ambient atmosphere, whereas SiC did not react after crystallization of orthorhombic mullite. The results showed that the composite ceramics with very uniform structure or nanosize-composites can be prepared by sintering these composite precursor powders. Effect of Prehydrolysis on the Structure of a Complex Alkoxide as a Cordierite Precursor and Their Crystallization Behavior. T. Fukui (Krosaki Co.), C. Sakurai (Nippon Steel Co.), and M. Okuyama (NGK Spark Plug Co., Ltd.) The complex alkoxides as cordierite precursors were synthesized by reactions of prehydrolyzed TEOSs with Al and Mg alkoxides, and effect of prehydrolysis on an alkoxide structure was analyzed by IR, [.sup]27[/]Al- and [.sup]29[/]Si-NMR spectroscopies. The crystallization of the resultant gels from the complex alkoxides was also studied, and a relation between the alkoxide structure and the crystallization was considered. When water ratio to TEOS (H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS) of prehydrolysis is <1.2, the (EtO)[.sub]3[/]Si-Al = structure in the complex alkoxide increases with increasing water ratio. When H[.sub]2[/]O/TEOS is > 1.2, the condensation degree of aluminosilicate skeleton (-(Si-O-Al)[.sub]n[/]-) increases with increasing water ratio. Mg alkoxide coordinates to the Al atom in aluminosilicate regardless of water ratio of prehydrolysis. For a temperature at the low end of the range for formation of _a_-cordierite, increasing the water ratio of prehydrolysis is effective under these hydrolysis conditions, because a larger number of Si-O-Al bondings are introduced into the Mg-Al-Si complex alkoxides. Effects of Seeding on Phase Transformation and Microcracking in Complex-Alkoxide-Derived Cordierite. M. Okuyama (NGK Spark Plug), T. Fukui (Kurosaki Refractory), and C. Sakurai (Nippon Steel) Cordierite gel powder prepared by the hydrolysis of an alkoxide-complex was seeded with crystalline _a_-cordierite particles. The seeding appeared to promote a direct formation of the _a_-cordierite from the amorphous state. The development of microcracks due to �-_a_ cordierite transformation could be prevented by the modified crystallization behavior, resulting in the improved flexural strength of _a_-cordierite of 190 MPa. The seeding also lowered the crystallization temperatures of _a_-cordierite to 900�C, which could be attributed to the epitaxial crystallization of the chemically homogeneous mother powder. Pyrolysis Process of Poly(isopropyliminoalane) as an AlN Precursor. Y. Saitoh, Y. Sugahara, and K. Kuroda (Waseda University) The pyrolysis of an AlN precursor, poly(isopropyliminoalane), was investigated by means of TG-MS and TG-GCMS. The major weight loss occurred between 220�C and 540�C.

Dehydration-condensation reactions between surface hydroxyl groups on a Si substrate and carboxyl groups in a dicarboxylic acid film prepared on the substrate by the Langmuir-Brodgett process, followed by the same reactions between surface hydroxyl groups on SiO[.sub]2[/] particles and carboxyl groups at the opposite side of the film, enabled us to fabricate a monolayer of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles tightly bonded to the substrate. In addition, it was revealed that pretreatment of SiO[.sub]2[/] particles with boric acid was indispensable for fabricating a closed packing monolayer.

UV irradiation on the gel films prepared from Zr or Ti-alkoxides modified with _b_-diketone dissociated the chelate bonds in the films and made the gel films insoluble in leaching solutions. Based on these changes in properties of gel films by the UV irradiation, fine-patterning process for oxide films such as ZrO[.sub]2[/] and TiO[.sub]2[/] have been developed.

Barium titanate ceramics with various grain sizes (30-500 nm) were prepared by hot pressing (50 MPa, 1000-1100�C) of these particles. These dielectric constants decreased as the average grain sizes of barium titanate ceramics decreased, and the size effect was observed in the ceramics with the average grain size greater than 30 nm. Low-Temperature Synthesis of Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Perovskite by Hydrolysis of Metal Alkoxides. S. Katayama, I. Yoshinaga, T. Nagai, and M. Sugiyama (Nippon Steel Co.) Crystalline Ba(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Ta[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] powders were synthesized at a low temperature (around 100�C) by hydrolysis of Ba, Mg, and Ta alkoxides. The alkoxides were hydrolyzed in the H[.sub]2[/]O:OR ratio (r) of 10 under refluxing to yield a crystalline precipitate, although the hydrolysis with a small amount of water (r = 2) gave an amorphous precipitate. In the case of non-refluxing, amorphous precipitates were obtained, even in the ratio of r = 10. Synthesis of Pb(Mg[.sub]1/3[/]Nb[.sub]2/3[/])O[.sub]3[/] Powders From Nitrate Solutions.

Fine composite powders of SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] system were produced from SiCl[.sub]4[/]-AlCl[.sub]3[/]-O[.sub]2[/] reaction system. Powder products were amorphous. The particle size was 40-200 nm. SiO[.sub]2[/] particles had a large surface area near 300 m[.sup]2[/]/g because of the porous structure. The surface area was reduced by the inclusion of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and the addition of H[.sub]2[/]O to reaction atmosphere because pores in particles disappeared. Synthesis of Sialon Powder by Carbothermal Reduction of Vapor-Phase-Reacted SiO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Powder.

Low carbon content amorphous AlN powder is prepared from NH[.sub]3[/] and triethylaluminum (TEA) by vapor phase reaction at 400-800�C. The relation between the reaction condition and the carbon content in the product powder was investigated. It was revealed that the carbon in the amorphous AlN powder consists of at least two species. One species is derived from ethyl group of TEA, and another one is derived from the carbon compound that is generated by TEA pyrolysis. These carbon species have a difference in the volatility at the elevated temperature in the crystallization process. Silica Fiber Synthesized by Oxidation of SiO Gas. H. Kotaka (Toshiba Ceramics, STK Ceramics Lab.) and H. Saito (Toyota Technological Institute, STK Ceramics Lab.)

It became apparent that Outside Whiskers grew on the wall where temperature was 920-1335�C in a tubular reactor irrespective of starting materials. Microwave Luminescence Properties of SiC Whiskers. K. Amita, S. Sasada, Y. Takao, Y. Shimizu, and M. Egashira (Nagasaki University) Microwave luminescence properties of SiC whiskers prepared by thermal decomposition of sulfur-containing silicon oil have been investigated under different atmospheres. Microwave luminescence spectrum could be obtained in both low (0.3 Torr) and high (0.001 Torr) vacuum for the whiskers prepared, but only in the low vacuum for commercially available ones. All of sharp peaks in the spectrum at the low vacuum were ascribed to residual gases in the environment, but at the high vacuum a peak corresponding to the band gap of _b_-SiC (2.3 eV) was observed at around 550 nm, in addition to large and broad peaks beyond 600 nm. Fabrication and Properties of SiAlON Reinforced With Si-Ti-C-O Fiber. T. Inoue, S. Sodeoka, and K. Ueno (GIRIO) SiAlON reinforced with Si-C-Ti-O fiber (with 3 wt% Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as additive) composite was hot-pressed at 1500�C for 30 min. The composite showed lower bending strength than that of monolithic SiAlON at room temperature, but strength degradation at 1200�C was improved than that of monolithic SiAlON. The composite exhibited high fracture toughness and the work of fracture. Influence of Additional Element and Mechanical Property on Joining PSZ to Titanium by Oxide Solder. I. Usui (Industrial Technology Center of Saga) The joining was performed using Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-TiO[.sub]2[/] system at temperature of 1173 to 1373 K for 1.8 ks in vacuum. Addition of Cu decreased the equilibrium contact angle between Titanium and solder. Addition of MnO increased the bond strength. In the case of PSZ/Na[.sub]2[/]O-SiO[.sub]2[/]-Cu-MnO-CoO/Titanium, the bond strength was 72 MPa. Heat treatment at 573 K for jointed specimen increased the bond strength to 120 MPa. Wire Electro-Discharge Machining of the Structural Ceramics. T. Matsuo and E. Oshima (Kumamoto University) Conductive ceramics such as ZrO[.sub]2[/]-NbC. Sialon-TiN, etc. were machined by a wire electro-discharge machine. The work-plates of 10mm thickness have been cut by a 0.25mm dia. brass wire in pure water. In this study, machining rate as well as surface roughness was measured under different conditions and NbC contents. Also, the side gap and warp were studied.

Niihara (ISIR, Osaka U.) Some mechanical properties of monolithic Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal nanocomposites were investigated by using ultra-micro indentation technique for a Berkovich type indenter. The load-displacement behavior has been measured at the maximum indentation force of 10 to 400 mN. Micro-hardness, elastic modulus and elastic-plastic deformation phenomena were calculated by using averaged raw data. Both Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites indicated the elastic deformation even at maximum indentation force of 10 mN, however, plastic deformation of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/metal composites were accelerated. Influence of Temperature on Microstructure and Tensile Strength of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Fibers. H. Iwanaga (Faculty of Liberal Arts, Nagasaki University), M. Ichihara, S. Takeuchi (Institute for Solid State Physics, The University of Tokyo) Alumina monofilaments (10 �m in diameter) were composed of many crystallites of 0.1-0.5 �m in diameter, within which many small pores were distributed. Growth morphology of the crystallites and pores were observed by TEM. Tensile strength measurements of the filaments were carried out at elevated temperature. Relation between their morphology and tensile strength at high temperature was discussed. High-Temperature Fracture and Slow Crack Growth of Polycrystalline Mullite. R. Saito, Y. Okamoto, K. Hayashi, and T. Nishikawa (Kyoto I.T.) Fracture behavior of mullite at high temperatures was investigated by the constant-stress and constant-stress rate techniques. SCG region was observed at all fracture surfaces. Apparent critical stress intensity factor at the high temperature depends on stress rate, decreasing to 3.0-3.5 MPam[.sup]1/2[/] with increasing stress rate. Mullite with large grain has greater crack velocity compared with fine grained mullite. Mechanical Properties of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-WC Ceramic Composites Prepared by Slip Casting. K. Noda, T. Shiono, K. Hayashi (Kyoto Institute of Technology), R. Shikata, T. Nishikawa (Osaka Cement Co., Ltd.) The addition of WC to the Zirconia-Alumina composites improved the mechanical properties. The composites were prepared by slip-casting method. The composites were sintered in vacuum at 1700�C for 3 hr and isostatically pressed at 1700�C for 1 hr under a pressure of 180 MPa in Ar. Flexural strength of the composites was 1500 MPa and was not satisfactorily improved, but the fracture toughness was enhanced to 9 MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] by the addition of WC. Elastic Moduli and Fracture Toughness of CeO[.sub]2[/]-Containing Tetragonal Zirconia Polycrystals (Ce-TZP). Y. Kubota (Tosoh), M. Ashizuka and H. Hokazono (Kyu. Inst. Tech.) Elastic moduli and fracture toughness of 12 mol% CeO[.sub]2[/]-containing tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (grain size: 28 �m for Z12C-I, 6.1 �m for Z12C-II) were measured as a function of temperature. Young's moduli were 194-195G, and fracture toughnesses were 6.4 for Z12C-I and 6.7 MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] for Z12C-II at room temperature. On the Influence of Temperature to Elastic Modulus and Strength of MgO-Partially Stabilized Zirconia. Y. Kubota (Tosoh), M. Ashizuka and E. Ishida (Kyu. Inst. Tech.) Elastic modulus and fracture toughness of 9 mol% MgO-partially stabilized zirconia was measured as a function of temperature. Young's modulus showed the minimum value around 600�C in heating process and increased with falling temperature in the cooling process. On the other hand, the fracture strength was not changed by rising temperature up to 750�C in the heating process and showed the maximum value at 450-500�C in the cooling process. Creep Deformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Particle Dispersed MgO at High Temperature. E. Yasuda, K. Sekine, and T. Akatsu (RLEM TIT) Compressive creep of MgO polycrystalline in which ZrO[.sub]2[/] particles are dispersed at 1400-1500�C under 6-30 MPa were studied. The steady state creep rates vs. stress curves of ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were characterized by a transition in stress exponent n the same as those of monolithic MgO. It was found that the transition stress of ZrO[.sub]2[/]/MgO were higher than that of monolithic MgO. R-Curve Behavior of Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina Composites. T. Fujii, Y. Hamada (Nisshin Flour Milling Co., Ltd.) and S. Hirano, M. Miura (Nagoya University) Ce-TZP/Lanthanum-_b_-Alumina composites with a fracture toughness of 9-12 MPa-m[.sup]0.5[/] had been developed. An indentation-strength method was used for measurement of R-curves in these composites (0 wt.% and 0.2 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] addition). The _b_ values (the slope of indented bar strength vs. indentation load on a log-log plot) of these composites were 0.176 for 0 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] and 0.108 for 0.2 wt.% MnO[.sub]2[/] addition respectively. High Temperature Strength of Rapidly Solidified Mullite Ceramics Containing ZrO[.sub]2[/]. H. Ito, K. Morino (Tokuyama College of Tech.), Y. Yamasaki, K. Takagi (Technical Research Lab., Toyo Kohan Co., Ltd.) Amorphous mullite ceramic powders containing ZrO[.sub]2[/] prepared by Rapid Solidification (RS) were hot-pressed to study the characteristics of sintered compacts at elevated temperatures. These compacts showed less reduction of strength than those without the RS treatment with increasing temperature. Dilatometric measurements revealed that the phase transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] was suppressed in the RS sample due to a fine microstructure. This indicated that the phase transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] led to decrease of the strength at elevated temperatures. Cyclic Fatigue Properties of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics at Room Temperature. M. Ogawa and K. Isozaki (Denki Kagaku Kogyo K.K.) Cyclic fatigue tests of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were carried out at room temperature to investigate the influences of starting powder on the fatigue behavior. Higher fatigue resistance for cyclic stresses in 3-point bending method was obtained for the sintered body prepared from Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powder with higher _a_-phase content. High Temperature Properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] Doped Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics. M. Isomura, T. Takahashi (NGK Insulators, Ltd.), Y. Endoh, Y. Furuse (Tokyo Electric Power Company) High temperature properties of SiO[.sub]2[/] doped Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramic were examined up to 1600�C.

Niihara (ISIR, Osaka University) We have successfully fabricated high strength Si-Al-O-N composites prepared by hot-pressing mixtures of fine _g_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and _a_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] powders at 1600�C. In the present study, the relationship between microstructure and mechanical properties of these composites was investigated. TEM observations revealed that fine Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] particles were dispersed both within the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] matrix grains and at the grain boundaries. Surface structure of selected grains in the atomic scale was also performed by AFM with much higher lateral and vertical resolution compared with SEM. Fiber-Matrix Interface and Mechanical Properties of 3D C[.sup]F[/]/SiC Composites. K. Igashira, K. Nishio, J. Fujioka, and S. Okazaki (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Ltd.) The 3D-C[.sup]F[/]/SiC composites were prepared by polymer conversion method. Some modifications in processing were done so as to control the properties of fiber-matrix interface. Mechanical properties of the composite was remarkably affected by condition on fiber-matrix interface. Flexural Creep Behavior of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Doped SiC at 1600�C in Air. H. Takahashi (Asahi Glass Co., Ltd.), Gou Iyogi and Seiichi Hamada (Tokyo Electric Power Company) Four point flexural creep behavior of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] doped SiC was investigated over the temperature range from 1400 to 1600�C in ambient air. The stress exponents obtained below 1500�C were close to 2 though that at 1600�C was 3.3. Apparent activation energies were calculated 400 to 490 kJ/mol. Microscopic observation of crept samples suggests the severe degradation of grain boundary at 1600�C by oxidation. High-Temperature Mechanical Properties of TiC Particulate-Dispersed SiC Composites. X. H. Tong, T. Iseki (Tokyo Inst. of Technol.), B-W. Lin (Indust. Technol. Res. Inst., Taiwan, R.O.C.) Up to 1600�C, high temperature bending strength and fracture toughness of Ti doped SiC/TiC composites were measured. The bending strength of SiC/TiC composites did not change up to 1200�C, decreased at 1400�C and slightly increased at 1600�C due to remarkable growth of Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] crystal particles just at 1400�C. The existence of Ti[.sub]3[/]SiC[.sub]2[/] in the microstructure of hot pressed SiC/TiC composites was confirmed by XRD. Residual Strain in Metal Boride Particle Dispersed SiC Ceramics. T. Mizutani and A. Tsuge (Toshiba R&D Center) The Selsing's formula is extended to the general formulas which contains the effects of dispersed particle amount by using a pseudo cell model and a concentric double sphere approximation.

Nishino (NIT), T. W. Chou (Univ. of Delaware) Shear strength (_t_zx) and mode II strain energy release rate (G[.sub]IIC[/]) of unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced SiC and Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] composites, which were fabricated by using organosilicon polymer precursors, were measured by employing the DNS and ENF methods, respectively. These composites showed 30-45 MPa in _t_zx and 0.5-0.7 kJ/m[.sup]2[/] in G[.sub]IIC[/]. Anomalous Shock Compression Behavior of the Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-Doped Tetragonal Zirconia. T. Mashimo (Kumamoto University) and D. E. Grady (Sandia National Laboratory, USA) Precise particle-velocity measurements were performed on the Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-doped tetragonal zirconia by the VISAR method. Very fine three-wave structures were observed, while the normal two-wave structures were observed on the cubic zirconias. Release waves from Hugoni of state of 11-13 GPa suggested an anomalous large spall property. These unusual shock wave profiles may be related to the phase transitions of the tetragonal zirconia. Strength Under Shock Compression of the Microstructure-Controlled Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics. A. Nakamura, T. Mashimo (Kumamoto University), and A. Yamakawa (Sumitomo Electric Co., Ltd.) In order to study the effects of microstructure on the shock-yielding property, the Hugoniot-compression curves of grain-controlled and SiC-whisker doped Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were measured by means of the inclined-mirror method combined with a powder gun. The HEL stress of the grain-controlled ones, whose grain dimensions were finer, were larger than the normal ones. The SiC-whisker doped Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics showed an anomalous shock wave profile. Improvement of Sodium Corrosion Characteristics of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] by High Purification. Y.

Steam Corrosion of Plasma Sprayed, Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Stabilized ZrO[.sub]2[/] Coatings. K. Yasuda, M. Itoh, S. Arai, and T. Suzuki (R&D Center, Toshiba Corp.) Experiments on the t-m phase transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] containing 8 wt% Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] on the average were carried out under a saturated steam atmosphere to understand the mechanism of steam corrosion from the viewpoint of Y distribution. The phase transformation occurred in heterogeneously Y distributed t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] coatings, but it did not occur in homogeneously Y distributed ones. This result suggests that a homogeneous Y distribution in t-ZrO[.sub]2[/] depresses the phase transformation. Behavior of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] Spray Coating at Elevated Temperature. Y. Kurisu, M. Amano, Y. Sinohara (Nippon Steel Corp.), H. Saka, K. Kuroda (Nagoya University) The stability of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-SiO[.sub]2[/] spray coating in contact with Fe[.sub]3[/]O[.sub]4[/] powder were evaluated at elevated temperature. At the coating surface, tetragonal ZrO[.sub]2[/] transformed into monoclinic ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the transfer of the stabilizer element (Ca) caused by the iron diffusion into silica glass. The transformation of ZrO[.sub]2[/] can be inhibited by the use of Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as a stabilizer. Durability of WC/TZP Ceramics in Aqueous Environment. Tetsuo Yoshio, Yuushi Hara (Okayama Univ.), Kohei Oda (Yonago NCT), Toshihiko Nishida (Kyoto IT), and Takaki Masaki (Toray Industries Inc.) The primary emphasis of this work is on chemical durability of zirconia composite (WC/Y-TZP) in aqueous environments. Water corrosion of the ceramics proceeds with weight loss caused by dissolution of W. Its extent varies with the processing conditions and WC content. The results suggest that an understanding of these chemical evaluations might be important for improvement of the aging-degradation durability of WC/Y-TZP.

Maekawa (Ehime University) Spherical porous silica glass whose average diameter is 40 �m are synthesized by the sol-gel process in W/O emulsions and a successive thermal treatment. The pore size can be controlled by changing temperature of thermal treatment. The presence of residual carbons can be avoided by decreasing unreacted alkoxides with increasing water content of the initial solution at the sol-gel process. Preparation and Characterization of Porous Glass in Na[.sub]2[/]O-B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]-CaO-SiO[.sub]2[/] System. T. Nakamura, H. Yamashita, and T. Maekawa (Ehime University) Porous glass was prepared by phase separation process. The pore diameter, the specific surface area can be controlled by this process.

Takasuka (Pola Lab.), and S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.) A unique siloxane oligomer was separated from reaction mixture when N-phenyl-_g_-aminopropyl-trimethoxysilane was hydrolyzed and polycondensated using NH[.sub]4[/] OH without stirring. Molecular weight distribution of the oligomer was rather sharp and mean molecular weight was not so affected by the period until phase separation. It was considered that the unique oligomer was synthesized through prevention of polycondensation by phase separation. Behavior of Organically Modified Fibrous Silicas in Aqueous Solution. Y. Miyamae, H. Iyanagi, Y. Takasuka (POLA Lab.), and S. Hirano (Nagoya Univ.) Organically modified fibrous silicas were prepared by the sol-gel method of alkoxysilane. We found the fibrous silicas treated by heating had the ability of decolorizing the dye solution. The pH values of the fibrous silicas varied with their heat treatment temperature in aqueous solution. The behavior changed with their structure of organic groups. The variation of pH values were related to the behavior of the dye decolorization. Synthesis of Fibrous Sodium Titanate Hydrate. H. Suzuki, K. Igarashi, and T. Shimizu (Chiba Institute of Technology) The synthesis of fibrous sodium titanate hydrate was examined by hydrothermal reaction of fibrous titanium dioxide hydrate and sodium hydroxide. The reaction approached closely to the completion when the concentration of sodium hydroxide was higher than 5 mol/l at the temperature of 130�C. The product had an X-ray diffraction pattern with the largest peak at lattice spacing of 1.1 nm. Powder Synthesis by Emulsion Firing. K. Takatori and S. Hori (Toyota CRDL) Two oxide powders, ZrO[.sub]2[/] and ZrTiO[.sub]4[/], were synthesized by an emulsion firing method. The emulsions containing metal ions in the aqueous droplets were air atomized and fired to yield oxide powders. The synthesized powders were characterized by SEM, BET and XRD. They were spherical and submicrometer in size. The emulsion firing method was considered to be applicable to synthesize fine mixed-oxide powders. Preparation of Mixed Valence Bismuth Oxides From Alkaline Aqueous Solutions. N. Kinomura, M. Hosoda, and H. Kojima (Yamanashi Univ.) Pyrochlore type Na[.sub]0.39[/]Bi[.sub]3.45[/]O[.sub]7[/] and BiO[.sub]x[/] containing Bi[.sup]5+[/] were prepared by low temperature hydrothermal reaction using hydrated sodium bismuth oxide, NaBiO[.sub]3[/]-nH[.sub]2[/]O, as a starting material. The mean valence of Bi in the pyrochlore is 3.94. The X-ray powder pattern for the pyrochlore was indexed in the cubic system with a = 1.0943(8) nm. The crystal structure was refined with the X-ray powder Rietveld method. The pyrochlore decomposes above 380�C with two steps of weight losses caused by complete reduction from Bi[.sup]5+[/] to Bi[.sup]3+[/]. Preparation of ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Composite Particles by Thermal Decomposition of Metallo-Organic Compounds. H. Yoshimatsu (Okayama Ceramics Research Foundation), Y. Miura, A. Osaka (Okayama University), and H. Kawasaki (Industrial Technology Center of Okayama Prefecture) Gels prepared from ethyl acetoacetate aluminium di-iso-propylate (ALCH) and zirconium n-butoxide were heated between 700�C and 1400�C in air to prepare ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] composite particles. The volume fraction (V[.sub]t[/]) of tetragonal ZrO[.sub]2[/] in the total amount of ZrO[.sub]2[/] for the ALCH derived particles heated at 1400�C for 2 h was greater than that for the particles with the same Zr/Al ratio from mixtures of aluminium sec-butoxide and zirconium n-butoxide. Preparation of _b_'-Sialon by a Sol-Gel Method. C. Sakurai and T. Nose (Advanced Mater. & Tech. Research Labs., Nippon Steel Corp.) _b_'-Sialon (Z = 2) was prepared by a sol-gel method using _g_-(aminoethyl)aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and aluminum s-butoxide modified with triethanolamine. Single phase _b_'-Sialon was obtained at 1500�C in N[.sub]2[/] by carbothermal-reduction-nitridation. Existence of Al-O-Si bonding in the gel was important to synthesize single phase _b_'-Sialon at lower temperature. Synthesis and Hot Isostatic Pressing of Ni-Se-Te Materials. T. Hattori, S. Nishiyama, T. Matsuzaki (Chiba University) NiSe and NiTe were prepared by solid state reactions in vacuum. These synthesized powders were mixed and CIPed into pellets, followed by HIPing in capsules. The amount of substitution of Te for Se was comparatively small, less than 25 mol%. In the other way, Se substituted for Te in NiTe more than 25 mol%. The density of HIPed NiSe-NiTe body increased with increasing amount of Te up to 50 mol%. It seems to be because the melting point was depressed by solid solution. The density of NiTe was highest. Fabrication and Characterization of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] Symmetrical FGMs by SHS/HIP. Z. Li, K. Tanihata, Y. Miyamoto (ISIR, Osaka Univ.) The symmetrically arranged functionally gradient materials of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/TiC/Ni/TiC/Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] densified using Si fuel at 100 MPa N[.sub]2[/] pressure by SHS/HIP. The product size was about _P_ 30 x 6mm. The Ni content was 20 to 30 wt% at the center layer and diffused toward the Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] layer. The surface hardness and toughness were similar to the bulk Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], but decreased and increased remarkably toward the inside respectively. The Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] surface had the compressive residual stress of about 200 MPa. Flexural strength ranged in 600 to 700 MPa which depended on the microstructure. Mechanical and Electrical Properties of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]/Metal Composites With Continuous Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and Metal Phases. Y. Batai, T. Watari, T. Torikai, and O. Matsuda (Saga University) The composites consisted of Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], Al and Si grew by oxidizing Al-Si-MgO powder compacts. The electrical conductivity of the composite (50% oxidation) was 0.94 _O_[.sup]-1[/]-cm[.sup]-1[/]. This indicates Al phase is continuous. The bending strength of the composites had the maximum value of 412 MPa in case that oxidation ratio was 50%. The fracture toughness of the composites increased with decreasing oxidation ratio and was 4.88 MPa-m[.sup]1/2[/] in case that oxidation ratio was 35%. Combustion Synthesized TiC Body With Dense Surface Layer. M. Ohyanagi, M. Shibuya, and M. Zoizumi (Ryukoku University) TiC cylindrical body with dense surface layer was fabricated by combustion synthesis. The dense surface layer can be formed in the green density greater than approximately 75%. The reactant compacts were ignited by using an ignition pellet of loose powder compact consisting of same content as the reactant. Effects of the green density and an exposed gas pressure on a fabrication of the dense surface layer were studied. The features of the layer were also reported. SHS Casting of MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/]. Osamu Yamada (Osaka Industrial Univ.) The new thermite type SHS process (TM-SHS) has been developed by combining the modified thermite reaction and the combustion synthesis reaction. The TM-SHS has potentiality for increasing reaction temperature over melting points of such silicide ceramics as MoSi[.sub]2[/] and FeSi[.sub]2[/] due to large formation heat, and for casting the molten products.

Furuse (Tokyo Electric Power Co.), H. Kobayashi, T. Takahashi (NGK Insulators, Ltd.), A. Hashimoto (Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd.) Corrosion behavior of ceramics was investigated under operational conditions of gas turbines. From investigations by SEM observation, X-ray diffraction and measurement of surface profiles, it is considered that surface layers which could be protective against further oxidation were not formed on the surface of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] specimens exposed to combustion gas flow. Results of 100 hr exposure test indicate that ceramic oxide coatings can be effective to increase corrosion resistance of Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/]. Oxidation Behavior of Cubic-Boron Nitride Powder at High Temperature. M. Tabira, K. Kobayashi, Y. Uchiyama, H. M. Cheng, and H. Sano (Faculty of Engineering, Nagasaki University) Oxidation behavior of 8 cubic-BN powders was investigated in dry air at elevated temperature comparing with that of hexagonal-BN. Weight loss started at about 1000�C for c-BN and no weight gain was observed, while weight gain started at 850�C for h-BN showing the maximum at 1150�C. Many pores and cracks were observed on the surface of oxidized c-BN powder. It was considered that both formation and evaporation of B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] proceeded at the same time for oxidation of c-BN and this caused the TG curve with no weight gain. Oxidation and Strength Degradation of SiC Fibers in Air and Water. (T.I.T.) Yu. Gogotsi and M. Yoshimura Fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites are being developed for a variety of applications. Knowledge of the environmental effects on mechanical properties of the fiber is essential for composite design and property prediction. The objectives of this work were to investigate the mechanism of oxidation of SiC fibers in air and water and to determine the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the fibers after oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion. A Tentative Preparation of _b_-SiC-Coated Carbon Fiber. S. Yamada (Nishi Tokyo Univ.), E. Yasuda, T. Akatsu (TIT), and M. Kimura (Tokai Univ.) To improve the heat-proof temperature of carbon fiber, carbonized and graphitized carbon fibers derived from PAN were heat-treated with SiO at 1400�C in vacuo for various minutes. _b_-SiC-coated fibers showed over 100�C higher temperature where 2% weight-decrease appeared.

Yamamoto (Dowa Kogyo) The oxidation of ZrC single crystals was carried out at 500-600�C and Po[.sub]2[/] = 2.6 kPa. It was found that the ZrO[.sub]2[/] phase is divided into two zones 1 and 2. Zone 1 showed a steep concentration gradient of oxygen and contained as much as carbon of 14-27 at%. Zone 2 was found to contain the 7-17 at% carbon, and many pores and cracks.

Effect of grinding and LaB[.sub]6[/] addition was investigated on graphitization and sinterability of raw oil coke powder. Grinding was found to lower graphitizability and improve sinterability of the powder. Oil coke with 5 wt% LaB[.sub]6[/] heat treated at 2500�C indicated a higher value of d[.sub](002)[/] than unadded oil coke. High Temperature Oxidation of SiC-C Particle Mixtures. M. Ishikawa, H.

Hatae, T. Suruga, J. Yoshitomi, and I. Furusato (Krosaki Corporation) MgO-C bricks have excellent slag and thermal shock resistance and are widely used in converters. It is well known that metals such as Al, Si, and Al-Mg alloy are added to prevent oxidation of MgO-C bricks. We will mainly discuss the high temperature behavior of MgO-C bricks with Al, Al-Mg alloy and Mg-B additions. We also investigated the addition of Mg-B material to MgO-C bricks. Consequently, oxidation resistance and hot M.O.R. were found to be greatly improved by less than 1% additions of Mg-B material together with less than 5% Al or Al-Mg alloy.

We have made improvements in Alumina-Magnesia castable refractories for steel ladles. It was recognized that use of fine magnesia powder and super fine silica powder brings about superior corrosion resistance. The reason why corrosion resistance is improved result from improved density, due to spinel expansion under load. Changes of Elasticity by Slag Penetration Into Monolithic Refractories. E. Udagawa, E. Maeda, and T. Nozaki (Iron & Steel Research Labs., Kawasaki Steel Corp.) The structural spalling derived from slag penetration is the most significant phenomenon for wear of refractories. Then we investigated about changes of material properties such as elasticity by slag penetration into magnesia based monolithic refractories. Elasticity of the material measured at room temperature increased by slag penetration, and the magnitude of it was great at the hot face side of specimen compared with the place at penetrated CaO finally reached. Quantitative Evaluation of the Dimensions of Process Zone and Crack-Face Bridging Region. H. Kurita and M. Sakai (TUT) The fracture toughness of ceramic materials is controlled by the frontal process zone as well as the crack-face bridging behind the crack-tip. In graphite materials, the process zone size is extremely large. Its R-curve behavior is dominated by grain bridging. These zone sizes are evaluated quantitatively through a fracture mechanics approach. Evaluation of Fatigue Crack Growth Characteristics of Alumina Ceramics. F. Tamai (Industrial Technology Center of Saga) and K. Hirano (Mechanical Engineering Lab., AIST, MITI) In order to know the influence of cyclic load on the crack propagation behavior of sintered alumina, static and cyclic fatigue crack growth tests were carried out over a wide range of fatigue crack growth rate. The crack growth rate da/dN was independent of frequency. In cases of R, R = 0.1, 0.5, the crack growth rate in cyclic fatigue was higher than that in static fatigue. The effective stress intensity factor range _D_K[.sub]eff[/], together with K[.sub]max[/], is a useful parameter to describe the cyclic crack propagation rate. Effect of Notch-Root Radius on the Fracture Toughness of Alumina Ceramic. T. Nishida, Y. Hanaki (Kyoto I.T.) The dependence of the K[.sub]IC[/] value on the notch-tip radius has been examined up to notch radii as small as few microns in a dense, fine-grained polycrystalline alumina ceramic. The K[.sub]IC[/] value was found to be independent of the notch sharpness for tip radii <10 �m. The Crack Growth Resistance of an In-situ Toughened Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] Ceramics at Elevated Temperatures. T. Miyajima, Y. Yamauchi, and T. Ohji (GIRIN) The crack growth resistance (R-curve) and the fracture toughness (G[.sub]Ic[/]) of a rod-like _b_-Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] toughened Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] ceramics were determined by the use of AM-DCB specimen at elevated temperatures. The effect of the fractured temperature on the maximum crack growth resistance (R[.sup]�[/]) was more sensitive than that on the fracture toughness. The results from this R-curve study indicate that integral relationship of crack-face bridging force and bridging length take minimum-value about 1100�C and maximum about 1200�C at displacement rate of 0.005mm/min.

The failure probability in the compression test of ring specimen was calculated using the mechanical properties obtained from 3-point bending test. Three kinds of criteria were evaluated in the calculations. The calculated values of penny shaped crack criterion and G-criterion were in good agreement with the experimental values. Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and Shear Internal Frictions (I). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo) We succeeded to develop a high temperature-simultaneous measuring system for all elastic moduli (Young's, shear and bulk moduli, Poisson's ratio and Lame parameter), dilational and shear internal friction values from room temperature to 1823 K, by an ultrasonic pulse sing-around method. These elastic moduli and Lame parameter of _a_-Al[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/], (Y)TZP and _b_'-sialon decrease and their Poisson's ratio increases with increasing temperature, suggesting activation of shear mode in the high temperature region. Temperature Dependence of the Elastic Moduli, Dilational and Shear Internal Frictions (II). M. Fukuhara, A. Sanpei (Toshiba Tungaloy), I. Yamauchi (Cho-onpa Kogyo) The elastic moduli and Poisson's ratio of (Y)TZP and _b_'-sialon decrease and increases with increasing of temperature, respectively. The high-temperature shear internal friction for (Y)TZP and sialon are more sensitive to strain and softening of glassy phase at grain boundaries, compared with the dilational one. Rapid increase in dilational friction corresponds to grain boundary sliding phenomena such as superplasticity and recrystallization. Problems of Fitting Fatigue Data of Ceramics to a Straight Line. N. Yamada, Y. Nakasuji, and H. Sakai (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) The method of straight line fitting and the variability of estimated crack growth parameter n for fatigue data of ceramics were considered. The least square method (LSM) was applied to Monte Carlo simulation data of the static fatigue life time obtained from the Weibull distribution of initial strengths and the power law of the slow crack growth. The average of crack growth parameter n estimated by the LSM is not in agreement with the true value. The standard deviation of n is relatively large and influenced by the Weibull modulus m. Ultrasonic Fatigue Test of Sintered Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] (III). T. Makino, Y. Nakasuji, H. Sakai, and M. Matsui (NGK Insulators, Ltd.) Ultrasonic fatigue test of sintered Si[.sub]3[/]N[.sub]4[/] was conducted to evaluate the influence of precrack length on fatigue behavior. S-N curves show the reverse S-shaped behavior. Fatigue limit depends on the precrack length. The longer the precrack length is, the smaller the difference between fast fracture strength and fatigue limit becomes. Effect of Applied Stress Ratio on Fatigue Lifetime Distribution of Polycrystalline Alumina Ceramics. T. Ina, K. Yasuda, K. Jinbo, Y. Matsuo, and S. Kimura The lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was investigated on variable applied stress ratio. The range of lifetime distribution on cyclic fatigue loading was narrower than on static loading. This suggests that fatigue behavior between under cyclic loading and static loading is different. Evaluations of Quenching Liquid Used on the Quenching Method for Ceramics. T. Nishikawa, T. Gao, M. Hibi, and M. Takatsu (NIT) Transitional temperatures in the specimen were measured after quenching and analyzed with various quenching liquids. The heat transfer coefficients h were obtained for each temperature difference. The mixture of mineral oil and butanol proved to be the suitable quenching liquid for thermal shock test of ceramics.

Kohei Oda (Yonago National College of Technology) and Tetsuo Yoshio (Okayama University) This work is concerned with the reactions between h-BN materials and common oxidizing media, such as oxygen and H[.sub]2[/]O. The oxidation and hydrothermal corrosion kinetics for h-BN were found to obey linear rate law and described by the surface chemical reaction controlled shrinking model. The apparent activation energies were found to be 300 kJ/mol in dry oxygen and 60 kJ/mol in water, respectively. Corrosion behavior of sintered h-BN will be discussed with regard to its microstructure. Transmission Electron Microscopy of Grain Boundaries in MgO Aggregates. T. Matsui, J. Nakao, H. Nakamura, H. Taira (Process Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.), and M. Ueki (Adv. Mat. & Tech. Res. Lab., Nippon Steel Corp.) Observation of grain boundaries for MgO aggregates with different purities was performed using transmission electron microscope. The MgO aggregate, containing about 0.5 wt% B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as impurities, has glassy grain-boundary phases. On the other hand the MgO aggregate, containing only 0.003 wt% B[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] as impurities, has crystalline grain-boundary phases. Phase Transition Enthalpy Between Tetragonal and Monoclinic Phases in ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] Solid Solutions. M. Yashima, H. Takashina, M. Kakihana, M. Yoshimura (Tokyo Institute of Technology), T. Mitsuhashi, T. Ikegami (National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials) Compositionally homogeneous ZrO[.sub]2[/]-Y[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] and ZrO[.sub]2[/]-CeO[.sub]2[/] solid solutions were prepared by arc melting and by sintering, respectively. Transition enthalpy between tetragonal and monoclinic phases, which were determined by DSC (Differential Scanning Calorimetry) measurements, decreased with an increase of dopant content. The DSC peak broadened and the transition temperature decreased linearly with an increase of dopant content.
