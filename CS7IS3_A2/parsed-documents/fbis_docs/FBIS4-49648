Arap Moi that China is willing to further the friendly cooperation with Kenya and strengthen the bilateral coordination and discussion of international affairs. During the talks lasting over one hour here this afternoon, the two sides exchanged views on bilateral ties and African and international issues. Both of them expressed satisfaction with the smooth development of Sino-Kenyan ties and shared the views that the two countries, as developing ones, face the same tasks of safeguarding peace and seeking development and that improving bilateral relations is in the interest of the two peoples. Jiang said that Moi, who had visited China twice, was an old friend well-known and respected by the Chinese people. He pointed out that China attached great importance to its relations with Kenya and would like to consistently strengthen and develop the cooperative ties in various fields on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence. Jiang expressed his appreciation for Kenya's one-China policy and extended his thanks for Kenya's support of China to resume its signatory status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The two countries have supported and cooperated with each other on the human rights issue, he said, adding that China would like to further its cooperation and discussions with Kenya on other international issues. On bilateral economic and technological cooperation, Jiang said that the Chinese Government encourages its companies to conduct business abroad, and he hoped that the two countries would carry out various people-to-people economic exchanges as well as governmental cooperation. Jiang also spoke highly of Moi's stand for Africans handling African affairs by themselves, opposing foreign interference, establishing a political and economic system according to each country's own situation, and strengthening unity of the nations. He gave a briefing to the guests on China's reform and opening and the idea of implementing a socialist market economy, as well as on China's independent foreign policy. Moi said that the aim of the visit is to meet with the Chinese leaders and acquaint himself with China's economy in an effort to learn from each other and seek common development. He said that the two countries had many common views on such international issues as human rights, and no country should impose its human rights conception on others since the domestic situations were different. He reaffirmed Kenya's one-China stand and warmly invited Jiang to visit Kenya. After the talks, the two presidents participated in the signing ceremony of the bilateral agreement on economic and technological cooperation, agreement on culture between 1994 and 1996, and protocol on educational exchanges.
