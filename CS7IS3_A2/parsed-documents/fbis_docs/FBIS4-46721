Part of the Seimas building is rented for the head of state. Brazauskas has spent more than one year in this office. He arrived here when he was elected chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR in January 1990. After the elections in the fall of 1992 Brazauskas became chairman of the Seimas and acting President of the Lithuanian Republic, which brought him back to this office. On 14 February 1993, receiving 60 percent of the votes in the election, Brazauskas took the post of President of Lithuania. [Pyadyshev] Russia's relations with the Baltic republics are far from happy. Against this general background there is more tranquility and realism in Russian-Lithuanian affairs. The fundamental issues of mutual relations were already settled last year. The surface layer of Russian-Lithuanian relations is, however, fragile. There was a recent flare-up because of delay in implementation of the agreement on trade and economic relations. You, Mr. President, are complaining that you have been unsuccessful in trying to get a call through to the Kremlin. You sent a message to the Russian President about this. Your displeasure flowed over into your speech in the parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. [Brazauskas] The evening before my visit to Strasbourg, where I spoke in the parliament of the Council of Europe, I talked by telephone with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. It was a constructive conversation. I also exchanged messages with President Boris Yeltsin. I think that there are possibilities of eliminating those difficulties in our relations that have appeared recently. Overall the present state of relations between Lithuania and Russia, despite the existing difficulties, can be described as good. They are developing in the direction outlined by the 29 July 1991 treaty and the 30 August 1993 Joint Declaration of the Presidents of Russia and Lithuania. The visit of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to Lithuania, during which a whole package of 10 agreements was signed, was also very important. One of the main agreements was the trade and economic agreement on most favored nation status. Unfortunately, it has not gone into effect yet. Lithuania has fulfilled its treaty obligations; now it is Russia's turn. It is mutually disadvantageous and unprofitable that, even though the treaty has been signed, the name of Lithuania is not found in the long list of more than 130 countries with which Russia carries on free trade and trade on a most favored nation basis. In my opinion, there is no future in that kind of economic pressure. [Pyadyshev] Moscow has its own reason for this. You were exactly right that the agreements signed constitute a package and thus should be realized as a package, in an integrated manner. As I understand it, what they are waiting for from the Lithuanian side is a solution to issues related to the vitality of Kaliningrad Oblast, above all the question of transit travel. [Brazauskas] It is natural that Russia wants to serve some of its interests related to Kaliningrad Oblast by collaboration with Lithuania. This includes the movement of people and transit shipment of various goods and freight across Lithuanian territory. In addition, most of the electricity and food consumed in the oblast is produced in Lithuania. We both have an interest in formalizing these and other areas of collaboration in agreements and treaties. Thus, many of the 10 Lithuanian-Russian agreements signed on 18 November 1993 concerned Kaliningrad Oblast directly. In Lithuania you hear arguments about the future status of Kaliningrad Oblast and revision of the decisions of the Potsdam Conference fairly often in the press and even in the statements of some political figures. They question Russian sovereignty over Kaliningrad Oblast and clearly go beyond scholarly debate. I can assure you that this is not the position of Lithuania. However, we are not indifferent to the future political and economic development of the oblast. I will not deny that we would like it better if Russia developed this oblast in the direction of Hong Kong (a free trade-economic zone), and not like, for example, Gibraltar (a military fortress). We are happy that at present, despite the well-known troubles with placement of Russian troops being withdrawn from Europe, both Moscow and Kaliningrad are more inclined to the first alternative. Polish President Lech Walesa recently visited Vilnius. He and I exchanged opinions about transit traffic to Kaliningrad Oblast; by land, of course, it goes either through Lithuania or through Poland. Our opinion was the same: if transit traffic is carried on in conformity with the laws of the sovereign countries, following international rules, and if it is economically beneficial, it can only be welcomed and will prove advantageous to the corresponding countries. But if we are talking about uncontrolled transit traffic, about some kind of corridors (for understandable reasons this word sounds harsh to the ears of our Polish partners), that is an entirely different matter. That is unacceptable. [Pyadyshev] Most of the people in Russia think that in Lithuania, unlike the situation in some other countries, there are basically no problems on the state and political levels with ensuring the rights of the Russian-speaking population. [Brazauskas] Yes, the postwar demographic, social, and economic development, finally, plus the historical tolerance in Lithuanian society, have not created ethnic problems in Lithuania. We have been able to move to so-called positive discrimination in relation to ethnic minorities in some fields. This means that more favorable conditions are created for the ethnic minorities than for the main people. We intend to hold to this policy in the future as well. We have the following demographic ratio: 80 percent Lithuanians and 9 percent Russians. We do not see any problems. And what is being done in Latvia and Estonia? I simply cannot justify the fact that such unacceptable measures for our democratic world are being adopted there. But on the other hand, why can't we understand this attitude, when only about half the people left are Latvians? In general, the question arises: What is an ethnic minority? [Pyadyshev] All states, large and small, are equal before God and before the U.N. Charter. But we must take account of the historical fate of each country, its geopolitical status... [Brazauskas] The history of the Lithuanian state is very complex, especially the last 200 years since the third partition of the Rzeczpospolita [Republic] in 1795. Lithuania was a part of that state, and after that it belonged to Russia. Before this there were quite complex relations with Poland, with which Lithuania lived in union for some 200 years. Almost two centuries as part of the tsarist empire, then the Soviet Union, with the exception of 20 years. This left its mark. I remember, not in reproach of course, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, who once said to me: "Listen, what is this independence to you? What do you need it for? You've lived together with this large, great country, and you'll keep on living that way." What does this tell us? Even people on such a high level, educated, enormously experienced, have difficulty understanding the mood and spirit of the people. Lithuania is a small country. We have 3 million Lithuanians in the country, and another 1 million abroad. But our national spirit is not disappearing; it assists the state formation of this small people to endure its trials. In no way do we support national states as pure-blooded states. We have many nationalities; that is how history developed. We find a common language with them. There are misunderstandings, of course, but they are the kind that can be resolved by normal methods and means. I cannot say that we are on the frontier. Of course, dealings with Holland, Belgium, and Austria are a different matter. Relations there have been developing for hundreds of years. We are aware of the attention we are receiving, especially from small states, for example Denmark and the other Scandinavian countries. Of course, we do not wait with outstretched hands for someone to rescue us, to prop up our life. We figure to satisfy 2-5 percent of our needs with assistance. Everything else we must do ourselves. [Pyadyshev] After a certain period of silence the United States and other Western countries have returned to their former arguments about Russia's imperial ambitions, by which they mean the interests of present-day Russia in the regions of the former Soviet Union. One wonders: What is news about that, that Russia really has its own interests in territories with which it was joined in the USSR and in which many connecting lines have remained--economic, political, cultural, and ethnic? It would be strange if people were talking about the absence of such interests. Moreover, some are saying, with good grounds, that a risky situation would be created if Russia were to renounce its special interests in these regions. [Brazauskas] I agree with you that there are such interests. But when a high-ranking Russian official states that the Baltic countries are the near abroad, that is a different matter. You cannot stop and leave the field open for each person to speculate and interpret these interests in his own way. But the way you put it, I agree. Lithuania also has interests in Russia. And they are not at all aggressive. Normal neighborly relations in a very broad spectrum. Mr. Viktor Chernomyrdin, Mr. Andrey Kozyrev, and Mr. Pavel Grachev have also sat at this table. In my opinion we found a common language. We found agreement and discussed matters. Of course, over 50 years the economic integration was enormous, and a policy of deep specialization, large-scale construction projects, and large enterprises was followed. We continue to feel this today. Those kinds of interests I understand. But you know, when a high official talks about permanent interests in the Baltic region it leads me to various thoughts. There are people who are using this for their own ends. The discussion here must, of course, be carried through to the end. [Pyadyshev] Apparently you have in mind the RF minister of foreign affairs' speech at a meeting at the ministry. An uproar began after that, but explanations were later given. [Brazauskas] When things are explained "later," it often fails to achieve the desired end... [Pyadyshev] It was clarified that the journalist who attended the meeting had presented the minister's words inaccurately. [Brazauskas] Judge for yourself, we get information, perhaps distorted, but we cannot check it for ourselves. This phrase is used about us, the "near abroad." Basically, what does this mean, the near abroad? What is understood by this? [Pyadyshev] I assure you that the Baltic region was not included in the near abroad at that meeting--and I attended it--or anywhere else. This term encompasses a very definite group of countries, which constitute the CIS... But let us turn to another subject. You mentioned Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev. How did your relations with him take shape when you were first secretary of the Central Committee of the Lithuanian Communist Party? [Brazauskas] I am not the judge, of course, but it is my personal impression that he gave in to a rock-hard politburo. And did not undertake to restructure our life. Something was always holding him back. But life was already demanding a new approach, new solutions within the state, and a certain freedom in the activity of public and even party organizations. Where did it begin among us? As first secretary I made a firm demand that party organizations be given autonomy. But the Central Committee, especially the organizational department, was still filled with people who longed for the old days, Razumov, Razumovskiy, Yegor Kuzmich. They always said that the politburo was a monolith, a monolith. But this monolith fell into pieces. If we had gone to a multiparty system it would not have been so dramatic. When our first rally was organized a shout went up to expel certain people from the party. Pugo gave me a list then of 10 people who had expressed their opinions. They sent a commission and terrorized us for a whole month. "Why aren't you responding according to the party line?" But how can you say that when life has completely changed? The party leadership did not see this or, possibly, certain people saw it but were afraid to say it. Finally we expelled ourselves, and then after that they expelled us at the politburo. Incidentally, have you read my book "Divorce Lithuanian Style"? In it I tried to present the events of that period as fully as possible. [Pyadyshev] How do you see the results of the Brazauskas presidency by the time it concludes? [Brazauskas] I have only been president for a year, and of course, it is very difficult to guess far into the future. Today we can only engage in fantasy. If we are able to preserve a consistently working government we will achieve tangible results. Instability of the executive power produces poor results. That is my goal. Of course, we cannot avoid the replacement of certain ministers. But under our Constitution if more than half of them are replaced then the parliament must give the government a vote of confidence. We will have to do that, and we will do it. Therefore I attach great importance to the work of the government and to work with the government. With the Cabinet of Ministers. We have very close ties--consultations, discussions of particular issues. The prime minister visits me 4-5 times a week. I drop in to his office. That is a mandatory condition. But I never work for them and I do not issue any ukases, although I do have certain powers.
