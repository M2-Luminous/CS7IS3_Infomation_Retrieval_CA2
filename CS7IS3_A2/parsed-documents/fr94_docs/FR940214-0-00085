FR940214-0-00085 FR940214-0-00012 B. Supply Line Pressure Requirements for Trailers Section S5.8.2 of Standard No. 121 currently requires that any single leakage type failure in the service brake system must not result in the pressure in the supply line falling below 70 p.s.i., measured at the forward trailer supply coupling. (See 56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991). The purpose of this provision is to prevent brake drag caused by the automatic application of trailer parking brakes while the minimum trailer supply line pressure is maintained. In a June 5, 1992 letter to the agency, ITI requested that the agency ``exempt'' its brake system from S5.8.2. It argued that this provision relates to problems caused by brake drag, a situation that it contends is not applicable to ITI's brake system, which, by design, can only be in the fully applied or fully released positions. After considering ITI's arguments, NHTSA, in the NPRM, tentatively concluded that no safety purpose would be served to apply this provision to non-towing trailers using air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes that use a common diaphragm. The agency noted that these vehicles do not use spring brakes and thus the requirement which addresses the safety problem of brake drag is not relevant to them. Accordingly, the agency proposed to amend section S5.8.2 to clarify that this provision would not apply to non-towing trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes that use a common diaphragm. Nevertheless, NHTSA emphasized that section S5.8.2 would continue to apply to towing trailers, since the 70 psi requirements may be necessary for other vehicles in the train. Midland-Grau, ITI, ATA, and Allied Signal addressed the issue of whether the 70 psi supply line pressure requirement should be retained for trailers, particularly towing trailers, equipped with air-applied, mechanically held parking brakes. Midland-Grau stated that making the 70 psi requirement optional for towing trailers with air-applied mechanically hold brake systems introduces a detriment to the couple vehicles in the event of system failure. This led Midland-Grau to conclude that it is necessary to apply failure. This led Midland-Grau to conclude that it is necessary to apply the supply line pressure requirements to trailers since a towing trailer will experience brake degradation if it is not properly protected from towed trailer system failures. In contrast, ITI stated that this requirement should not be applied to either towing or non-towing vehicles equipped with air-applied, mechanically held vehicles since they do not experience brake drag. This led ITI to state that S5.8.4 was not necessary, because it claimed that partial application or brake drag is not an issue with its brake systems. Thus, it requested that towing trailers with air-applied, mechanically held systems be permitted without the 70 psi supply line protection feature, even though it acknowledge that this may result in some mismatches. In response to Midland-Grau's comment, ITI stated that trailers equipped with spring brakes manufactured before and after the October 1992 rule that specified these requirements (56 FR 50666, October 8, 1991) will experience compatibility problems. Therefore, ITI believed that the problem raised by Midland-Grau will exist with spring brake equipped trailers as well as trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held equipped trailers. ATA commented that the existing 70 psi supply line requirement is inappropriate and prevents tractor low air pressure warning systems from warning drivers of the loss of service pressure in trailers. Therefore, it requested that the agency either exempt all trailers from the 70 psi supply line requirement or modify the requirement. Allied Signal similarly stated that the 70 psi requirement has undermined the effectiveness of the low pressure warning system, especially for doubles and triples. After reviewing the comments, NHTSA has decided not to apply the supply lone pressure requirements to single trailers equipped with air-applied, mechanically held brake systems. Such trailers, which do not experience brake drag, also do not affect the braking of any other vehicle because they are not connected to other trailers. Therefore, as discussed in the NPRM, this requirement would not benefit this type of trailer.
