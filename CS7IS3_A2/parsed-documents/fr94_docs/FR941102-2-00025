The Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated System [Docket No. TX95&hyph;2&hyph;000] Take notice that on October 17, 1994, The Wisconsin Public Power Incorporated System (WPPI) tendered for filing an application requesting that the Commission order Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO), Wisconsin Power and Light Company (WP&L), and Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) jointly, joint network tariff to provide network transmission services on a joint, single-system basis to WPPI. The application was filed pursuant to Section 211 of the Federal Power Act, as amended by Energy Policy Act of 1992 (16 U.S.C. 824j). In its application, WPPI requests that network service be provided commencing on May 1, 1995, and continuing on a long-term basis thereafter. The total transmission capacity requested would be sufficient for WPPI to integrate its load in eastern Wisconsin (now approximately 482 MW) with WPPI's resources. The service requested is network service over the integrated transmission grid of the EWU. The service requested includes both long and short-term firm and non-firm use, comparable in all respects to the EWU's use of the EWU grid. WPPI seeks services that will allow it, subject to existing power purchase contracts, (i) to schedule power and energy from a variety of sources within and outside of the EWU grid to WPPI's loads within the control areas of WP&L, WEPCO and WPS on an economic dispatch basis and in response to planned and unplanned outages and (ii) to engage in coordination purchases and sales using the EWU grid in the same manner as the owners of that grid schedule their power and energy transactions. The service would be costed on single-system basis for the EWU, with one joint rate for use of the integrated transmission system of three utilities. Revenues would be shared by the EWU. WPPI also requested that the EWU unbundle their transmission services from power sales services. Copies of the application have been served upon the affected parties, WEPCO, WP&L, WPS, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, and upon Madison Gas & Electric Company. Comment date: November 9, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice. Standard Paragraphs E. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before the comment date. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
