The following is a report by correspondent Nam Son-hyon from UN headquarters. [Begin Nam recording] The UNSC held a plenary meeting on the morning of 1 April Korean time and unanimously adopted a presidential statement urging North Korea to accept nuclear inspections. Saying that the statement was adopted upon agreement of all the UNSC member states, Jean-Bernard Merimee, president of the UNSC, read the statement in which indirect expressions replaced precise wordings of additional measures on North Korea and a negotiation deadline. In the presidential statement adopted today, the clause regarding additional measures on North Korea was mildly expressed by stating that additional evaluation will be made on the compliance of the agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] if North Korea refuses nuclear inspections. As to the negotiation deadline, which was one month, no specific date was fixed, but the IAEA secretary-general is to report the result of negotiations with North Korea to the UNSC at the next inspection. The presidential statement comprises five articles including that the UNSC will continue to deal with the North Korean nuclear issue and urge North-South dialogue. Today's statement was a presidential statement, which is milder than a binding resolution, without any strong expression including sanctions or measures on North Korea. It is analyzed that China had strong influence on the statement and the United States, United Kingdom, and France made considerable concessions. However, a high-ranking official of the ROK mission to the United Nations, said that the United States explained the draft statement to the ROK in advance and evaluated that it is more meaningful to adopt a presidential statement with the participation of China and have China actively involved in the North Korean nuclear issue in the future than to adopt a resolution and exclude a few countries from measures on North Korea.
