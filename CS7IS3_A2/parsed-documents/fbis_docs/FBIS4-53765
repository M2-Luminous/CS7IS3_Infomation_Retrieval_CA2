Meeting his South Korean counterpart Han Sung-chu, Alatas explained that Cairo will be in charge of drafting the final document that is to include the first clause on the nuclear dispute. Alatas said Indonesia, as chairman of NAM, will try to reflect a balanced position on the matter that is unbiased toward both North and South Korea and the international community, Yu Pyong-u, director-general of the Asian Affairs Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry, said after the two-hour talks. Alatas said his government will "have sympathy" for South Korea's bid to gain a non-permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, noting that Jakarta is aware of Seoul's position. South Korea is expected to compete with Sri Lanka for the council slot for 1996-97. Indonesia has been the object of heavy diplomatic lobbying by North Korea, which keeps its third largest mission here with a staff of 25 as a base camp for Southeast Asia. NAM foreign ministers meet May 31 in Cairo and the row over Pyongyang's nuclear program is on the agenda for the first time, with the final document at the end of the meeting June 3 to address the issue. Alatas commented on the need for overall revisions to the makeup of the permanent membership of the Security Council, pointing out that all current members except China are advanced nations. He emphasized that developing countries should be duly represented as well, Yu said. The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in November, to be hosted by Indonesia. Alatas notified Han that the summit is slated for Nov. 15, preceded by a ministerial conference Nov. 11-12. Despite the expected changes from last year when the United States and other advanced nations stole the spotlight, Alatas explained his country plans to follow the format of last year's summit. In addition, the two foreign ministers discussed prospects for the Malaysia-led East Asian Economic Caucus (EAEC), a sub-group within APEC that raised U.S. officials' eyebrows when advanced countries were excluded. Alatas said the matter will be discussed fully with South Korea, Japan and China as well as Australia, Canada and the United States.
