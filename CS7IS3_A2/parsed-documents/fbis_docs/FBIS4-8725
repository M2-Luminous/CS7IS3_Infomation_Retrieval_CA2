The consultations were also attended by Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina. An agreement was reached on the formation of a government of national unity that will be constituted at the assembly session scheduled for 20 April in Knin. In the name of the Serbian Democratic Party for Krajina [SDS], its president Dr. Milan Babic gave his agreement and support to Prime Minister Designate Borislav Mikelic for forming a government in which the SDS Krajina will be represented in proportion to its representation in the parliament. Veljko Vukelic, president of the deputy caucus of the SDS for Serbian lands, extended his support to this constructive agreement between Mikelic and Babic. The composition of the new government of national unity of the republic of Serbian Krajina was also established. [Zivkovic] Mr. Mikelic, we have heard that on 20 April, the republic of Serbian Krajina will get a government of national unity. [Mikelic] Well, yes. As soon as I was nominated prime minister designate by President Martic, I joined these, so to speak, active talks with the representatives and presidents of all the parties in the republic of Serbian Krajina. Of course, one of the central issues was the position the Serbian Democratic Party, headed by Mr. Babic, would take. Incidentally, the SDS has the greatest number of deputies in the republican assembly, regarding the part of the parliamentary coalition that existed [sentence as heard]. For my part, I also talked to the leadership of the Serbian Radical Party [SRS], who, because of certain requests that I obviously could not implement -- I even offered a part of their membership to join our government -- however, owing to certain principled or some other reasons, they remained within the framework of their party's position [sentence as heard]. We have reached a complete agreement, an integral agreement with Mr. Babic, with the representatives of the SDS of the Serbian lands and other parties, and I can say that we have already reached an agreement on all the ministers in the framework of the future government which I will lead. Therefore, along with the program that I will present to the assembly of the republic of Serbian Krajina on Wednesday, 20 April, I will also present the composition of the government, the cabinet, that is, and I believe that in such agreements, [words indistinct] we will achieve the unity which is of extreme importance to the Serbian people within the framework of the republic of Serbian Krajina at a point when we have signed this peace process, when we need to strengthen the Krajina from within, when we need to revive production, strengthen the civic state, and offer a perspective of our future joint state which we will create with the Srpska republic and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I am convinced that this composition of the government and our agreement will lessen the tensions present on the ground, and that the Serbian people in the Krajina [changes thought], and that more favorable news will come from the Krajina than has been the case in the previous year and in those months when there were significant conflicts there.
