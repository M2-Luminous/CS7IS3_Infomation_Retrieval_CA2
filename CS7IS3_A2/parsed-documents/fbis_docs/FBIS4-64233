Berlusconi, who according to all observers will be given a mandate tomorrow to form a new government, told reporters one solution to the political wrangling over who will control the Interior Ministry may be to separate "what concerns local administrations from the ministry's other competences," adding: "I think a solution may also be found in this direction." The Northern League has been clamoring to be given the Interior Ministry portfolio in a new right-wing government led by Berlusconi's Forza Italia and presumably including the neo-Fascist National Alliance; the coalition may also include right-wing Christian Democrats (renamed Christian Democratic Center) and the tiny party led by Marco Pannella. Berlusconi also replied to persistent questioning about his continuing ownership of the Fininvest Group by saying that "good sense" should be enough to avoid any conflicts of interest. "I still do not have a convincing solution but I would say that the solution probably lies in good sense," he said, referring to growing calls, especially from the opposition, for legislation making it impossible for the head of government to control any part of the media. Fininvest controls three of the country's most popular television networks, a major publishing house, advertising, construction and insurance groups. According to Berlusconi, a government is "under the eye and judgment of all every day" and therefore passing judgment on only one person in that government "would not be logical." Berlusconi said he believed his "personality" and his "civic passion" should be sufficient guarantees against conflicts of interest. He apparently believes the system does not need improving and said, referring to the guarantees his personality and commitment have to offer: "If it is not possible, then there will be all the members of government who will be able to judge my every move, then there is parliament, with its opposition, which has the task of controlling and watching the action of the government and of the majority." In addition, he then said, pointing to the reporters from his own and competing networks, "there is you, protagonists of information, and there is the public." Furthermore, the president may always refuse to sign an act of parliament, preventing it from going into effect, Berlusconi said. In other words, "being submitted to a daily and severe examination by an infinite plurality of subjects is a total guarantee for a government," he explained. As for television and radio, Berlusconi said a watchdog body already exists, with "very precise rules and regulations" concerning election coverage. As for the businesses themselves, the only thing to be watched closely, is "illicit earnings," which can emerge immediately simply through "criticism." The likely head of Italy's next government said that placing his holdings in a blind trust would not be feasible and that all the other solutions proposed so far, including that of an ombudsmanship, "are not a good solution." Berlusconi said forcing him do divest would in effect sanction a law saying that "whoever is a businessman cannot govern," and that "taken to its extreme, this could mean that whoever owns an apartment cannot govern, or that that whoever owns any company at all cannot govern." Since "everyone is a holder of interests," according to Berlusconi's thought, the only thing to be watched is whether "one's government activities bring illicit gains" through conflicts of interest. Berlusconi said the entire issue of his mass media holdings has been "blown out of proportion" by his political adversaries and that what counts is "the judgment of voters."
