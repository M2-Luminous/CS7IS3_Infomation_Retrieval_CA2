FR941213-2-00041 FR941213-2-00032 Health Resources and Services Administration Program Announcement and Proposed Minimum Percentages for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference for Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Programs The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that applications will be accepted for fiscal year (FY) 1995 Grants for Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Programs under the authority of section 751, title VII of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Pub. L. 102&hyph;408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentages for ``high rate'' and ``significant increase in the rate'' for the implementation of the general statutory funding preference. Approximately $600,000 will be available in FY 1995 for this program. It is anticipated that the $600,000 will support approximately 7 competing awards averaging $86,000. Purpose Section 751 authorizes the award of grants for the purpose of planning and implementing projects in primary care training for podiatric physicians in approved or provisionally approved residency programs which shall provide financial assistance in the form of traineeships to residents who participate in such projects and who plan to specialize in primary care. Eligibility Eligible entities for this program are schools of podiatric medicine and public and nonprofit private hospitals. As noted above, the authorizing legislation limits eligibility to residency programs that are approved or provisionally approved. The Council on Podiatric Medical Education (CPME), the recognized accrediting body for podiatric medicine, uses the term ``candidate status'' in lieu of ``provisional approval.'' For the purposes of this program ``candidate status'' will be accepted as meeting the statutory requirement for ``provisional approval.'' Applicants to this program that are planning to initiate a new podiatric primary care residency program are expected to apply to CPME for candidate status. Grants will only be awarded to applicants that can demonstrate the attainment of candidate status by July 1, 1995. The application for Federal funding must demonstrate, through responses to the program specifications, that an adequate emphasis will be placed on podiatric primary care. The period of Federal support should not exceed 3 years. National Health Objectives for the Year 2000 The Public Health Service (PHS) is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS-led national activity for setting priority areas. The Podiatric Primary Care Residency Training Program is related to the priority area of Educational and Community-Based Programs. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00474&hyph;0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report; Stock No. 017&hyph;001&hyph;00473&hyph;1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402&hyph;9325 (Telephone 202&hyph;783&hyph;3238). Education and Service Linkage As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved. Smoke-Free Workplace The Public Health Service strongly encourages all grant recipients to provide a smoke-free workplace and promote the non-use of all tobacco products. This is consistent with the PHS mission to protect and advance the physical and mental health of the American people. The following project requirements and review criteria were established in FY 1989, after public comment and are being extended by the Administration in FY 1995. Project Requirements Each project must have: a. A project director who is employed by the grantee institution and has completed at least one year of podiatric residency training and has at least one year of clinical teaching experience; or is board certified in a recognized specialty area in podiatric medicine and has at least 5 years of clinical teaching experience; b. An appropriate administrative and organizational plan and appropriate faculty, staff and facility resources for the achievement of stated objectives; c. A systematic evaluation of the educational program, including the performance and competence of trainees and faculty, the administration of the program, and the degree to which program and educational objectives are met; d.
