The ratio of boy babies to girl babies was 144.6 to 100; and the ratio in Tengzhou City, which is subordinate to Zaozhuang, was 163.8 to 100. According to analysis, a major reason for the serious sex imbalance among babies was the use of the ultrasound B test. Many people use this technology to determine the sex of embryos so that they can keep boy babies and abort female embryos. In view of this situation, the Zaozhuang City CPC Committee recently ordered that if Communist Party members receive or administer ultrasound tests, they will be expelled from the party. The same offense will cause state cadres and workers in state-owned institutions to be dismissed.
