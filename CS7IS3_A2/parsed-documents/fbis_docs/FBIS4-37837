[Buwayz] I am sure you are aware that Lebanon entered these negotiations on two principles. The first concerns Lebanon; that is, Israeli occupation of the Lebanese territory in the south and western al-Biqa'. Lebanon continues to believe that Resolution 425 constitutes the accurate, clear, and just mechanism to remove this occupation. This is a basic condition. Secondly, Lebanon is concerned about the dispute in general. Lebanon is an Arab country, one of the ancient Arab decisionmaking states and one of the founding members of the Arab League. It hosts a large number of Palestinian people. It is concerned with any peace in the region and with the fate of these Palestinians. Therefore, Lebanon deals with this issue in general in solidarity with the other Arab states. It will not sign an agreement in isolation of the other concerned states and before these states have regained their usurped rights. So far, Israel wants to combine these two cases and we cannot yet say that Israel has agreed to the principle of leaving the occupied Lebanese territory. We presented a clear mechanism. We said that Israel should abide by full withdrawal behind the internationally recognized borders. For this reason, we will accept the formation of a joint military committee to discuss the tabulation and programming of this withdrawal in addition to how peace and stability can be secured in the south. Lebanon will then begin talks in solidarity with its brothers on the level of this future peace. [passage omitted] [Tarabayh] Mr. Minister, frankly speaking, you are aware that the West, especially the United States, is asking the Lebanese state to spread its control on the entire southern region; that is, stopping the resistance operations so that Israel could stop its attacks on the south. Are you adhering to the principled stand of the Lebanese government; that is, continuing the resistance until the end of the occupation? [Buwayz] You said at the beginning that the world is demanding that Lebanon impose its control over its entire territory. That is what we wish and that is what we are demanding from the Western world. However, the reality is different. We believe that nobody in this world would like to die for nothing, nobody likes to die unless he believes in a sublime objective. We believe that the resistance is the result and not the cause of the occupation because it began after the occupation. A solution for this problem lies in reassuring Lebanon that Israel will withdraw from its territory to the internationally recognized borders. I believe that other solutions, be they military or security solutions, have proved after many years that they are futile and will only result in more violence in southern Lebanon. I really would like to ask about the results of the Israeli attacks on the south over the past 10 years. Have these attacks with all their technology, sophistication, and power, been able to cancel the will of the Lebanese people to regain their south? I think the solution is a political one and lies in a clear Israeli commitment to withdraw from southern Lebanese. [Tarabayh] If full Israeli withdrawal from the south is realized, will Hizballah undertake to hand in their weapons and renounce fighting? [Buwayz] In any case, there is an undertaking by the Lebanese state that when Israel withdraws, this Lebanese state will be committed--and it now has all the resources, and the required security and stability--to implementing a full security plan in the southern region. I believe that this has been a constant policy of the successive governments during the era of President al-Hirawi. These governments have presented this undertaking to more than one team. Lebanon does not love violence and trouble. It does not seek more than its natural and legitimate rights. When this is realized. the Lebanese state, which is now strong by its armed forces, will be committed to spreading its full control over the entire south and laying down the basis of peace and stability. [passage omitted] [Tarabayh] What is Lebanon's attitude on the various tracks of negotiations and the Arab coordination? [Buwayz] We have all wished this peace to be a comprehensive peace. We cannot view the comprehensiveness of this solution and this peace the way things are being done; that is, by separate means. Therefore, Lebanon, which believes that this peace has to be either comprehensive or not to be at all, based on experience and prior consideration of things, cannot but call on everybody to effect cohesion in the peace process. Moreover, we believe that this peace is an Arab-Israeli peace decision. Who represents the Arabs? They are represented by all their states, trends, and forces. Therefore, we believe that separate solutions will empty the meaning of a comprehensive solution for the Arab-Israeli question. So far, we believe that an Arab peace decision cannot be concluded except through a unified Arab decision. It does not come through separate paths. As for what was realized on the Jordanian level in terms of achievements, so far I really do not believe that there are achievements. I do not know if you are aware what these achievements are.
