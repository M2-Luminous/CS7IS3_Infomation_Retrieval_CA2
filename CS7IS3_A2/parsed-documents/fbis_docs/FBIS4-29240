Hiromi Takahashi, representative member of the Edokawa Ward People's Society in Tokyo, Japan, for supporting the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, charged that Japan has defined the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as "the enemy," fostering tension under the pretext of its "nuclear issue" and suppressing Chongnyon. He urged the Japanese Government to take steps to prevent outrages against Koreans in Japan. Lawyer Takayuki Yoshida denounced the search of the Kyoto prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon by the Japanese police and called for pooling strength in the struggle against "an emergency system" sought by the Japanese reactionary forces. Takayoshi Yamanaka, vice-chairman of the All-Japan Federation of Peasants Unions, said though Japan must ask pardon of the Korean people for the issues of "comfort women for the Army" and forcible drafting, it is increasing tension in league with the United States and South Korea. Warning that the suppression of Chongnyon today will reach the Japanese people tomorrow, he called for checking such fascist suppression.
