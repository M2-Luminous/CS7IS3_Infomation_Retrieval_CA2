Agency: Bureau of the Census. Title: Questionnaire for Building Permit Official. Form Number(s): SOC&hyph;903. Agency Approval Number: 0607&hyph;0125. Type of Request: Revision of a currently approved collection. Burden: 209 hours. Number of Respondents: 835. Avg Hours Per Response: 15 minutes. Needs and Uses: The Bureau of the Census uses the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official in conjunction with the Survey of Housing Starts, Sales, and Completions (OMB number 0607&hyph;0110). Data collected in the Survey of Housing Starts are used to produce statistics on residential construction and are needed by economic policymakers to monitor this sector of the economy. Census field interviewers use the Questionnaire for Building Permit Official to obtain information on the operating procedures of a sample of the building permit issuing offices in the United States in order to locate, classify, list, and sample building permits for residential construction. This information is used to carry out the sampling for the Survey of Housing Starts and to verify and update the geographic coverage of permit offices. In calendar years 1995&hyph;96, we plan to automate the data collection by replacing the paper questionnaire with laptop computers. Affected Public: State or local governments. Frequency: On occasion. Respondent's Obligation: Voluntary. OMB Desk Officer: Maria Gonzalez, (202) 395&hyph;7313. Copies of the above information collection proposal can be obtained by calling or writing Edward Michals, DOC Forms Clearance Officer, (202) 482&hyph;3271, Department of Commerce, room 5312, 14th and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230.
