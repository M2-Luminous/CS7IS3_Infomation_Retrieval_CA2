"We have sufficient reasons to doubt the reliability of General Rose's sources," the Bosnian president said in a statement. He also criticised the fact that Rose had not specified whether the Moslem mortar fire had been in response to a Serb attack or a defensive manoeuvre. Izetbegovic said UNPROFOR had "systematically... denied" Bosnian reports on the serious nature of the Serb offensive against Gorazde, adding that the NATO air strikes had been launched too late and that their "limited and selective nature has only encouraged the enemy." Serb shells had killed 23 people in Gorazde Monday, he said. Izetbegovic said he was willing to return to the negotiating table provided Serbs withdrew from all areas of the eastern Bosnian enclave they had conquered and a political solution was found which did not legitimise "the occupation of Bosnia."
