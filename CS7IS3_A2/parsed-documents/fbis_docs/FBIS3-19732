Government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis said that the government will wait for the official results of the police investigations before proceeding with diplomatic steps in the next few days. Mr. Kasoulidhis added that the government wants to have a strong case, as he described it, so that no one will draw conclusions by reductio ad absurdum. Joe Clark, the UN Secretary General's special representative in Cyprus, said that the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis does not fall within the framework of the UN secretary general's mission in the Cyprus issue. Mr. Clark, who was responding to questions from correspondents after his meeting with President Kliridhis this afternoon, said that he discussed the whole issue with the president of the Republic and with some of Mr. Kliridhis' advisers. Despite the continuous and persistent questions from the correspondents, Mr. Clark refused to make any comment on the assassination of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis. He also refused to comment on a letter addressed to him today by Greek Cypriot political correspondents. The letter noted that from now on they will not be visiting the occupied areas to cover the proximity talks for security reasons. The question of Theofilos Yeoryiadhis' assassination was also discussed by Joe Clark and Rauf Denktas at their meeting today. However, Joe Clark refrained from giving any details and said that it is a question of a human tragedy, making no reference whatsoever to the political dimensions of the issue.
