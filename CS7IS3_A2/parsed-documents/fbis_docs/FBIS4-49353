This is what Abulaiti Abudurexiti, chairman of the Xinjiang autonomous regional government, pointed out at a regional work meeting on construction on 31 March. After reviewing Xinjiang's capital construction last year, Abulaiti Abudurexiti pointed out: This year, while undertaking investment restructuring measures, our region will further expand key constructions and increase investment in a large group of key construction projects such as the second Lanxin railway line; the Xian-Lanzhou-Urumqi optical cable; the Duzishan ethylene project; the Urumqi airport expansion project; and the Turpan-Urumqi-Dahuangshan high-quality road. At a stage when we have achieved overall progress and key breakthroughs in reform, the construction front must also actively implement reform measures in capital construction management systems as well as bring into full play the role of market mechanisms. For new construction projects, we must fully implement open-bidding and owners' responsibility systems. It is necessary to establish and improve the evaluation report system for construction projects as well as to strengthen the management of project contracting. The construction industry must actively explore the international construction market. Not only should the industry open up the markets of surrounding countries and Central Asia but also those of the East Asia, Southeast Asia, and other countries and regions. It is necessary to win more contracts for foreign construction projects and labor cooperation to spur exports of building materials and mechanical equipment. Speaking on the specific issue of urban construction, Abulaiti Abudurexiti stressed: Currently, the primary task is to strengthen urban planning management. The wider we open up and the more vigorously we develop the economy, the tighter control on urban planning management should be exercised in accordance with the law. On the other hand, in urban planning management, we should strive to streamline our work and raise efficiency by reducing unnecessary jobs. Economic development zones, cooperation zones, and various ports must effectively tackle infrastructure construction. We should not place hopes on foreign investors to develop the region for us but rather should create conditions to attract their investment.
