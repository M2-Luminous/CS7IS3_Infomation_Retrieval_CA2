Democratic Voice of Burma, DVB, has received the following report. U Myint Maung, minister of agriculture and forest of the NCGUB, has been missing. He was returning from Chiang Mai to Bangkok on 25 March 1994. U Myint Maung, an elected representative from Einme Township constituency-2, Irrawaddy Division, went missing after he failed to arrive in Bangkok on 26 March as scheduled. Although the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung is being investigated, no confirmed news has so far been received. In similar circumstances, NCGUB Finance Minister U Win Ko and Information Minister U Hla Pe were assassinated while traveling in 1993. While traveling on official duty, Finance Minister U Win Ko last contacted Bangkok from Kunming, China, on 27 February 1993. Three days later on 2 March, Minister U Win Ko was found dead with two knife wounds in Room No.41 of the Green Garden Hotel in Kunming. Furthermore, Information Minister U Hla Pe went missing on 16 June 1993 while traveling in Bangkok, Thailand. A few days later, his corpse was discovered with gun-shot wounds. There is a possibility that the assassination of the two ministers is the work of the State Law and Order Restoration Council. A reliable source says continued investigations are underway on the disappearance of Minister U Myint Maung.
