It is treason for anyone to confront the Resistance, because it the highest duty of all. Minister Dallul made these statements during a celebration held today in Saghbin. Minister Dallul said: [Begin recording] [Dallul] Lebanon is determined not to take unilateral action or to allow itself to be isolated. We entered negotiations after reaching understanding with Arab sides. Unfortunately, there are those who have abandoned this course or decided to leave these negotiations in return for trivial and insignificant things. However, we shall continue our coordination, understanding, and solidarity with sister Syria until the very end. No one can isolate us, nor will anyone be able to take unilateral action against us. [Correspondent] Are there any new developments regarding the relationship between the authorities or the Lebanese Army and the Resistance men, or is the relationship firm and will it continue as it was? [Dallul] We have repeatedly said and I will stress again today: Resistance is the right and duty of every citizen who is capable of resisting, because it is our right to confront the Israeli occupation with all means available to us. There is territory occupied by the enemy and there are people, our people, who are under this occupation. It is our duty to struggle with all available means to end this occupation and regain this honorable and sacred land, because it is a cherished part of Lebanon. It is an act of treason for anyone to confront the Resistance, because it is the highest duty of all. [Correspondent] Therefore, the Resistance operations will not stop until the last inch of Lebanese territories is liberated? [Dallul] The Resistance knows its duties very well and no one can dictate any conditions or stands to it. We, as an authority and government, believe that it is the duty of the citizens--as happens all over the world, and as was the situation in Europe when the German army occupied it and the popular resistance started--to resist. It is the duty of the sons of all people who are under occupation to resist with all the means at their disposal. [end recording]
