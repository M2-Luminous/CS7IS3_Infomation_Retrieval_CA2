Fedorov, RAS Technical Institute of Physics, St. Petersburg, Russia] [Abstract] Epitaxial phosphide-gallium p-n-structures on a Si-substrate were obtained by the method of gas-phase epitaxy in an open chloride system. Their electrical and electroluminescent characteristics were examined. The current-voltage characteristic at small values of current (6x10[.sup]-8[/] - 6x10[.sup]- 4[/] A/cm[.sup]-2[/]) exhibits a tunnelling behavior. At direct currents, it is exponential (with a pre-exponential multiplier 10[.sup]-8[/] A/cm[.sup]2[/] and a 75 meV characteristic energy); at reverse currents, it is to a power 4). The voltage cut-off is about 1.85 V, the breakdown voltage is 12- 18 V and the differential resistance is 4.5 Ohm. The capacitance- voltage characteristic is to the second power with a cut-off voltage of 1.8 V, the slope 1.75x10[.sup]-4[/] nF[.sup]- 2[/]/Vxcm[.sup]-4[/]. With a reverse bias, the obtained structures emit a visible light. The electroluminescence spectrum is wide, decreasing to the side of large energies of photons in the 1.6 - 2.5 eV range; the quantum output of the electroluminescence comprises 10[.sup]-3[/]%, and does not depend on current. The totality of experimentally obtained data agrees with the concept of avalanche breakdown (with a reverse bias above 12 - 18 V), due to shock ionization, which generates the light radiation.
