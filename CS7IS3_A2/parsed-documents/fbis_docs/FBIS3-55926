I have not seen a single movie or read a single book that has been disparaging about the guys in green service caps. I have not heard them being accused of links with the criminal world, of cruelty, of bullying.... Even when the KGB was being abused, they did not touch the border guards, although structurally they came under the committee. The nationwide esteem for them is understandable: The guys protect the fatherland's borders, the threshold of our home. Relations in military collectives there are always normal because the border guards fulfill a combat task even in peacetime. The service is specific, and they shoulder a tremendous responsibility. Their independence was virtually predetermined. They have secured it: An edict of the Russian Federation president has created the Federal Border Service [FBS]-High Command of the Border Troops with the rights of a federal ministry. It is headed by the commander in chief of the Border Troops. He is Colonel General Andrey Ivanovich Nikolayev. Much is demanded of him to whom much is given. The FBS-High Command directs the official combat, operational, financial-economic, and other activities of the Border Troops. Not all the former links are being broken. The Federal Counterintelligence Service is the coordinating organ for border guards in questions of operational-investigative activity. The previously developed system of supply and material-technical backup for both services is not being destroyed either. As previously, the border guards' tasks are immense and on a par with Russia's expanses. The new ministry's functions are largely traditional, but new responsibilities have also appeared -- for example, participation in the fulfillment of federal programs for ensuring the safety of the individual. The FBS will live not only for the present day. On the basis of long-term forecasts of the development of the operational situation on the border the service elaborates the concept of its protection, conducts long-term planning, and organizes information-analytical activity. Operational-investigative activity and the ensuring of one's own safety will require extensive specialized knowledge and painstaking work. Without going into details, I will single out just one of the points of interest to the reader at large: Henceforth the FBS organizes the conclusion of contracts on the performance of military service by border guards. Further. In the edict I have counted 27 points directly concerning the commander in chief. Incidentally, each of the tasks set before him may be broken down into hundreds more. So Gen. Andrey Nikolayev's categorical response to my request for an interview became clear to me: "It is not necessary to comment on the edict but to carry it out...."
