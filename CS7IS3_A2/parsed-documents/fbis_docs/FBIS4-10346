In a meeting that lasted all morning, PSDB President Tasso Jereissati and Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes, PFL leader in the Chamber of Deputies, made progress in consolidating the alliance between the two parties and seeking to find a PFL candidate for the vice presidency. In another meeting, PFL President Jorge Bornhauser and Tasso Jereissati established a schedule. At the beginning of May, the two parties will hold simultaneous conventions to officially report on their electoral ticket. Despite having succeeded in ensuring an agreement to make the electoral alliance formal, the PSDB and PFL leaders did not confirm Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes' name as the vice presidential candidate on Fernando Henrique Cardoso's ticket. Magalhaes is, nonetheless, the candidate preferred by the PFL and by Cardoso himself. In addition to the alliance, it also was decided on 6 April that two committees comprised of representatives from the two parties will be created to draft a common government program. Bornhauser explained: To avoid complaints about possible differences in the program of each party, we decided to draft a joint government program to last four years. This program's pillar will be the resumption of development. He believes that after sealing the agreement, the natural tendency will be to gradually reduce the PSDB and PFL factions' rejection of the alliance. The strategy now will be to seek new partners for this front. According to Bornhauser, the initial targets will be the PTB [Brazilian Labor Party], the PPR [Progressive Renewal Party], the PP [Popular Party], and the PL [Liberal Party]. The wider the range the better, the PFL leader said. One of the decisions made on 6 April was to hold the regional directorates responsible for eliminating the differences PFL and PSDB members living in the various Brazilian states still might have. Another proposal approved during the meeting was on holding simultaneous conventions to officially announce the PSDB-PFL ticket amidst huge celebrations. Two dates have been suggested for the convention: 15 May or 22 May. Each party will hold its convention separately as established by the law and, at the end of these conventions, the two parties will get together for a festive ceremony in which they will announce the electoral ticket.
