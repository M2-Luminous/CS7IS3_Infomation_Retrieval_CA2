A poll conducted by the Belgrade Institute for Market Research (IZIT) in 200 industrial firms showed that 84.4 percent of the polled firms have made perceptibly better results under the new conditions. Since January 24, when the Yugoslav Government launched its programme, the world's record hyperinflation dropped from a monthly rate of 313 million percent in january to below zero. The national currency, the dinar, was stabilized and pegged to the German mark (one dinar selling one mark). Fifteen percent of the polled, primarily firms oriented to imports and exports, said the economic reform has not improved their business. Revival of their production depends on the lifting or easing of the international economic sanctions, which the United Nations Security Council imposed against Yugoslavia on May 30, 1992. Production increase in the period between mid-March and mid-April was reported by 58 percent of the polled firms, while 15 percent said their production decreased. The poll showed that the number of industrial firms without sufficient orders for normal functioning has dropped from 81 percent in mid-February to 44 percent. For the first time after nearly two years, some firms increased the use of their production capacities, mostly those producing consumer goods (6.7 percent) and equipment (5.9 percent). This mostly results from an improved supply of raw materials and primary products. At the beginning of the year, 70 percent of industrial firms complained of insufficient stocks of raw materials while in April it dropped to 59 percent.
