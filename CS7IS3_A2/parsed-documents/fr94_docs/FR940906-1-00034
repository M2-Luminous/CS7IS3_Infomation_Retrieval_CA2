ACTION: Proposed rule with request for public comments.

The clause would specify rights and duties of the contractor and DMA in the event of malicious code contamination of supplies provided under a contract. DATES: Comments must be submitted by November 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: All comments concerning this proposed contract clause should be addressed to Viola W. Hagberg, Chief, Acquisition Policy Division, Defense Mapping Agency, 8613 Lee Highway, Mail Stop A&hyph;3, Fairfax, VA 22031&hyph;2137. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Wendy Leathem, Procurement Analyst, 703&hyph;285&hyph;9198. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A. Background The Department of Defense has established the Computer Security Vulnerability Reporting Program (CSVRP) in response to national security instructions. Under this program the Defense Information Systems Security Program Office has established the Automated System Security Incident Support Team (ASSIST) whose mission is vulnerability reporting. ASSIST has recommended all DOD elements include a clause in all contracts for computer hardware or software to protect against delivery of contaminated or malicious code. DMA proposes the use of Agency clause 5252.246&hyph;9000 ``Contaminated Products''. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act applies, but the proposed rule is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has therefore not been performed. Comments are invited from small businesses and other interested parties. Comments from small entities will also be considered in accordance with Section 610 of the Act. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection requirements which require the approval of OMB under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.
