NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA writes that "the West asked Russia to do its utmost for enabling NATO not to put its ultimatum into effect... After adopting the ultimatum, which was prompted by emotions and not careful calculations, and after realising how dangerous its consequences may be, the NATO countries began themselves to persuade Russia to do all it can for preventing the bombing." "Boris Yeltsin and Russian diplomats have managed to ward off the threat of the bombing of the positions of Bosnian Serbs. By all appearances, the Russian diplomacy is set to develop the initial success," the newspaper points out. This means that the Moslems are expected to respond to the Russian initiative in the same way as Serbs. The Russian diplomacy believes that its next task is to achieve the demilitarisation of Sarajevo, following the diplomatic breakthrough, and its putting under U.N. control, as is envisaged by all the settlement plans. "This should be followed by the settlement of local Bosnian problems, along with keeping in sight a global settlement of the crisis." According to ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, "the plan of the settlement of the conflict, suggested by Boris Yeltsin, makes the bombing senseless ... However, it is too early to celebrate a victory. A successful settlement of the crisis, brought about by a mine explosion at the Sarajevo market place and the death of 68 people, is just the first stage in establishing comprehensive peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Many more joint actions will be required from all countries of the world community before the fratricidal war, which has been going on for 22 months, will be ended with a peace settlement." Analysing the Russian peace initiative and its possible impact on the normalisation of the situation in Bosnia, IZVESTIYA writes that "the Russian diplomacy is saving NATO from the need to resort to force in Bosnia" and is giving a chance to Serbs. "This breakthrough of the Russian diplomacy is a logical and natural continuation of its Balkan policy, which has done far more good than actions and statements of any other Russian institution, party or group. Servicemen from various countries, who are now in Bosnia as part of the U.N. peace-keeping force, know well that not a single agreement has been fulfilled there so far, not a single ceasefire accord has lasted long. The situation with the latest agreement will become clear on Monday, the day when the NATO ultimatum expires. Even if the situation changes for the better, the settlement of the crisis around Sarajevo is an important, but initial step towards stopping the war and finding a political settlement in Bosnia and Herzegovina." According to KRASNAYA ZVEZDA, "Russia's stand is clear: to prevent NATO air strikes at Bosnian Serbs." In the opinion of the author of the article, which is frontpaged by the newspaper today, "whatever they say in the West about the fear that Serbs felt after the NATO ultimatum, it is confidence that played a decisive role in the fulfilment of its terms by Serbs, the confidence that they feel for Russia and its servicemen." The article points out, at the same time, that if the U.N. plan of the troop withdrawal and the taking of Sarajevo under U.N. control is put into effect, this first major victory over the Bosnian nightmare will go to the credit both of the U.N., NATO and the Russian diplomacy."
