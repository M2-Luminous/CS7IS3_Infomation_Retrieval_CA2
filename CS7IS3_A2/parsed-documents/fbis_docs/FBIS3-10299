Pedro Noyola Nolasco, Mexican foreign trade undersecretary, noted that NAFTA's successful implementation has resulted in large commercial flows, increased exports, and the strengthening of the Mexican textile and manufacturing sectors. Interviewed within the framework of the 10th meeting of the Mexican-Canadian Ministerial Commission, Noyola said that the customs problems NAFTA faced at the beginning have been resolved satisfactorily. Regarding Chile's integration into NAFTA, Noyola said that no specific date exists but Chile is a good candidate and that according to the admission clause its incorporation is feasible. Noyola stated that although there are no negotiations in this regard yet, the three signatories (Mexico, the United States, and Canada) have expressed their interest for Chile as well as other countries from the area to join NAFTA. He recalled that Mexico was the one to propose the admission clause in NAFTA, arguing that it constitutes a mechanism that strengthens international trade and helps create an open area instead of a closed fortress that restricts commercial growth. Noyola added that agreements of this type and the one that is expected to be signed by the G-3 [Mexico, Colombia, Venezuela] have the greatest possibilities of promoting global trade and are more efficient than other former agreements such as the Latin American Integration Association, which did not help Mexico to broaden trade with the region. Noyola went on to say that negotiations among ministers to sign the G-3 trade agreement "have concluded." Therefore, the technical groups are only working on the final details. He disclosed that from these last meetings a final document will be issued to clearly establish the chapters regarding the place of origin and protection regulations. However, he denied that there is currently a specific date to sign and initiate the commercial agreement with the G-3. Noyola announced that on 2 March Trade Secretary Jaime Serra Puche will travel to Costa Rica to meet with his counterpart Roberto Rojas and conclude NAFTA negotiations.
