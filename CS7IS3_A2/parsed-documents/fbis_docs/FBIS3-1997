Liu Chengxiang, of the State Statistical Bureau [SSB], said the order was given by a vice-premier, Zou Jiahua, at a meeting in Beijing last week. Zou had called on the bureau to adhere to party discipline and state laws to solve what he called "negative, corrupt behaviour". "Our leaders are worried that their ability to take signals from the economy this year may be hampered by fake statistics," Liu said. Liu said retrospective analysis of gross domestic product growth figures was showing up about 2 percent of errors every year. Problems were worst in numbers from coastal areas and township enterprises, he said. "Local officials know that others will judge the achievements of their political careers based on statistics," he said. "As a result, there are a lot of weaknesses showing up in our national statistical system." Under-reporting of profits and tax revenues was another worry of the bureau this year after a new national tax-sharing system was introduced, he said. In other cases, excess paperwork was causing things to be counted twice by mistake. In one recent case, a local forestry bureau reported it had planted 20,000 hectares of trees over the past five years when in fact the same 4,000 hectares had been repeatedly replanted after the seedlings kept dying from lack of proper care. Meanwhile, Beijing will rely more on the bureau this year than in the past to guide its macro policy, Liu said. "The central government has asked us to start providing them with sample-based analysis and forecasts so that they can be more sensitive to the economic situation this year," he said. The State Council had been told the growth rate was too high. In their January meeting with the State Council, SSB officials advised that growth was "a little too high," Liu said. "We said that the growth rate so far this year will lead to inflation which urban people cannot bear," he said. While Beijing's official targets for 1994 are 9 per cent GDP growth and 10 percent inflation, the SSB had already bumped up its internal estimates to 11 percent growth and more than 12 percent inflation, he added.
