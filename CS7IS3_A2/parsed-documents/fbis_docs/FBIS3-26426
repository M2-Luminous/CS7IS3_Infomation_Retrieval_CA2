Since the government decided to proceed actively with the privatization of state-owned concerns to assure continued growth and profitability, many foreign firms have been showing strong interest in acquiring them. A large Japanese construction firm recently offered a meaty price for BES Engineering Corp., but was turned away when BES declared the bidding closed to foreigners. The Economics Ministry has targeted Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp., Chung Hsin Electric & Machinery Mfg. Corp. and China Petrochemical Development Corp. for privatization before the end of June. Following suit will be Taiwan Fertilizer Co., Ltd., Taiwan Power Company, China Steel Corp., China Shipbuilding Corp., Taiwan Sugar Corp., and many others Vice Economic Affairs Minister Yang Shih-chien said recently that given the vital role many public enterprises play in the public's daily life, his ministry will hold firm to its decision that public enterprises be kept under the control of Taiwan shareholders while they undergo privatization. Sticking to this view is Taiwan Machinery Manufacturing Corp., a government property that will soon go private. It has included the 40 percent foreign ownership rule in its bid instructions. Additionally, a recently published petroleum law regarding foreign investment in the local refining industry also orders that foreigners cannot hold more than a 30 percent stake in those businesses.
