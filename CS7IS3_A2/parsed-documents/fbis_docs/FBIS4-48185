On the frontlines, the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has shown that it is making progress. Today the RPA captured Gako Camp in the Bugesera region. This occurred after prolonged fighting, and the occupation of a large amount of territory. The RPA controls Byumba Prefecture, Kibungo Prefecture, three-quarters of Kigali Prefecture, and half of Ruhengeri Prefecture. In short, the RPF controls more than half of the country. Fighting is now taking place in Bugesera region in southern Rwanda, which is very close to the border with northern Burundi. In Kigali itself the RPF controls the northern part of the town [words indistinct] southern part of the town. The liberation of the country is thus already a reality for the people. However, each Rwandan is still expected to contribute to that liberation by supporting the RPF combatants, and all those acting to help rid the country of the current dictatorship.
