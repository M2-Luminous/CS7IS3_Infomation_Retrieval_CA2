"The assurance given on this by the Iranian Government still applies," Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union) told BILD newspaper today. Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said the government will also bring public pressure to bear in order to obtain a pardon for the German, who was convicted of spying for Iraq. It will be made clear to the Iranian Government that it is in its own interests to grant the appeal for a pardon, Vogel said. [passage omitted] Vogel pointed out that carrying out the death sentence could have an unfavorable effect on German public opinion. Attitudes could worsen to Iran's detriment. In any case, the Federal Government regards the accused as "basically innocent." [passage omitted]
