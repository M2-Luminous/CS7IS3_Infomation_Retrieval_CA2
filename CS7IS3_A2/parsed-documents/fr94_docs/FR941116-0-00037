FR941116-0-00037 FR941116-0-00006 The ``total cost impact'' figures described above are based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The FAA recognizes that the obligation to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition is vital, but sometimes expensive. Because AD's require specific actions to address specific unsafe conditions, they appear to impose costs that would not otherwise be borne by operators. However, because of the general obligation of operators to maintain aircraft in an airworthy condition, this appearance is deceptive. Attributing those costs solely to the issuance of this AD is unrealistic because, in the interest of maintaining safe aircraft, prudent operators would accomplish the required actions even if they were not required to do so by the AD. A full cost-benefit analysis has not been accomplished for this AD. As a matter of law, in order to be airworthy, an aircraft must conform to its type design and be in a condition for safe operation. The type design is approved only after the FAA makes a determination that it complies with all applicable airworthiness requirements. In adopting and maintaining those requirements, the FAA has already made the determination that they establish a level of safety that is cost-beneficial. When the FAA, as in this AD, makes a finding of an unsafe condition, this means that the original cost- beneficial level of safety is no longer being achieved and that the required actions are necessary to restore that level of safety. Because this level of safety has already been determined to be cost-beneficial, a full cost-benefit analysis for this AD would be redundant and unnecessary. Regulatory Impact The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39&hyph;5250 (51 FR 7767, March 6, 1986), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39&hyph;9073, to read as follows: 94&hyph;23&hyph;10 Boeing: Amendment 39&hyph;9073, Docket No. 90&hyph;NM&hyph;265&hyph;AD. Supersedes AD 86&hyph;05&hyph;07, Amendment 39&hyph;5250. Applicability: All Model 727 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless previously accomplished. To prevent engine damage or separation, airframe damage, and/or hazard to persons or property on the ground as a result of ``blue ice'' that has formed from leakage of the lavatory drain system and dislodged from the airplane, accomplish the following: Note 1: The dump valve leak checks required by this AD may be performed by filling the toilet tank with water/rinsing fluid to a level such that the bowl is approximately half full (at least 2 inches above the flapper in the bowl) and checking for leakage after a period of 5 minutes. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this AD, accomplish the applicable procedures specified in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5) and (a)(6) of this AD. If the waste drain system incorporates more than one type of valve, only one of the waste drain system leak check procedures (the one that applies to the equipment with the longest leak check interval) must be conducted at each service panel location. (1) For each lavatory drain system that has an in-line drain valve installed, Kaiser Electroprecision part number series 2651&hyph;329, 2651&hyph;334, or 2651&hyph;278: Within 1,500 flight hours after the effective date of this AD, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 1,500 flight hours, accomplish the following: (i) Conduct a leak check of the dump valve (in-tank valve that is spring loaded closed and operable by a T-handle at the service panel) and the in-line drain valve. The in-line drain valve leak check must be performed with a minimum of 3 pounds per square inch differential pressure (PSID) applied across the valve.
