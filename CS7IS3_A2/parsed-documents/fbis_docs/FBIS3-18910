Is recovery now underway? [Verplaetse] The recession is over, there is no doubt about that. The United Kingdom suffered eight consecutive quarters of negative growth. We had four. The recession was delayed by the effects of German reunification. The low point came in the first quarter of 1993. The second and third quarters were better. A slight falling off is possible in the fourth quarter due to the situation in the construction industry and social conflict. Our barometer, which is reliable whatever people may say, shows that we should record 0.8 percent growth in 1994 without any new factors. I believe it will be higher, but we are remaining cautious. [Correspondent] Not everyone is stating so clearly that the recession is over. [Verplaetse] But that is the situation. To say anything else would be incorrect. [Correspondent] Will we return to the same economic conditions as before the recession? [Verplaetse] The growth potential in Belgium is in the region of 2 or 2.5 percent. Beyond that and you start to create tensions. Personally, I do not believe that we will exceed our potential growth in 1994. After that, we will see. [Correspondent] But always with persistent unemployment? [Verplaetse] To maintain employment in the private sector we need a 2 percent growth rate. As the working population is growing by 0.5 percent, this means we in fact need 2.5 percent growth in order to keep unemployment at present levels. So at the very best we will have stable unemployment figures. Solutions? We must act on three fronts, and sustain our efforts: We must reduce the cost of labor compared with the cost of capital; we must divide available employment among a greater number of individuals with a corresponding fall in incomes; we must increase the flexibility of the labor market. The global plan aims to act on these fronts. I do not foresee a general reduction in jobs. [Correspondent] What is your reaction to company closures? [Verplaetse] It hurts, but it is unavoidable. The relative importance of industry is decreasing in favor of services. And that process will continue. Some regions will be increasingly affected. [Correspondent] So what is to be done? [Verplaetse] Make the most of the global plan and look at our fundamental problems, at our structural weaknesses. The government's achievements to date are pretty impressive. There is no use in burying your head in the sand. We must allow the psychological scars to heal. We must not be impatient. The dialogue will recommence. The Belgians are pragmatists. After all, what is one year in someone's life? Pleased With the Rate of the Franc [Correspondent] Is the present strength of the Belgian franc justified? Does it reflect a healthy Belgian economy? [Verplaetse] I believe that the Belgian economy is sound. We no doubt have certain structural weaknesses. The private sector remains much more efficient than the public sector. The current account shows an excellent result with a positive balance of over 300 billion Belgian francs. [Correspondent] So you are pleased with the present rate of the franc? [Verplaetse] Yes. [Correspondent] Is your aim to arrive at the same central bank rate as the Germans? [Verplaetse] We need the lowest possible interest rates in order not to aggravate the problem of public finances. On the other hand, the central bank rate has no effect on households. For companies, that depends. So the question is how we can help companies. The answer is simple. It is by giving them the lowest possible costs. But 40 percent of costs come from imports. Then there are other factors such as index-linking. The result is that, directly or indirectly, 80 percent of our price system is influenced by the rate of the Belgian franc against other currencies. [Correspondent] The Belgian franc remains linked to the German mark. But at the same time the Belgian Central Bank is free to act without a green light from the Bundesbank. Is it therefore free of any German influence? [Verplaetse] Certainly not. This very morning I telephoned Frankfurt and Amsterdam before making a decision. The aim is not to receive orders but to agree on the extent of and reasons for a decision. Also, in the past the Bundesbank was not interested in what happened in Belgium. [Correspondent] Has it changed its attitude? [Verplaetse] I believe that the present president of the Bundesbank, Hans Tietmayer, is more open to other countries than his predecessor, Mr. Schlesinger. [Correspondent] Do you think that foreigners are often unaware of the situation of Belgium? [Verplaetse] I am quite sure they are. And that is our own fault, I would like to embark upon a very objective information campaign together with our commercial banks. [Correspondent] How do you explain the fact that short-term interest rates are falling while long-term rates are rising? [Verplaetse] There is an evident economic recovery in the United States. Europe is coming out of recession. Private investments are starting up again. There are also countries which cannot manage to control public expenditure. In a world where there is savings competition, how can you expect real long-term interest rates to fall? I can see no mechanism that could avoid this. The Social Pact? "I Remain Optimistic" [Correspondent] Last autumn, you headed a group charged with drawing up the social pact. How do you view this experience today? [Verplaetse] It was a good document and I am very proud of it. But I was very naive to believe that everyone was in favor of the social pact. When the prime minister asked me to participate, my first reaction was to refuse. Mr. Dehaene then confronted me with a choice: Either you do as many of your colleagues would probably do, pursue an orthodox monetary policy and consider that if it doesn't work then it is all someone else's fault, or you tell us what you believe to be the necessary conditions for total success. I agreed provided I could do it with other people. [Correspondent] Who you chose yourself? [Verplaetse] I did not really have the right of veto, but I did say yes or no. I knew them all except for one, all of them perfectly reasonable people. It remains one of my best ever memories of cooperation within a group. [Correspondent] Were you not disappointed to see how things turned out in the end? [Verplaetse] I believed that all politicians, including the opposition, would respond favorably to King Albert's appeal, without criticizing those who had agreed to bear responsibilities. I had not foreseen that, if I had I would have perhaps refused the mission. [Correspondent] The main complaint of the trade unions was the absence of any job guarantees in your report. [Verplaetse] You must allow for time between creating incentives and achieving results. You must also understand that an effort in one sector does not necessarily produce a result in terms of jobs in that same sector. It is illusory to believe that it does, and all members of the group were agreed on that point. But I understand, while not agreeing with them, the fears of the unions. [Correspondent] How did you react to the refusal of the trade unions to sign the Central Bank's report? [Verplaetse] With sadness. With respect to the social dialogue, and it is that which is behind it all, I realized that the leaders could not manage to convince their members. And I understand that union leaders who do not have the support of their members are unable to sign. But I remain quite optimistic. I hope that later, when the scars have healed, we will be able to look at the country's fundamental problems without apportioning blame. Belgian pragmatism will then make it possible to accept the inevitable solutions. [Correspondent] Are you thinking in terms of a new major round of negotiations, all together round the table? [Verplaetse] Perhaps not quite like that, but I remain confident. The will is there. I have many scenarios in mind. I will take initiatives, but behind the scenes.... I Should Have Kept Quiet [Correspondent] You are accused of making a few unfortunate remarks during the summer. Do you accept this criticism? [Verplaetse] No. I believe there was a misunderstanding. Perhaps I should not have tried to reply to my colleagues at the KUL [Louvain University]. In seeking to establish that Belgium's situation was not comparable to that in 1981, I did not state clearly enough that it was possible to improve the situation without devaluation. Indirectly, I confronted the social partners and the politicians with their responsibilities. They had to take steps to prevent a return to the situation in 1982. It was a risk I took. On the other hand, I do believe it helped. All members of the Central Bank committee were agreed. The Bank did its duty. The government also had to make an effort. [Correspondent] But it is you who made the statements. [Verplaetse] I wanted to say that the economists at the KUL were wrong. But I would have been much better advised to have kept quiet at that point. "Eighty Percent Was Adopted" [Correspondent] Your report inspired the global plan. Were your recommendations adopted? [Verplaetse] Eighty percent was adopted. [Correspondent] Your opinion of privatization? [Verplaetse] I believe that CGER [General Savings and Retirement Bank]-Fortis is one of the very best examples of an operation which offers every guarantee of success. [Correspondent] Why do the trade unions always take such a dim view of privatization? [Verplaetse] Many of these people automatically assume that private initiative neglects overall well-being. And that is not necessarily true. An inefficient public corporation is more socially damaging than anything. [Correspondent] And the matter of anchorage? [Verplaetse] I have never thought in terms of North or South. I am Belgian. A merger between the BBL [Bank Brussles Lambert] and the ING [International Netherlands Group] would have led to the ING controlling the BBL. But in the CGER-Fortis operation, it is privatization which has brought the "Belgification" of the Fortis group. [Correspondent] And the control of Belgian companies by foreign groups? [Verplaetse] I would of course prefer the opposite, but I believe it is inevitable. [Correspondent] Why such harsh words from Mr. Van Den Brande? [Verplaetse] As you know, politicians sometimes have to use very strong language. The ECU Decided in a Weekend [Correspondent] How do you believe we are going to move from the present European Monetary System (EMS) to a single currency? Are we going to return to more restricted limits within the EMS? [Verplaetse] That is a question I cannot answer. However, I have never believed that the Twelve would be able to convert to the single currency all at the same time. There are some differences between Germany and Greece ... If the European enterprise succeeds, and I hope and believe it will, there will be a first stage when some of the Twelve will move forward to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union. [Correspondent] Do you think monetary union can be achieved within the deadlines set? [Verplaetse] What are these deadlines? [Correspondent] At the latest, 1999. [Verplaetse] If you read the texts carefully, you will see that they do not say that. [Correspondent] So that means that there will be at least a two-speed Europe? [Verplaetse] There will be a first stage which will involve seven or eight partners. And I believe Belgium should be one of them. After that, countries will join the group individually. [Correspondent] How do you envisage the switch to a single currency for the first group? [Verplaetse] For me, the ideal situation would be to organize a weekend session between the heads of state and governments at which it would be decided, after having consulted the governors and finance ministers, to launch the third stage on Monday morning. For me, that would be the surest scenario. [Correspondent] And when would this weekend meeting of government leaders be held? [Verplaetse] I do not know. Everything will depend on economic developments. It is easier to converge when things are going well. We need more solid growth. [Correspondent] Do you believe that Belgium can reduce the public debt to no more than 3 percent of GDP by 1996? [Verplaetse] The Central Bank's forecasts indicate that this is possible. I believe that Belgium will achieve its aims. But two points are less certain: Social security and the Regions and Communities. But it should be possible to solve these problems if we take the necessary measures.
