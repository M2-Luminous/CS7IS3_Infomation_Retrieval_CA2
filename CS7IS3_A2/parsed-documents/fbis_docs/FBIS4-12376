Proceeding from the house's concern about performing its duty with full responsibility, the house has decided the following: First, to reaffirm the House of Representative's statement on the crisis issued on 5 November 1993, in terms of adhering to national constants, foremost of which is Yemeni unity. The house rejects every formula that would go back or encroach on this unity. Whoever relinquishes any part of this unity will be accused of high treason. The house delegates its permanent committees to follow up the implementation of the accord document based on its decision issued on 27 March 1994, especially the following committees: A. The Defense and Security Committee will follow the security and military issue, especially in terms of withdrawing military units from the outskirts, deploying them in areas with vital targets and the strategic defense requirements of the Republic of Yemen, as well as to prevent other forces' deployment or movement, except within the framework of the process of redeployment and merger according to the accord document. The committee will start work today. B. The Financial Affairs Committee will follow up the budget and will make sure sovereign revenues reach the Yemeni Central Bank. C. The Public Liberties and Human Rights Committee will follow up what was delegated to it previously. D. The Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee will implement the law on procedures to try senior state officials based on Articles 101 and 111 of the Constitution. E. The Media Committee will follow up media deterioration. Second, the house delegates the speakership and bloc leaders to follow up crisis political developments and to brief the house on these developments. Fourth [as heard], the House of Representatives hopes that 27 April 1994 will be a day of national salvation in which the entire situation becomes stable, all crises and their repercussions end, and all government institutions reunite in Sanaa, the capital of the country of unity. Fifth, all the state's executive bodies and their leadership at all levels should shoulder their responsibilities. The crisis cannot be allowed to obstruct work or prevent the government from executing its programs and running the state's affairs. Sixth, the House of Representatives appreciates the brothers and friends who are exerting efforts to mend the rift and maintain Yemeni unity. The house will resume its meetings on Saturday [9 April] morning, God willing.
