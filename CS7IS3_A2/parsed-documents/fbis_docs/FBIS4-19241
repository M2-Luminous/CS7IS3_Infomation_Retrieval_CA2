This was stated by the Bundesbank in its recent monthly report. Different to the previous months, it was not only orders from abroad that increased. For the first time domestic orders significantly increased, too. Compared to the same period last year, both the value and the volume was superior in February 1994. Production also increased sizeably in February. In the January/February period, production was hardly lower than the average of the last three months of 1993. In the main construction industry, demand shot up more than 10 percent in real terms in January within one year. Building production was 3.5 percent up in the first two months compared to last year. The Bundesbank writes that in eastern Germany construction orders were almost 50 percent up on January 1993. Building production was about one-third higher than last year's level. In the manufacturing industry, orders went up more than 25 percent over last year. There was an increase above the average in domestic orders. However, even orders from abroad, which were fluctuating strongly in the preceding months, were clearly higher than in January 1993. Production increased by more than 20 percent within one year. "The importance" of hidden unemployment has "significantly decreased": With a total of 135,000 people working short-time, this number is down 110,000 compared to March 1993. The number of people on schemes related to labor market policy (further training and job-creation programs) has dropped from 485,000 in March 1993 to 245,000.
