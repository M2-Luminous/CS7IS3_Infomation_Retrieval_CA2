Shortly before a visit by the U.S. secretary of state to Beijing, this appears to be a challenge. The United States has again and again threatened to withdraw the most-favored-nation status from China, but that is usually it. The Chinese market is too enticing. Europeans are behaving in a similar way. It has been argued that the closer the economic ties, the greater the chances for loosening up the rigid political system in China. Time and again, this has proved to be wrong. Nevertheless, the West is sticking to this illusionary policy. Even this time, officials will find an excuse. Maybe the dissidents will be released again after the People's Congress, due to open next week and which must not be disturbed by requests for more democracy. Maybe. At any rate, for the sake of economic interests, the West will again and again turn a blind eye to political suppression in China, and even more so in Tibet.
