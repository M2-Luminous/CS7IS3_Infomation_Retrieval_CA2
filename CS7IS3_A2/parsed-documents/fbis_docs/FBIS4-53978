This statement triggered strong reaction from the alarmed Thai prime minister and members of the Royal Thai Government to the point that they called on the ASEAN countries to lobby against military aid from Western countries to Phnom Penh. However, many politicians condemn such a response from Thailand and regard it as an act of interference in internal affairs of the Kingdom of Cambodia. Political analysts on Cambodia revealed that Thailand does not want war in Cambodia to end because the fighting in Cambodia has all along enabled Thailand to reap massive profits from Cambodia's wealth, especially from the rich forests and gems along the border. The analysts added that no country has the right to prohibit Cambodia from getting foreign military aid for strengthening her army. Cambodia has the right to receive the assistance and is able to prove to Thailand how to end the war through military means. Is it now not the time for all of us, Cambodians, to wake up to face reality and stop quarrelling? Are there still Cambodian politicians who agree with such an assumption of the Thai side?
