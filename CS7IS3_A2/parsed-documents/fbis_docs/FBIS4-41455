Russian Premier V. Chernomyrdin Answers TRUD Correspondent's Questions"] [Excerpt] Washington, 24 Jun -- [passage omitted] Your correspondent asked V.S. Chernomyrdin to express his opinion. [Sisnev] Forgive me, Viktor Stepanovich, but I want to repeat a question that I put to you after last year's Washington meeting. TRUD readers, being closer to the problems of everyday life than anyone in our society, will wish to know above all whether this visit will produce anything tangible for ordinary people. [Chernomyrdin] There is no need to explain to me who TRUD readers are. But I can tell both them and the readers of all other newspapers that money has not been wasted on this trip, in the social sphere or elsewhere. What, essentially, are the space-related contracts that we will be bringing home? They mean support for our industry. For the defense and conversion sectors, which as a rule are in a very difficult position today. And Sakhalin-2? In the long term this is a multibillion contract which provides a solution to funding problems and will create a large number of new jobs. I see major social benefits here. I should say that generally we do not consider, let alone sign any project unless there is a social program behind it. As for the agreements on ecology and conversion, will they not be of direct benefit to people? [Sisnev] This is your commission's third session. A major milestone since, as the saying goes, good things come in threes. It is probably already possible to sum up some general results in terms of the effectiveness and the practical usefulness of this mechanism of bilateral partnership, is it not? [Chernomyrdin] I believe that few bilateral organizations, particularly as young as ours -- it is not yet one year old -- can honestly claim to have produced such undoubted benefit, and practical benefit too. I can say without exaggeration or bragging that much has been done during this brief time. We, the Russian side, take a very responsible attitude to our obligations in the permanent commission, and it is fair to say the same of our U.S. colleagues. For his part Vice President Gore is trying very persistently to ensure that the mechanism we have created really works efficiently. The chief thing is that we do not shirk any issues, that we are expanding our activity and intend to expand it further. [Sisnev] You talked for quite a long time with President Clinton. Were political aspects touched on during that conversation? Was an assessment made of the state of relations between the United States and Russia? As you well know, Viktor Stepanovich, there are "prophets" on both sides of the Atlantic ready at the drop of a hat to predict that these relations will develop into acute rivalry, if not worse -- in short, that they will inevitably collapse. [Chernomyrdin] Of course political problems were discussed. As regards assessments, our bilateral relations were assessed only on a positive plane. They proceed in the ascendant from one presidential meeting to the next. With regard to the claim that relations could "collapse," that is simply stupid. Such a development is ruled out. Relations are improving and will continue to improve -- write that down. [Chernomyrdin ends] Right after this brief interview the chairman of the Russian Federation Government left for Detroit, where his present visit to America will end in talks with the leadership of General Motors, the world's largest motor vehicle building company.
