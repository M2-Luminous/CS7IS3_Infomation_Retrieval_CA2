In the past, China had, over a protracted period of time, implemented an excessively protective foreign trade policy which has become an obstacle for its re-entry into GATT. As for imports, the number of mandatory plans have been duly reduced with the scope of planned management narrowing. However, due to the lack of a mechanism to guide imports with the industrial policy, shortcomings such as weak macroeconomic control, unfair competition and delayed legislation on foreign trade have cropped up. As for exports, the role of market regulation remains insignificant. Moreover, competitions are usually unfair. In domestic trade, commodity prices are being driven up, while in foreign trade, goods are exported at a much lower price. All this has harmed the overall interests of the state. The enterprises which handle exports have monopolized the export business. In addition, export products are divided into different grades. This prevents the enterprises from improving their production quality and enhancing their competitiveness. As for the customs duties, protective measures are over-emphasized, while not enough efforts are made to help enterprises become more competitive. Right now, China's average tariff rate is 22 percent, while that of the industrialized nations is 4 to 5 percent, and that of developing countries is 13 to 14 percent. Moreover, the structure of China's tariff rates is not so rational. It lacks flexibility in regulating imports, and falls far short of the GATT requirements. China's highly protective policy fails to draw a clear-cut line between the protection of an "infant industry" and the protection of a backward industry with low economic efficiency. It cannot help some industries extricate themselves from their predicament of high energy and production costs and low economic efficiency. It serves to increase the scale of capital-intensive industries, and makes the highly competitive labor-intensive and technology-intensive industries suffer. It crushes the incentive of the enterprises to lower their production costs and improve the quality of their products. As a result, the enterprises lack enthusiasm to seek technological progress and the ability to compete with others on the world market. In short, this policy has made China's industry to develop production without taking into consideration the production costs and economic results, and suffer from an inherent shortage before it competes with others on the international market. We must change our practice of protecting our own products in an overall manner and suppressing competition; place emphasis on protecting our infant industry; introduce a competition mechanism; and use the tariff and foreign exchange rates as an economic lever and a means of regulation; and improve the relevant legal system. It is necessary to thoroughly change the pattern of controlling imports and exports with administrative measures; make full use of the market mechanism in carrying out activities in foreign trade; permit more industrial enterprises directly engage in import and export business and compete with others on the world market; and establish China's own multinational corporations. In formulating its enterprise policy, the ROK government gives the enterprises all kinds of preferential treatment and relaxes restrictions placed on them. It helps enterprises become export-oriented and allows them to wholeheartedly compete with others on the world market. Since the implementation of its reform program, China has raised the status of its enterprises. The change of the management mechanism of the enterprises has become a priority item on the government agenda. As for the foreign trade policy, only a limited number of large and medium-sized enterprises are authorized to do foreign trade, although the power to handle foreign trade is being delegated to the lower levels. As a result, the great majority of China's enterprises are separated from the world market, while some enterprises specialized in handling foreign trade have monopolized the business in foreign trade. Therefore, China's foreign trade is monopolized and divided to a great extent. However, due to trade restrictions, it is also difficult to lift all restrictions in doing foreign trade. The existence of this kind of "partition" puts China at a disadvantage in export competition and also creates friction between industry and trade. It also violates the GATT provisions regarding "state-run trade enterprises." All these not only hamper the process of China's re-entry into GATT, but also hinder the development of enterprises, weaken their competitiveness and actually undermine their vitality in competing with others on the world market. China's state of affairs is different from that of the ROK. However, ROK's successful experience also gives us an inspiration. After we re-enter the GATT, our enterprises and their foreign counterparts will be placed on the same starting line. Therefore, we should give our enterprises greater power to manage their own business and narrow the gap between our enterprises and foreign enterprise in terms of operating environment. The government must establish a set of all-round preferential policy, encourage enterprises to develop foreign trade and compete with others on an equal footing according to GATT provisions. Generally speaking, the degree of industrialization of a nation is mainly determined by its major enterprises. China's large and medium-sized enterprises with the state-run enterprises as the core constitute the main force which bears the financial burden of the state. To lift restrictions on these enterprises and let them directly participate in international competition will undoubtedly increase China's competitiveness, give the medium-sized and small enterprises an impetus to become export-oriented and help China's enterprises to become more internationalized.
