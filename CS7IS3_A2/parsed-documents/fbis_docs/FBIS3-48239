The so-called new law made the Vietnamese cheer loudly since this is what they long for. The significance of the law is exactly the same as the content of the nonborder treaty previously concluded between the Vietnamese communists and their puppets. Are the puppets so stupid? No, they are not. The Vietnamese communists have ordered them to act like this since they exert 100 percent control over military, civilian, and other affairs in the rural areas and 99 percent in Phnom Penh. As for other people, they are waiting only to repeat clamorously what the Vietnamese communists and their puppets have said. Another concrete example is that when the people support and demand that the five-point initiative offered by the king be implemented to achieve national reconciliation and restore peace, the Vietnamese communists and their puppets talk about only three points; those in the Vietnamese communists' cage also repeat the three points. This action will destroy the nation and people and make the Cambodian race and territory disappear as was the case of Kampuchea Kraom. The people say they do not want the two-headed government because it is under the total control of the Vietnamese communists and their puppets. Only by supporting the five points of the king can the Cambodian nation, people, and race be safeguarded forever.
