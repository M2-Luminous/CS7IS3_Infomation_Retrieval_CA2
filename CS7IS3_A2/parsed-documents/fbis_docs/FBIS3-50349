The decision has not been made yet, Pavel Pechacek said, and added that further talks on the topic will take place in Prague tomorrow. In his words, however, the Czech section and the Institute of Free Europe and Liberty should move to Prague by the end of June. The talks on accommodating these sections favor the former building of the National Assembly. According to Pavel Pechacek, representatives of RFE should have talks in Bratislava with the Slovak Government on Friday. According to Pechacek, the Slovak Government, in connection with its proposal to end the possibility of RFE broadcasts on Velke Kostolany, Poprad, and Presov transmitters, probably wants to offer an alternative solution.
