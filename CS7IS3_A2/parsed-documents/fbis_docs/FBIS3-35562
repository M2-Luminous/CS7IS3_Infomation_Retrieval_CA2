'Abu-Hamdan said: With the full support of the Army, and using automatic weapons, six Zionist criminals attacked the fasting worshipers in prostration from six vantage points, martyring and wounding more than 400 of them. But to make the world public opinion believe that this was an individual event and to bury the details for ever, the Zionist military then killed one of the elements who was involved in the attack on the Muslims, and who was the main contact with the Israeli Army in the execution of this ominous plan. But how could an individual person commit such a crime on his own and kill and injure hundreds of people? 'Abu-Hamdan stressed that despite efforts by the 'Arafat gang to use the killing to speed up the PLO-Israel deal, HAMAS and other militant organizations opposed to concession plans, will avenge the martyrs of the Hebron bloody Friday by increasing their martyrdom seeking operation. The head of the HAMAS office in Tehran, while criticizing the weak stance of Arab countries regarding the massacre, said that unfortunately, some of them have moved in line with the Zionists wishes.
