[26 February] -- Malaysia today condemned the massacre of Palestinians at the al-Haram al-Ibrahim mosque in Hebron yesterday in which dozens were killed after a Jewish gunman opened fire on worshippers performing prayers. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Malaysia was deeply saddened by the incident which occurred in a holy place while Muslims were observing the fasting month. He said Israel could not escape responsibility for the dawn attack which was the biggest single killing of Arabs since Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967. The massacre reflected the gravity of the situation in the occupied territories and the urgent need for Israel to change its policies and practices for the areas. Israeli authorities had to adhere to international obligations by respecting the rights of the Palestinians and its holy place, he said. "Those responsible for the massacre must be made accountable and the entire incident should not be dismissed as the action of an alleged mad man," he said in a statement. He said Malaysia wanted the international community, in particular the United Nations to provide effective protection to the Palestinians in the occupied territories. [passage omitted]
