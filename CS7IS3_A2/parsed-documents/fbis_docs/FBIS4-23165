ANC regional deputy secretary Obed Bapela said SDU members between 13 and 18 years old would go back to school. A special catch-up programme for these youths was being negotiated with PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] education authorities, he said. Those between the ages of 19 and 24 should be accepted as police reservists in a neighbourhood watch. Other members should join the police force. Mr Bapela said these two proposals were still being negotiated with regional police authorities. Those who did not want to go back to school should join what he called the police academy. He said SDU members were being debriefed to inform them of recent political developments. The disarmament programme, he said, was in line with the ANC's policy of strict gun control limiting firearm ownership to one per person. All illegal weapons would have to be taken from criminals, SDUs and armed hostel residents, Mr Bapela said. He said he hoped a law on gun control would be passed in the regional Parliament by September.
