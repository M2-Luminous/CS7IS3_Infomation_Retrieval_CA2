'Adnan al-'Ani, an adviser with ministerial rank, led the delegation to Moscow last week to discuss developing the West al-Qurnah field when the UN embargo is lifted, the Middle East Economic Survey (MEES) said. The field close to the northern tip of the North al-Rumaylah field will have an estimated output capacity of 600,000 barrels per day after a second phase of work is completed, it added. In an agreement signed in April 1984, the former Soviet Union was to develop the field under an engineering, supply, and construction contract financed by a 2-billion dollar soft credit facility. Technoexport, a Soviet firm, was responsible for the first phase with a production capacity of 200,000 bpd, according to MEES published in Cyprus. Much of the field's surface facilities have been built, but Technoexport was behind schedule when Iraq in?nah field was discovered by the Iraqi National Oil Company in 1973. A UN embargo was imposed on Iraq when it invaded Kuwait and the UN Security Council has set conditions for Iraq to meet in order to have the embargo lifted.
