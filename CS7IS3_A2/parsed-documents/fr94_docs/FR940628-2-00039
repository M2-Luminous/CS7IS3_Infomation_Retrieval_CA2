ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice announces the receipt of test data on N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) (CAS No. 872&hyph;50&hyph;4), submitted pursuant to a testing consent order under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). Publication of this notice is in compliance with section 4(d) of TSCA. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Susan B. Hazen, Director, Environmental Assistance Division (7408), Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. E&hyph;543B, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460, (202) 554&hyph;1404, TDD (202) 554&hyph;0551. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under 40 CFR 790.60, all TSCA section 4 consent orders must contain a statement that results of testing conducted pursuant to these testing consent orders will be announced to the public in accordance with section 4(d). I. Test Data Submissions Test data for NMP were submitted by the NMP Producers Group, on behalf of the test sponsors and pursuant to a testing consent order at 40 CFR 799.5000. They were received by EPA on May 24, 1994. The submissions describe the subchronic oral toxicity 28-day feeding study in rats and a repeated dose toxicity study in B6C3F1 Mice: Administration in the diet for 4 weeks (range finding study) with NMP. This chemical is an inert, stable, polar solvent that is used in a wide variety of processes. Its commercial uses result from its strong and frequently selective solvent power. One of the major uses of NMP is the extraction of aromatics from lubricating oils. It is also used as a medium for polymerization and as a solvent for finished polymer. It is the preferred solvent in a variety of chemical reactions and the manufacture of numerous chemical intermediates and end products such as plastics, surface coatings, and pesticides. An important new use of this chemical is as a substitute for methylene chloride in paint strippers. NMP is also used in the recovery and purification of acetylene, olefin, and diolefins, in the removal of sulfur compounds from natural and refinery gases, and in the dehydration of natural gas. EPA has initiated its review and evaluation process for these data submissions. At this time, the Agency is unable to provide any determination as to the completeness of the submissions. II. Public Record EPA has established a public record for this TSCA section 4(d) receipt of data notice (docket number OPPTS&hyph;44610). This record includes copies of all studies reported in this notice. The record is available for inspection from 12 noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, in the TSCA Public Docket Office, Rm. B&hyph;607 Northeast Mall, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. Authority: 15 U.S.C. 2603. List of Subjects Environmental protection, Test data. Dated: June 14, 1994. Charles M.
