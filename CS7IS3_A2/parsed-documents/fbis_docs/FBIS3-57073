The draft was published Friday [21 January] as a classified ad in the leftist TIESA newspaper. According to unofficial reports, the LUL wants to unite former members of the Soviet Communist Party, who broke away from Moscow in 1990 but neither joined the Lithuanian Democratic Labor Party nor the pro-Moscow wing of the Lithuanian Communist Party. The emergence of a political organization based on the LUL program would mean the creation of a new communist party in Lithuania. The draft says, however, that the union would be a completely new political force, unrelated to "communist and Stalinist crimes." The program emphasizes the need to protect "the interests of the biggest, most impoverished and robbed part of the population."
