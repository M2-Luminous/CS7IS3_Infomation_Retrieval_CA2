FR940627-0-00009 FR940627-0-00003 Comments Invited Although this action is in the form of a final rule that involves requirements affecting flight safety and, thus, was not preceded by notice and an opportunity for public comment, comments are invited on this rule. Interested persons are invited to comment on this rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications shall identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified under the caption ADDRESSES . All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered, and this rule may be amended in light of the comments received. Factual information that supports the commenter's ideas and suggestions is extremely helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of the AD action and determining whether additional rulemaking action would be needed. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 94&hyph;NM&hyph;82&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive: 94&hyph;13&hyph;09 Dassault Aviation: Amendment 39&hyph;8950. Docket 94&hyph;NM&hyph;82&hyph;AD. Applicability: All Model Mystere Falcon 900 series airplanes, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent inability of the nose landing gear (NLG) to extend (deploy) fully due to recompression of the NLG shock absorber, accomplish the following: (a) Within 7 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish either paragraph (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this AD in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F900&hyph;A149 (F900&hyph;A32&hyph;11), dated April 13, 1994: (1) Perform a pressure check of the low pressure chamber of the NLG shock absorber to determine if its charging operation is within the limits specified in the Airplane Maintenance Manual (AMM). Perform the pressure check in accordance with procedures described in the service bulletin. (i) If the charging operation is within the limits specified in the AMM, repeat the pressure check at intervals not to exceed 7 days, until the installation required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (ii) If the charging operation is outside the limits specified in the AMM, prior to further flight, recharge the shock absorber in accordance with procedures described in the AMM. Thereafter, repeat the pressure check at intervals not to exceed 7 days, until the installation required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (2) Perform a torque check of the nose wheel steering to determine if the charging operation of the NLG shock absorber is within the limits specified in the service bulletin. Perform the torque check in accordance with procedures described in the service bulletin. (i) If the average load computed is greater than or equal to 130 ft. lbs. (18 mdaN), repeat the torque check at intervals not to exceed 7 days, until the installation required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (ii) If the average load computed is greater than 87 ft. lbs., but less than 130 ft. lbs., (12 to 18 mdaN), within 3 landings or 7 days after performing the torque check, whichever occurs later, recharge the shock absorber in accordance with the service bulletin. Flights on which the landing gear will be retracted are authorized. Thereafter, repeat the torque check at intervals not to exceed 7 days, until the installation required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (iii) If the average load computed is less than or equal to 87 ft. lbs. (12 mdaN), prior to further flight, recharge the shock absorber in accordance with service bulletin. Thereafter, repeat the torque check at intervals not to exceed 7 days, until the installation required by paragraph (b) of this AD is accomplished. (b) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, install a relay in the right side of the electrical rack in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F900&hyph;150 (F900&hyph;32&hyph;12), dated May 9, 1994. Accomplishment of this installation constitutes terminating action for both the pressure checks and the torque checks required by paragraph (a) of this AD. (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished. (d) The checks and recharging shall be done in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F900&hyph;A149 (F900&hyph;A32&hyph;11), dated April 13, 1994. The installation shall be done in accordance with Dassault Aviation Service Bulletin F900&hyph;150 (F900&hyph;32&hyph;12), dated May 9, 1994. The incorporation by reference of these documents were approved by the Director of the Federal Register in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. Copies may be obtained from Dassault International, Inc., P. O. Box 624, Paramus, New Jersey 07653&hyph;9925. Copies may be inspected at the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. (e) This amendment becomes effective on July 12, 1994. Issued in Renton, Washington, on June 20, 1994. Robert C. McCracken, Acting Manager, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15381 Filed 6&hyph;24&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;U
