FR940204-0-00043 FR940204-0-00020 The tidewater goby occurs in loose aggregations of a few to several hundred individuals on the substrate in shallow water less than 1 meter (3 feet) deep (Swift et al. 1989), although gobies have been observed at depths of 1.5 to 2.3 meters (4.9 to 7.6 feet) (Dan Holland, University of Southwestern Louisiana, in litt. 1993). Peak nesting activities commence in late April through early May, when male gobies dig a vertical nesting burrow 10 to 20 centimeters (4 to 8 inches) deep in clean, coarse sand. Suitable water temperatures for nesting are 18 to 22 ○C (75.6 to 79.6 ○F) with salinities of 5 to 10 ppt. Male gobies remain in the burrows to guard eggs, which are hung from the ceiling and walls of the burrow until hatching. Larval gobies are found midwater around vegetation until they become benthic (Swift et al. 1989). Although the potential for year round spawning exists, it is probably unlikely because of seasonal low temperatures and disruptions of lagoons during winter storms. Ecological studies performed at two sites documented spawning occurring as early as the first week in January (Swenson in litt. 1993). Although usually associated with lagoons, the tidewater goby has been documented in ponded freshwater habitats as far as 8 kilometers (5 miles) upstream from San Antonio lagoon in Santa Barbara County (Irwin and Stoltz 1984). The tidewater goby is discontinuously distributed throughout California, ranging from Tillas Slough (mouth of the Smith River) in Del Norte County south to Agua Hedionda Lagoon in San Diego County. Areas of precipitous coastlines that preclude the formation of lagoons at stream mouths have created three natural gaps in the distribution of the goby. Gobies are apparently absent from three sections of the coast between: (1) Humboldt Bay and Ten Mile River, (2) Point Arena and Salmon Creek, and (3) Monterey Bay and Arroyo del Oso. Roughly 10 percent of the coastal lagoons presently containing populations of tidewater goby are under Federal ownership. Over 40 percent of the remaining populations are either entirely or partly owned and managed by the State of California. The remainder are privately owned. Previous Federal Action The tidewater goby was first classified by the Service as a category 2 species in 1982 (47 FR 58454). It was reclassified as a category 1 candidate in 1991 (56 FR 58804) based on status and threat information in Swift et al. (1989). Category 2 applies to taxa for which information now in the possession of the Service indicates that proposing to list as endangered or threatened is possibly appropriate, but for which conclusive data on biological vulnerability and threats are not currently available to support a listing proposal. Category 1 applies to taxa for which the Service has on file substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats to support proposals to list them as endangered or threatened species. On October 24, 1990, the Service received a petition from Dr. Camm Swift, Associate Curator of Fishes at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, to list the tidewater goby as endangered (Swift 1990). The petition, status surveys, and accompanying data describe the goby as threatened because of past and continuing losses of coastal and riparian habitats within its historic range. The Service's finding that this petition presented substantial information that the requested action may be warranted was published on March 22, 1991 (56 FR 12146). Following this finding, the Service initiated a status review on the tidewater goby. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Endangered Species Act (Act), as amended in 1982, requires the Secretary to make a finding within 12 months of the date a petition is received as to whether or not the requested action is warranted. On December 11, 1992, the Service published a proposal to list the tidewater goby as an endangered species (57 FR 58770). The proposed rule constituted the 12-month finding that the petitioned action was warranted.
