FR940405-2-00124 FR940405-2-00043 107. Regulation: 24 CFR 92.254 (a)(1) and (b)(1). Project/Activity: Alhambra, CA.; Costa Mesa, CA.; Orange County, CA.; San Diego County, CA.; Oxnard, CA.; Santa Clara County, CA.; and San Mateo County Consortium, CA. Waiver of the section 203(b) dollar limits for purchase and rehabilitation of houses under the HOME Investment Partnership Act program. Nature of Requirement: 24 CFR 92.254(a)(1) provides for the setting of area limits on the initial purchase price for single family housing and 24 CFR 92.254(b)(1) provides for the setting of area limits on the value of property after rehabilitation, not involving purchase. Granted By: Don I. Patch, Acting Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development, March 15, 1993; April 2, 1993 and April 21, 1993. Mark C. Gordon, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Operations/Chief of Staff, May 26, 1993. Date Granted: Alhambra, CA., March 15, 1993; Costa Mesa, CA., March 15, 1993; Orange County, CA., March 15, 1993; San Diego County, CA., March 15, 1993; Oxnard, CA., April 2; Santa Clara County, CA., April 21; and San Mateo County Consortium, CA., May 26, 1993. Reasons Waived: Department recognizes that in some high-cost areas, there may be few properties whose purchase price and/or after rehabilitation value are below the section 203(b) caps. The local jurisdictions indicated that to have a viable homeownership program, they need to have the limit increased. A HUD review confirmed the validity of the requests, analyzed the data and, therefore, for good cause, granted waivers establishing the recommended limits as follows: Alhambra, CA., $204,000; Costa Mesa, CA., $213,000; Orange County, CA., $237,000; San Diego, CA., $181,000; Oxnard, CA., $163,000; Santa Clara County, CA., $266,000; San Mateo County Consortium, CA., $252,000. 108. Regulation: 24 CFR 92.3. Project/Activity: San Francisco, CA.; and Franklin County, OH. Waiver of the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) definition in the HOME Program which requires food preparation or sanitary facilities in each unit when rehabilitating an existing residential structure. Nature of Requirement: 24 CFR 92.3 as clarified in CPD Notice 92&hyph;31 requires either food preparation or sanitary facilities in each HOME assisted SRO unit. Granted By: Don I. Patch, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Grant Programs. Date Granted: San Francisco, CA., April 12, 1993; Franklin County, Ohio, May 8, 1993. Reasons Waived: The waivers were issued for good cause. The waiver approval to Franklin County noted that in response to many public comments, the Department would issue an interim rule to modify the definition of SRO found at 24 CFR 92.2 to require sanitary or food preparation facilities only if the project consists of new construction, conversion of non-residential space, or reconstruction. For acquisition or rehabilitation of an existing residential structure, neither type of amenity is required in the unit. However, the Department strongly encourages participating jurisdictions to provide a higher level of amenities whenever possible, to contribute to the continued marketability of the standard housing stock in the future. This change is made in response to public comment that installing plumbing when rehabilitating an existing residential structure may be financially prohibitive. Nonetheless, the Department believes that for new construction, reconstruction and conversion, a higher level of amenities is appropriate and desirable. The new SRO definition was published in the Federal Register on June 23, 1993.
