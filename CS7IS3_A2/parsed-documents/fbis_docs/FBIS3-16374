He said that building such a facility was not MSF's job but that of a special branch of the industry which is in Ukraine and elsewhere after the break-up of the Soviet Union. On the prospect of a Far Eastern project, the RSA official said that although his agency had no objections, billions of rubles would have to be raised to implement it by the year 2000, something that Moscow could not afford at the moment.
