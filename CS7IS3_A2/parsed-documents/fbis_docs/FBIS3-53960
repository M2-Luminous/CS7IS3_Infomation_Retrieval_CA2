It appears that Rabin divulged this intention to Clinton during their last meeting in Washington. Rabin explained to Clinton the difficulties he would face in Israel should he have to undertake such a task. Therefore, the U.S. Administration was not surprised by the announcement on a referendum. Government ministers say they will raise this issue during Sunday's cabinet session, because it is inconceivable that Rabin should divulge such a move to Clinton while hiding it from the government. At the same time, it is believed that at least one minister -- Justice Minister David Liba'i, who has already asked for information on Swiss referendum laws -- was apprised of the plan.
