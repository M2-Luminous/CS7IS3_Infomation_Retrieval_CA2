[Begin Monde recording] The international community's strategy is aimed at punishing the people who voted for Aristide. As I, Frantz Robert Monde, deputy, do not receive money transfers; as for you, you do not receive transfers; who receives transfers? It is those who had the chance to leave by boat; it is someone who made an effort to buy a visa, it is someone who made an effort... [pauses] who was working, saved some money, and then left. It is those people who are sending $150-200 to their families so they can live. But you condemn those little people to live on only $50 per month. I want the U.S. Government to tell me if the poorest U.S. citizen can live on an income of $50 a week? This is a racist and irrational decision which does not take the faintest notion of humanitarianism into account. This is unprecedented. I went to Washington and negotiated with them. We agreed on the conditions under which General Cedras would step down. The problems of Gen. Biamby Colonel Michel Francois were out of the question. They agreed with me, but have decided today that the entire Army high command should step down. When one says high command, one implicitly says the department commanders as well. Why? For Father Aristide? It is not true, my dear. You must remember that when they entered the country in 1915, they destroyed an existing police corps in order to create the National Guard. Now, they say: Let us destroy the Haitian Army which is a pure offspring of the National Guard in order to create a police corps. In fact, let us imagine that Aristide returns, that the Americans arrive in the country, and that soldiers are going to be killed. Do you think they will sit idly by? It is a [word indistinct] political obligation for the Army high command to have a defense plan. [end recording]
