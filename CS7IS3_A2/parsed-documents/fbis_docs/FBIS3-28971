Gregorio Rosal, alias Comrade Roger, CPP spokesman, also issued strong statements against Dee. Rosal said the Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), headed by Felimon Lagman, is a vigilante group working with the military. "The Ramos regime bears full responsibility for closing the door to any kind of talks with the NDF (National Democratic Front)," Sison said in a statement from his base in Utrecht, the Netherlands. Sison said Dee revealed the government's decision to get out of peace talks with the NDF in a statement issued by Dee on 5 February. [passage omitted] "Dee is in effect delivering the message to the revolutionary forces that they must continue to wage the people's war," Sison said. "Howard Dee is more interested in being a psy [psychological]-war agent of the Ramos regime than in looking for a way to the negotiating table. He is below the caliber and style of Representative Jose Yap," he said. Yap was presidential emissary to the NDF during the exploratory talks in September last year in the Netherlands. Sison said it will be futile for Dee to "pretend that the Lagman gang is something that the regime can negotiate with." He said the NDF had in fact demanded that the government stop coddling and using the "criminal Lagman gang" as a tool to "sabotage" the communist movement before peace talks can proceed. Sison said Dee's statement was meant to "deflect public attention from the outrageous raising of oil prices and electricity and power rates." In a separate statement, Rosal said the ABB's bombing of the three oil companies following the increases last 28 January was aimed at sabotaging the peace talks. [passage omitted] "From being part of the NPA [New People's Army], the ABB has become a vigilante group and worse as an instrument of the U.S.- Ramos regime," Rosal said.
