Recalling that the Japanese delegate at a meeting of the committee on the reform of the UN Security Council formally declared the wish of Japan to be a permanent member, the analyst says: This is, indeed, a ridiculous and impudent act. Japan has neither qualification nor confidence for a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Japan is, above all, an "enemy state" which has not honestly repented of and liquidated her blood-stained past, though 50 years have passed since the end of the Second World War, but is defending and trying to justify the war of aggression committed by her. The Japanese ruling quarters are working round the clock to turn Japan into a military power and arm her with nuclear weapons, with the tag of "enemy state" still attached to her. Worse still, the Japanese authorities unhesitatingly commit suppression of foreign citizens in Japan and their organizations by mobilizing power. They have instituted the "law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping operations" and is now hastening the preparation of "emergency security legislative arrangements" to open a broad road for aggression overseas. The Japanese ruling quarters are loud-mouthed about "international contribution". But they must clearly understand that Japan still remains a target of accusation and denunciation by the Asian people, far from enjoying their confidence, because she is evading the liquidation of the past and stepping into the old- fashioned shoes of aggression overseas. They must not impudently eye the permanent membership of the UN Security Council, but properly liquidate the past, first of all, and renounce the scheme of overseas aggression.
