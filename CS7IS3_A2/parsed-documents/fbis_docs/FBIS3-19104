As he stated at a news conference today, he will present a concluding report next week. At the Bundestag on Thursday [10 March], he indicated that the pesticides transported to Albania are to be returned to Germany "in a more or less legal way" and disposed of here. However, the financial aspect of the operation has apparently not yet been settled. The Finance Ministry has not yet released the 1.4 million German marks [DM] needed to handle the toxic waste, which is mainly stored in a train of the GDR Railroads. The costs for the return and disposal are expected to be much higher. A similar operation during which waste from Romania was transported back to Germany involved about DM10 million.
