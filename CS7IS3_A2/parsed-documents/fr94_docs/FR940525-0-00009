FR940525-0-00009 FR940525-0-00003 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 94&hyph;AWP&hyph;5] Establishment of Class E Airspace; Ukiah, CA AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action establishes Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. An automated Weather Observing System (AWOS) has been installed at the Ukiah Municipal Airport meeting the criterion for a surface area. Controlled airspace extending from the surface is needed for Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) operations at Ukiah Municipal Airport. The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c., December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Scott Speer, System Management Branch, AWP&hyph;530, Air Traffic Division, Western-Pacific Region, Federal Aviation Administration, 15000 Aviation Boulevard, Lawndale, California 90261; telephone (310) 297&hyph;0697. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On March 15, 1994, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. (59 FR 14805). An AWOS has been installed at the Ukiah Municipal Airport, Ukiah, CA. The proposal was to modify controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and to add controlled airspace extending from the surface for IFR operations at Ukiah Municipal Airport. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceedings by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No objections were received concerning this proposal. The coordinates in the proposal are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations are published in Paragraphs 6002 and 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designations listed in this document will be published subsequently in this Order. The Rule The amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulation establishes and amends Class E airspace at Ukiah, CA. This action modifies controlled airspace from 700 to 1200 feet AGL and establishes controlled airspace from the surface for IFR operations at the Ukiah Municipal Airport at Ukiah, CA. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore, (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
