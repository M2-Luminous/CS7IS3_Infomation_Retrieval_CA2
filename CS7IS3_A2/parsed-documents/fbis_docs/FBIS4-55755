Communism, with its "scorches earth policy" left us the consequences of the bunker type isolation as inheritance, an economy in collapse, a totally paralysed production, almost complete unemployment, outdated technology, the long queues, hunger, a budget 60 per cent of which was covered by the donation and humanitarian aid, a galloping inflation of 400 per cent a year. In two years the Albanian Government was engaged in a course of radical and difficult reforms. On a retrospective analysis, we could say that in two years Albania managed to reduce inflation from 400 per cent to 30 per cent, to have a stable and practically convertible currency, to forget the long queues, to privatize the land, the flats, services, trade, transport and thousands of enterprises. Exports increased 50 per cent in 1993, whereas imports rose only 7 per cent and the production increased 11 per cent, which is the highest growth rate in Europe. It is significant that even this year we are walking with such rapid strides, only the volume of construction increased 150 per cent without calculating individual construction. Albania until yesterday the country of forbidden cars, has imported during 1993, 50 thousand vehicles, in the country of total television jamming about 30 thousand satellite dishes have been installed during one year alone. All these changes are accompanied by deep transformations in psychology of the Albanians who, according to recent studies, 79 per cent support the market economy; so they feel free from the state, have complete faith in the free initiative. We have quite another situation today as regards foreign investments. They have increased from 60 million dollars in 1992 to 290 million in 1993 and they are surely expected to be doubled in 1994 as a response to the stable finance conditions, free exchange, and trade operation. Albania in its course of compensation for the lost time and integration into Europe has not a road covered with flowers. On the contrary, sacrifices, obstacles and difficulties lie ahead. But the case of Albania clearly testifies that the shock therapy, in spite of the pains it inflicts, is the safe road and the most successful for the transformation of a centralized economy into market economy. It is painful, but its marrow is freedom; that is why it must be accepted. Its fruit at the beginning is bitter, but when it is ripe, it is delicious as the freedom itself. On the occasion of inauguration day of Coca-Cola, I would like to avail myself of this opportunity to say some words about the really favourable climate of investments that foreign friends now find in our country. It is true that Albania is a small country, but I would say that it displays serious real possibilities for foreign investors. The geographic position, the young age of the population, good qualification and education of the people, the very favouable labour market, the great natural resources in minerals such as chromium, copper, nickel, energy sources, water reserves and petroleum, the highly fertile land full of water and sunlight, its natural beauties and clear environment which also constitutes a great touristic potential, the political and economic stability, the policy of peace and prevention of the conflict, of the noble spirit and the hospitality of the Albanian make Albania, according to my opinion, a country really attractive to foreign investors. But I think that more than all of these, importance is to be laid on the economic and liberal trade policy of the Albanian Government which aims, without doubt, at creating a much more attractive climate and the most favourable conditions for the free initiative and foreign investments which we consider to be an essential element of economic progress. The government and the parliament have established today an institutional framework and a legislation to ensure foreign investments and free initiative which reduce very much the so called country risk. The Civil Code is sent to the parliament today, it completes the package of laws compatible on the banking system, fiscal management, the legislation of the companies, accounting and the like. The Law on Foreign Investment which has a special place in this package is in accordance with international standards for the protection of investors. The essential feature of this law is its liberal character and the freedom of action for foreign investors. It is intended also at eliminating bureaucratic procedures, it allows the transfer of the capital and profit, land-lease for 99 years at modest rates and in some cases even buying it. It provides guarantees for foreign investors against nationalization, expropriation, or other actions with similar effects. It is in compliance with generally recognized principles of international law and it is accompanied by a number of changes in easing the customs regulations. I would like to recall here that today about 45 per cent of the values entering Albania are exempted from the customs. In order to stimulate foreign investments, the government has programmed the privatization of medium and large-scale enterprises which will facilitate the wide participation of foreign investors in these prices. In the same way, taking into consideration the role of infrastructure and its lacking, the government has decided 37 per cent of public investment for 1993-1996 to go for infrastructure. The analysis of foreign investments in Albania indicates the real investments and commitments of the Albanian Government to do everything in its power to help foreign investors. We invite them to come to Albania, they are welcome.
