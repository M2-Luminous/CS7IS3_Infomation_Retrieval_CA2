The market, approved by the State Land Administration (SLA) and the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, will be a non-profit making agency controlling and servicing land and real estate dealers. The market will sell land-use rights, oversee commercial transfers of the rights and regulate real estate sales. The market is empowered to act as an estate agent, evaluating land, advertising land for sale and providing legal consultation services. The move will help set up "an open, fair and just allocation mechanism of land," according to State Land Administration director Zou Yuchuan. Central and provincial government will be responsible for working out the country's industrial and urban land-use plan, he said. Zou said that other agencies involved in land deals would be put under State control. The land management boss hinted that the government was going to stop handing out free land-use licenses for State-owned real estate. The government was planning to sell land or lease it to the highest bidder, he said.
