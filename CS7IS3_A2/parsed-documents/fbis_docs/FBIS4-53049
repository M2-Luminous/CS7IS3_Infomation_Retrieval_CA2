In response to increased demand being experienced as a result of the "outright sale system" which went into effect in April, NEC, Matsushita Communication Industrial, Fujitsu, and Japan Radio Company plan to double production of cellular telephones earmarked for domestic markets over levels of fiscal year 1993. Competition in the cellular telephone market is heating up because domestic appliance makers have joined the competition. In response, makers hope to gain a competitive edge by reducing costs through volume production. NEC will increase its current fiscal year production of domestically marketed cellular telephones to 400,000-500,000 units, more than twice the level of fiscal year 1993. NEC Saitama, its manufacturing subsidiary, is currently producing at the rate of about 1 million units a year for both domestic and overseas markets. About 200,000 units were distributed to domestic markets and the remainder was shipped to overseas markets, but domestic volume will be doubled because of the sharp jump in demand occasioned by decontrol leading to outright sales of cellulars. Matsushita Communications Industrial boosted monthly production at its Shizuoka plant in Kakegawa city, Shizuoka Prefecture, to 50,000 units beginning in April. According to President Takashi Kawada, "Sales of digital cellulars are better than expected," and production plans were revised upward because of a sharp rise in demand, even though they had just increased production at the Shizuoka plant from the 30,000- to 40,000-unit level in March. Fujitsu has invested roughly 1 billion yen in its Nasu plant in Otawara city, Tochigi Prefecture, to raise the capacity of that plant to 400,000 units from the current annual level of 170,000. They also plan to increase employment commensurately. Further, Japan Radio Company lifted production capacity at its Saitama plant located in Kamifukuoka city, Saitama Prefecture, twofold to a monthly rate of 20,000 units.
