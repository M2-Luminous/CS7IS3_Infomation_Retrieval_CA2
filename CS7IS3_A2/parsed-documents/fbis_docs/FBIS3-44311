This was stated by Zhang Junsheng, deputy director of the local branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, after attending the 1994 New Year reception held by the China Areospace International Holdings Ltd. here today. China will watch closely whether the British side wanted to depart from its stubborn position, Zhang added. He used a Chinese saying "he who created trouble has to solve it" to make the point that it is up to the British side, which broke off the negotiations on Hong Kong's future, to strive for the restarting of the process. Replying to a question about Patten's comments on the dissolution of Hong Kong's three-tier councils, namely the Legislative Council, district boards and two municipal councils set up under the British rule, after the change-over of power in 1997, Zhang said "it is an internal matter of our country. It is only absurd that he (Patten) should have something to say on it."
