China's current military service law was adopted by the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress on 31 May 1984. The law replaced compulsory military service, prescribed in China's first military service law drawn up in the mid-1950's, with a military service system which merges compulsory and voluntary service and merges militia and reserve forces, with compulsory service remaining the mainstay. Chi Haotian reviewed the successes which party committees, people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and social quarters have achieved during the last decade in implementing the military service law; in accomplishing assignments relevant to military service, militia, and reserve services; in taking special care of disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and servicemen; and in building stronger national defense and armed forces under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. Chi Haotian said: The period from now to the end of this century is crucial for the development of China's socialist cause. While continuing to implement the military service law, uphold the party's basic line without the least wavering, and concentrate our efforts on expediting our economic development under the new situation, we must continue to build stronger national defense and armed forces and make constant efforts to strengthen our defense to powerfully guarantee security for reform, opening up, and economic development. Specifying what needs to be done in implementing the military service law, Chi Haotian stressed: To implement the military service law, we must exert great efforts in fostering patriotism and selfless dedication so as to create an environment in which the whole nation will care for and support national defense. He pointed out: Following the founding of New China, patriotism -- which is one traditional ethic of the Chinese nation -- was further manifested. Models such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Su Ning, and Xu Honggang have come to the fore in the people's armed forces; and many progressive personnel -- such as Rong Guanxiu and Zhao Chenni, who are known as the mothers of people's soldiers; and Zhuang Yinfang and Shao Linyuan, models of supporting the military -- have also emerged from among the people. The solidarity between the armed forces, the government, and the people has become even stronger, and many units have distinguished themselves in rendering mutual support and in embarking in material and spiritual construction. Their exemplary deeds have fully demonstrated the patriotic spirit and selfless dedication of Chinese people of all nationalities. Chi Haotian pointed out: This spirit and dedication are specifically the spiritual support with which our country and people survived despite repeated catastrophes and aggressions, and they are the powerful force motivating us, the Chinese people, to press forward to build a prosperious country. Now, under the new situation, we cannot build a strong ideological foundation for implementing the military service law or build stronger defense and armed forces unless we make great efforts to promote patriotism and the spirit of selfless dedication. Chi Haotian pointed out: To implement the military service law, we must strive to study and use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system and demonstrate the role of the military service law in safeguarding the construction of our defense and armed forces. Deng Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system with Chinese characteristics is the theortical foundation for formulating the military service law, and it is also the guide for implementing the military service law. Thus, we must integrate the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking about building a legal system with the study of the military service law, extensively educate the people on the military service law, and propagate knowledge about the military service law until each and every citizen understands its basic points and understands that a stronger defense and stronger armed forces are an important part of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and that fulfulling military service and being concerned with and supporting national defense exemplify patriotism and selfless dedication. In conclusion, Chi Haotian said: As always, party committees, people's governments, enterprises, institutions, and people in all social sectors must be concerned with defense, support defense, promote defense education with perseverance, strive to make the whole nation more defense-conscious, and strive to make a success of affairs relevant to military service and the militia and in taking special care of disabled servicemen as well as families of martyrs and servicemen. The vast number of young people should have a correct concept of life and values, consider it their responsibility to safeguard the motherland, voluntarily fulfil their military service, and dedicate themselves to defense. All officers and men of the People's Liberation Army and armed police forces should keep firmly in mind that their objective is to serve the people wholeheartedly. In accordance with the Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin's general requirement that the PLA must "be politically qualified and militarily toughened, have a good work style, observe strict discipline, and be strong in defending the country," we must intensify our efforts in building the PLA into modern, regular, and revolutionary armed forces which actively support the country's economic construction and powerfully ensure the security needed for reform, opening up, and economic development. The vast number of militiamen and reservists must take the lead in participating in socialist spiritual and material construction as prescribed in the military service law. They should become the new force to become affluent through hard work, the sentinel safeguarding public security, and the powerful reserve forces backing the people's armed forces.
