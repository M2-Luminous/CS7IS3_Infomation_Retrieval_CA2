While stressing a diplomatic solution to the Bosnian crisis, Clinton reiterated that Washington remains committed to its role in NATO under the United Nations. Clinton, having communications on Bosnia with British Prime Minister John Major and Russian President Boris Yeltsin earlier today, did not rule out further NATO air strikes on Serbs around Gorazde. "It depends on the U.N. commander on the ground," he said. The U.S. "is still a very important part of the NATO alliance and we are committed to doing whatever we're asked to do," Clinton said. The situation around Gorazde, one of the six Bosnian Muslim "safe areas" designated by the U.N., remains confusing. There were reports that Serb tanks were retreating and fighting subsided in the Muslim enclave encircled by the Serbs. Meanwhile, Charles Redman, the U.S. ambassador to Bosnia, told NBC's "Meet the Press" program that Gorazde was under the military and tactical control of the Serbs. U.S. airplanes under NATO launched two air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions during the past two weeks. In retaliation, the Serbs held more than 100 U.N. soldiers as hostages. One British jet fighter was shot down Saturday over Gorazde. However, Clinton said, negotiations between the U.N. and the Bosnian Serbs had "some progress," such as the Serb agreement to release 16 Canadian soldiers.
