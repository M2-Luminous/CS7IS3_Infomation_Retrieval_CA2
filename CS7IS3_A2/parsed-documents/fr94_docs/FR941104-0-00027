FR941104-0-00027 FR941104-0-00009 A commenter raised concerns regarding Hanford, specifically with respect to the burial of decommissioned reactor cores, and regarding incinerator standards. In response, EPA today is approving and authorizing the state for a RCRA corrective action program. EPA's authorization today does not directly address cleanup decisions at Hanford, the disposal of decommissioned reactor cores, nor EPA's incinerator standards found in the Boiler and Industrial Furnace Regulations (40 CFR part 266). Therefore, these concerns are considered to be outside the scope of today's authorization action, and would be addressed by the State RCRA base program. Therefore, it is EPA's determination that there are no changes required to this authorization action as a result of the comments received. G. Status of Federal Permits Upon the effective date of authorization, the State of Washington will begin to administer and enforce corrective action requirements. EPA actions which fall under the federal omnibus authority of section 3005(c)(3) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6925(c)(3), and/or which are federal enforcement authorities, including actions issued pursuant to sections 3008(h), 3013, or 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6928(h), 6934 or 6973, will continue to be administered by EPA. In addition, HSWA amendments for which the State has not been authorized will continue to be administered and enforced by EPA. Due to recent legal developments in the national RCRA hazardous waste program, the discussion that appeared in the proposed rule (March 30, 1994, 59 FR 14827) concerning permits with automatic transfer provisions has been revised. All permits issued by U.S. EPA Region 10 prior to final authorization of the State for corrective action will continue to be administered by U.S. EPA Region 10 until the issuance, or reissuance after modification, of the State RCRA permit. Upon the effective date of the issuance, or reissuance after modification, of the State RCRA permit to incorporate authorized State requirements, those EPA-issued permit provisions for which the State is authorized to administer and enforce will expire. HSWA provisions for which the State is not authorized will continue in effect under the EPA-issued permit. H. Decision I conclude that the State of Washington's application for program revision meets all of the statutory and regulatory requirements established by RCRA. Accordingly, the State of Washington is granted final authorization to operate its hazardous waste program as revised. The State of Washington now has responsibility for permitting treatment, storage, and disposal facilities within its borders and carrying out other aspects of the RCRA program described in its revised program application, subject to the limitations of the HSWA. The State of Washington also has primary enforcement responsibilities, although EPA retains the right to conduct inspections under section 3007 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6927, and to take enforcement actions under sections 3008, 3013 and 7003 of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6928, 6934 and 6973. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 4 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this authorization will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This authorization effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of the State of Washington's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for handlers of hazardous waste in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.
