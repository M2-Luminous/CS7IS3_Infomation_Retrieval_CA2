[passage omitted] Responding to Delors statement, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said: Mr. Delors has made a very general statement on the European family and I think he referred to the concept of European solidarity, to which Greece also attaches very great importance. Mr. Delors has his views on the measures the Greek Government took on 16 February and he outlined these as president of the Commission in the letter he sent to the prime minister; the replies and procedures are well known. Mr. Venizelos concluded: Nothing special emerged in today's radio statement by Mr. Delors.
