Is this proposal acceptable to the Slovak Government? [Kukan] The EU commission's recommendation to increase the inflow in the old Danube River bed to 800 cubic meters a second is a proposal for a political solution that is not acceptable to the Slovak Government. We think there are a sufficient number of other technical measures to attain the aim put forward by Hungary; we are also interested in achieving an agreement on this. We are presenting these technical proposals and would like to discuss them. We would like to explain to the EU that our approach to this issue is serious. However, its expert group's recommendation--it gave us a number of proposals and all were acceptable to us except this one, which seems to us to be a political solution--we reject, and we reject any political pressure to have it accepted. [Stukovska] Obviously there will be talks with Hungary. At which level should they be conducted? [Kukan] We are interested in continuing the talks on temporary water management with Hungary. You, however, know the current situation in Hungary: A new government is being constituted, a new parliament has been elected. We have certain positive signs that the Hungarian position might be changing. I am a realist and will wait and see what happens. We are having continuous diplomatic correspondence with the Hungarian Foreign Ministry. To answer your question, These talks will be technical talks between experts dealing with the issues linked to temporary water management. [Stukovska] Can you tell us, at least approximately, when they might be held? [Kukan] It depends on when a new government is formed in Hungary.
