[Voskanyan] I could not truthfully say that the peasant has suffered more than city residents, let us say, as a consequence of the monetary exchange. The rural living standard is higher today. The exchange of money would have taken place more favorably if we had had the appropriate market substructures, aside from the state structures, and had buying and selling organizations in the private sector. They could have been given certain privileges to bring agricultural products into the market. I want to emphasize that a large amount of output has been accumulated in the countryside today, especially potatoes and vegetables. Our objective is to deliver 420,000 metric tons of potatoes to city residents. [Correspondent] In a press conference several months ago, you advanced the idea of establishing purchasing organizations and insisted that it be put into effect without fail. What has been done in this regard? [Voskanyan] The Ministry of Agriculture itself has studied this problem, and I can say that we have procured 1,500 metric tons of seed potatoes. This means that we will be able to work with the peasant in the spring, that is, to sell or grant him credit to buy seed potatoes. We have been trying to find markets outside the republic. One of these days our ministry representatives will travel to Pyatigorsk, where a trade fair will be organized and we will sell wool, geranium oil, and seeds, which our republic has in abundance. And I think we should proceed to privatize with confidence and establish purchasing organizations based on different forms of ownership. Certain steps have already been taken in this direction. [Correspondent] Be more specific about them, if possible. [Voskanyan] A commission on barter has been formed in the Ministry of Agriculture which can buy products locally and sell them where there is a demand for them. Despite the fact that this is not part of our ministry's responsibilities, we will make changes in our charter enabling the Ministry of Agriculture to engage in sales matters as well. This is a specific measure provided in the program for 1994. So the commission has already been formed and it is functioning. [Correspondent] Mr. minister, please tell us what will happen to the credit emission (13.5 billion rubles [R]) allocated for agriculture, especially as the agricultural administrations have permitted a large number of abuses in the emission's distribution, according to peasants and official reports. [Voskanyan] According to our assessments, use of the credit emission in agriculture has been very effective. To begin with, R7.5 billion of the R13.5 billion were allocated to the rayons for them to distribute locally, and R6 billion were allocated to various organizations in the agricultural system. What did we achieve? First of all, we were able to maintain the number of fowl in poultry farming, which had decreased to the lowest point. If we have credit funds in 1994, we will provide them for peasant farms once again, since the system is working. Some 420,000 metric tons of potatoes have been produced in the republic. This is the highest indicator in recent decades. Light frosts last year caused substantial damage to viticulture, and the gross output of grain reached 310,000 metric tons. We regret to point out that the average yield of grain crops declined, but vegetable production reached 480,000 metric tons. This indicator does not take cabbage production into account. I would like to say a few words about the number of livestock. We do not see an overall decrease in the number of livestock in the republic. This problem has to be approached from a different viewpoint. We must follow the best possible path: the number of animals has to be brought into conformity with the forage reserve in the republic. Concentrated feeds are not coming into the republic as in previous years, and I do not think they will be delivered in the years ahead. [Correspondent] What is the situation with regard to the supply of diesel fuel, which the prices of agricultural products depend on to a large extent? Spring sowing lies ahead, and the peasants are very concerned about this. [Voskanyan] Joining my colleagues, I must note with regret that the agreements concluded are not always put into effect. Our preparation period is in December and January, and we will try to make the best use of it. We intend to bring 5,000 metric tons of fuel into the republic through the Ministry of Agriculture's efforts alone. The government will also allocate a certain quantity, but I cannot say how much yet. [Correspondent] At what prices will it be sold to the peasants? [Voskanyan] At prices lower than market prices, naturally. And generally speaking, all those measures which are implemented with the help of the Ministry of Agriculture are always at prices substantially below market prices. [Correspondent] And a final question. What would you like to say to a peasant in this difficult situation which has taken shape? [Voskanyan] There are many states in a similar situation, but these problems will pass like rainy days. I think the current government will manage to bring the republic out of the situation that has developed. Our peasant farms and our peasants should realize that they are thought about. It would be correct if they were not only consumers, but obtained the needed fertilizer, seeds, and so forth beginning today to rescue us from inflation. I repeat: the Ministry of Agriculture will do everything in its power.
