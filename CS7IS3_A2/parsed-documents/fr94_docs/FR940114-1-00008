FR940114-1-00008 FR940114-1-00002 * * * * * (b) Chattel security . Ordinarily, FO loans will not be secured by chattels. However, loans will be secured by chattels as follows: (1) A first lien will be taken on equipment or fixtures purchased or refinanced with loan funds whenever such property cannot be included in the real estate lien and the additional security is needed to secure the loan. (2) Chattel security will be obtained when there is not enough real estate security for the loan and the best lien obtainable on all real estate has been taken. (3) The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Therefore, junior liens on chattels may be taken when there is enough equity in the property. However, when possible, a first lien on selected chattel items should be obtained. (4) Chattel security liens will be obtained and kept effective, as provided in subpart A of part 1962 of this chapter. (c) Other security . (1) A pledge of real estate by a third party may be taken as security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. (2) Other property may be taken as additional security when the real estate owned and to be acquired by the applicant is not adequate to secure the loan. Examples of such security include but are not limited to cash surrender value of life insurance, securities, patents and copyrights, and membership or stock in cooperatives and associations. * * * * * Subpart B_Direct Soil and Water Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations 5. Section 1943.69 is amended by removing paragraphs (a)(2), (b)(4), and (c)(1); redesignating current paragraphs (a)(3) through (a)(8) as paragraphs (a)(2) through (a)(7) respectively; redesignating current paragraph (b)(5) as paragraph (b)(4); redesignating current paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(5) as paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) respectively; revising the introductory paragraph, paragraph (a)(1), newly redesignated paragraph (a)(2), paragraph (c) introductory text, and newly redesignated paragraph (c)(1) to read as follows: §1943.69 Security. Each SW loan will be secured by real estate. Chattels and/or other security also may be taken as security. The total amount of security required will be the lesser of 150 percent of the loan amount, or all real estate owned by the applicant. A loan will be considered adequately secured when the real estate security for the loan is at least equal to the loan amount. Security in excess of 150 percent of the loan amount will only be taken when it is not practicable to separate the property, i.e., a tract of land. In unusual cases, the loan approval official may require a cosigner as defined in §1910.3(d) of subpart A of part 1910 of this chapter or a pledge of security from a third party. A pledge of security is preferable to a cosigner. (a) *␣*␣* (1) A mortgage will be taken on all real estate refinanced or improved with SW funds, and by any additional real estate security needed to meet the requirements of this section. (2) Security will also include items which are considered part of the farm and ordinarily pass with the title to the farm, such as, but not limited to assignments of leases or leasehold interests having mortgageable value, water rights, easements, rights-of-way, revenues, and royalties from mineral rights. * * * * * (c) Chattel security . Loans will be secured by chattels when there is not adequate real estate security for the loan. (1) The loan will be secured by: (i) A first lien on all property acquired, improved, or refinanced with loan funds; and (ii) If the security for the loan is not at least equal to 150 percent of the loan amount, the best lien obtainable will be taken on other chattel security owned by the applicant, up to the point that security for the loan equals 150 percent of the loan amount. * * * * * PART 1945_EMERGENCY 6. The authority citation for part 1945 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 5 U.S.C. 301; 7 U.S.C. 1989; 42 U.S.C. 1480; 7 CFR 2.23 and 2.70. Subpart D_Emergency Loan Policies, Procedures and Authorizations 7. Section 1945.169 is amended by redesignating current paragraphs (b) through (n) as paragraphs (d) through (p), respectively; revising paragraph (a), and adding a new introductory paragraph and paragraphs (b) and (c) to read as follows: §1945.169 Security. Each EM loan will be secured by chattels, real estate, and/or other security and nonessential assets in accordance with this section. The same collateral may be used to secure two or more loans made, direct or guaranteed, to the same borrower. Thus, a junior lien on property serving as collateral for a guaranteed loan(s) is acceptable.
