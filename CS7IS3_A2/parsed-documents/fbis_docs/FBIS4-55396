The Ministry of Defense in not interested in 11 million korunas? The Supreme Control Office will now take a good look at the sale of arms. The Supreme Control Office [NKU] found frequent breaches of laws and government edicts in the way the Czech Republic Army has been handling its surplus and unusable property in the period 1990 to 1993. Irregularities were found in almost all of the audited Army units as well as in the Ministry of Defense. The greatest number of irregularities was found in the Army Housing and Construction Administration (VUSS) Plzen, which, in addition to selling the chateaux Struzna and Kanice, broke the law on historical monuments by not first giving the state the option of purchasing these cultural monuments. The same law was broken by VUSS Tabor by its sale of the Neznasov chateau. The Plzen VUSS further broke the Ministry of Finance regulation on the management of national property by its transfer of the Vysocany barracks, the Dobrany billets, the Plzen exhibition grounds, and the barracks in Tachov and Rokycany. It transferred the chateau Zelena Hora-Nepomuk, including the training grounds, without a certificate from the Ministry of Finance approving the free transfer. The Army unit in Olomouc sold engineering material for more than 3.5 million Czech korunas [Kc] without obtaining approval from the government, and, subsequently, for more than Kc2 million without submitting it to public bidding. VUSS Brno sold the building at its training center for Kc1.6 million without being granted a special permit by the government. The NKU also found shortcomings in the handling of the government's claims. VUSS Plzen has not demanded the payment of rent for the lease of the grounds of the Plzen-Bory airfield, the Brno administration still has not been paid for the sale of real estate in Bilovice in the amount of Kc15 million, and neither was the Prague administration for the Aquacentrum building for Kc60 million. The Ministry of Defense has outstanding claims for the sale of movable assets amounting to more than Kc42 million. The results of the audit show that, at present, the Ministry of Defense is demanding the payment of claims in the amount of roughly Kc31 million, but, at the time of the audit, not of the remaining amount. The Ministry of Defense used almost Kc10 million for the purchase of equipment for the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] unit. Moreover, all of the equipment that was purchased is still to be found in the Czech Republic. According to the deputy press spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, J. Sila, the ministry has had the NKU report available only since Monday, and the minister will be able to make a statement about it only after 25 April. Sila further stated that, after assuming his post, Minister A. Baudys was aware that there have been irregularities in the sell-off of movable and immovable assets, and he therefore asked for his own internal audit of the sales. The report was turned over to the then prosecutor general of the Army, who, according to Sila, did not find any reason to institute criminal proceedings. At the same time, the minister decided to put in place a new system for selling movable and immovable assets, the rules of which would be fully in accord with the existing legal code. The NKU spokeswoman, J. Vavrova, told ZEMEDELSKE NOVINY that the Ministry of Defense had the protocols concerning the results of the audit available already in January. On the basis of the present investigation, a further audit of management by the Army is being planned, which this time will also include the use of funds from the state budget and the sale of arms.
