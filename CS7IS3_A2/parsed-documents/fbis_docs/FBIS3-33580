One move in this direction is represented by the bylaws that were approved at the 1991 Congress (which are radically different from the ones under which we operated throughout the 1980's) and the adjustments that we must make without delay for this special session. Yet the key question is not what structure we will create for ourselves but rather: Should the FSLN continue to be a revolutionary party or should we organize ourselves in keeping with the commonplace objectives and styles of power-hungry parties? We will find the answer mainly in the "Principles and Program of the FSLN," which will also be revised by the time of the May Congress, and the changes in the bylaws will be consistent with them. If the FSLN reaffirms that it is a party whose focus is the Nation as a whole but that wages its battle mainly to further the interests of the have-nots, a party that seeks power to continue making changes that will democratize society not only politically but in an economic and social sense as well, then the bylaws must be consistent with this tenet. The bylaws of domestic and foreign rightist parties are very similar. They are vote- and power-hungry parties that are designed to reach their operating peak during election campaigns, when the main goal is to parcel out seats and posts. As far as these parties are concerned, politics boils down to taking office, enjoying power, and promoting a few policies of social justice. Revolutionary parties, in contrast, are designed to function at all times, because they must support the struggles and grievances of the people at all times. They have very clear missions between elections, whether they are in power or the opposition. In keeping with their principles, revolutionary parties base their strength on developing the awareness of the people, on which they must work all the time. They forge broad political alliances but do not thereby corrupt the struggles and objectives of the party in light of its allies. If most Sandinists want the FSLN to remain a revolutionary party and, in particular, a true government option, it will have to adopt structures and workings that are consistent with its devotion to democracy and revolution. Intensifying Democratization Consequently, I feel that we must steadfastly intensify the democratization begun in 1990. The name that the FSLN's executive leadership body ought to adopt is not a matter of principle (until now it has been called the National Directorate), although many comrades in the rank and file contend that there ought to be a radical change in personnel, while others feel that the historic name ought to be preserved. Nonetheless, regardless of the name, it is imperative that the leadership, like the Sandinist Assembly, be elected directly by the Congress. The subordination of the executive body to the Sandinist Assembly is not merely an issue related to the bylaws. This structuralist approach is too simplistic. What we have here is a political problem that requires political answers. I feel that we need an effective and, therefore, not very large executive leadership body that can coordinate efforts through the regional network and that has close ties to the social organizations. I would like to see the creation of a body that coordinates departmental chiefs but that has well-defined functions and decisionmaking power on a number of issues affecting party life. One of the most important and decisive issues is the rank and file bodies. I think that we must try to bring as many Sandinists as possible into the new organizations and to broaden, without factionalism, the political involvement of a wide range of sectors in all spheres of activity that Sandinism can create and support. We must recognize, however, that there are different levels of commitment in the FSLN, and therefore categories must be maintained, with the different demands clearly spelled out. The suggestion about organizing the FSLN in an altogether liberal manner is typical of the vote-getting approach. If we want a party that brings together people who are ready to push a revolutionary agenda, then it must have discipline and teamwork. A revolutionary party cannot be organized as if it were a club without membership requirements, because even religious or humanitarian organizations have demands, discipline, and hierarchical categories, not to mention the capitalist business system, part of whose success is based on its organizational and hierarchical capacity. In a word, the oppressive system that we are combating is organized and cannot be defeated with a liberal approach. Under these new conditions, leaders (the Sandinist Assembly, the executive leadership body, regional posts) must be elected individually, directly, and secretly from among candidates who offer political proposals, not just personal appeal. A code of ethics to govern procedures must be established. A quota for women has been a long-standing grievance of the women's movement, and the party should establish one without delay. This will insure that women, of whom we see fewer and fewer in leadership posts and as public candidates, have a minimum of representation at all levels.
