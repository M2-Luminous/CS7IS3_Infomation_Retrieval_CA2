In several days, the first issue of NOWE PANSTWO [NEW STATE] will come out; it will be a paper related to the alliance of Jaroslaw Kaczynski and Wieslaw Chrzanowski. NOWE PANSTWO appeared last year (also during the election campaign); there were 10 issues, with a circulation of 3,000 copies, which were internal leaflets of the Center Alliance [PC] published by the office of PC Vice President Adam Lipinski. Lipinski is also the organizer and editor in chief of the new publication. The first issue, which will appear in several days, will consist of 16 pages; its format will resemble that of GAZETA WYBORCZA, and it will cost 6,000 zlotys. "We imposed a very strict financial discipline; we prepared this issue along with several people from beginning to end," says Adam Lipinski. The publisher of the paper was supposed to be the "New State" Foundation; however, the court of law refused to register it, and it has been for the time being registered as a noncommercial partnership. NOWE PANSTWO has, for the time being at least, decided not to use the distribution services of "Ruch." Representatives of the editing team claim that it is too expensive. Lipinski's paper will be distributed by private companies, rightist parties, and Solidarity. The subtitle of NOWE PANSTWO reads: "To the right of the center." This paper is not directly linked to the bloc of the Christian-National Union, teh PC, Movement for the Republic, Peasant Accord, and the Conservative Coalition [KK]. The first issue has been prepared, among others, by the leaders of the Union for Real Politics [UPR] such as Stanislaw Michalkiewicz, Rafal Ziemkiewicz, and Tomasz Gabis; Ludwik Dorn of the PC; Marek Budzisz of the KK, as well as people related to such papers as ARKA, DEBATA, and SPOTKANIA. The main subject of the first--strictly political--issue is a debate on what is the real right wing; however, the paper also wants to inform readers about cultural issues and comment on current events. "It is easiest to obtain political material," admits Adam Lipinski. In the beginning, NOWE PANSTWO will appear irregularly, and after a few months it is supposed to become a weekly. The organizers are for the time being not even dreaming of turning the paper into a daily, even though they do not rule out such a possibility in a more remote future. Also, the Agreement of 11 November, which consists of the UPR, the Christian-Democratic Party [PChD], the Conservative Party, and the Peasant-Christian Party, would like to start a publication "close" to this alliance. Primarily, politicians of smaller parties are making efforts to achieve that because the UPR already has at its disposal NAJWYZSZY CZAS, which is quite an influential paper, coming out twice a week (also as NAJWYZSZY CZAS-BIS). PChD leader Pawel Laczkowski recently announced that such a paper will be established; so far, however, this has remained up in the air--it is still not known where the money for financing such an initiative should be taken from.
