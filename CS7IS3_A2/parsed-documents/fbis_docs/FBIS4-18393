A U.S. official told Apostolis Zoumbaniotis, CyBC [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] correspondent in New York, that the UN secretary general's report is expected to finally be given to the Security Council tomorrow. The CyBC correspondent also reports that all indications are that the Turkish side will be given 15 days to accept the latest proposals of Joe Clark, the UN secretary general's special representative for Cyprus, regarding the means of implementing the confidence-building measures. The CyBC correspondent reports the possibility of the Security Council putting substantial pressure on the Turkish side is very slight due to strong objections by the United States. Security Council circles told the CyBC correspondent that it can not be ruled out that after the expiration of the 15 day time limit, President Glavkos Kliridhis and [Turkish Cypriot Leader] Rauf Denktas will be invited to go to New York, either to sign an agreement or for a coordinated effort to find a compromise with the participation of the UN secretary general and the five permanent members of the Security Council.
