The United Nations and the UN Coordination Commission were informed of these developments and the latter said it was watching the situation. A statement issued by the "Iraqi Transmitting Corporation" [ITC] [Hay'at al-Irsal al-'Iraqiyah] from its headquarters in Salah al-Din in northern Iraq said that the Iraqi Government has replaced its armed forces deployed along the contact line in Kurdistan in February. The statement, of which AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT received a copy in London, also said: The 10th Armored Division of the 1st Corps -- one of the most important divisions in the Iraqi Armed Forces -- has withdrawn, taking its armored units and advanced T-72 Russian-made tanks, and headed for the Tib area in the Maysan Governorate near the Iranian border. Its command used as headquarters a building opposite the radio and television premises in the town of al-'Amarah. A week later, the 1st Mechanized Infantry Division was moved by train to the north and took up positions in the area of Makhmur. The 24th Armored Brigade, supplied with T-55 tanks, is its only armored brigade. The ITC did not give a clear reason for this change in which the more advanced tanks withdrew to be replaced by older tanks to carry out "the expected attack." The explanation is perhaps that the Iraqi regime wants to protect its wing on the Iranian border. The ITC also said that the al-'Abid forces of the Republican Guard, under the command of Staff Brigadier General Salih al-Hajj and his assistant Staff Colonel Nizar Husayn al-Husayni, have also moved up to the northern region and taken up positions near al-Mawsil dam with brigades deployed in Shaykhan, Fulyfilah, and Fa'idah. The changes also included withdrawal of the guard units near the contact lines and deployment of these units in towns. That was confirmed by Peshmerga forces and also by patrols of the Unified Iraqi National Congress [UING]. The ITC quoted its correspondent in al-Mawsil as saying that, during his visit to the town on 23 February, Saddam Husayn met with the party leaders and armed forces commanders in the northern intelligence service building in the town and told them that "he decided to attack" the region of Kurdistan during the 'Id al-Fitr period. That was accompanied by measures denoting aggressive intent. The Saddam Hospital in Karkuk was vacated to be ready to receive the wounded. The town of Karkuk was fortified and on the night of Monday, 28 February and in the early hours of Tuesday 1 March some armored units moved toward the areas of Bardarash and Shaykhan but stopped short of the contact line. That prompted the Peshmerga Ministry in northern Iraq to send a notification to the UINC, the UN Coordination Commission, and the United Nations on 2 March warning of an imminent aggression against Kurdistan. The statement added: The Peshmerga forces monitored major Iraqi forces movements including armor and heavy artillery in the direction of the areas of Fa'idah, Shaykhan, Ba'idrah, Bardarash, and Faysh Khabur along the contact line. Our correspondent in al-Mawsil says there is much talk in the Iraqi Army's officers' circles in the town about the possibility of an offensive. As a result, the Dahuk [Peshmerga] command requested a meeting with the UN Coordination Commission. The ITC correspondent in Dahuk says that officers of that commission went to the Dahuk command on 2 March and met with Babakr, the Peshmerga commander in that area, and a number of Kurdistan Government officials.
