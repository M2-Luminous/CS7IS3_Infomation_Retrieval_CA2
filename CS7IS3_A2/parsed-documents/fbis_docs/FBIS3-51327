The minister is now in the Uruguayan city of Colonia, where the Argentine, Brazilian, Uruguayan, and Paraguayan presidents, along with their ministers of economy, are attending a Mercosur summit. Cavallo denied that the deadlines for implementation of Mercosur will be postponed, noting in this regard that a document christened "Consolidation of the Customs Union and Transition Toward the Common Market" will be signed "probably this afternoon." Concerning informatics products, the minister said that Argentina advocates "a very low tariff, like the one agreed upon within the NAFTA," adding that Brazil "wants a very high tariff because it has a protection system." He added: "When there is no agreement, debates continue, but this is an issue on which we can reach a final agreement if each country maintains a tariff structure for the capital goods it wants, and if a convergence process is then implemented." In statements to a Buenos Aires radio station, Cavallo said that Argentina "wants all areas of the economy, industry, the farm sector, and the services to make investments, purchasing the best possible technology at the lowest price." "That is why we encourage our capital goods producers with internal tax refunds, but we will not permit them to sell their equipment at prices that are higher than those prevailing abroad," he said.
