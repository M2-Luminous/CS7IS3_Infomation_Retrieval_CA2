The newly-elected Supreme Council of Crimea and the autonomous republic's president, Yuriy Meshkov, have embarked on an unmasked course towards Crimea's separation from Ukraine. Thus states an appeal to the president and Supreme Council of Ukraine by Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea, formed to consolidate progressive pro-Ukrainian democratic forces on the peninsula. The pro-Russian chauvinists and their media, the document stresses, are trying to convince people that Kiev is responsible for all of Crimea's troubles, and that Ukraine is putting brakes on the development of the autonomous republic's economy. Rumors are constantly spread about accelerated militarization of the peninsula. This campaign has already reached its goal: Fear is common among Crimean residents and households are getting involved in interethnic clashes. The shadow parliament, the Civic Congress of Crimea, demands that the Supreme Council of Crimea should be dissolved, the republic's presidency abolished, and direct presidential rule imposed here. The demands include urgent and fair settlement of the Black Sea Fleet problems, withdrawal of Russian ships from Ukraine, prevention of the lease of Ukrainian territories to foreign military bases, and recognition of the powers of the majles as a body representing the interests of the entire Crimean-Tatar people.
