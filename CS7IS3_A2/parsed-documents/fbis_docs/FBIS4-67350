The annual emission of nitrous oxide in China is 950 gigagrams (as nitrogen), equivalent to about 6 percent of the world total. Natural sources account for 71 percent of the total and human sources for 29 percent. The primary natural source is the sea, and the most important human source is the combustion of coal. It is calculated that in the next few years the rate of increase of N2O emissions will be 6 gigagrams per year (as nitrogen) Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important atmospheric trace gas which both contributes to the greenhouse effect and can destroy ozone in the stratosphere. Atmospheric N2O levels have increased greatly from their pre-Industrial Revolution levels, reaching 310 ppbV in 1990, and the annual rate of increase is now between 0.2 and 0.3 percent. Although N2O makes a major contribution to global environmental change, there are still difficulties in identifying and quantifying its sources. It was formerly believed that the use of agricultural fertilizers and the combustion of fossil fuels were the factors causing global N2O levels to rise. But recent research has shown that the results of earlier calculations were overstated, and as a consequence, more detailed efforts to identify N2O sources and to forecast N2O concentrations are being made. Because N2O levels vary from region to region and from country to country, any limits imposed on its emission must take account of the particular conditions of each country. Calculated country-by-country or region-by-region emission figures are of great importance in the development of appropriate control policies in each country and are also of great reference value in calculating the global N2O budget. Since China is a large, developing nation, the trace gases emitted by its industry and agriculture may constitute an important fraction of total global emissions of greenhouses gases. Wang Mingxing [3769 2494 2502] has made an estimate of methane emissions in China, but there have been relatively few efforts to determine the emission sources of other trace gases in China. In this paper, using domestic statistics and following the most recent OECD methodology for calculating trace gas emissions, we analyze domestic N2O sources and their relative contributions. Nitrous oxide emissions can be classified as natural and manmade. Among the natural sources, we shall concentrate on emissions from soil and water. Table 1 gives statistics on N2O emissions in China, classified by source. Table 1 3. Annual Change in N2O Emissions Human activity has altered the global environment and is producing a great effect on atmospheric N2O levels. Changes in the natural environment and the development of industry and agriculture have caused fluctuations in emissions by various N2O sources. Below we shall present crude estimates of the changes in N2O sources that are likely to result from various factors in the next few years (Table 2). In China, housing construction, desertification and other land-use factors are causing a gradual decrease in the arable land area, which may cause a decrease in N2O emissions from the soil. It is estimated that an annual decrease of 5 million hm[.sup]2[/] in the area of arable land and grassland will result in an annual decrease of 3.0 Gg (gigagrams) in N2O [here and below, all figures for nitrous oxide are expressed as nitrogen]. But with accelerated economic development, the consumption of fossil fuels will rise steadily, producing an increase in N2O emissions. The combustion of coal, oil and natural gas in stationary facilities will cause increases of respectively 2.8, 0.3, and 0.03 Gg of N2O per year, for a total of 3.1 Gg. Similarly, the total N2O emissions from mobile sources will increase by 0.3 Gg. An annual increase of 1.4 x 10[.sup]8[/] kg in fertilizer use will cause direct release of 1.6 Gg N2O from the soil, together with the emission of 1.6 Gg of N2O from groundwaters. The burning of straw from crops will produce an annual increase of 2.3 Gg N2O per year; but this is an upper limit: because the energy structure of agriculture is changing and fossil fuels are gradually replacing plant fuels as an energy source, in the next few years N2O emissions should increase by about 6 Gg. Table 2. 4. Conclusions. Our analysis indicates that the total amount of N2O emitted in China is 950 Gg per year (as nitrogen), with natural and manmade sources accounting for respectively 71 and 29 percent of the total. It is reported that the total world emission of N2O is 14 to 15 Tg (teragrams). Thus, China's N2O emissions account for about 6 percent of the world total. The calculations show that China's N2O emissions are primarily from natural sources, chiefly marine sources. Because China burns very large amounts of coal, this source represents a rather large fraction of manmade N2O emissions. Owing to changes in various factors, in the next few years the net annual increase in N2O emissions will be 6 Gg N2O.
