Eric Jung has just contacted Captain Barril, who accuses the rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] of having carried out this attack: [Begin recording] [Barril] I have not only the black box, but also various other items which go with it. I have three reels from the control tower, I have all the recordings, all the telexes, all the airport's books, which I went to the spot to find myself. No doubt you are going to ask me why, but I will tell you that I have been a specialist in the fight against terrorism, and that was an attack on two heads of state, which also killed three Frenchmen, and this attack was planned by a terrorist group backed by a pseudoterrorist state which is also responsible for the genocide of the 500,000 Rwandans who have died in recent times. [Jung] Here you are referring to the RPF, Paul Barril. [Barril] Yes, absolutely, and I will give you a piece of information that is of capital importance to me and to those who are listening to us: In an attack like that, with two heads of state and three Frenchmen killed, no proceedings, no inquiry, at a national level or at an international level, has been launched by anyone, and this is a flaw in the system of justice, because there is no international system of justice, and the matter has not been referred to France, and during the next few days we are going to lodge several complaints at an international level to attempt to rattle a little those who planned this attack. Those who planned it and executed it are responsible for the massacre of 500,000 innocent people which followed. These are the people who must be tried, and I have done everything I could: I have been to the spot, I have been helped by people, I have collated eyewitness accounts, to point the finger at these people and bring them to trial so that they can be tried by an international commission.
