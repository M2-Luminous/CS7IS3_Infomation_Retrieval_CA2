He has been "released on bail for medical treatment" in the United States. If the people of Beijing were to find out about it, they would certainly find it strange. People will at once associate this event with the question of the U.S. most-favored-nation trading status. Have human rights been linked with trade once again? A rumor has shown that the people's guesswork has not been completely off the mark. During U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to China in the middle of March, it was said that the four commitments concerning the release of Wang Juntao made between the Chinese and U.S. sides were as follows: 1. Special judicial arrangements will be made by China for Wang Juntao, and, after his release on bail, he will be allowed to go to the United States for medical treatment; 2. The U.S. departments concerned should undertake the responsibility that, during the period of receiving medical treatment in the United States, Wang Juntao cannot get involved in activities opposing the Chinese Government; 3. Wang Juntao will be allowed to return to China after his recovery; 4. Wang Juntao's wife Hou Xiaotian will have no difficulty in returning to China. A cadre, a friend of mine, "leaked this secret" to me and told me that it was accurate information, but I think it can also be termed a "rumor."
