ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively the agencies) are amending their regulations regarding appraisals of real estate. This final rule is adopted pursuant to Title XI of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The final rule increases to $250,000 the threshold at or below which appraisals are not required pursuant to Title XI, expands and clarifies existing exemptions to the Title XI appraisal requirement, identifies additional circumstances when appraisals are not required under Title XI, and specifies when exempt transactions nevertheless require appropriate evaluations. In addition, the final rule amends existing requirements governing appraisal content and the use of appraisals prepared by other financial services institutions. The agencies are adopting this final rule to further federal financial and public policy interests by reducing regulatory burden, while requiring Title XI appraisals when necessary to protect the safety and soundness of financial institutions or otherwise advance public policy. EFFECTIVE DATE: This final rule is effective on June 7, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Thomas E.
