Ozren region used a B-1 gun to shell the village of Sijevo. The enemy is continuously regrouping along the entire 133-km long defense line. Moreover, significant movements of motorized vehicles have been sighted in the region of Kokice and Novi Seher. Our reconnaissance units report that the woods in Sijakovac were ablaze all night, and that it was Croats and Muslims, mobilized in Doboj and Teslic, who were forced to set fire to them. As we file this report, the chetniks are fiercely but unsuccessfully attacking units of the (?111th) Croatian Defense Council Zepce Brigade. This has been Smajl Terzic reporting from the 7th South Operative Group Information Center.
