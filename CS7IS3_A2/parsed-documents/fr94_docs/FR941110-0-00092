FR941110-0-00092 FR941110-0-00016 Comment: Several commenters proposed that HCFA establish procedures that would enable resident advocates, families and the interested public to request validation (complaint) surveys for specific facilities. These procedures should include public notice including a regulatory requirement that a poster notice be displayed in facilities. HCFA would be required to respond to such requests and investigate complaints against facilities and allegations of poor performance of State agencies. Response: Disclosure of survey-related information is in accordance with ยง488.325, and it is also discussed in detail under the section of this preamble entitled, ``Disclosure of Survey Information.'' We understand the concerns expressed by the commenters who would like HCFA to perform complaint investigations and validation surveys at the request of advocates and other individuals. The Act and current regulations ensure that the State survey agencies will respond to allegations of poor care or abuse and will investigate these allegations according to State law and HCFA requirements. Most complaints directed to HCFA are referred to the State agencies for investigation. HCFA is not staffed sufficiently to respond directly to complaints and/or requests for validation surveys. The small HCFA survey staff is occupied fully in the assessment of State agency performance of its survey and certification responsibilities under section 1864 of the Act. Because of these constraints, we are unable to accept the commenters' suggestions. Comment: Certain commenters asked that we give a facility that is dissatisfied with the State survey the ability to request a validation survey and receive it within a reasonable time period. Response: As mentioned above, we do not have the resources to conduct validation surveys upon every request. If a provider believes that the State survey was done in an inappropriate manner, it may file a complaint with the HCFA regional office at whose discretion a validation survey may be, but need not be, performed. Comment: One commenter was concerned that when selecting facilities for validation surveys, HCFA will not draw a random sample but will select inferior facilities in order to cut its Medicaid obligations to the States. Response: This fear is groundless. It is not the quality of the facility that determines whether the State will be sanctioned for inadequate State survey agency performance, but rather the quality of the State's assessment of the facility which is relevant. Facility noncompliance does not reflect poorly upon the State unless the State has failed to identify it. Comment: One commenter believed that the identities of facilities on which validation surveys are to be performed should not be disclosed to the State survey agency. Response: There is no justification for such a policy. Currently, HCFA notifies States of an impending validation survey either 3 days before a nonconcurrent Federal validation survey or 3 weeks before a Federal/State OSPATS survey. In the case of the nonconcurrent Federal validation survey, this allows the State to arrange to have a surveyor present to observe the Federal survey and take advantage of the instructional opportunities that it presents. Comment: Several commenters with recent experience with validation surveys noted that the State and Federal surveys were very different; the Federal surveys stressed concepts (for example, use of restraints) not emphasized by the State. Response: The primary emphasis of the Federal validation survey is on assessing State survey performance. Therefore, the Federal review may stress certain areas of compliance in which an evaluation of State performance is particularly important. In addition, the long term care survey protocol has only been in effect since October 1990, with appropriate instruction enhancements for the final long term care regulations which were effective April 1, 1992. It is not unusual that some variation in emphasis will occur in a new survey process. HCFA is committed to a survey process that produces accurate and consistent findings. To that end, we have organized numerous educational sessions for Federal and State surveyors, held regional training conferences in the HCFA regions and produced the ``Principles of Documentation'' which is an attempt to standardize the writing of deficiency citations. Despite all of these continuing efforts, some variation will remain as long as human beings perform surveys and statutory requirements involve the making of professional judgments. As far as the use of restraints is involved, the decrease of restraints has been a HCFA priority since the inception of the new survey protocol. Comment: One commenter suggested that HCFA perform validation surveys of all facilities that have a waiver of the RN director of nursing or other licensed nursing requirements for a year or more. Others suggested that HCFA list the criteria it uses to select facilities for validation surveys and that the validation sample should reflect the State's diversity in location, size and ownership of facilities.
