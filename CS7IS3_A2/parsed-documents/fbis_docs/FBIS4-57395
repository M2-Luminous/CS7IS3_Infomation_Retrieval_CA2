Commander in Chief Fidel Castro was honoring an invitation made to him and representatives from another 188 nations to witness the triumph of the first multiracial elections, the disappearance of racism, and the establishment of the first South African Government of national unity. Prior to his arrival in South Africa, the Cuban president and his delegation made a technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, where the highest leader of the Cuban Revolution held a friendly conversation with President Jerry John Rawlings. The two leaders conversed on many topics, but mostly on the ANC and the triumph of the electoral process in South Africa. In Pretoria on the morning of 10 May, mankind witnessed a political change unprecedented in that nation's history. The main news agencies of the world broadcast for more than 2 billion television viewers the most relevant historic event for the public opinion in the course of those 24 hours. Present were 5,000 invited personalities, 140 governmental delegations, 40 of them represented by heads of state and government. Nelson Mandela was sworn in for a five-year term. In taking over the destiny of South Africa, he stated to the world: We are committed to establishing a true and lasting peace, a society of which we can feel proud where all South Africans, Blacks and Whites, can live without fear for each other. In that context, Fidel Castro dialogued with many heads of state and distinguished political figures such as Jose Eduardo dos Santos, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Robert Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Frederik de Klerk, John Rawlings, Yasir 'Arafat, meeting with a total of 30 personalities. At the seat of government in Pretoria, on the morning of 11 May, Fidel Castro, the president of Councils of State and of Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, held official talks with South African President Nelson Mandela. [Begin recording] [Mandela, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] Thank you very much. (?We need you.) [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into English] Please convey my greetings to Mr. De Klerk. [Mandela, in English with superimposed translation into Spanish] Thank you very much, I will do that. [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into English] We have witnessed the death of apartheid and the birth of freedom. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the unity of the South African people from all sectors and all ethnic backgrounds, and no one can imagine how many were saying that the process continues to evolve in that direction. [end recording] On the morning of 12 May, new South African Foreign Minister (Alsen Sock) and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina officially established diplomatic relations between the two countries. Hours later, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made remarks to the South African Broadcasting Company, one of the stations with greatest repercussions on the national public opinion. [Begin recording] [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into English] I will say this categorically: These have been extraordinary impressions. South Africa was for me a mysterious country and I have found an extraordinary country in all senses. [end recording] After concluding his visit to South Africa, Cuban President Fidel Castro and the delegation that accompanied him made a brief stop in the Brazilian state of Salvador de Bahia. On his arrival the commander in chief was met by Bahia Governor Antonio Inva Say. Fidel also met with former Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and local authorities. Prior to his departure, Fidel answered the questions of Brazilian reporters interested in his visit: [Begin recording, in Spanish with superimposed translation into Portuguese] [First unidentified reporter] What is Cuba doing to break the economic embargo? [Castro] We are making all kinds of effort. We are working in the international sphere, at the United Nations, and in all the organizations. We promote solidarity. We try whatever is in our reach. There is a movement against the blockade that is gaining momentum in the United States. The immense majority of the countries in the United Nations condemn the blockade. Only two or three nations support the blockade. Meanwhile, the blockade has to be fought with deeds. With the efforts for the development of the country, the financial restructuring, and in the difficult circumstances, we also had to adapt ourselves to the collapse of the socialist bloc of the USSR which represented 80 percent of our trade. The embargo has [words indistinct] our fighting spirit and resistance. I believe that no other country would have been able to resist what Cuba has resisted. Cuba resists, and it will continue to resist. In the long run, we will be worthy of the victory. [Second unidentified reporter] In the United States, presidential candidate Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva called for the end of the blockade on Cuba. How do you see the position taken by Lula? [Castro] I greatly appreciate his position. He has always held that position, as have many other political leaders. Generally all the progressive and democratic forces of the world oppose the blockade and that number continues to grow. [Second unidentified reporter] What are the expectations for and what is the new economic plan to be implemented in Cuba? [Castro] Well, it is not a new economic plan. This new plan has a series of measures. We are already developing our [words indistinct] adjusted to the conditions of the world we live in, which is hegemonized by the United States, without giving up our ideals, concepts, or the achievements of socialism. We are trying to adapt our economic work to the reality of the world we live in. Many are the things that we are doing, without shock policies and without haste. Just recently, the National Assembly of the People's Government [ANPP] approved a series of measures of principles designed to stabilize internal finances, one of the many problems we are facing. [Third unidentified reporter] What changes, under these measures that were approved by the ANPP? [Castro] Excess currency is reduced. [words indistinct] Cuba has done many things. I believe that the things Cuba has done can compete in quality and in democratic spirit with those things that have been done in many countries around the world. Because in our country it is not the party that nominates, but the people. In other words, in our country there are (?thousands) of parties. Each citizen has the right to nominate candidates and has the right to elect them. But since we do not have media multinationals, we cannot make our ideas known. [Fourth unidentified reporter] What motivated you to make a second visit to Brazil? [Castro] Many things. Let us say that it is geography. It is a big country in the southern hemisphere, at the world crossroads, a place through which one must pass. That is one reason. Another reason is that it is a friendly nation. A third is that it is a hospitable country. Fourth, it is a country we esteem. Fifth, I feel very happy every time I come here. Sixth, because relations between Brazil and Cuba improve everyday. [Fourth unidentified reporter] Why Bahia? [Castro] Because it is on my way. If I am going to Europe, for example, I cannot go through the Antarctic. I have to go direct to Madrid or Paris. It is an ideal stopover from the geographic point of view. From the friendly point of view, I know Bahia [words indistinct] We have many friends here who always receive us with affection. [Fourth unidentified reporter] Do you have another meeting when you leave here? [Castro] Yes, when I leave here I will have a meeting with Morpheus. [chuckles] [Fifth unidentified reporter] Will you visit the city? [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from Cuba for over a week. [Fourth unidentified reporter] At what time are you leaving? [Castro] That is a military secret. [laughs] Probably, tomorrow morning. We must leave either in the morning or in the evening, depending on the weather. [end recording] Yesterday afternoon [12 May], the commander in chief arrived in Havana after a tour that included Barbados, on the occasion of the first global conference for the sustainable development of insular states; a technical stop in Ghana; the presence of Cuba at Nelson Mandela's inaugural ceremony in South Africa; and a brief stop in Salvador de Bahia.
