Reporters and bodyguards exchanged strong insults and even a few blows while the Cubans' station wagon quickly pulled away amid jeers from the reporters. The reporters had tried to film and interview the bodyguards after they attacked a group of cameramen who tried to talk with Castro at the entrance of the Hilton Hotel in Cartagena, where guests attending the Fourth Ibero-Ameican Summit are lodged. The incident started when Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro stopped to make statements at the foot of the stairs, which were being descended by the heads of state who had just held a number of bilateral meetings before the second session of the summit. At that moment, one of the television reporters brought a microphone close to Castro, who was waiting behind Chamorro, but Castro's bodyguards reacted violently, and, according to eyewitnesses, a fracas ensued, first with an exchange of insults, then blows. From amid a maelstrom of Cuban security agents and reporters, one Argentine cameraman shouted in anguish: "You must not hit reporters. You must not hit reporters." The incident took place in front of several astonished and concerned presidents, foreign ministers, and Colombian officials. When the situation calmed down and the presidents left for the Cartagena Convention Center, the reporters went looking for the bodyguards and chased them down -- cameras and microphones in hand -- in the vicinity of the Hilton. Finally the group of bodyguards, some of whom were accused of having caused similar incidents at previous summits, hastily got into a station wagon amid shouts of "This is not Cuba; reporters are respected here." Reporters covering the Ibero-American Summit have encountered difficulties because of security measures that have been described as excessive. On Tuesday, they complained to the Colombian authorities who, nevertheless, refused to modify the strict rules concerning access to the leaders.
