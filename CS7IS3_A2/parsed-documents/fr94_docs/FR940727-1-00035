FR940727-1-00035 FR940727-1-00014 (3) Crushing and Breakage of Lamps Mercury remains in lamps until they are broken. When lamps break, the elemental mercury inside becomes available for evaporation, adsorption, or reaction. EPA modeled mercury emissions from broken lamps based on two different methods of transportation (EPA, 1993). Discarded lamps may be transported in one of two ways: In refuse trucks as household or commercial trash, and in closed vans or trailers as part of a bulk relamping program. Based on available information, it was assumed for the purposes of this model that as much as 6.6% of mercury could be released in the air from a lamp broken during the collection, storage and transport of mercury-containing lamps in garbage trucks. The Agency recognizes that it is uncertain how much mercury is released from broken lamps. The amount of mercury released would vary depending on the ambient air temperature, the time the broken lamps are directly exposed to the air and the number of lamps broken. The Agency requests any available data concerning releases of mercury during storage, transportation and waste management (e.g., landfill and recyclers) activities. C. Technical Considerations and Request for Comments The available data on landfill leachate suggests that mercury-containing lamps may not pose a threat to groundwater when placed in a state-controlled municipal landfill due to the low levels of mercury found in landfill leachate. However, available information also indicates that an important route of exposure for mercury is bioaccumulation up the food chain, causing mercury poisoning to both wildlife and humans (i.e., through fish consumption). Although it is unclear how mercury moves through the atmosphere and what conditions enhance or retard it, information suggests that given the high vapor pressure of mercury, it can readily volatilize to the air and be transported, perhaps long distances, and be deposited on surface water or soil (which can run off into surface water). Some mercury that is subsequently methylated will bioaccumulate in the food chain. The actual amount of mercury released from fluorescent or HID lamps is unknown. It is estimated that lamps that are incinerated will release 98% of their mercury due to the high temperatures needed for the incineration process. However, because mercury is such a volatile metal, amounts of mercury could be released into the air from lamps broken during transportation or lamps broken at the landfill. For purposes of this proposal, EPA has made assumptions on the amount of mercury that may be released from a broken lamp but few studies have directly measured the amount of mercury released from a lamp over time. More information on the air release, transport and exposure pathway for mercury is needed in order to better evaluate the proper management methods for spent mercury-containing lamps. The Agency requests information on air transport of mercury from mercury-containing lamps, the mercury methylation process (both in general and in landfills) and any studies that directly measure the amount and form of mercury released from broken mercury-containing lamps. IV. Management Options The information presented in this notice has led the Agency to re-evaluate the management of waste mercury-containing lamps because of their importance in promoting energy-efficiency. As mentioned earlier in this notice, the use of energy-efficient lighting can reduce mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants as well as emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur oxide. In light of the benefits derived from the use of these lamps, EPA is seeking comment on two proposed options based the data which indicate that these lamps may be better managed either outside of the hazardous waste system or in a reduced regulatory structure within the hazardous waste system. However, since there remain uncertainties in the data, more information on the air exposure pathway for mercury from lamps would facilitate a decision by EPA on the management of lamps. Additional information could clarify which kind of reduced management structure would be most appropriate for mercury-containing lamps. The Agency has requested that information, if available, be submitted with the public comment to this proposal. Given these technical uncertainties, EPA has developed two proposed alternative approaches for the management of mercury-containing lamps. The first approach is a conditional exclusion for mercury-containing lamps from regulation as hazardous waste. Under this approach, mercury-containing lamps would no longer be considered hazardous waste provided that they are managed under the conditions of the exclusion. The second approach is to add mercury-containing lamps to the universal waste management system, which was proposed for batteries and pesticides on February 11, 1993 (58 FR 8102). Under the universal waste management system, lamps that fail the TC would be considered hazardous waste, but they would be subject to streamlined hazardous waste management requirements, which are described in detail later in this notice. The major difference between these two options is whether lamps are disposed of under Subtitle D requirements or under Subtitle C requirements. Recycling of lamps would be allowed under either option.
