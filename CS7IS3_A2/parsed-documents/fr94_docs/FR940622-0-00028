FR940622-0-00028 FR940622-0-00011 A. Participation in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA Programs We proposed to revise §489.20, Basic commitments, to show that a participating Medicare hospital must agree to participate in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA program as payment in full in accordance with a new §489.25, which incorporates statutory provisions. In new §489.25, we would require Medicare participating hospitals to be participating providers in the CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA programs. We proposed to require the hospitals to comply with DoD regulations governing admissions practices and payment methodology and amounts for such services. As noted above, CHAMPUS published a final rule on September 1, 1987, that contains provisions for the implementation of a DRG-based payment system. We would continue the policy that hospitals participating in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA that also participate in Medicare must meet all Medicare conditions of participation. Thus, if CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA have requirements for participating that differ from Medicare's, Medicare's requirements also would have to be met. We proposed to require hospitals to accept payment from CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full for the services provided to these beneficiaries (less applicable deductible, patient cost-share, and noncovered items). In addition, we intended to add a new paragraph (11) to §489.53, Terminations by HHS, to show that a hospital that does not meet the requirements of §489.25 would be subject to possible termination. The proposed changes would apply only to inpatient hospital services furnished to beneficiaries admitted on or after January 1, 1987. B. Participation in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care Program To implement section 233 of Pub. L. 99&hyph;576, we proposed to add a new §489.26. Hospitals do not enter into participation agreements with the Department of Veterans Affairs program as they do if they choose to participate in the Medicare program or the CHAMPUS or CHAMPVA programs. Instead, the VA authorizes payment for the treatment, usually on a preadmission basis at a designated hospital that furnishes the service. We proposed to require a Medicare participating hospital to admit any veteran whose hospitalization is authorized by the VA under 38 U.S.C. 603 (this includes emergency cases, which may be authorized after admission). The hospital would have to meet the requirements of 38 CFR Part 17 regarding admission practices and payment methodology and amounts published October 24, 1990 (55 FR 42848). This arrangement would not affect the hospital's need to meet all Medicare hospital conditions of participation.
