FR940222-2-00005 FR940222-2-00004 DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE International Trade Administration University of California, Berkeley, et al.; Notice of Consolidated Decision on Applications for Duty-Free Entry of Scientific Instruments This is a decision consolidated pursuant to section 6(c) of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1966 (Pub. L. 89&hyph;651, 80 Stat. 897; 15 CFR part 301). Related records can be viewed between 8:30 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. in room 4211, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th and Constitution Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. Comments: None received. Decision: Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instruments described below, for such purposes as each is intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States. Docket Number: 93&hyph;003R. Applicant: University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720. Instrument: Blackbody Furnace with Internationally Accredited Absolute Reference. Manufacturer: National Physical Laboratory, United Kingdom. Intended Use: See notice at 58 FR 14559, March 18, 1993. Reasons: The foreign instrument provides: (1) highly flat spectral emissivity over the 3&hyph;30 Î¼m range, (2) an isothermal emissivity to 0.999, (3) characterization relative to an absolute standard cavity and (4) operability in an airborne observatory. Advice Received From: National Institute of Standards and Technology, January 4, 1994. Docket Number: 93&hyph;138. Applicant: Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439. Instrument: Scintillometer, Model SLS 20. Manufacturer: Scintec, Germany. Intended Use: See notice at 58 FR 63924, December 3, 1993. Reasons: The foreign instrument provides measurement of the refractive index, provides continuous measurement of the refractive index parameter (C n 2 ) and the inner scale of turbulence (l o ) for estimating heat and momentum flux in the atmosphere along light propagation distances of tens to hundreds of meters. Advice Received From: National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, January 10, 1994. Docket Number: 93&hyph;144. Applicant: Duke University, Durham, NC 27708&hyph;0227. Instrument: Electron Microprobe (Used), Model CAMEBAX. Manufacturer: Cameca, France. Intended Use: See notice at 58 FR 65158, December 13, 1993. Reasons: The foreign instrument provides (1) non-destructive chemical analysis of micron-sized regions with detection limits of 0.01% and precision to 1.0% for major elements and (2) four wavelength dispersive spectrometers. Advice Received From: National Institute of Standards and Technology, November 10, 1993 (comparable case). The National Institute of Standards and Technology and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration advise that (1) the capabilities of each of the foreign instruments described above are pertinent to each applicant's intended purpose and (2) they know of no domestic instrument or apparatus of equivalent scientific value for the intended use of each instrument. We know of no other instrument or apparatus being manufactured in the United States which is of equivalent scientific value to either of the foreign instruments.
