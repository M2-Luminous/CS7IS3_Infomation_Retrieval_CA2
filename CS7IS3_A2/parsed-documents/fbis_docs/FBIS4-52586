There has been growing criticism against his Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]-oriented management of party affairs. The Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] and other parties have also made an official request to summon Hosokawa as witness in connection with his loan from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. Therefore, most party members have come to the conclusion that "if Hosokawa remains in the post of party head, the party's split will be inevitable," (as stated by a senior JNP official). Hosokawa disclosed at a meeting of JNP Diet members of both houses on 9 May that he will hold a national meeting of party representatives as early as 21 May to hear their opinions on this matter. However, there is a possibility that he will announce his intention to resign before this meeting. The JNP held separate meetings of Diet members according to their seniority on 9 May to discuss party management and other topics. The prevailing view among the participants was: "To rebuild the party, there is no other way but for Mr. Hosokawa to resign voluntarily." If Hosokawa should resign, it is certain that the party executives, who have been criticized for their stand on party management, will also be replaced. On the other hand, JNP members who have been considering leaving the party are now inclined to think that "if the leadership changes, this will open up prospects for the party's renewal." Mass secession is likely to be averted for the time being.
