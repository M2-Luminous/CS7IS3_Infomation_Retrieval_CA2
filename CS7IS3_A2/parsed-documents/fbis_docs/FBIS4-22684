Vorobyev, press service of the St. Petersburg Trade Unions Federation: "The Students and the Power: The Process Has Started...: On the Eve of a Student Rally the St. Petersburg Government Made Important Decisions"] [Text] It would seem that the city government is beginning to understand that the situation that has formed with the social protection of the St. Petersburg student group is an explosive one. (This newspaper has written about the student rally that is planned for 12 April.) Today people are already demanding the urgent interference of the executive authority in order to prevent a French recurrence on the banks of the Neva. On 7 April the first session of the Commission on Problems of the Student Youth was held in the Department of Youth Policy, of the St. Petersburg government. That commission was created on the order of city mayor Anatoliy Sobchak. Sergey Prushchak was appointed chairman of the commission, and Vyacheslav Ryabkov, a consultant on youth affairs in the St. Petersburg and oblast Trade Unions Federation, became his deputy. The commission includes representatives of academy science, the council of rectors, and tekhnikum directors, as well as the students themselves and representatives of student trade unions. Now there has appeared in the structure of the city's executive authority an agency that has received the right to prepare drafts of decrees for the St. Petersburg government with regard to student youth problems. According to tentative information, Vitaliy Mutko, deputy chairman of the St. Petersburg government, is supposed to allocate from the fund for the social protection of the city's population more than 900 million rubles for 1994 in order to render assistance to the most needy categories of students. At the next commission session, on 27 April of this year, there will be a discussion of the procedure for paying grants in aid to the most unprotected categories of students.
