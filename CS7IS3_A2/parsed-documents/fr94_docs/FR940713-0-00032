FR940713-0-00032 FR940713-0-00015 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY 44 CFR Part 362 RIN 3067&hyph;AB84 National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program; Criteria for Acceptance of Gifts, Bequests, or Services AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule establishes criteria for determining whether the Director of FEMA may accept gifts, bequests or donations of services, money or property for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). EFFECTIVE DATE: August 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Summers Taylor, Mitigation Directorate, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;3079. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA or Agency) published a proposed rule, ``National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program; Criteria for Acceptance of Gifts, Bequests, or Services,'' on July 9, 1992, 57 FR 30455. Comments from the public were invited but, since publication, none have been received. The Agency is now publishing the final rule with minor editorial changes in the preamble. Under 31 U.S.C. 1342, officers and employees of the United States Government may not accept voluntary services or employ personal services exceeding those authorized by law except for emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property. Unless expressly authorized by law to do so, Federal officers and employees may not accept gifts or bequests of property or money. The general rule is that appropriations may not be augmented with funds or property from private sources unless specifically authorized by law. Under section 9 of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, 42 U.S.C. 7705c, the Director of FEMA may accept and use bequests, gifts, or donations of services, money or property. Section 9(b) of the Act requires the Director to establish by regulation criteria for accepting such bequests, gifts, or donations, and to take into consideration the impact of such acceptance on the Director's ability to conduct business fairly and objectively, or its impact on the integrity of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP). This authority is similar to that granted by other statutes to other agencies in the NEHRP and the Federal Government. These regulations establish the required criteria for determining whether to accept bequests, gifts, or donations of services, money or property to further the purposes of the NEHRP. National Environmental Policy Act. This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements for environmental assessments of 44 C.F.R. part 10, Environmental Consideration. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared. Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., because the rule states how FEMA will administer acceptance of gifts, bequests, or services, defines the criteria for acceptance of gifts, bequests, or services to the National earthquake Hazards Reduction Program, and is not expected (1) to have significant secondary or incidental effects on a substantial number of small entities, nor (2) to create any additional burden on small entities. Regulatory Planning and Review. This rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 of September 30, 1994, Regulatory Planning and Review, 58 FR 51735. To the extent possible this final rule adheres to the principles of regulation as set forth in Executive Order 12866. Paperwork Reduction Act. This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. Executive Order 12612, Federalism. This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, dated October 26, 1987. Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778. List of Subjects in 44 CFR Part 362 Disaster assistance, Earthquakes, Government property.
