This was stated by Grigoriy Karasin, director of the information and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, at a briefing today. He noted that Russia views with deep concern recent events in Afghanistan, the flaring up of armed clashes in Kabul and in the north of the country which have already caused numerous casualties, including among the civilian population. It is evident that such a development can only further intensify the polarization of the forces in Afghan society, make the prospects for restoring peace in Afghanistan even more remote, and seriously complicate the situation on the southern frontier of the CIS and in the region as whole, the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed. Together with other states and the United Nations, Russia is prepared to assist the process of achieving an Afghan settlement. Grigoriy Karasin said getting such a settlement going and furthering it would correspond to the common interests of the whole of the international community.
