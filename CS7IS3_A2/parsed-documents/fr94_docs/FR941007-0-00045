The USEPA, at this time, is also approving the incorporation of permitting rules recodified as Article 2. Permit Review Rules of 326 IAC into the SIP to replace APC 19 which was incorporated into the Indiana SIP at 40 CFR 52.770 (c)(24). (i) Incorporation by reference. (A) Amendments to Title 326 IAC 2&hyph;1&hyph;1, 2&hyph;1&hyph;2, 2&hyph;1&hyph;3, 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, 2&hyph;3&hyph;2, 2&hyph;3&hyph;3, and 2&hyph;3&hyph;5.

Section 52.773 is amended by revising paragraph (i) to read as follows: §52.773 Approval status. * * * * * (i) The Administrator finds that Indiana's ozone plan for Lake and Porter Counties, which was required to be submitted by July 1, 1992, does not satisfy all the requirements of part D, title 1 of the Clean Air Act and, thus, is disapproved. See §§52.770(c)(69)and 52.770(d). The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain approved. * * * * * 4. Section 52.777 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to read as follows: §52.777 Control strategy: Photochemical oxidants (hydrocarbons). * * * * * (d) Part D_Disapproval. The 1982 Indiana plan for Lake and Porter County is disapproved because it does not assure the attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS there. See §§52.770(c)(69) and 52.773(i). The disapproval does not affect USEPA's approval (or conditional approval) of individual parts of Indiana's ozone plan and they remain approved. 5. Section 52.780 is amended by adding paragraph (h) to read as follows: §52.780 Review of new sources and modifications. * * * * * (h) On March 7, 1994, Indiana requested a revision to the State Implementation Plan (SIP) for New Source Review (NSR) to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The Indiana 326 IAC regulations do not include a definition of ``federally enforceable''. On July 13, 1994, Pamela Carter, Attorney General of the State of Indiana, sent a letter to USEPA clarifying Indiana's interpretation of the definition of federally enforceable. The letter states that federally enforceable, e.g. as used in 326 IAC 2&hyph;3&hyph;1, should be interpreted in accordance with the federal definition at 40 CFR 51.165(a)(1)(xiv). The USEPA took the opportunity of rulemaking on the State's submittal to recodify the permitting SIP to conform to Title 326 the Indiana Administrative Code.
