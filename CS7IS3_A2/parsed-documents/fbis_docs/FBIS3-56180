Having a hand in its creation were such organizations as the Russian Orthodox Church; the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Towns of Russia; the Russian Union of Self-Government; three cultural funds headed by Nikita Mikhalkov, Aleksandr Krutov, and Vyacheslav Klykov; and the Agrarian Union, provincial commercial structures, and so forth. Besides, the revived Zemstvo movement counts on assistance from the heads of administrations, noteworthy among whom is Nizhniy Novgorod Governor Boris Nemtsov, and help from experts such as Aleksandr Tsipko and Valeriy Zorkin. Although the movement was not active in the recent parliamentary elections, according to an RZM spokesman, some 50 percent of State Duma deputies, especially in the Democratic Party of Russia faction, share Zemstvo supporters' views. The fundamental objectives of the movement are the "revival of moral and spiritual foundations of Russian society and restoration of this country's traditions of organization of power and the state." In the opinion of RZM Chairwoman Yelena Panina, the key areas of activity at this stage should be a quantitative and qualitative expansion of the movement, and the evolvement of a concept for reforming local administration. According to Mrs. Panina, the best model for a system of local administration that could not only fill the vacuum of power but that would also be organic for Russia, would be a combination of Zemstvo structures and the organs of government administration. The draft text of a law on so-called Zemstvo Reform prepared by experts of the movement should be submitted for scrutiny in the Duma. In addition, specific programs are being evolved aimed at solving ecological and educational problems, the development of small and medium-sized businesses. Speaking before journalists, Yelena Panina outlined things that are supposed to form the "object of thoughts and work of not only Zemstvo supporters, but also of all the other nationally thinking people." In her opinion, this is a rallying of public forces on the basis of the revival of traditional Russian spirituality and healthy patriotic, rather than nationalist, ideas. According to Mrs. Panina, RZM initiatives are meeting with understanding of Boris Yeltsin, with whom leaders of the movement had a two-hour discussion, and with understanding of members of the president's staff, with whom fruitful cooperation has been established. Zemstvo supporters are hoping to come to terms with the prime minister as well. Although RZM proposals on a local government reform are not likely to be taken up adequately by the Federal Assembly, the movement, which has structures in 72 regions of Russia, would be able to influence in no small way the course of elections to local bodies of power.
