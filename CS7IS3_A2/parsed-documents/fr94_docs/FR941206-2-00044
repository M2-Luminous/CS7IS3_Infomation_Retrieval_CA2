These 65 parties collectively have agreed to pay $3,930,469.96 subject to the contingency that EPA may elect not to complete the settlement if comments received from the public during this comment period disclose facts or considerations which indicate the proposed settlement is inappropriate, improper, or inadequate. Money collected from de minimis parties will be used for past response costs incurred at or in connection with the Site, projected future response costs to be incurred at or in connection with the Site, and includes a premium to cover the risk that unknown conditions are discovered or information previously unknown to EPA is received. EPA is entering into this agreement under the authority of sections 122(g) and 107 of CERCLA. Section 122(g) authorizes early settlements with de minimis parties to allow them to resolve their liabilities at Superfund Sites without incurring substantial transaction costs. Under this authority, EPA proposes to settle with a number of potentially responsible parties at the Eastern Diversified Superfund Site, each of whom is responsible for less than four percent of the volume of hazardous substance disposed of at the Site. EPA issued a draft settlement proposal on June 6, 1994, invited comments and challenges to the volumetric ranking. On July 29, 1994, EPA issued a final settlement proposal embodied in the Administrative Order on Consent which included several modifications made in response to comments by de minimis parties in letters to EPA and during negotiations with the Agency. The proposed settlement reflects and was agreed upon based on conditions known to parties on July 29, 1994. De minimis settling parties will be required to pay their volumetric share of the Government's past response costs and the estimated future response costs at the Eastern Diversified Metals Site excluding any federal claims for natural resource damages or any State claims. The settlement as it is now proposed includes an adjustment to the volumetric share of an eligible de minimis party; this adjustment was made after the final settlement proposal was sent to all eligible parties on July 29, 1994, in response to additional evidence provided by this party or discovered by EPA. The party affected is Schiavone-Bonomo, a/k/a Schiavone-Bros. The Environmental Protection Agency will receive written comments relating to this Agreement for thirty (30) days from the date of publication of this Notice. A copy of the proposed Administrative Order on Consent may be obtained from Harry R. Steinmetz (3HW11) in EPA's Region III Office, 841 Chestnut Building, Philadelphia, PA 19107, (telephone: 215/597&hyph;1192). Stanley Laskowski, Acting Regional Administrator, Region III.
