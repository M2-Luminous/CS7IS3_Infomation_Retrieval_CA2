This committee will make use of innovative means to increase economic relations -- specifically, in the granting of credits, on the Spanish side -- and the diversification of areas in which permission for investments are granted in Cuba, including mixed enterprises. [passage omitted] The bilateral committee is responsible for establishing the path of trade between the two countries. Tonight the committee has come out in favor of intervening in the balancing of the internal finances of our country. In our opinion, the response of our entrepreneurs should be greater imagination and aggressiveness.
