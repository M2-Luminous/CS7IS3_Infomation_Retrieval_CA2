In a statement released today, the Arab League said it is afraid that this might be interpreted as an acknowledgement of Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. It emphasized the special standing Jerusalem enjoys in the Arab and Islamic worlds. The following is the Arab League's statement today on the recent agreement between the Vatican and Israel on diplomatic recognition between the two countries: Although it regards establishing diplomatic ties and signing agreements between states as a their right to sovereignty, the Arab League General Secretariat believes that such agreements should not ignore international legitimacy resolutions or (?cause) injustice to third parties' inalienable and legitimate rights. In this respect, the League's general secretariat is eager to recall Jerusalem's special standing in the Arab and Islamic worlds, an established fact that has been asserted by the Arab League's numerous resolutions on all levels. Regarding the provision in the agreement between the Vatican and Israel to respect the de facto situation of the holy places in the occupied territories, the Arab League secretariat general expresses its extreme concern lest this would be interpreted as recognition of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territory. If we take into consideration that the Vatican has always adopted a firm stand consistent with the resolutions of the United Nations and international legitimacy on the question of rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the holy city and not changing its historic and cultural status, this new position demands that we emphasize our eagerness that this should not affect the status of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is an extremely sensitive issue for all the believers in the world. There is no doubt that based on its long history, which has been characterized by objectivity and fairness regarding the issue of Jerusalem, the Vatican will take all these factors into consideration so that peace and stability can be restored in the city of peace so it can remain a glowing symbol of coexistence and tolerance among the heavenly religions.
