The court sentenced Yoshio Nagano, 52, to 18 months imprisonment with four years' suspension and a 5 million yen fine, and Kiichiro Hara, 51, to one year imprisonment suspended for three years and a 3 million yen fine. The two previously led political groups for LDP House of Representatives member Akira Amari. From 1989 to 1991, they submitted to the Kanagawa Prefecture Election Monitoring Committee reports of donations 10 times greater than those actually received. According to the accounts, the men received tax refunds and evaded some 68 million yen in taxes. Judge Hiroshi Akiyama said, "their criminal liabilities are serious since they established the political groups for the purpose of tax evasion by making unlawful use of the (state's) tax rebate system."
