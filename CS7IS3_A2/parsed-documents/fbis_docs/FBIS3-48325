Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), was referring to options facing Hosokawa in the wake of his failure Friday to push a package of political reform bills through the House of Councillors. He told a news conference that both the ruling and opposition parties should join forces to realize political reforms "with wide perspectives." Hiraiwa said the worst choice would be to dissolve the Diet and call a general election because the ensuing political vacuum would damage the economy. Prolonged political uncertainty will worsen the economic situation further as reflected in the steep fall in the value of the yen and stock prices, he said. Hiraiwa called on Hosokawa to display leadership in promoting political reforms.
