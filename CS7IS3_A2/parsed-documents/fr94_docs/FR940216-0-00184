FR940216-0-00184 FR940216-0-00010 (2) The model given in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be effective from January 1, 1995 through December 31, 1997, unless extended by action of the Administrator. §§80.43&hyph;80.44 [Reserved] §80.45 Complex emissions model. (a) Definition of terms. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: Target fuel=The fuel which is being evaluated for its emissions performance using the complex model OXY=Oxygen content of the target fuel in terms of weight percent SUL=Sulfur content of the target fuel in terms of parts per million by weight RVP=Reid Vapor Pressure of the target fuel in terms of pounds per square inch E200=200 ○F distillation fraction of the target fuel in terms of volume percent E300=300 ○F distillation fraction of the target fuel in terms of volume percent ARO=Aromatics content of the target fuel in terms of volume percent BEN=Benzene content of the target fuel in terms of volume percent OLE=Olefins content of the target fuel in terms of volume percent MTB=Methyl tertiary butyl ether content of the target fuel in terms of weight percent oxygen ETB=Ethyl tertiary butyl ether content of the target fuel in terms of weight percent oxygen TAM=Tertiary amyl methyl ether content of the target fuel in terms of weight percent oxygen ETH=Ethanol content of the target fuel in terms of weight percent oxygen exp=The function that raises the number e (the base of the natural logarithm) to the power in its domain Phase I=The years 1995&hyph;1999 Phase II=Year 2000 and beyond (b) Weightings and baselines for the complex model. (1) The weightings for normal and higher emitters (w 1 and w 2 , respectively) given in Table 1 shall be used to calculate the exhaust emission performance of any fuel for the appropriate pollutant and Phase: Table 1._ Normal and Higher Emitter Weightings for Exhaust Emissions 1␣ 1Phase I 2VOC & toxics 2NO X 1Phase II 2VOC & toxics 2NO X Normal Emitters (w 1 ) 0.52 0.82 0.444 0.738 Higher Emitters (w 2 ) 0.48 0.18 0.556 0.262 (2) The following properties of the baseline fuels shall be used when determining baseline mass emissions of the various pollutants: Table 2._ Summer and Winter Baseline Fuel Properties 1Fuel property 1Summer 1Winter Oxygen (wt %) 0.0 0.0 Sulfur (ppm) 339 338 RVP (psi) 8.7 11.5 E200 (%) 41.0 50.0 E300 (%) 83.0 83.0 Aromatics (vol %) 32.0 26.4 Olefins (vol %) 9.2 11.9 Benzene (vol %) 1.53 1.64 (3) The baseline mass emissions for VOC, NO X and toxics given in Tables 3, 4 and 5 of this paragraph (b)(3) shall be used in conjunction with the complex model during the appropriate Phase and season:
