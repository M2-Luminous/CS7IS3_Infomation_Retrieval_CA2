FBIS4-34719 "drlat121_l_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-121 Daily Report 11 Jun 1994 Bolivia Justices To Appeal Sentence Before Human Rights Court Justices To Appeal Sentence Before Human Rights Court PY2306012694 La Paz PRESENCIA in Spanish 11 Jun 94 p 5 PY2306012694 La Paz PRESENCIA Spanish BFN [Excerpt] Edgar Oblitas Fernandez and Ernesto Poppe Subieta, who will today hear the sentence of their impeachment in Congress, yesterday announced an international campaign to file a request for their acquittal before the San Jose de Costa Rica Human Rights Court. During a news conference the Supreme Court justices asserted that a struggle for the "dignity and complete independence of the judicial branch" has begun, and at the same time they accepted "serving their imprisonment sentences [as published] humbly, in the certainty of winning awareness in the Bolivian court." The justices, tried by the national Congress' Special Court, were yesterday feted and honored by the La Paz District Court alternate members, judges, and administrative personnel in a simple ceremony that ended in a news conference. Both Oblitas and Poppe admitted this was the last public event they would attend in their capacity as justices, as they announced that the government has decided to sentence them to the highest penalty established by the Impeachment Law that is sponsored by the U.S. Embassy. Oblitas said: "The justices and their lawyers have shown the country, irrefutably and clearly, that neither of the two have committed any crime, and that this is an irrational impeachment seeking only to replace the Supreme Court justices with subservient justices who will obey the government's orders."
