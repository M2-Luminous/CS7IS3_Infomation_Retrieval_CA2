Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, addressing the ceremony, said many people in Russia were today pinning their hopes on the accord. "We have all witnessed the completion of an important stage of a nationwide endeavor to achieve social conciliation on the most burning and acute problems," he said. "The Civic Accord meets the main task, a search for civilized methods, a comparison of various views and principles and conflicting ideas of how we should further develop the society and economy of Russia," all of which should be done without "political confrontation," Chernomyrdin continued. He paid special attention to section two of the document, proposing ways to overcome the current social and economic crisis. Beside setting general goals, the section declares economic stabilization to be the shared responsibility of the legislative and executive branches of authority, the industrialists, business and trade unions, the prime minister said. He pointed out the fact that the signatories of the accord included prominent bankers. Stabilization would largely depend on their ability to satisfy the economy's "investment hunger," he said. Chernomyrdin said it was particularly important to provide normal market conditions for agriculture. But those problems should be tackled jointly with those who actually work in the fields and are building new economic relations in agriculture, he said. "The government will keep its promise to the rural population: it will support their work within reasonable and possible limits," the premier said. He said the government had also pledged to make it easier for farmers to exercise their property rights, to provide normal conditions for competition, and to draw up a taxation system that would stimulate production. The country is still deep in crisis, "but we can already feel solid ground under our feet. Now we must move on. For that the country needs the perseverance and conscientious work of every member of society. We can't afford to have a flabby state," the prime minister said. The Civic Accord had brought national conciliation nearer, he said. What is important now is to create an effective mechanism to make it work, for instance permanent high-level consultations between various governmental bodies and political and public organizations, Chernomyrdin said. He called the Civic Accord a good remedy for the "civil war syndrome," in economics as well as in politics.
