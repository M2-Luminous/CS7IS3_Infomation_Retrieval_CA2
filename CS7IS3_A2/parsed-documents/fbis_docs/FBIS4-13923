Can your federation be held responsible for the results of the demonstration under the current conditions in the country? [Abu-Rizq] The government alone is responsible for such dangers because the government's failure to implement the agreement it ratified during the cabinet meeting is the cause of this demonstration. The government signed an agreement granting workers in both the public and private sectors their basic rights. However, the government's failure to implement this agreement has forced the General Labor Federation to resort to its legitimate right to stage demonstrations. This right is supported by human rights, the Lebanese Constitution, and international laws. The government alone will be responsible for anything that might occur during the demonstration or for banning the demonstration. If the government does not want to see security disturbances it must implement the agreement that was reached five months ago. If it does, there will be no demonstration. As long as the government fails to implement the agreement the demonstration will take place.
