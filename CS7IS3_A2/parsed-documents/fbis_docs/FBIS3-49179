[passage omitted] Answering a journalist's question, Mr. Geoana referred to certain aspects of Romanian-Hungarian relations: [Begin Geoana recording] The statement made last week by Gyula Horn is well known. He said -- and I am trying to summarize his words -- that if the party he is leading wins the general elections that are to be held during this year's spring in Hungary and a government is set up in which Mr. Horn's party held the majority, that would mean a historic turn in relations between Romania and Hungary and, generally, between Hungary and its neighboring countries. We believe that the issue of the relations between Romania and Hungary is an issue of national interest and we believe that the relaunching of those ties is an absolutely vital need for the establishment of a stable situation in this region. We also believe that it is an absolutely necessary precondition for the two countries' integration within Euro-Atlantic structures and that goal is more important than any circumstantial political issue and therefore it should be in the center of attention of any [Hungarian] government, regardless of its political orientation. I also have to say that the Mr. Horn's statement was received by us with great satisfaction, as it is quite obvious that in the Hungarian political life they have realized the importance of normalizing ties with Romania. We believe that a similar thing is currently happening in Romania as well. [end Geoana recording]
