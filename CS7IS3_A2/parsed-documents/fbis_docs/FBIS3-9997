"It would not be surprising. The U.S. has clearly shown it does not intend to exert further pressure on the military. It has never sought to corner them," the official told an international news agency. The UN Security Council decided to apply an oil and arms embargo against Haiti last October in order to force the military officers who toppled Aristide with a coup d'etat in 1991 to return to the democratic system. "Pressure exerted on the Dominican Republic reportedly worsened the effects of the embargo; instead, they are seeking that Aristide share power with the coupists and decree an amnesty for the offenses perpetrated these last 28 months," the source noted. The lack of controls on the Dominican border allows entry into the country of sufficient oil so that traffic is nearly normal. After conducting a study of the northern part of the border between both nations, the Justice and Peace Human Rights Commission of the Catholic Church reported that more than 66,000 gallons of gasoline are brought daily into Haiti with the complicity of Dominican soldiers. In Haiti, this "illegal" traffic is totally controlled by the military, who obtain revenues of 20,625 gourdes, some $7,392, for each truck transporting hydrocarbons. The Justice and Peace Commission regretted that these open violations are not sanctioned by the United Nations. Meanwhile, parliamentarians opposed to the return of Aristide to this Caribbean island denied Monday that they want to install a new government. They termed this information on the issue as "rumors." Senator Bernard Sansaricq, spokesman for this group, declared last week that "all the institutions are ready to support the Parliament's initiative to install a new junta, only pending the persons who will form it. The Army cannot play that card; it has not received the green light from the United States," a source close to the military commented. The group of anti-Aristide lawmakers, who staged "a coup d'etat" against the Senate's Board of Directors, announced last week the visit of Army Chief General Raoul Cedras to the Parliament to take the opportunity to present the new government. Despite having waited in vain for Cedras, who according to sources close to the Parliament supported this initiative in the beginning, Sansaricq would insist on Monday that a new administration be named. Meanwhile, the U.S. Coast Guard today repatriated 141 Haitian -- boat people [preceding two words in English] -- who tried to reach Florida, United States, in boats. Officials of the local Red Cross announced that 40 more Haitians will be repatriated tomorrow.
