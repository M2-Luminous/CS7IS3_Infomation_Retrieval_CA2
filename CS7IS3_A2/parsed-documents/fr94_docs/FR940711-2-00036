Refunds to eligible purchasers would be based on the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased and the degree to which they can demonstrate injury.

Comments should be submitted within 30 days of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , and should be sent to the address set forth at the beginning of this notice.
