This is an old dream of this eastern region. Several tests have been conducted, and the specialists say that, except for the town of Buey Arriba, the signal reaches every municipality in the province strongly. Certain antennas have been rotated and others installed, making it possible to broadcast the signal from the center of Bayamo. Efforts to have a television station in Granma Province, though optimistic, have not yet borne fruit, since most of the equipment, which comes from abroad, is lacking. Those of you who have seen this signal on your television set may find it interesting to know that it was broadcast using this Television Serrana cassette player or the videotape recorder from the office of the NTV correspondent. Work is under way with a view to organizing a first, weekly, 30-minute program, which will of course be broadcast employing the minimal equipment we mentioned. Also, the effort made by the Communications Ministry makes it possible for Granma Province to receive the signal from Holguin's (Tele Cristal) with top quality.
