In an interview with NBC April 10, Christopher, setting a deadline for the DPRK, told that "the diplomatic pressure on North Korea will give way to a more severe approach, with even a preemptive military strike not ruled out", unless the DPRK positively reacts to their one-sided and unjustifiable demand until that time. U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry, too, in an interview with NBC April 3 openly blared that "a preemptive military strike at North Korea will not be ruled out" and they were ready to risk a war. Such war blasts ringing out continuously from among the U.S. high-ranking officials clearly show that the very one who seeks to provoke a war on the Korean peninsula is none other than the United States.
