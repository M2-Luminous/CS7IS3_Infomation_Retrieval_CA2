FR941206-1-00010 FR941206-1-00001 FSIS's tentative consideration in the March 1994 ANPR was to define and standardize certain mechanically separated poultry by concentrating on the product characteristics that the Agency believes distinguishes this product from poultry produced by traditional deboning methods, i.e., hand-deboning. A different way of defining and standardizing this product based on starting materials was suggested by one commenter. It was suggested that a certain type of statistical analysis (factorial analysis) be performed in order to identify a relationship between percent bone solids content and types of starting materials used to manufacture mechanically separated poultry. By suggesting this type of statistical analysis, the commenter supported a procedure for establishing a standard that would account for the materials used, and percent bone solids content limits would vary by the processing procedure employed by the processor. However, it was never the intention of the March 1994 ANPR to suggest possibly defining and standardizing mechanically separated poultry by starting materials used. The data collected by FSIS in 1993 and used in the report previously cited, came from industry records. Information was collected on starting materials but not on the percentages of use nor on processing parameters, e.g., pressures, settings, used during processing. Thus, data could not be used for establishing process control parameters or for determining the relationship between bone solids content and other product characteristics, the materials used, and processing parameters employed by establishments in the study. The purpose of collecting the data was to examine the levels of bone solids in mechanically separated poultry produced today, and to get an idea of the variability of the percentage of bone solids contents within an establishment. Information on starting materials was collected to ensure that the sample of establishments represented the different types of materials used to manufacture mechanically separated poultry. If in establishing standards for the product, the Agency had intended to use explicit starting materials to manufacture poultry product produced by mechanical separation, then more data would need to be collected under known or controlled conditions. FSIS believes that any standard established for mechanically separated poultry should not preclude a manufacturer from using any type of starting materials so long as the requirements of the standard are satisfied. Further, in response to comments about the application of an acceptable tolerance for meeting bone solids content criteria based on statistical variation, FSIS agrees that the establishment of such a tolerance should be considered. However, because this issue requires indepth technical review, FSIS will consider it for possible rulemaking in the future. B. Handling Requirements. The tentative position presented in the March 1994 ANPR indicated that FSIS was tentatively considering that starting material to be processed into poultry product produced by mechanical separation be processed into this product within 2 hours from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40 ○ F (4 ○ C) or less, or held indefinitely at 0 ○ F (^18 ○ C) or less. Additionally, the ANPR indicated that FSIS was considering proposing that mechanically separated poultry be chilled to 40 ○ F (4 ○ C) or less within 2 hours of the mechanical deboning operation, or frozen at 0 ○ F (^18 ○ C) or less, or cooked. Furthermore, it was indicated that FSIS was considering proposing that such product be used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat food product directly after being processed, except that it might be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at 40 ○ F (4 ○ C) or less or indefinitely at 0 ○ F (^18 ○ C) or less. Twenty-seven commenters addressed the issue of handling requirements for poultry products produced by mechanical separation. All of the commenters disagreed with the need for handling requirements and, specifically, the need for a time constraint by which the raw material used to manufacture poultry product produced by mechanical separation has to be processed into such product. Commenters stated that chicken can be held for varying times and still be safe depending on manufacturing practices, and that the raw materials used need to be organoleptically evaluated and not set up on a time schedule, i.e., processed within 72 hours. The commenters also stated that there are already adequate regulations on handling and storage, and any additional handling requirements should be handled in a more inclusive way, e.g., as part of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) effort. FSIS believes that handling requirements are necessary to produce a safe and wholesome product, and that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. FSIS believes that it is the manufacturer's responsibility, in concert with FSIS', to assure that wholesome materials are used in the manufacture of its product within sound timeframes, and the safety of such product is not negatively affected.
