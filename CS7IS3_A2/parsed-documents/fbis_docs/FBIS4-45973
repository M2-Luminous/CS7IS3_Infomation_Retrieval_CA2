In a message sent to North Korea early this morning, the IAEA reminded North Korea that the deadline for submitting a report to the UN Security Council is approaching, and stated that even though the inspection on the replacement of fuel rods has been delayed considerably, it will send an inspection team around this weekend if North Korea accepts the IAEA proposal by this week. The IAEA expects North Korea to show a positive response this week or early next week depending on the result of the recent contacts with the United States. However, in case North Korea shows a negative response, including the replacement of nuclear fuel on its own, the IAEA's position is that a report to the UN Security Council will be inevitable.
