(Shinichiro Torii, president) has succeeded in greatly increasing antibody production capability by combining serum globulin and an artificial vaccine, which poses no danger of infection but does little on its own to stimulate antibody production. When researchers tried to produce antibodies against the AIDS virus in mice, they found that not only did antibody production begin rapidly, but the amount produced was double that produced by previous methods. This discovery brings us one step closer to creation of an AIDS vaccine. This method is expected to be effective in the case of other diseases such as malaria for which vaccines have not yet been developed. The artificial vaccine is called a peptide vaccine, and it consists of many artificially synthesized antigenic amino acid sequences from proteins on the surface of the virus. This kind of vaccine is different from a vaccine in which the virus has been attenuated, so although the peptide vaccine poses no danger of infection, it is very small as vaccines go, and the white blood cells (macrophages) that produce antibodies do not readily take it up. Therefore, it is not effective in stimulating antibody production and its practical application has been delayed. Professor Ikai and researchers from Suntory made use of the fact that macrophages easily take up _a_2-macroglobulin (_a_2M), a serum globulin, so they combined the peptide vaccine with _a_2M to solve the problem. _a_2M is a serum globulin that binds to receptors on the macrophage surface. The researchers used _a_2M purified from human blood. Suntory researchers synthesized a peptide sequence of 23 amino acids that plays a major role in infection by the AIDS virus, and they used this to make the vaccine. When researchers repeatedly injected mice with the vaccine and checked the amount of antibody production after three weeks, they found that although the peptide alone hardly caused any antibody production, when it was linked to _a_2M the effect was dramatic, and the mice produced twice the amount as previous methods that do spur antibody production but require the use of toxic, oil-based adjuvants. Combining the artificial vaccine with _a_2M increases its rate of uptake by macrophages roughly fifty times, which also greatly shortens the time before antibody production begins. Vaccines in general use are made with attenuated virus. They stimulate high antibody production, but because the major genes of the virus still remain, there is always a chance of infection, which means they cannot be used for an AIDS vaccine. With the artificial vaccine there is no fear of infection, and safety will be enhanced even more if the essential portion of the _a_2M is also synthesized.
