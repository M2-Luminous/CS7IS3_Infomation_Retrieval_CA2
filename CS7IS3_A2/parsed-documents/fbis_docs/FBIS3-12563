The party's Foreign Relations Office has cabled the United Nations secretary general, the Arab League secretary general, Amnesty International, the EU president, the secretary general of the Islamic countries organization, his holiness the pope, and the president of Socialist International. The cable said: We cabled you a few days ago condemning the Zionists' horrendous massacre at the al-Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. Today, we cable you to condemn another massacre perpetrated by the same hand against innocent worshipers in Sayyidat al-Najat Church in Zuq, Lebanon. These and many previous massacres confirm the nature of Zionism and require us all to reconsider some UN resolutions that acquitted Zionism and (?overlooked) its past and present. We urge international and regional institutions, all human rights organizations, and all countries and parties to adopt immediate, courageous positions against this barbaric racism, which denies every human right and threatens world peace if its interests are not served.
