Take notice that on May 17, 1994, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets: Proposed to be Effective June 1, 1993 3rd Sub Original Sheet No. 634. Proposed to be Effective October 1, 1993 2nd Sub First Revised Sheet No. 633. Proposed to be Effective October 3, 1993 2nd Sub Second Revised Sheet No. 633. Proposed to be Effective November 1, 1993 2nd Sub Forth Revised Sheet No. 633. Texas Eastern states that on February 14, 1994 in Docket No. RP94&hyph;135&hyph;000 (February 14 filing), Texas Eastern filed tariff sheets as part of its General Terms and Conditions to clarify that certain incremental services are not subject to the ASA provision and to further clarify the definition of ``Applicable Shrinkage Percentages''. In addition, Rate Schedules LLFT, LLIT, VKFT and VKIT were eliminated from the listing of ASA Rate Schedules. The Commission's March 16, 1994 Order in Docket No. RP94&hyph;135&hyph;000 rejected as premature, those sheets in the February 14 filing reflecting the above-mentioned clarifications. Texas Eastern states that on January 31, 1994, Texas Eastern filed a comprehensive stipulation and agreement in the above-referenced dockets to resolve all of Texas Eastern's Order No. 636 transition costs issues and an array of related issues in numerous separate ongoing proceedings of which Docket No. RP94&hyph;135&hyph;000 is included (Settlement). Pursuant to Ordering Paragraph (C) of the May 12 Order approving the Settlement, Texas Eastern hereby submits these sheets to reflect the identical clarifications as set forth in the February 14 filing. Texas Eastern states that copies of its filing have been served on all firm customers and interested state commissions. Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before May 27, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on a file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
