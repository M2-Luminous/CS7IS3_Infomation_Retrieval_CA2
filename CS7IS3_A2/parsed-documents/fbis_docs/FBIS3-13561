Muhyi-al-Din Nimr, the spokesman of the Chamber of Commerce, told our correspondent Moti Amir that the dignitaries asked the officers to lift the curfew on the city and to allow the residents to return to work and resume normal life. According to Nimr, Major General Shahaq voiced his sorrow over the massacre in Hebron, and said he knew that the enemies of peace had become stronger as a result of this deed. Shahaq pointed out that after the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement it will also be Hebron's turn to attain Palestinian self-rule. The dignitaries asked the IDF officers to reduce the friction between IDF troops and the local population in order to avert confrontations and riots once the curfew is lifted.
