Attempting to disarticulate and analyze in the stream of reports from Ankara, Baku, and other information centers, the key phrases concerning G. Aliyev's visit to Turkey, one succumbs, frankly speaking, to a certain confusion in connection with how soon the present president of Azerbaijan, who came to power as "Moscow's man" and who was perceived as such overseas (we recall the sharply negative reaction of both Turkey and Washington to Elchibey's ouster), has gone over to the other side, so to speak. "Turkey is the friendly, fraternal country closest to Azerbaijan." "We are one people," this statesman, who in his speeches on his assumption of office almost never mentioned Turkey, increasingly emphasizing the age-old productive ties of Azerbaijan and Russia and, in particular, his, Geydar Aliyev's, outstanding role in the strengthening and development of these relations, now declares. In order, obviously, to compensate for the undesirable impression that had arisen in connection with Azerbaijan's membership of the CIS and to emphasize the insignificance and "innocuousness" of this fact, G. Aliyev declared: "Unfortunately, certain forces are in Turkey currently spreading various inventions concerning Azerbaijan and its development along the path of independence. I, as president of Azerbaijan, assure you that no force can deprive our state of independence." Even a certain arrogance and open disregard for the opinion and interests of Russia are appearing in Mr. Aliyev's tone. Here are some words from his interview with Turkish correspondent Adnan Advan. Correspondent: The Friendship [words illegible], and Cooperation Treaty includes an article which points out that if one party is the victim of aggression, the other will adopt measures against the aggressor. What do you think, will this evoke a negative response from Russia? G. Aliyev: If we have, indeed, appended our signatures to these documents, we must remain true to them. The same approach has been demonstrated in purely economic matters affecting Russia's vital interests in the Caucasus region. "I have no doubt that an oil pipeline will pass through Turkey," G. Aliyev says, as though specially teasing, knowing full well that this question cannot leave Moscow indifferent. The impression that Geydar Aliyev has in his old age embarked upon a dangerous playing with fire is strengthened particularly when you read his off-hand statement: "Let them recognize that the Caucasus was previously part of a great empire." Although this appeal applies to an equal extent to both Turkey and Russia, it would seem, it is easy to understand which empire he is talking about. In Mr. Aliyev's opinion, the time has now come when we need to recall the bygone words of Kemal Ataturk: "The Soviet Union is today our friend, neighbor, and ally. We need this friendship. But no one can now foresee what will happen tomorrow. We could find ourselves broken up like the Ottomans, broken up like Austro-Hungary. Nations that are now held together by a strong hand could tomorrow be scattered. The world balance could change. And Turkey should know what to do in this case. This friend of ours is ruling our brothers, to whom we are bound by a common language and religion and with whom we are one in essence. We must be prepared to take them under our protection. Not silently wait for this day but be prepared for it." Comment would be superfluous, as they say. On the other hand, G. Aliyev gave the assurance in the course of his visit to Turkey that the war (in Karabakh) could not go on for long. But unless this was the most artless propaganda move aimed at attracting potential Turkish investors in the economy of Azerbaijan, what kind of resolution of the Karabakh conflict, we would like to know, has he in mind here. After all, by the time of his visit it had become perfectly obvious that, despite the country's drastic militarization, he has not succeeded in achieving the promised military victory at the fronts--even limited, even symbolic--and the shadow of the new (and, perhaps, also the old) Suret Guseynov obviously prevents him presenting constructive proposals. Perhaps there is something else also. In any event, no fundamentally new features in Azerbaijan's quite rigid position have been observed as of late at all. It is appropriate to note in this connection, for example, that at the recent conference in Moscow, "Interethnic Conflicts on the Territory of Russia and Countries of the Near Abroad," Mr. Rizayev, ambassador of the Azerbaijan Republic in Russia, returning to the sources of the Karabakh conflict, reiterated the depressing catalogue of charges, which set the teeth on edge, against the notorious Armenian nationalists, the notorious Armenian mafia, and the notorious center, not having ascertained a single Azerbaijani factor here, so to speak. In spite of the actual facts and documents formerly confirmed by the Azerbaijani side itself, the ambassador of the Azerbaijan Republic maintained that the socioeconomic position of Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was higher even than in Armenia and Azerbaijan and that the change in the demographic situation in Karabakh (and, obviously, in Nakhichevan, where there were hardly any Armenians left long before the Karabakh events) was explained by the fact that the Armenians are a very talented people and that for this reason they yearn for space and big cities, where they may realize their outstanding capabilities. What is typical here is that the Azerbaijani side never offers any versions of a comprehensive solution of the Karabakh problem, always constructing its protests entirely on accusations and demands for the unconditional liberation of the occupied territories. What kind of constructive approach is this? Of course, the speech at some conference even of an official with the rank of ambassador of a sovereign state could ultimately be considered merely his personal opinion, did this viewpoint not correlate right down to trifling details with the position of Azerbaijani delegations at negotiations of all levels--from exclusively social through the highest political. In this light we have no choice but to think that Azerbaijan remains a convinced supporter of a military solution of the conflict. This is really very disheartening because very many people had connected with the assumption of office in Azerbaijan of the quite experienced and politically astute Geydar Aliyev the hope that Baku would not need additional senseless casualties for it to finally recognize present-day realities. But, as we can see, youthful ardor is sometimes manifested even in people of a ripe old age. And at the most inappropriate moment, as a rule. Familiarizing oneself with the words of G. Aliyev, it is hard to escape the impression that the elderly figure, who has tried out everything in his time, is now simply entertained by the mere possibility of playing near the end at "the collapse of great empires." Or their reconstruction, which is equally dangerous. And, what is most distressing, not for their ill-starred architects but for the unfortunate peoples rashly entrusting their fate to them.
