Inspector Jurkevicius heads the Defense Ministry's dangerous cargo transportation division and is authorized to issue or to deny permissions for Russian military transit. On Tuesday, he instructed Lithuanian railroad officials to stop a Russian train with around 30 armored personnel carriers, which were escorted by four armed Russian soldiers. The train was allowed to enter Lithuanian territory from the Kaliningrad region late Tuesday when 17 flatcars with military equipment were disconnected. The leadership of the Russian troops stationed in Kaliningrad apologized for an incident last weekend when a Russian echelon crossed the Lithuanian border without any permission of Lithuanian authorities. On Tuesday, Russian Army officials requested a transit permission for a new echelon but Jurkevicius denied their request. Jurkevicius said his decision was prompted by the media's strong reaction to the incident last weekend. Until now, Russian military transit from Kaliningrad was reportedly carried out in accordance with the rules of transit from Germany. Apparently, the inspector is no longer willing to apply the same rules to transit from Kaliningrad and to transit from Germany.
