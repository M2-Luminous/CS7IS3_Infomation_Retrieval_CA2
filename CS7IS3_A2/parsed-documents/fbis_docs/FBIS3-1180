Speaking at a Johannesburg business breakfast meeting, Mr Buthelezi said the interim constitution contained "all the unwanted baggage of the past -- the excesses of central government, a limited bill of rights and a politically malleable constitutional court". The whole system remained top heavy and would continue the autocratic and authoritarian characteristics of the present government. The new provinces would not have a say on provincial matters such as civil service, police, audits, budgeting and finance, he said. While the South African business community seemed complacent about the interim constitution, Mr Buthelezi said he was prepared to accept criticism for not taking part in the coming elections. International mediation by constitutional experts would show the IFP's demands as fair and its concerns as legitimate, he said. Mediation would address the question of Zulu self-determination and the status of the Zulu kingdom. It would help rationalise the electoral process and timetables so all parties could compete on an equal footing.
