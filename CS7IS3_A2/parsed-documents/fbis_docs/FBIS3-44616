A survey shows that the output value generated by rural industrial enterprises surpassed 400 billion yuan in 1993, ranking first among all provinces and autonomous regions. The output value of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou and Zhenjiang Cities, where rural industries are developing more rapidly, accounted for three-fourths of the province's total rural industrial output value. Known as the "Kingdom of Rural Enterprises," Jiangsu started to popularize the share-holding system and cooperation in rural areas last year. By the end of last November, more than 2,600 rural enterprises had tried out the system and 68 rural enterprise groups had been established.
