This indicates that the party and government, as well as the general public, are very much concerned about the healthy growth of children and attach great attention to developing socialist undertakings supporting the poor and orphans. The Chinese government has always paid great attention to developing social undertakings of supporting the poor and orphans, one task of the undertakings being to protect the orphans' right to live. The government has formulated relevant laws and regulations, mapped out plans for the growth of youngsters, including orphans, and set up social welfare institutions to adopt orphans. Central and local governments provide funds to support orphans every year. Various localities have provided special workers to take care of orphans and set up a number of relevant scientific research institutes and organizations for rehabilitating and training orphans. In helping the orphans, many people in society were so warm-hearted that they produced many moving stories. With affectionate support from the party and government and from those who are not but are even dearer to them than their relatives, a great number of orphans have grown up and have worked hard on various fronts to help build up the country and to repay society's kindness. In general, China's undertakings to save and support orphans have developed healthily. However, in the process of building a socialist market economy, the work is facing many new problems, some of which are knotty, such as the greater number of orphans, a serious shortage of funds, poor quality of education, poor living conditions for orphans, and so on. All of these problems cry out for immediate solution. Saving and supporting orphans calls for the persistent participation of all sectors in society. Governments at all levels must tighten up leadership over the work of saving and supporting orphans and should mobilize and organize all social forces to raise and educate orphans in a down-to-earth manner. Civil affairs departments at all levels, which are functional departments in charge of the work, must conscientiously implement the State Council's regulations on protecting children, strengthen research in relevant legislation and policies, set up and improve regional social welfare networks with all-inclusive functions, encourage more volunteers to join in the work, explore new ways to save and support orphans in various types of regions, and focus on saving and supporting orphans in the countryside. All types of social welfare organizations must earnestly perform their duties in raising, protecting, and educating orphans; and deepen reforms, improve management, and promote the development of social welfare organizations in surrounding areas. It is imperative to try in every possible way to find more sources of funds for supporting orphans and improving service facilities to provide more services to orphans. Government departments concerned should energetically support operations to save and help orphans, providing sufficient funds and introducing appropriate policies. Saving and helping orphans is a noble undertaking and also a traditional virtue of the Chinese nation. We should answer the party Central Committee's call by displaying the socialist humanitarian spirit, extending a helping hand, feeling sympathy for orphans, and concerning ourselves with the healthy growth of orphans. We expect that the activity to cultivate love for the Chinese nation and for orphans will become the order of the day throughout the country. The realization of the "plan to save orphans" will certainly usher in a blooming spring for China's undertaking to save and support orphans.
