Among these are documents filed under the names of the state leaders of that period. The overwhelming majority of documents are from leaders of the Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, and the organizational units working under the Secretariat, government spokeswoman Judit Juhasz announced at her customary Thursday [26 May] press briefing. She added that several documents still contain information which remains protected for foreign policy or national security reasons, or because their publication would violate personal rights. The secrecy of these documents will continue to be upheld, on the proposal of the committee that reviewed the "secret" classification of the documents. In addition, the cabinet decided on Thursday to place an addendum on the document on Peace Partnership which clarifies that the State Office for Technical Development is in charge of scientific affairs among the organizations designated for cooperation.
