"We do not regard this visit as a form of pressure. We like people to come and see what happens in Nicaragua," Leal said in reference to the five-day visit of U.S. Representatives Robert Torricelli and Cass Ballenger. According to a Foreign Ministry note, Torricelli and Ballenger arrived in Nicaragua "to learn about progress on property ownership, human rights, security of the people, and the economic and political situation in general." Torricelli, the Democratic representative for New Jersey, said upon arriving in Managua the return to U.S. citizens of properties confiscated in the last decade "is a necessary factor for the continuance of aid for Nicaragua." The U.S. Congress approved an amendment on 29 April imposing restrictions on U.S. financial aid for countries where properties of U.S. citizens have been confiscated, if the necessary steps for the resolution of this situation are not taken within a 90-day deadline. Leal said these restrictions do not apply to Nicaragua, because, he said, the amendment applies only to countries that lack mechanisms to settle the claims of U.S. citizens. According to Leal, Nicaragua has started to return or make compensation for the real estate confiscated from both Nicaraguans and foreigners since 1991. According to the U.S. Embassy in Managua, 600 U.S. citizens demand the return of more than 1,000 properties. The government of President Violeta Chamorro argues, however, that most of these individuals had adopted Nicaraguan citizenship prior to the time their properties were seized. The Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry has reported that 125 U.S. citizens are demanding the return of 412 properties and that the difference between these figures and those provided by the U.S. Embassy consists of Nicaraguans who had assumed U.S. citizenship.
