As is known to the general public, criminal proceedings have been instituted in the Republic of Georgia Procurator's Office concerning the genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population that has been living on this ancient Georgian land. Regarding these facts, the investigation has already acquired numerous pieces of evidence that very clearly show the Abkhazian separatists' cruelty toward the peaceful population. Taking into account the very great interest of the public toward the investigation, our editor's office is continuing its series of publications on this subject. Anzor Baluashvili, head of the investigation group and the republic's deputy procurator general, spoke to a SAKINFORM correspondent about the incidence of genocide and ethnic cleansing of the Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by Abkhazian separatists. [Baluashvili] Absolutely horrific facts are being established on the basis of research: The organized genocide of the native Georgian population on the territory of Abkhazia by Abkhazian separatists and their reactionary henchmen. The conspiracy to between the organizers, perpetrators, and accomplices in this most serious crime is clearly evident. With the aim of violating the territorial integrity of the Georgian state, Abkhazian separatists slaughtered, in an organized way and on a massive scale, thousands of completely innocent people who were sacrificed only because they were of Georgian nationality. With the same aim, hundreds of thousands of indigenous Georgians were expelled from their homes, which action was accompanied by indescribable terror, physical and psychological violence, violation of the honor and dignity of citizens, devastation of homes and destruction of family belongings, the stealing of livestock and hijacking of vehicles. The Georgian people were subject to conditions that would have resulted in their certain annihilation had they remained on this territory. Certain people are vainly trying to deny that the genocide of the Georgian population took place in Abkhazia and explain the events as the cruelty that takes place during time of war. We state openly that this is an attempt to mislead the international public. The investigation will make available to any interested person the materials in its possession, to prove that systematic ethnic cleansing did indeed take place on the territory of Abkhazia. Moreover, several issues of the newspaper would probably not suffice to simply list the biographical details of those persons who were killed by the Abkhazian separatists and their hirelings. Those who were slaughtered did not participate in military operations. You cannot find an Abkhazian town, rayon, and village where reprisals were not perpetrated against the Georgian population. In practice, military actions in Abkhazia ended following the fall of Sukhumi on 27 September 1993. However, the investigation has gathered numerous pieces of evidence testifying to the slaughter of the Georgian population on a massive scale after military actions had ended. The investigators know with what inhuman cynicism and brutality the band of separatist criminals raped women and then cut off their breasts while they were still alive and even raped young girls who had not attained puberty and cut off their nipples and kept them in matchboxes. I state publicly that this testimony can be corroborated not only by Georgians but also by Greeks, Armenians, Russians, and representatives of other nationalities. In order for the world to assess the tragedy perpetrated by the fascists in Abkhazia in an objective and comprehensive manner, I believe it is essential that international organizations become immediately involved in the investigation. I believe that riffraff have surfaced at the end of the 20th century, the spread of whose lifestyle causes wounds that will not heal among millions of inhabitants of different countries. According to the testimony of some people, it has also become known that, after killing innocent people, the vandals attached the following types of inscriptions to the bodies of the victims: "Georgians, don't eat a lot, don't get fat. It's unpleasant for us to drag your corpses." One cannot read without feeling revulsion the testimony of eyewitnesses that describes how, in the immediate aftermath of the fall of Sukhumi, the following people were slaughtered on Tsereteli Street: A. Gadelia, O. Gegechkori, U. Kvaratskhelia, J. Dgebuadze, T. Kakuberi- Gvakhariasi, and S. Kakuberi, and also the Sukhumians J. Dartsmelia, the Zakradze brothers, Sh. Kacharava, Eter and Zaira Abramia, Z. Kalandia, B. Pipia, V. Jimsheleishvili, Ts. Sharia, V. Kvachakhia, A. Kintsurashvili, D. Kopaliani, and M. Kvirchkhaia. Thousands of Georgian families residing in Abkhazia shared the same fate as Nugzar Varlamis dze [son of Varlam] Jimsheleishvili, former Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers engineer. His father, Varlam Noes [son of Noe] Jimsheleishvili was taken prisoner, his home was ransacked, and his mother Babutsa Pipia and mother-in-law Mzia Kalandia were tortured to death. For specific reasons, I am unable to disclose the identity of 80-year old L.B. He was tortured to death and his foster child I.T., who was of Russian nationality, was shot at his grave for the sole reason that he had dared to bury a Georgian. 60-year-old M. Shonia, who was being sheltered in a neighbor's apartment, was killed with similar cruelty, as were 68- year old N. Mirtskhulava, and the couple V. and A. Kvaratskhelidze and V. Arghvliani. According to information acquired in the course of the investigation, people of Georgian nationality were shot individually and in groups. I repeat that it is possible to present a multitude of analogous facts. A description of the tragedy played out in Gali rayon and the facts about the slaughter there could become the subject of a separate long discussion. The investigation into the circumstances surrounding the brutal murder of Jiuli Shartava, chairman of the Abkhazian Council of Ministers, and his associates is continuing. According to additional materials received by the investigation, it is patently clear that, following the capture of Giuli Shartava and his associates in Sukhumi, Abkhazian separatists tortured them to death with particular cruelty. Before being killed, they were violently tortured, which has been clearly corroborated by forensic examination; additional testimony was provided by witnesses and other evidence. It is confirmed beyond a doubt that the murder of J. Shartava, employees of the Abkhazian Cabinet of Ministers, and other persons was sanctioned by those who provoked the armed conflict against the Georgian state and its people, which subsequently took the form of large-scale military operations. [SAKARTVELOS RESPUBLIKA editorial note] During the course of the investigation, a clear picture is emerging of the identity of those persons who, on the instructions of the Abkhazian separatists, carried out the genocide of the peaceful population. The materials that have been gathered show that the tragedy played out in Abkhazia is a crime against humanity and, therefore, as Anzor Baluashvili, the republic's deputy procurator general, stated, those who participated in this crime should be punished to the fullest extent of the law.
