(CSBC) announced Wednesday. Construction of the frigate, named "Cheng Ho" after a noted Ching Dynasty admiral, began on Dec. 21, 1990, and the vessel was launched in September 1992. "The ship will be delivered to the Navy about five weeks ahead of schedule," a CSBC official said. Construction of three other such warships are under way at the CSBC's Kaohsiung shipyard, and the last one is scheduled to be delivered to the Navy in 1999. The first of the frigates, which are modeled on the US Perry- class frigates, went into service last May. The 4,200-ton frigates have a cruising speed of 27.5 nautical miles per hour, according to the CSBC. The ships will be armed with locally-manufactured Hsiung-Feng ship-to-ship missiles, US standard ship-to-air missiles, [word indistinct] submarine torpedoes, and phalanx weapons systems built by the General Dynamics Corp. of the United States. The weapons system uses a closed-loop radar to spot and track enemy missiles and to direct fire from an M-61A1 Gatling gun capable of firing 3,000 rounds per minute. In addition, the vessels will carry anti- submarine helicopters. The eight vessels, which will eventually cost the Navy more than NT$40 billion (US$1.5 billion), are to replace part of the Navy's aging fleet. The Navy had 24 destroyers and nine frigates as of [word indistinct], according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies. The ROC also agreed on a US$4.8 billion deal in 1991 to buy 16 Lafayette-class frigates from France.
