Discussing this topic in the 14th Party Congress report, comrade Jiang Zeming pointed out that, "The orientation of economic reform is based on maintaining public ownership and distribution according to work as the mainstays; other economic sectors and means of distribution may supplement these, in order to establish and perfect the socialism market economy system." He also noted that, "The socialist market economic structure is combined with the basic structure of socialism." If public ownership is not taken as the mainstay, the basic socialist structure will suffer serious damage, perhaps even a quantitative change. This is self-evident. Therefore, in reforming the economic system and developing the market economy, persistence in taking public ownership as the dominant sector and nonpublic forms of ownership as supplements should become a common understanding and unified guidance for the nation. However, some people believe there seems to be some incompatibility between insistence on taking public ownership as the dominant sector and establishing the market and developing productive forces; so they always advocate reducing and weakening publicly-owned economy. Not long ago, it was reported in the newspapers how some economists had met to discuss the question, "Whether public ownership is the objective or the means." Some people at the meeting held that we must correct the "lopsided view that takes public ownership as the mainstay," that we "must rethink taking public ownership as the mainstay," and believed that "taking public ownership as the mainstay need "not necessarily be an absolute numerical quota, but should be manifested chiefly in quality". After the meeting, an economist also wrote to advocate that the rate of public ownership should "not necessarily occupy over 50 percent." For if so, it will be unfavorable to developing the market economy and productive forces. Some people even think that it would be fine if the level of public ownership could be kept at about 20 percent, controlling some key industries and a very few large enterprises. Under the precondition of insisting on taking public ownership as the mainstay, we believe that the crux lies in just how much should each economic sector occupy, one that demands continuous study and control. But if we artificially reduce public ownership to less than 50 percent, in a situation where the other economic sectors enjoy favorable policies, the dominant position of public ownership must be weakened, and may even be hard to maintain. It is surprising, but people who hold this opinion are forgetting the simple truth that "every mass must be expressed in a certain quantity." Their motivation aside, the fact remains that it must weaken and shake the dominant position of public ownership. We really should discuss the necessity of insisting on the dominant position of public ownership under the socialist system, both theoretically and practically. First of all, is public ownership or private ownership more suitable to the need to develop modern socialized productive forces? Marx and Engels resolved this question long ago, but since some people often dispute the point, I must take time to discuss it again. Marxism tells us that the historical unfolding of the basic contradictory movement possessed by capitalism's production has to lead to "incompatibility between socialized production and capitalist ownership". This contradiction contains the "seeds of all conflicts" in modern capitalist society, and "forces the capitalist class to treat productive forces more like the productive forces of society within all possible limitations inside the capital relationship." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 3 pp 311, 317). To completely resolve this contradiction, "it has to admit the social nature of modern productive forces, so make production, occupation, and exchanging patterns appropriate to the social nature of the productive materials. This can be accomplished only by the public and direct occupation by society of the productive forces which have developed to a situation of being unsuitable to other management than social management." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Volume 3 pp 318-319). That is, replacing capitalism with socialism, replacing the private ownership of capitalism with the public ownership of socialism. The objective necessity and historical justification of establishing and developing socialism is rooted in this. Practices shows that the public ownership of socialism matches and impels the development of modern socialized productive forces more than the private ownership of capitalism does. The former Soviet Union rapidly accomplished national industrialization in just 10 years; in addition, the great achievements of modernization construction since the establishment of new China 40 years ago, and especially in the past decade, all prove that only the public ownership economic relationship of socialism is the vital economic system which suits and impels the development of modern socialized productive forces. It also should be the scientific belief and practical principle of all Marxists. Second, insistence on the dominant position of public ownership must be in deed as well as word, not merely admitting orally that "public ownership is in the dominant position," while shaking and damaging its dominant position. China is a socialist country; we must conduct its economic system with public ownership of the means of production, for without public ownership, we will be unable to protect the working class's leadership of the nation (through the Communist Party of China), since its power to lead will lose its economic base. So, to adhere to socialist public ownership, we must consolidate and develop public ownership, and absolutely not damage it. Now, some people in the backs of their minds constantly view public ownership as an obstacle to developing the market economy and productive force, they try everything they can to weaken and nibble away at public ownership, which causes considerable loss to state-owned assets. There are estimates that at present, more than 100 million yuan in state-owned assets are being lost every day, "changing from public assets to private." Some cadres and economists believe that state-owned enterprises are burdensome, basing this view on such things as low economic efficiency and serious losses brought on by such things as unfair economic competition, and try hard to abandon them, urging their number be reduced. The idea of a so-called reduction in public ownership to less than 50 percent comes from this background. These comrades have not analyzed the complex reasons for state-owned enterprise losses, they do not seriously study countermeasures, they make no attempt change the operational system to create a modernized system of public ownership of enterprises. Actually, they simply conclude that the reason why these enterprises suffer loss is that public ownership itself is no good, concentrating their hopes and excitement on privately-owned enterprises. So, as such situations appear, some economists and responsible cadres even advocate auctioning off State-owned enterprises on a large scale to display their "ideological liberation" and "bold reforms". In April of last year, the mayor of a large city publicly announced that "except for those enterprises which the State must control, most enterprises can be auctioned off." The director of the system reform committee in that city said, concerning the question of auctioning enterprises, "not only enterprises which suffer losses can be auctioned, but efficient enterprises as well; not only small enterprises but the larger state-owned enterprises also." Further, "as long as there are buyers, it doesn't matter whether they are Chinese businessmen or foreign businessmen, natural persons or legal persons." This daring to auction off state-owned enterprises is really wild! Of course, for that portion of state-owned enterprises which are inefficient, small scale, and appropriate for distributed operation, we can change the operational system through leasing, contracts, and auctions of property rights. But it is really difficult to agree with those who advocate selling the great majority of state-owned enterprises, including even the efficient and large scale ones. We have to ask what right have they to shake and damage public ownership's dominant position as they please? It must be obvious that if we cut the rate of the public ownership economy to less than 50 percent, the nature of China's economy will change. Not only will it be impossible to maintain the dominant position of public ownership, but the socialist nature of the economy will change as well. If private enterprises occupy more than half of the gross social assets and gross social output, that means the majority of social surplus labor will be occupied by the private sector. In such circumstances, can we still say the working people have been liberated from the labor hiring system? Can we still say that the exploiting class has been wiped out? Can we still talk about eliminating polarization, and growing prosperous together? Moreover, if a private ownership economy possesses more than half of the private assets in the gross social assets, it must automatically result in division and concentration under the law of value, which then must produce a privately run enterprise clique with great economic power. In this situation, what kind of administrative and legal regulations does the state have which is strong enough to stop the emergence of an exploitative class? Can the people's regime remain in the hands of the people? Obviously, if a socialist nation permits the privately owned economy to exceed the power of the public ownership economy, the economic, political, and social consequences brought on by this will be dreadful to contemplate. Therefore, adherence to the dominant position of public ownership both quantitatively and qualitatively is the economical base and major framework of socialism with Chinese characteristics. We can say that if public ownership is not in the dominant position, there can be no socialist market economy, nor can there be socialism. We should have no wavering and concessions on this point. All expressions and practices which will weaken and shake the dominant position of public ownership must be rejected. Third, adherence to "taking public ownership as the major body" while confirming and maintaining the "supplementary" status of the nonpublic ownership economy are two related aspects of guaranteeing that our socialist economic structure is equitable. For more than a decade, carrying out reform and opening while adjusting the economic structure has resulted in considerable development of the individual economy, the privately-run economy, and the foreign capital economy, and these have played a necessary and good "supplementary" role. We can anticipate that in the distant future, these non-public ownership economies will have greater development. Based on forecasts by relevant departments, given the current developmental trends of the non-public ownership economy, by the year 2000 there will be 25 to 30 million individual industrial and commercial families, and privately-run enterprises. These will have as many as 50 million employees, as much as 350 billion yuan in self-owned capital, and will occupy over 20 percent of the gross industrial output. Annual retail sales value of social goods will be more than 600 billion yuan, occupying over 30 percent of the gross social retail sales value. So we can see that in China the developmental trend of nonpublic ownership is very swift and strong. Meanwhile, it is clear that in addition to its positive and necessary supplementary role, the nonpublic ownership economy also trends to self-development. Non-public ownership enterprises, especially a few large-scale privately owned enterprise groups which grow more mature by the day, are calling for the maximum possible extension of their economic power. They are dissatisfied with their "supplementary" status as compared to public ownership's dominant, and seek to "exceed" that position; as a theoretical reflection of this economic demand, some people employ such terms as "diversified economic structure," "diversified investment," and "diversification of the main entity of interest" to describe the current situation of China's economical life. In fact, statements of this sort are demands that the nonpublic ownership economy have equal status with the public ownership economy. This is an implied challenge to public ownership's dominant position. But some of our economists have rationalized the content of this kind of "challenge," even advocating 50 percent or more nonpublic ownership. If the system of nonpublic ownership "exceeds its position" it will mean that the main body of the public ownership system will "lose its position." Question: when the economic power of non-public ownership exceeds over half of the whole economy, can you still regard it as a "supplement" to the socialist economy? When the private ownership economy occupies the greater part of national production and operations, where is the "major" position of the public ownership economy? Fourth, public ownership enterprises should play a leading role in the entire domestic economy in quantity, mass, and function. The state-owned big and medium-sized enterprises should control key departments and the advanced, new technical industry and basic industries, play both an advanced and a leading role in technical development and applications. They must have advanced enterprises rules and scientific management, and they must have higher productivity and good economic efficiency. The state-owned big or medium sized enterprises usually have the advantages of large scale, strong capabilities, advanced facilities and a concentration of talented people, so they should be capable of fulfilling the role of backbone and model. Of course this leadership work can be accomplished only in fair market competition. At present, for reasons which are very complicated, and due largely to a rigid system and an unfair competitive economic environment, some state-owned big or medium-sized enterprises are in difficult straits, with declining economic efficiency, a talent drain, poor sales, and shortages of capital. All of these problems can be improved gradually, but only through accelerated change in the operational system to create modern, public ownership enterprises rules and creating a fair competitive environment which suits the requirements of a market economy. It is only by carrying out further reform, facing the markets, strengthening scientific management, and pushing scientific and technical progress will the public ownership enterprises regain their youth and vitality.
