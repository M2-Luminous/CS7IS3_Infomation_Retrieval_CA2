FBIS4-62921 "drsov097_f_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 National Affairs Attempt To Seize Interior Ministry Detailed Attempt To Seize Interior Ministry Detailed LD1905134094 Kiev UNIAN in Ukrainian 1245 GMT 19 May 94 LD1905134094 Kiev UNIAN Ukrainian BFN [Text] Simferopol [no date as received] -- During the discussion of the agenda at the Crimean Supreme Council's session today, Yuriy Meshkov, the republic's president, proposed that the composition of the government should be approved immediately. He then interrupted his speech to give the floor to Crimea's acting internal affairs minister, General Valeriy Kuznetsov. The latter announced, in particular, that "a plane with Ukrainian First Deputy Internal Affairs Minister Valentin Nedryhaylo and special forces [spetsnaz] on board secretly arrived in Simferopol in the early hours [on 19 May]. A surprise attempt to seize the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry building was made right away. That attempt was barred by resolute actions by the personnel of the Crimean militia. A military coup is under way." In Valeriy Kuznetsov's words, Valentin Nedryhaylo tried to read to the militia personnel a Ukrainian presidential directive dismissing the leadership of the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry, appointing "Kiev governors" and subordinating the Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry to the Ukrainian president, bypassing the Crimean Supreme Council and president. It was proposed at the session that Valeriy Kuznetsov's candidacy for the post of Crimean internal affairs minister should be approved urgently and even without any discussion, but because of the [Crimean Tartar People] Kurultay group's disagreement this proposal was not passed. A commission was set up in order to verify Valeriy Kuznetsov's report. The Crimean Supreme Council's commission for military issues and the Republic of Crimea's security, and the republic's procurator are members of the commission. The deputies discussed the candidacy of Valeriy Kuznetsov for the post of Crimean internal affairs minister. Voting on his candidacy was postponed until the commission completes its work. The president of the Crimean Republic proposed that the session should consider and approve a resolution in reaction to the Ukrainian president's decree "On converting the Crimean Republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs main directorate for internal affairs in Crimea", as well as approve the composition of a coordinating commission formed by the government to go to Kiev for negotiations on cooperation and delimitation of powers in disputed policy areas. Yuriy Meshkov also proposed the immediate approval of two more appointments, the heads of the Crimean security service and the Justice Ministry. According to the Crimean president, while the Ukrainian leadership continues its attempts to destabilize the situation in Crimea to help Leonid Kravchuk hold on to the presidential seat, there is no other option than to approve the ministerial appointments to preserve stability on the peninsula. Valeriy Kartavtsev, head of the Ukrainian Security Council Secretariat, told UNIAN that a meeting of the Council on 18 May discussed the issue of Ukraine's territorial integrity following the latest developments in Crimea. In his opinion, the Ukrainian president and the newly elected Supreme Council can be expected to take action if the violation of Ukraine's Constitution continues. Militia Colonel-General Valentin Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of internal affairs, flew to Crimea after the Security Council meeting. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs' main center for public links, on 19 May at the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs, the results were summed up on the granting of practical assistance by the bodies and subunits of Crimea's internal affairs to officials from Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Militia Col-Gen Valentin Nedryhaylo, first deputy minister of Ukraine's internal affairs, took part in the summing up. He read a decree of the Ukrainian president to the leadership of Crimea's Ministry of Internal Affairs, "On reorganizing the ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Crimea into a chief directorate of internal affairs of Crimea of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs and on subordinating this directorate directly to Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs." In accordance with this decree, administrative and management buildings, armaments, means of transportation, and other assets are transferred for use by the chief directorate of internal affairs of Crimea. The additional post of deputy minister of Ukraine's internal affairs -- head of the main directorate of internal affairs of Crimea of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs, is being introduced to the staff of the central apparatus of Ukraine's Ministry of Internal Affairs. Militia Colonel V. Chernyshov [name as received] was appointed to this post. The main center for public links of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine also announced that a statement from Valeriy Kuznetsov, acting internal affairs minister of the Republic of Crimea, about an attempt by spetsnaz to seize the Crimean Ministry of Internal Affairs building was "another attempt to deceive the public of Crimea and Ukraine."
