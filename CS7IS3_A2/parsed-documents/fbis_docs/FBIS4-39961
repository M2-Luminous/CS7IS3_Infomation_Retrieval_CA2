The congress, which will continue for two days, is being held in the Russian parliamentary center. Gaydar pointed out that one of the main tasks of the new party is to bring the truth home to the people and oppose demagogy and lies advocated by political adversaries. "We need a strong political organization, and therefore, we are creating a party," Gaydar said. The pointed out that the fundamental task of the party is to create prerequisites for stable economic development. In his opinion, the economic course which has been pursued in Russia over the past 1.5 years is a course of compromise and fluctuations, which is, in fact, a departure from the solution of existing problems. "It is dangerous to repudiate a challenge, since this creates an instable environment which is a nourishing media for extremists' experiments, Gaydar said. If this tendency continues for another 3-5 years, the country will find itself under a colonial rule, Gaydar said. Among cardinal tasks needed for Russia's normal development Gaydar mentioned defense policies and problems of security. He pointed out the importance "of conducting a consistent and steadfast military reform, which fully meets servicemen's interests". In his opinion, the existing army is "a too heavy burden for Russia and it needs reorganization." Gaydar said that it is necessary to reduce the number of the army personnel, saying that this does not mean any disrespect towards the army. Another "colossal problem" faced by Russia is an enormous and inefficient state mechanism and an unnecessary large "army of officials," Gaydar said. In his opinion, one of the most important problems is the agrarian reform which has been practically frozen today. Gaydar pointed out that the agrarian reform should enter a new stage and that attempts to maintain the collapsing system of collective and state farms should be rejected. Touching upon foreign policy problems, Gaydar said that relations with "near abroad" are the most important task. He pointed out that "it is necessary to work steadfastly for the creation of a single market on the territory of the former Soviet Union and the creation of the customs and currency unions. However, advocating the comprehensive development of integration on the territory of the former Soviet Union and the defense of the Russian-speaking population, Gaydar categorically came out against political scheming and the solution of other problems at the expense of Russian taxpayers.
