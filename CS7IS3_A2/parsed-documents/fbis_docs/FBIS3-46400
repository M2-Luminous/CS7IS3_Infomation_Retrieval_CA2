He said Mr Patten was constitutionally entitled to veto a law and dissolve the legislature. Mr Lee, chairman of the United Democrats, claimed most of the appointed members in Legco had consistently acted against the wishes of the public. "After disbanding the council, he can appoint a new group of legislators who truly represent public views," he said. Mr Patten could then table the bill again and seek its approval. Later, Mr Lee said that if Prime Minister John Major and the British Government "had any respect for the people of Hong Kong at all, they should introduce the bill containing Mr Patten's original reforms immediately". He said it would "wholly irresponsible and unacceptable" to delay any longer. Replying to Mr Lee's suggestion, Mr Patten said: "We have to legislate with the Legco we've got, and I don't think I could very well say if this or that was amended in that case I would have to send for a new Legco. "I don't think that would be regarded by the community as very fair." The British Cabinet last night failed to take any decision on the tabling of the second section of Mr Patten's package but again urged China to return to the negotiating table and make concessions. Officials had earlier stressed that the meeting of the Hong Kong committee of the Cabinet chaired by Mr Major was aimed at taking stock of the impasse with China. "No dramatic decisions have been considered or taken," said Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd as he emerged from the one-hour meeting in Downing Street. "The first part of the legislation, what we hope would be the non-controversial part, is going through the Legislative Council," he said. "No decisions have been taken yet on the timing or content of the second part." But he stressed: "That legislation needs to be in place by July this year in order that the preparations for the elections in 1994 and 1995 can be made in an orderly way. "We are entirely ready to resume discussions with the Chinese on the points that remain in disagreement, but obviously there is a limit to the time which could be spent before legislation has to be tabled on the second part." Mr Patten insisted that the Hong Kong Government had proceeded in an orderly way. "We have taken one legislative step after another, and obviously we will want to have the first bill on the statute book before moving on unless of course by that stage we have managed to resume discussions with Chinese officials," he said. He refused to be drawn on whether the second tranche of legislation would be based on his original October 1992 proposal or the compromise cutting the functional constituency electorate put forward in the later rounds of talks. "We will obviously be deciding on what is the best way forward in the light of our success in getting the first bill through and other factors at the time," he said. This was not the appropriate occasion to make an announcement on the content of the bill. He said he would want to take account of the views expressed in the community and by political groups in recent weeks. "We want to make sure that there is as broad a base of support as possible." He hinted that Britain had asked the US to raise the Hong Kong democracy issue in its current talks with the Chinese Government. "It would not be surprising if other countries expressed their concern over Hong Kong's system and the survival of rule of law," he said. The Governor added: "When approached by our friends, we tell them." Mr Patten firmly denied any suggestion of division between himself and the Foreign Office on how to proceed. "I have never ever in my life been to a meeting at which views were more unanimously expressed," he said. The United Democrats' own amendments on the coming partial electoral bill was ruled out of order by Legco President John Swaine. The amendments intended to increase the number of directly- elected seats to 30; to introduce the nine new functional constituency seats as mentioned in the original package proposed by Mr Patten and to create three new functional constituencies to give the retired and housewives a second vote.
