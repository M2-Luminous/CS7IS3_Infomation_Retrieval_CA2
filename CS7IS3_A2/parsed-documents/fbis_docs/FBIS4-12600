The Iraqis, who were unarmed, gave themselves up and asked for political asylum. However when army spotters sighted the men just south of the Sea of Galilee the alert was sounded fearing an armed infiltration was underway. Half a dozen cases of Iraqis, some army deserters, reaching the Israeli border with Jordan have been reported in the last two years. All have requested political asylum or to be allowed to travel on to a third country.
