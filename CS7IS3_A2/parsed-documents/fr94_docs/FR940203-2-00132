FR940203-2-00132 FR940203-2-00068 Changes: Paragraph (b)(9) has been changed to require each State to describe how it will ensure opportunities for low achieving students, students with disabilities, and former students who have dropped out of school, to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs in a manner that leads to employment in high-performance, high-paying jobs. Comment: Three commenters requested, that in lieu of describing the manner in which they will ``ensure'' opportunities for students to participate in the School-to-Work Opportunities programs in paragraphs (b)(6) through (b)(8) of the October 14, 1993 notice, States be required to ``increase'' opportunities for students to participate in the School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Discussion: The Secretaries believe that requiring States to ensure opportunities for student participation will naturally result in increased opportunities for participation. Therefore, the Secretaries do not think that the suggested change is necessary. Changes: None. Priority_Stakeholder Agreement Comment: While agreeing that all the items in the notice are critical, one commenter suggested that perhaps the most critical item would be one requiring an agreement among ``stakeholders'' setting out the results to be achieved by each State's program, how achievement of these results would be determined by stakeholders, and what agency would be entrusted with the review of program results. The commenter suggested that an independent or quasi-independent entity would be best suited for the role of evaluating program success. Discussion: The Secretaries agree that the ideas presented by the commenter, including that relating to agreements among stakeholders, are good ones. While the Secretaries think that stakeholder agreements may be very effective ways of ensuring meaningful collaboration, they are opposed to making them mandatory. Rather, each State is allowed the flexibility to determine the best way to ensure effective collaboration among the stakeholders and the specific methods and processes by which the progress of its program will be reviewed and assessed. Changes: None. General Program Requirements_Common Features Comment: Two commenters noted that, to allow individuals with disabilities to fully participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs, the wording on outcomes must be revised to add, after ``a high school diploma,'' the phrase, ``or alternative diploma or certificate, as appropriate.'' Discussion: The Secretaries seek to establish systems that will result in the attainment of a high school diploma or its equivalent, and a skill certificate, for all students. States have the flexibility to provide support services to students who may require additional resources to obtain the outcomes sought to be achieved under the program. However, as has been discussed above, the Secretaries do not intend to discourage the participation of students with disabilities in State School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Indeed, the School-to-Work Opportunities initiative is intended to serve all students. Accordingly, the Secretaries include within the term ``equivalent,'' which has been added to the definition of ``career major,'' certificates which States may choose to provide to students with disabilities. These are considered to be equivalent to high school diplomas. Changes: Paragraph (b)(1) of the ``General Program Components'' section of the priority has been revised to indicate that the high school diploma requirement may be satisfied when a student is awarded the ``equivalent'' of a high school diploma, as determined under standards by the State. Program Components_General Comment: One commenter considered the three program components contained in the October 14, 1993 notice to be inadequate and suggested that a section for support activities like counseling, child care, and transportation, be added. The commenter felt that without these support activities, programs would not attract and hold students who were drop-outs, young parents, or disadvantaged, and whose past lack of success had been due to the unavailability of such services. Discussion: The program components required in the notice define the core elements of a School-to-Work Opportunities program. The Secretaries recognize that other support services may be necessary to help students fully participate in the program, particularly in the case of disadvantaged or disabled students, and in the case of dropouts. The Secretaries do not, however, wish to render such additional services mandatory in all cases. Moreover, under the notice, States are already required to ensure opportunities for ``low-achieving students, students with disabilities, and former students who have dropped out of school to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs.'' This will mean in some cases, providing support services. Also, it is important to note that funds under this competition may be used for support services. In addition, under the priority, States are required to describe how their School-to-Work Opportunities systems will coordinate the use of education and training funds from State and private sources with funds available from related Federal programs. (See paragraph (b)(4) of the priority.) Changes: None.
