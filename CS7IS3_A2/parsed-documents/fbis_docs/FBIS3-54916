NATO is eager to have member states on the border with Russia, to strengthen the market potential of former Warsaw Pact states. Russia, in its turn, is doing everything to prevent NATO intrusion into East Europe because, in its viewpoint, this military union represents a threat to Russia's geopolitical interests. Meanwhile, there are few officials in Russia who take into consideration the viewpoint of East European states. Some of them view NATO as a guarantor of their national security (Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary). Those states which are closer to Russia made attempts to create something akin to a third Europe. The existence of the Republic of Poland is an historic example of such a political structure in Europe. In the 18th century, this type of state did not meet the expectations of its population because it could not withstand the expansion of East and West, and was divided by them according to their spheres of influence. Lack of economic initiative, political anarchy, and Poland's eagerness to become rich at the expense of Lithuania, Belarus, and Ukraine were the reasons for the collapse of the Republic. The establishment a Central European market stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea is, simply put, highly unlikely due to the fact that both Russia and Germany will oppose this idea. Furthermore, the existence of this structure will mean the division of Europe into three military-economic blocks and the breaking up of the existing market relations. In my mind, the NATO proposal on the participation of East European states in the European integration process seems more likely. Following such a course, these states could secure access to Western capital and technology. In Belarus, the last variant of the development of events in Europe is not supported at all. The opposition, represented primarily by the Belarusian Popular Front, is striving to implement its idea of setting up a Baltic-Black Sea Association, a kind of politically neutral buffer zone between NATO and Russia. This military-political draft project has an historic background. The Belarusian nomenclature, as represented by the Kebich government, is striving to establish a close union with Russia based on a joint monetary system. In fact, in Belarus, we are witnessing a struggle being launched in the financial sector. Currently, two monetary units -- the dollar and ruble -- are reigning supreme in the Belarusian market. Dollars symbolize Western trends, while rubles -- the Russian tendencies. Our Belarusian "hares" [nickname for Belarusian currency notes] are struggling for independence under conditions that are extremely unfavorable for the existence of capital and is gradually losing the game because the capital is located somewhere else, not in Belarus. The latest events in the Supreme Soviet have shown that even though Vyacheslav Kebich defeated the opposition, he could not beat the dollar. Belarus is likely to introduce its own national currency and enter the world market with its normal criteria of business relations. I regret that this idea is not supported by a political force, which could explain why Belarus is not going to use its neutral position for the division of Europe. The neutrality was imposed on the Republic by its specific geopolitical location. A similar notion of neutrality was used by Austria when it found itself between two Europes (the socialist and the capitalist one). Finland has also used a similar tactic. It is clear that the leaders of these countries understood quite well that the principle of regional security has not lost its significance in the 20th century. NATO cannot be dissolved because it guards the interests of democratic states. It is evident that these states require protection because the totalitarian regime of the former USSR has not yet passed away. This totalitarian system is manifested in the aggressive Islamic fundamentalism and Asian communism (North Korea). It is also manifested in local nationalist tendencies (Germany, Russia). Therefore, totalitarianism is both a state of mind and a military-political strategy. Russia could find a partner in NATO for waging harsh fights against Eastern totalitarianism, especially in Tajikistan. However, the Russian military is against this union. The egoism of a neighboring superpower will force Belarus to either give up or find its own path to a civilized world. The acting Supreme Soviet is unable to resolve this issue because its majority adopts only those decisions which protect their interests. The Supreme Soviet opposition faction is too weak. Nevertheless, the political and economic processes continue to develop. In my opinion, the dollar will win the battle. For Moscow officials and the Belarusian Supreme Soviet majority, it is a usual thing that local provincial interests are being settled in Moscow. Therefore, V. Kebich and S. Shushkevich are continually visiting Moscow. Meanwhile, Moscow is uttering threats against disobedient Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan because they cannot stem the flow of Russians from their territories.
