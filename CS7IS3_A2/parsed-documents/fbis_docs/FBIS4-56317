In the opinion of Fernando Untoja, leader of the National Katarist Movement (MKN), the new law will serve only to register and allocate the land. The head of the CSUTCB [General Trade Union Confederation of Peasant Workers of Bolivia], Felix Santos, says that "what the administration wants with its proposal is the support of the peasants to hegemonize power." Despite the fact that the indigenous peasant represents more than 54 percent of the nation's population, integration into the economic, political, and social life of the country has always been an unresolved problem because of the social development and structure in Bolivia from its founding up to the present. After 169 years of life as a republic, economic and political power is still denied to those persons who, for more than 500 years, have demanded the ownership of their lands, usurped in their opinion by "European invaders and their heirs, who today enjoy impunity in the command levels of the state." The recent misfortune of the indigenous peoples, in the national and continental contexts, and the social injustice in which they live, was the motivation, according to government representatives, for the preparation of a law that would channel the sense of participation that the "people" have always had, Popular Participation. The sentiment and the logic with which the administration rationalizes its proposed law is described by Miguel Urioste, national deputy of the Free Bolivia Movement (MBL), as a redistribution of the state's resources in order to encourage rural development. "It is the first time in the country's history that 20 percent of tax revenues will have been transferred to the provinces, cantons, and communities through the sectional townships," said Urioste, referring to the projections for peasant development. Fernando Untoja, presidential candidate for the National Katarist Movement (MKN) in last June's general election, believes, however, that the Popular Participation Law will not further social development, much less the economic strengthening of rural areas, because it does not contain a comprehensive agricultural policy. "The Popular Participation project has a single virtue: it is designed to register territories and communities, which in the end will come down to the administration of schools, health stations, and other public facilities, through the municipalities and subprefectures," Untoja said. There is still another view. In the opinion of Felix Santos, executive secretary of the CSUTCB, the Popular Participation Law is a plan that will commercialize land ownership, impoverishing the peasants even more. "How can there be economic development and progress in rural areas when the administration itself has in mind to create land banks and institutes that will establish new rural taxes which logically further impoverish the peasants?" questioned the union leader, who is of Quechua origin. A subject that concerns Fernando Untoja, who recently proposed an alternative plan to Popular Participation, is the law's lack of ideas and specific articles related to the economic development of rural areas. These are areas that suffer from a lack of markets for their products, and the fact that agricultural technology has not reached rural areas. This thought was further developed by Santos, to whom it seemed "totally incoherent" that the government proposal did not take into account the economic progress of the indigenous peoples. Worse yet, it wanted to eliminate education and health services, transferring them gradually to the municipalities. "I do not believe that the reallocation of the budget will aid the development of rural areas, especially when the money will come out of the pockets of impoverished urban families and of the peasants themselves, while wealthy businessmen will continue to benefit from our labor," he emphasized. Urioste, vice presidential candidate for the MBL in 1993, defended the government's proposal, saying that "this is just the beginning" of a series of changes that, in the long run, will restructure a state that still preserves hidden forms of colonial domination and ethnic-cultural exclusion. Urioste recognized that juridical equality for Bolivians, embodied this time in the Popular Participation Law, will not be sufficient to close the immense gap that exists between the poverty of rural areas and the opulence of the privileged social sectors in the cities. "We must keep in mind that this is an important plan but not the final one. I believe that this juridical instrument will, in a sense, initiate the liberation of the indigenous peoples," Urioste said. In Santos's opinion, the worst thing that could happen to a poor person is to be a peasant, without access to political and economic power, without any real opportunity to take part in governing the state. "We believe that one of the ways that rural areas can be developed is to transfer the administration of natural resources to the indigenous peoples, so that the proceeds of the exploitation of these resources can be administered autonomously by the people of the regions that produce them," said Santos. The peasant leader's suggestion was converted by Untoja into an alternative proposal that was recently presented to Congress. That document proposes drawing the indigenous peoples' tribal organizations into the state, which might even make possible a new system of national departments, based on Bolivia's ecological zones and ecosystems. The most important feature of "Untoja's Katarist" alternative lies in the state's real ability to distribute land to the peasants. "The current Popular Participation Law makes no provision for granting land to the peasants, which in this situation is the most important element for a takeoff in agricultural development, which is certainly not to be confused with the Basic Territorial Organizations (OTB's)." Santos and Untoja, the latter of Aymara origin, agree in saying that the official document is political in content and has as its ultimate end taking possession of the rural sector and municipalizing it by means of the committees of vigilance. "The government's aim in forming the committees of vigilance is obvious. These committees will be taken over by movement groups which will set aside and leave powerless the popular and communitary organizations of workers and indigenous peoples," the principal leader of the CSUTCB charged. "This is evident. The ayllus, cabildos, jilikatas, curacas [presumably governing or representative bodies of the Indian nations] and other communitary organizations will have to give up their places to the committees of vigilance, which necessarily will be vouched for by the subprefectures, and in the final analysis these committees will do the screening of the OTB's representatives," said Untoja. But Urioste, the number two man in the social democratic MBL, defends the project, saying that "the peasants' ability to choose, decide, and to administer should not be underestimated." "I am certain that there will be no political infiltration in the committees of vigilance because they will not be handpicked but will be chosen by each community's individual system," said Urioste. However, in Untoja's opinion the government sector already has a juridical instrument that "will legalize" political conditioning for each electoral event. "For example, the community that does not agree with the government's political line simply will not receive resources to run its schools or health stations. This fact will produce divisions in the communities and ayllus, which will fight to be legally recognized," Untoja predicted. In any event, and from different perspectives, Untoja, as well as Santos and Urioste, already knows that the new law will not produce an immediate economic takeoff in agriculture, although the MBL leader nourishes a certain hope.
