The Foreign Ministry press secretary referred to the cease-fire agreement concluded among Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan in Moscow last Friday [18 February] with the mediation of Russia and noted that it is another step on the way toward peacefully resolving the Karabakh conflict and establishing peace in the region. The Armenian authorities welcome such a step and will do everything possible to find ways toward the peaceful resolution of the conflict. Now everything depends on the stance to be adopted by Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. It is very important that the agreement on a complete cease-fire was also signed by the representative of Nagorno-Karabakh. This is another confirmation that Karabakh is being recognized as one of the main sides to the conflict. Safaryan also highlighted that in addition to the cease-fire, the agreement also envisages the deployment of peacekeeping forces between the armed formations of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh all along the conflict zone. Of course, no one should overestimate the importance of this document, after all, agreements on a cease-fire were concluded in the past but never implemented because of Azerbaijan, but it should not be berated at the same time because this is undoubtedly another step in the difficult process of establishing peace. The latest developments in the region have generated the need to conduct active diplomatic contacts. This is why Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister Zhirair Liparityan met Vladimir Kazimirov, the Russian president's ambassador on special missions, in Moscow. During his 90 minutes of talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin in Ankara on 21 February, they examined issues relating to the peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict. Liparityan will also visit France and Germany, where he will meet Foreign Ministry officials. These contact are important because both countries are members of the CSCE Minsk Group and should be able to clarify views on particular issues relating to the measures envisaged by the CSCE Minsk Group. At the end of the week, Liparityan will visit Iran. Armenia's relations with Iran are thriving and must be expanded in every sphere of cooperation. Safaryan noted that Armenia aspires to establish good neighborly relations with all its neighbors in the region. In this context, Foreign Minister Vahan Papazyan's upcoming visit to Israel is particularly important. The visit is planned for 6-9 March.
