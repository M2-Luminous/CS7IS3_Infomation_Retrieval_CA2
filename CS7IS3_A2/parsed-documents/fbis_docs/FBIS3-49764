Commenting on the talks of the Visegrad Group leaders, the chief Polish diplomat based his view on the evolution that has occurred in the concept of the "Partnership for Peace" since it was first put forward by Bill Clinton. Minister Olechowski believes that the U.S. "Partnership for Peace" initiative was enriched by the declaration that NATO will remain open to the states of Central Europe. These states were assured that they can count on NATO's help in crises and that their security is closely related to the security of NATO. "Partnership for Peace" will also incorporate Ukraine and Russia into the international security system. Minister Olechowski claims that "Partnership for Peace" will enhance Poland's defense capabilities. The proposed program of military cooperation with NATO will lead to "interoperationalness" of the armies of NATO and of the states of Central Europe. In line with this program, Poland will have access to NATO technology and information, as well as to Western early-warning systems. Poland will also have the right to hold consultations with the 16 member states of NATO if its sovereignty is jeopardized, and the possibility of establishing joint units with them. While commenting on the talks in Prague, Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak said that, aside from the "Partnership for Peace," which offers Poland "political prospects and prospects of security," we also need a "partnership for development." He stressed that "economic stability is one of the most important security factors." Prime Minister Pawlak stated that the leaders of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia agreed on the need to extend the political platform of the Visegrad Group to the economic platform and to establish a formula of "G-4," similar to "G-7," the seven richest countries in the world. The Visegrad Group states will jointly resolve regional problems, intensify their economic cooperation, and create the appropriate infrastructure. It is expected that, in April of this year, the liberalization of trade within the framework of the Central European Free Trade Zone will be accelerated. Asked whether the meeting of the presidents of the United States and the Visegrad Group states was a success, President Lech Walesa stressed upon his return from Prague that new concepts are being created that are headed in the right direction; however, the important thing is the rate of the transformations: "I take advantage of any good moment; there are also other strategists, who walk the assigned path step by step," said the president, emphasizing the role of the mass media, especially in the West, in explaining Poland's stand on this issue.
