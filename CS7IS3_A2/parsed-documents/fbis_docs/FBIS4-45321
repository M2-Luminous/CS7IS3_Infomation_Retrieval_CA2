Last Friday evening, the biggest-ever quantity of the white powder to be caught was confiscated in the city of Durres. During a surprise search near the beach at Durres, the forces of public order discovered around 500 grams of heroin in a person's private car. A few hours later, after this person's immediate arrest, two other persons were detained; an intensive search was still going on. The first announcements--albeit very reserved ones--confirm that the person from whom the big quantity of heroin was confiscated was a man of 40, working in the Mercantile Marine of Durres and a resident of Kavaja. Meanwhile, other sources from Kavaja report that later the same evening, the forces of public order carried out a minute search of the man's house. Anyhow, there is no report of any new quantity of drugs having been confiscated since then, although--due to the top secrecy of the investigations--no other details relevant to this action, carried out by the forces of order, were given. It is clear that this discovery was preceded by long-running investigation work that succeeded in coming to fruition only last Friday evening. The fact that two other persons were detained is another sign that makes us believe that, in this case, we are dealing with a whole network of drug traffickers, whose tentacles in Albania have just been revealed. Thus the hypothesis presented--especially in recent times--of various persons within the Albanian territory being involved in the international drug traffic is thoroughly confirmed. On 9 March 1993, 10 grams of heroin and 53 small bottles of cocaine were confiscated, again in Durres, in the facilities of the Italian "Pellicano" Operation. The then vice-interior minister, Mehja, told GAZETA SHQIPTARE at that time of "the capture of the first Albanian drugs trafficker." Today--only one year later--a 50 times greater quantity of the best selling and most sought-after drug, which can fetch the price of $700,000 in the West, was discovered. It is not known yet whether this quantity of drugs belonged to any contingent intended to reach the Italian shores, or whether it was designed for domestic use. Yet that it was intended for trade remains the most certain hypothesis, because half a kilogram of heroin could not possibly be used by an ordinary drug-addicted maniac alone. Only one week prior to last Friday, the Italian authorities announced the detection of an international network of drug traffickers and the confiscation of 40 kg of heroin that was meant to pass via Albania to the Italian drug market. Besides--according to the Italian specialist--the existence of a mobile heroin refinery--moving to and fro, stationed now in Albania, now in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]--was confirmed. Nevertheless--unless a complete investigation is carried out, it cannot be ascertained that the quantity sequestrated in Albania belongs to the aforementioned drug refinery and network.
