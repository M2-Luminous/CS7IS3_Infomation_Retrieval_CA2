Dubnov; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] Today at the eastern district prefecture building in Moscow, a working conference of the leaders of the Russian All-People's Union [RANU] took place. The conference began with a wave of displeasure in the hall when the chairwoman attempted to address those in attendance as gentlemen. However, this vexing slip of the tongue did not affect the course of the meeting. On the agenda were economic and political issues as well as the RANU's tasks for the next six months. The greater part of a speech by Nikolay Pavlov, one of the RANU leaders, was devoted to criticizing the president and the government. On the whole, it contained nothing new: the accusation that Yeltsin and the government had organized the putsch, the dissolution of parliament, the slump in manufacturing, corruption and criticism of foreign policy, and of the START II treaty in particular. It was asked why so many people had perished on October 3-4 if the balance of forces in the new parliament will not, in the opinion of RANU members, be in favor of those now in power, in so far as former deputies and opposition members have once again got into the Duma. [sentence as heard] There was, however, recognition that the RANU is an insufficiently powerful political force and therefore it has been decided to re-register the movement as a party.
