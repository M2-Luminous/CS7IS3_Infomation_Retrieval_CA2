Arab responsibility makes it incumbent on all the parties to help close this painful chapter in Arab history. Iraq has rescinded the decision making Kuwait its 19th governorate. Iraqi Information Minister Hamid Yusuf Hammadi said in a news conference that Iraq has decided to drop the decision it announced following his country's invasion of the State of Kuwait on 2 August 1990. He said that Iraq has officially informed the United Nations of this decision, adding that it was the Iraqi parliament that rescinded the decision and the Revolution Command Council that ratified it. At the same time, Iraq's parliament speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih stated that his country is prepared to discuss all pending issues with Kuwait in order to achieve stability between the two countries. He said that these issues could be discussed with a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation when it visits Baghdad to check the facts and information on the issue of Kuwaiti detainees in Iraq. In the first comment on the decision, the Kuwaiti ambassador in Cairo said that such Iraqi statements do not add anything new. He added that Iraq had already rescinded the annexation decision so as to conclude the cease fire and then presented to the Security Council a memorandum saying that the cancellation was made under "the pressure of circumstances" of the time. But Iraq's media and political articles later once again began to reiterate the story of the 19th governorate. The ambassador explained that the way to solve this problem is for "Baghdad to recognize the Security Council and UN resolutions and the decisions of the borders demarcation committee whose establishment was approved by Iraq. These resolutions concern the borders, the prisoners, and compensations." The Kuwaiti ambassador called on the Iraqi side to deal with the prisoner issue through the International Committee of the Red Cross team that will be allowed to visit the prisons and detention camps. In his comment on the proposal to send a Kuwaiti parliamentary delegation or letting some parties undertake shuttle trips between Baghdad and Kuwait, he said that the Arab League secretary general has exerted great efforts in this regard and these trips will be futile without recognition of the international resolutions. Many circles believe that the recent Iraqi moves fall within the context of Iraq's desire to end the international sanctions imposed on it. Major countries such as France, Russia, and China support such a move and Turkey is insisting on it by raising the issue of the losses resulting from stopping the flow of Iraqi oil through its territories. These moves come against acts of blackmail and schemes led by the United States in the name of the United Nations. The monitoring of the situation in Iraq is used as an excuse for these acts. The United States has imposed a no-fly zone on northern Iraq on the pretext of protecting the Kurds in the north from the Iraqi regime's repression. This was done in accordance with a Western agreement concluded by the United States, Britain, and France outside the framework of the United Nations and the Security Council. In the meantime, we see that the Shiites in southern Iraq are subjected to the same sufferings but the United States has not provided them with the same measure of protection. Is it not astonishing to see the United States volunteering, by exploiting the United Nations name, to protect Iraq's Kurds but ignoring the fierce battles and massacres being perpetrated by Turkey's armed forces against the Kurds on the Turkish-Iraqi border areas? Is it not astonishing to see the U.S. President persisting in playing the role of the region's cop and ordering that air sorties continue on the pretext of protecting the Kurds even after the scandal of the downing of two UN planes over the no-fly zone in northern Iraq? One wonders about the true U.S. objectives toward Iraq. Are they really the implementation of the UN resolutions? Or are they the dismemberment of Iraq and the secession of the north from the south? Does the United States want to implement international legitimacy or to carve up Iraq and paralyze its economic, military, and human resources and capabilities? Is the complete erasure of Iraq as a state a supreme Arab interest? In whose interest is this being done at a time when the United States is making the deal of the century with Israel involving the "F-15A1" aircraft which the U.S. military arsenal has never sold to any country in the world and whose use has been limited to the U.S. Army alone? Does the Middle East peace from the U.S. point of view mean subjugating, starving, and humiliating the Iraqi people and exhausting their resources and at the same time arming Israel and enabling it to achieve complete economic hegemony over the Arab region in light of an overwhelming military domination? The State of Kuwait--government, parliament, and people--has the right to doubt the credibility of the latest Iraqi decision and no one disputes this fact because they are still living the bitter and painful experience ever since the invasion day. Any ordinary Kuwaiti citizen has the right to wonder about the seriousness of the Iraqi offer, ask what the guarantees are, and even stress the demand for such guarantees. We will have ignored the feelings of an entire nation if we do not achieve for Kuwait all the guarantees it demands. The whole Arab nation has the right to ask how long the imposition of the blockade on Iraq and the starvation and humiliation of the Iraqi people will continue. The Iraqi armed forces have withdrawn beyond the borders and the Security Council resolutions have been implemented to the full. Then how long will the United States continue to use the international organization as a tool to destroy the Iraqi people and land on the pretext of implementing international legitimacy resolutions? These same international legitimacy resolutions are being trampled in the Israeli-occupied territories and in Bosnia by the Serbs while the United States does not lift a finger. The Arab League is now required to benefit from the opportunity provided by the recent Iraqi decision and all nationalist forces are required in these circumstances to move urgently toward Baghdad and Kuwait to transform the Iraqi decision into reality. The Egyptian Solidarity Committee which groups all nationalist forces and personalities of all affiliations in Egypt has made a move and issued a comprehensive political statement emphasizing that Iraq's recent decision turns over a new page to regain Arab solidarity and assert Arab reconciliation that has become a pressing pan-Arab demand. The Iraqi decision removes an obstacle that had blocked Arab reconciliation based on respect for international legitimacy and national independence of all Arab countries. The decision is also an incentive for all nationalist forces, parties, and organizations to work to enhance Arab solidarity to liberate the occupied Arab territories. The Arab nation is now facing a difficult test; to be or not to be, submit and kneel to the new theorists who adopt the false slogans of Rabin and Peres about the promised peace, or remain steadfast, achieve Arab solidarity, fight for unity, and prove that pan-Arab security is not a lie but rather an established fact and that it will continue to exist today, tomorrow, and forever. Iraq's recent decision opens the doors for us to realize the dream of Arab solidarity and by a joint Arab solidarity we will achieve our desired Arab peace, a peace based on justice, liberation of all the land, and recovery of Jerusalem, not the peace of Rabin and his new incense carriers of some of the former left-wing figures who have gone astray.
