FR940711-2-00179 FR940711-2-00073 (4) HAs shall submit only one application (Form HUD&hyph;52515) for an allocation area. If both rental vouchers and rental certificates are requested on the same application, then the application will be given two project numbers, one for the Rental Voucher Program and one for the Rental Certificate Program. The total number of units applied for may not exceed the ten percent or 50-unit limitation. (5) Regional and State-wide HAs may submit one application for each allocation area, and each application will be considered separately. Each regional or State-wide HA application may request up to ten percent (10%) of the total rental vouchers and rental certificates the HA has under reservation for each allocation area as applicable, or 50 units, whichever is greater. (6) The HUD State or Area Office/Native American Programs Office will reduce the number of units requested in any application that exceeds the ten percent or 50-unit limit to the greater of ten percent (10%) of the total number of rental vouchers and rental certificates identified on the latest HUD-approved budget for the HA. D. Certification Regarding Drug-Free Workplace The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 requires grantees of Federal agencies to certify that they will provide a drug-free workplace. Thus, each HA must certify (even though it has done so previously) that it will comply with the drug-free workplace requirements in accordance with 24 CFR part 24, subpart F. E. Certification Regarding Lobbying Section 319 of the Department of the Interior Appropriations Act, Public Law 101&hyph;121, approved October 23, 1989, (31 U.S.C. 1352) (the Byrd Amendment) generally prohibits recipients of Federal contracts, grants, and loans from using appropriated funds for lobbying the Executive or Legislative Branches of the Federal Government in connection with a specific contract, grant, or loan. The Department's regulations on these restrictions on lobbying are codified at 24 CFR part 87. To comply with 24 CFR 87.110, any HA (other than an IHA that meets the definition of ``person'' in 24 CFR 87.105) submitting an application under this NOFA for more than $100,000 of budget authority assistance must submit a certification and, if warranted, a Disclosure of Lobbying Activities. To assist HAs, the texts for the Certification Regarding Lobbying and Standard Form LLL, Disclosure Form to Report Lobbying are available from the HUD State or Area Office. F. Checklist for Technical Requirements The following checklist specifies the required information that must be submitted in the HA's application. It is recommended, but not required, that the application contain a narrative explaining how the application meets the selection criteria.
