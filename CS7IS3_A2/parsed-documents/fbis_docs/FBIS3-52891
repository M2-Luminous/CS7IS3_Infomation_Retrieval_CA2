According to Lt. Gen Niranjan S. Malik who has been briefing the press, insurgent groups particularly in trouble-torn Nagaland and Manipur, are better armed and more militant than ever before. Bomb blasts, assassination attempts and `genocide', he reportedly said, have become the order of the day. The escalation in insurgent activity is ascribed to various factors. The most serious of them is the patronage of foreign agencies. Although it has long been suspected that some rebel groups have been assisted by Bangladesh and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence [ISI] agency, this is probably the first time that the seniormost army officer in the region has said as much. He claimed to have definite knowledge of other sources of foreign aid to the rebels as well. Malik specifically named the Muivah-Swu faction of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN-M) as a beneficiary in this context. The ISI is said to have launched a new organisation called the United Liberation Front of Seven Sisters in which the NSCN(M), the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA), the Bodo Security Force and other tribal groups are key participants. Just as disquieting was the revelation that the banned NSCN(M) which has emerged as one of the most formidable outfits in the North-East was recruiting immigrant Muslims. In the army's perception, the NSCN(M) has received a major psychological boost by being admitted as a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation based at the Hague and apparently gets financial assistance from it as well as from the American Baptist Church. All this has encouraged insurgent leaders on the one hand to believe that their cause has received international recognition and on the other to acquire arms and ammunition more easily. Last but not least, army officers say that the Nagaland police force has been grossly negligent in allowing its weapons to fall into the hands of underground groups. In this grim backdrop some comfort may be drawn from the fact of the doubling of security forces and army units deployed in the North-East since October 1. However, the army briefing raises crucial questions about the overall strategy being pursued by the Central Government in dealing with what appears to be a heightened level of insurgency. Clearly, if the army assessment of the situation is accepted, anti-insurgency operations will have to be stepped up especially in border areas. But this should not preclude political measures among which should be steps to stabilise and improve the functioning of the governments of Nagaland and Manipur. They will have to become both more responsive to popular aspirations and firm in dealing with troublemakers than they have proved so far to be.
