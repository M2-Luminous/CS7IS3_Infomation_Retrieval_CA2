In his introductory remarks at the opening of the sitting F. Mukhametshin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, dwelt on a number of the priority problems confronting Tatarstan. He emphasized that the treaty concluded between Tatarstan and Russia legally enshrined the path trodden by the Republic following the proclamation of state sovereignty. The results of the ballot on 13 March were a kind of vote of confidence by Tatarstanis in the policy chosen by the Republic. Now, F. Mukhametshin said, it is necessary to immediately begin formulation of the strategy of the political and economic development of Tatarstan under the new historical conditions. It is necessary to get right down to filling sovereignty with real content, assimilate to the maximum the possibilities that have been acquired, and engage as quickly as possible the mechanisms of realization of the central provisions of the treaty. It is necessary to formulate an official program specially for this. It is a question of painstaking work geared to confirmation of the durability of sovereignty. This means an intensification of the work [line illegible]. It is necessary to critically review the state of affairs in all sectors of the economy, analyze the financial, tax, and credit policy pursued by the government, and closely examine the priorities of economic support proposed by the president of the Republic of Tatarstan in his budget message for 1994. It is essential to revitalize the government's manifestly inadequate work on the search for internal reserves and possibilities of Tatarstan for imparting new impetus to the economic reforms, for a way out of the crisis, and for support for small and medium business. His speech noted particularly that an appreciable adjustment of the law-making activity of the Supreme Soviet and its Presidium was required under the new conditions. The Supreme Soviet should by political and legal means support the realization of the treaty and the state sovereignty of the Republic. New laws actively influencing the progress of the economic reform and laws ensuring the social protection of the populace are needed. It is necessary to accelerate the preparation of bills on a reform of the representative and executive organs of state power of Tatarstan. The obsolete forms are clearly holding back development here, F. Mukhametshin said. The chairman of the Supreme Soviet called attention to the need for an all-around analysis of the progress of privatization in the Republic and to the activity of the enterprises that have been converted into joint-stock companies and their relations with the treasury. Preparation for the spring field operations was cited as being among the priority areas of work today. The problem of the fight against crime must not disappear from the field of vision. With the participation of members of the government and deputy chairmen of city and rayon soviets of people's deputies of the Republic, the sitting then examined the question of the progress of realization of the basic provisions of the Law "On Languages of the Peoples of Tatarstan" in Zelenodolsk and Zelenodolskiy Rayon. The decree on this matter was assumed as a basis. The Presidium adopted the decision to continue the business of the Supreme Soviet 19th session on 16 April and to submit for its consideration the budget message of the president of the Republic of Tatarstan for 1994 and also a number of other supplementary questions. The sitting also examined other questions of the Republic's state life. M. Sabirov, prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, his deputy F. Khamidullin, and Finance Minister D. Nagumanov took part in the business of the Presidium and spoke. The sitting was chaired by F. Mukhametshin.
