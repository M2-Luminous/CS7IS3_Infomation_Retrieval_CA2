He said that "any such attempt would plunge the country into a whirlpool of unhelpful conflicts and divisions." In a telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT from his residence in the Syrian capital Damascus, he said it was very important that the agreement should go into practical implementation as soon as it was signed by Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and House of Representatives Speaker Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. He expressed hope that a venue and date would be set for the signing as soon as possible. [passage omitted] 'Ali Nasir also said: "What is important as far as we are concerned is that the basic principles reached should be implemented in an atmosphere of trust between members of the political leadership with nobody feeling that he won or lost. Everyone should feel that the triumph went to Yemen, the Yemeni people, their unity, and their stability." He emphasized the importance of implementation which, he said, was more significant than the signing. [passage omitted] 'Ali Nasir revealed that, in his telephone contacts with President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and Shaykh al-Ahmar the day before yesterday, he received assurances that the subcommittee assigned by the the Dialogue Committee to make arrangements for the signing ceremony had already begun its work and was preparing to select a venue and set a date for the signing of the agreement. [passage omitted] Concluding his telephone statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, he said that the local government system confirmed in the document was a worthy solution to many of the crises experienced under the Yemeni political system before and after the unity, and also an ideal solution for the people's suffering. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, the Sons of Yemen League believes that the agreement lays firm foundations for the building of united Yemen. In a statement it issued yesterday, it expressed full support for the document and appealed to all factions of the Yemeni people to stand united in support of that document and its implementation. It said that any delay or dithering in the implementation of the document would lead to a greater crisis in Yemen with no time for the mediators to mediate and no time for dialogue.
