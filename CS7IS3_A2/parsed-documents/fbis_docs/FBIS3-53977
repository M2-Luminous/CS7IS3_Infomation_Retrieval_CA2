The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan had invited al-'Aryan and al-Hudaybi to visit Jordan. AL-SABIL learned that the authorities did not give any convincing reasons for banning these two figures from entering the Kingdom. It is known that Counselor al-Hudaybi has visited Jordan several times, the last time was four months ago. Al-Hudaybi also led a delegation from the Islamic Movement in Egypt on a visit to Jordan in 1989 to meet with His Majesty King Husayn to congratulate him on the parliamentary elections. Sources in the Islamic Movement in Jordan expressed deep regret and surprise at this step, which takes place at a time when our country is boasting about the democratic atmosphere and the openness prevailing in it. The Islamic sources said that there is no explanation for banning these two figures from entering Jordan at this particular time, particularly since such a measure would tarnish the image of our country whose doors have always been open for guests from all sisterly and friendly countries.
