I recall that throughout the course of last year we had several "roundtables" and some very important documents on agreement were signed, but they have not been carried out and have had no substantive impact on the political situation. Today there is little correlation between the authorities and society's political forces. All the changes to the power structures have no connection with the situation in parliament, with the positions held by political parties, or with the demands of the trade unions. That is why the opposition undoubtedly has an interest in fundamentally resolving the question of power -- that is, winning the 1996 elections. And, in this sense, a moderate and calm opposition could have an interest in some kinds of consensual documents so as to buy time and prevent radicals on both flanks from destabilizing the situation in the country.
