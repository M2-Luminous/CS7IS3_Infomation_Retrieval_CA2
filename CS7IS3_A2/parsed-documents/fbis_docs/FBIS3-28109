He was speaking at a press conference held shortly after the government decided to abolish the 3 percent consumption tax and adopt a 7 percent "national welfare tax" on goods and services in April 1997 that will effectively raise the rate of the current consumption tax. Fujii said increased revenues from the new tax rate of over 8 trillion yen annually will be necessary from now on, citing 800 billion yen in spending on social welfare, 1.3 trillion yen in government goods purchases and 1.4 trillion yen in repayment of debt principle. Under a simple calculation, revenues from the new tax will exceed the reduced revenues from the tax cuts by some 2 trillion yen. Noting that 10 years will be needed to repay bonds worth 18 trillion yen to be issued to cover the tax cuts over three years, Fujii said the decision was a "tough choice" for the ministry but that the government's financial position would continue to be "tough." On income tax cuts worth 5.3 trillion yen, Fujii said the proportion of national income tax and local residential tax cuts would be "roughly 7 to 3." Concerning the three-year period before implementation, he said the government wants its stimulus package to be announced Thursday evening to help the economy on a "full-fledge recovery track in fiscal 1994 and a stable growth phase in fiscal 1995," and said the third year would be to monitor growth. Asked about the use of revenues from the new tax, Fujii said the specifics have yet to be decided but would include pensions and improvement of the social infrastructure linked to welfare. He vowed to do his utmost to win public support for the tax reform plan but declined to comment on the possibility of further tax hikes. Given the decision, the tax commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, is expected to compile its fiscal 1994 tax reform report next Tuesday, calling for widening the middle-income bracket to ease its tax burdens.
