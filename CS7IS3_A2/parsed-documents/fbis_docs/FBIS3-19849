Kohl also made it clear in Bonn today that he expects the Free Democrats to issue a coalition pledge in favor of the Union. The FDP has always known what is in its own best interests, Kohl said. He is confident they will continue to do so. In addition to this, they can hardly point out to voters the good work done by the coalition and at the same time announce its break-up.
