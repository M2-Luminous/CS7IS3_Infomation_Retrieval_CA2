Today, almost 100 years later, reflections and doubts are no less distressing, but thanks to the development of the social sciences we, as opposed to the poet, can express them in a more strict, more scientific form: "Having lost the status of a superpower, Russia moved swiftly into the ranks first of all of the developing and now of the regressing countries. It is possible that the danger of global military conflict does not threaten us, but internal instability, chaos, economic ruin and the psychology of losers comprise no fewer threats to national security." This quotation, having a clearly apocalyptic character, was taken from the work "The National Doctrine of Russia (Problems and Priorities)" which was prepared by the not unknown "RAU-Corporation." [For a translation of excerpts from this work, see the FBIS Report; Central Eurasia, Number FBIS-USR-94-047 dated 4 May 94]. Despite some painful prognoses (the transformation of inflation into galloping hyperinflation, gorwth of prices, fall of production, corruption of society, increase in crime, demographic regression, danger of a social explosion, etc.)the book also contains, frankly speaking, some unusually optimistic ideas. It is true that these are more general in character: "Russia is a great country with a great history, a difficult present and a great future. We believe that the approaching 21st century is the century of Russia." At first glance these prognoses about the near future cancel out these hopes for a kingdom of Freedom, Peace, Spirituality and Democracy. But this is only at first glance. In recent times one often hears the opinion that the situation in Russia cannot be forecast. According to all appearances, the very term "non-forecastable [neprognoziruyemost]" can, from a historical point of view, be understood as "it will be so lousy that there is nothing to even talk about." Such a position is accessible to many, although it is not very constructive. The authors of the "National Doctrine," in no way closing their eyes to today's problems, not only try to predict the situation, but also offer some short-term goals which may be general, but nonetheless help us to see a picture of civil peace and harmony. "As soon as a strong and responsible government is consolidated Russia will once again become a center of attraction." The reestablishment of Russia as a specific world, as a specific civilization, one of the subjects of world history--this is the goal for our country. And the main task of the patriotic movement is to avoid spontaneity, which can direct the development of our country into the channel of reaction. Today, in the opinion of the book's authors, we should turn our attention to those factors which unite us: The Motherland and the state. One more quotation: "The main thing today is to prevent the weakening and e disintegration of the state. It is impossible to do this only by the traditional administrative-state or financial methods: for Russia this is small. We must resurrect the Russian idea which forms the basis of unity and the natonal doctrine which represents the goals and tasks for developing society recognized by the majority..." "The National Doctrine" is not dogma, but an invitation to discussion. Reactions to the conclusions of the authors' collective, of course, will be extremely varied. The work itself is intended for those people who draft and make political decisions--first of all for deputies of the Federation Council. But not only for them. The new economic structures created as a result of market transformations are more and more actively being included in the political life of society. And this is understandable: their activity, earlier based on purely economic factors depends to an ever greater degree today on those processes which are taking place in spheres not directly connected with business. The possibility of forecasting, of predicting events, is extremely important for them, especially under the conditions of political and economic instability. It is no accident that many entrepreneurs, without any apparent benefits for themselves, are cooperating with scientists. Thus the latest work of the "RAU Corporation" was partially financed by a private company. The TOO [limited liability partnership] "Group MOST" paid for the preparation and publication of the "National Doctrine of Russia." It required 180 million rubles in order for this book to see the light of day. In the words of the leader of "Group MOST's" analytic service Ye. Ivanov, the sponsors do not completely share some of the ideas and suggestions of the "National Doctrine." First of all the idea of the economic basis of the doctrine gives rise to criticism. In Ivanov's opinion it has a one-sided character. No constructive alternative is provided in the criticism of the ideas and practices of monetarism. There is no new "model" of social-economic progress. The section "Military Security and the Military Policy of Russia" received particular criticism. History shows that it is better not to have enemies than to fight with them... Nonetheless the leadership of "Group-MOST" sees this work as "an interesting and necessary attempt to delineate and to a well-known degree work out a set of problems, without which thought it will be impossible to move ahead." As regards the authors of the "National Doctrine", in the words of the leader of the authors' collective A.I. Podberezkin "the RAU-Corporation responded with pleasure to the suggestion of Group MOST on writing this work. "If there are new orders in the future we are ready to fulfill them--that is our work." Someone, probably I.A.[Joseph] Brodsky said that if we elected a government according to their reading experience, and not their political program, there would be fewer ills on earth. It seems that this statement is just, to a certain degree, and in our case the experience gathered in the book "The National Doctrine of Russia" should help our society avoid many convulsions and cataclysms peculiar to it in the past.
