Tests using a prototype of the vaccine on monkeys have been promising, said Jean-Claude Chermann, head of the National Institute of Health and Medical Research and a co-discoverer of the AIDS virus in 1983 when he worked at the Pasteur Institute. If all goes well, tests on humans will begin in mid-1995 under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he added. The vaccine is designed to be taken orally along with the polio vaccine, which is relatively low-cost and easy to use, and thus make the AIDS vaccine widely accessible in Africa, he added.
