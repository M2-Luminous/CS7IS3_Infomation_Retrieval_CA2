Statistics from the General Administration of Customs show that the total trade volume between China and Japan last year reached 39.04 billion U.S. dollars. Hong Kong, the Chinese mainland's biggest trading partner in 1992, now is second on the list, followed by the United States. The mainland's trade volume with Hong Kong and the United States last year was 32.54 billion U.S. dollars and 27.65 billion U.S. dollars respectively. The figure for Sino-U.S. trade in 1993 rose by more than 10 billion U.S. dollars over the preceding year. The volume of indirect trade between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan province rose to 14.39 billion U.S. dollars, placing the province fourth on the list, one position ahead of Germany. China's trade ties with Germany developed at a steady pace and bilateral trade volume last year surpassed 10 billion U.S. dollars for the first time. Germany is also China's largest trading partner among the European Economic Community countries. Although trade volume between China and the Republic of Korea (ROK) last year failed to reach 10 billion U.S. dollars as was expected, ROK still has become China's sixth largest trading partner, surpassing Russia, which dropped from sixth to seventh place. The trade volume between China and ROK last year was 8.22 billion U.S. dollars, some 540 million U.S. dollars more than the figure for that between China and Russia. The eighth and the ninth trading partners of the Chinese mainland in 1993 were still Singapore and Italy, with which China's trade increased steadily. Canada, China's tenth largest trade partner in 1992, was replaced by Britain on the list. Trade between China and Britain last year was 3.59 billion U.S. dollars. According to customs statistics, China registered a trade deficit with all top ten trading partners except for Hong Kong, the United States and Britain. The Chinese mainland faced a deficit of 11.47 billion U.S. dollars last year in its indirect trade with Taiwan province, while its trade deficit with Japan was 7.47 billion U.S. dollars. The statistics also show that China enjoyed a favorable balance of trade with Hong Kong, the United States and Britain. China's trade surplus with Hong Kong and the United States last year was 11.58 billion U.S. dollars and 6.27 billion U.S. dollars respectively.
