The poll results, released Friday [11 February], showed that 67.6 percent of those interviewed replied "no" when asked if they had decided which party they will support, while only 32.4 percent said they had. The highest percentage of undecided was among women between the ages of 35 and 54, fluctuating between 73 and 75 percent in different municipalities. "The results show a high level of confusion among Italian voters and allow us to affirm undeniably that the percentages of support attributed to various parties or alliances are totally unreliable because, by referring to only one third of the electorate, they are scientifically unfounded," Directa stated, referring to polls that claimed Go Italy [Forza Italia], led by entrepreneur Paolo Berlusconi, topped the ratings with 24 percent. The number of undecided voters, Directa said, was the highest reported in the last 15 years just six weeks away from elections.
