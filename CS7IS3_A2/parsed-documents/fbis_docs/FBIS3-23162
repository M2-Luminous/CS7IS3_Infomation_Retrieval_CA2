It is one of the dirtiest crimes of terrorism and the most vile crimes of war. It is premeditated official terrorism being managed by the Israeli Government, a policy on which she sat up her entity since its establishment, under the protection of the West, and cover up provided by the Western forces supporting her terrorist policy which is founded on massacres. Although what happened represents the ugliest act of terrorism ever seen in the world and an act of blatant and gross terrorism, but we challenge the West to declare this reality and admit that the act carried out by the Israelis is a pre-planned act of official terrorism and part of a long chain of Israeli terrorist acts, and to condemn the Israelis for their terrorism. The West, who put the names of the Palestinian people's freedom fighters on the black list, are supplying the Israeli terrorist with arms, nuclear weapons and F-15 and F-16 war planes. It is the West who is supporting Israeli terrorism and sponsor it while they treat Palestinian freedom fighters as criminals despite the fact that they are fighting for the most sacred humanitarian cause in modern times. We believe that if there was a real security council other than the one dominated by the Christians, and there was a real United Nations, other than dominated by the Christians, we would have seen anyone who supported the Israeli terrorism and support it with weapons, nuclear weapons and other supplies put on the black list and subjected to air, naval and land embargo and be punished harshly for being a partner in terrorism and supplying the Israeli terrorist camp with weapons. We challenge the international community, if there is one, to fulfill their humanitarian and required duty to assert justice. And after what the world has seen this morning is their anyone who can claim that 'Abu Nidal and Ahmad Jibril. After their terrorism and the premeditated and organized official terrorism which may ensue by the Israeli entity, there is no terrorist state in the world like the Israeli entity and there is no state sponsoring terrorism in the world like those states which sponser Israel and supply her with weapons and forge a strategic alliance with her. 'Abu Nidal, Ahmad Jibril and other fighters of the Palestinian people are angels if compared with the Israeli savages, for the Palestinians have never committed horrific cirmes like those committed by the Israelis against innocent worshippers in this holy month. The Palestinian fighters are fighting in defence of their land occupied by the Israeli invaders and usurpers who came to it from overseas to commit these atrocities which shock human conscience. What is happening nowadays confirm the credibility of our viewpoint regarding this issue and prove the correctness of our dicta which we have repeatedly asserted.
