Faustino Igreja has further details. [Begin recording] [Igreja] The General Peace Accord's Supervision and Control Commission will continue to discuss the confinement problems tomorrow, at a time when the government admits responsibility for the delay being observed in sending its men to confinement centers. Deputy Planning Minister Tomas Salomao led the government's delegation to the CSC meeting. [Salomao] In practice, what is being observed in the field is that some confinement centers do not have the capacity to receive large numbers of troops. What is more, we experienced some logistical problems. The government is to blame for some of these problems, while institutions providing some products are to blame for other problems. Evidently, a process of this nature means that we were sending men to confinement centers and not pushing them there. All the same, we have reassessed the situation. We identified the critical points. It is true that there is some delay in the confinement process. The provincial commanders received instructions to speed up the process. Thus, when we assess the si??x> [?n?er to comment about the statement made by the Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader that his movement would interrupt the confinement process if there is no greater flow of government men to confinement centers by Saturday [22 January]. [Salomao] It is not a question of the government normalizing the situation by Saturday. It is a question of the parties carrying out their responsibilities. The government has its responsibilities in order to complete the number of troops to be sent to confinement centers. Renamo too has its responsibilities. If we see the numbers, we realize that it is not only on the government side that there is an imbalance. There is an imbalance on both sides. This being the case, the government has its responsibilities and Renamo too has its responsibilities. What the government has to do is to carry out its responsibilities and Renamo too must carry out its responsibilities. [Unidentified reporter] Mr. deputy minister, what is the situation at the moment regarding the collection of weapons at confinement centers? [Salomao] There was a proposal made by the president of the Cease-Fire Commission to immediately begin to collect 50 percent of the materiel found in confinement centers. We agreed with this position since security conditions for weapons at confinement centers are not good. It is therefore important that the weapons collected are sent to regional warehouses where the United Nations, the government, and Renamo have access to these warehouses. [Unidentified reporter] At the moment, we continue to experience riots by the armed forces. Some troops, who have not been confined, are raiding shops and blocking roads. Why can't we avoid these problems? [Salomao] I cannot say that riots are continuing. There were incidents at Namialo, Cuamba, and Massinga. There are reasons for some of these incidents -- delays in processing salaries, bad logistical conditions -- while others were just acts disturbance and agitation. Corrective measures to resolve these problems have been adopted. The chief of the general staff is carrying out work in the northern and central regions to assess the situation. We are therefore correcting the situation. [Igreja] During the CSC meeting, Radio Mozambique interviewed Raul Domingos, head of the Renamo delegation. [Domingos] We began a series of meetings today which, I think, will continue for a number of days. We shall meet again tomorrow and we are going to examine the report presented by the president of the Cease-Fire Commission today. [Unidentified reporter] [Words indistinct] President Dhlakama said that he would interrupt the confinement process if the government continues to drag its feet in confining its troops? [Domingos] Well, we have this forum. We shall use it to present our [words indistinct]. [Unidentified reporter] Renamo therefore expects to interrupt the confinement of troops? [Domingos] If that is necessary, we shall declare it here at the level of the commissions. [[Unidentified reporter] You therefore deny the statement by the Renamo president? [Domingos] I do not deny it. I am only saying that the statement made by my president will formally be presented here at the level of the commissions. [Igreja] Aldo Ajello, special representative of the UN secretary general, thinks the situation will improve. [Ajello] There is a report which was presented by the president of the Cease-Fire Commission on the confinement process. There are delays and there are problems. We are discussing these problems to see how we can resolve them and so that the parties can have the time to study the report from the president of the Cease-Fire Commission that we are going to present now. Tomorrow afternoon, at 1500, we shall resume our meeting and discuss the report. [Unidentified reporter] Do you consider valid the government's reasoning that there are technical problems concerning the confinement process? [Ajello] I want to understand what these problems are. If they are technical problems, we want to see how can assist in resolving them to have a correct confinement process, because now it is not progressing smoothly. [Unidentified reporter] The Renamo president said that he is going to interrupt the confinement of Renamo forces if the government continues [words indistinct]? [Ajello] I do not think the government will continue not confining its troops. The government is resolving the problem and beginning to confine troops in 15 areas approved in December. I do not believe there will be a need to disrupt the process. [end recording]
