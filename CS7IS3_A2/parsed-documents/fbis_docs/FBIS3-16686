The amount the state owes to the military department no longer increases by the year but by the month. While it totaled 5 percent of the military budget at the end of 1992, it was 25 percent in December last year, and at the beginning of this year the Defense Ministry received only 63 percent of planned appropriations. This money was scarcely sufficient to pay half the amount owed to suppliers of equipment, arms, and property. For the first time the Russian defense minister declared that "If the funding situation does not change in the near future, there can be no question not only of reforming the army, providing it with modern weapons and equipment, and a qualitative renewal, but also of ensuring Russia's security." This -- let us say bluntly -- sensational statement by the head of the military department was prompted by the fact that the military budget being proposed by the Finance Ministry meets only 46-47 percent of the army and navy's minimum requirements. If it is adopted the Defense Ministry will have to sharply cut (by three-fourths) military orders at defense enterprises, which in turn will lead to the defense sector's final collapse, a fall in industrial production as a whole, and increased unemployment. In addition, what is inevitably the latest wholesale reduction of the armed forces by 400,000 men, which will have a boomerang effect on the army's combat readiness and the state budget (discharging 70,000 servicemen now costs the treasury a trillion rubles), will also lead to an explosion of social tension among the troops.
