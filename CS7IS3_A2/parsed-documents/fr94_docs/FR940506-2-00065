FR940506-2-00065 FR940506-2-00042 Analysis of Consent Order To Aid Public Comment The Federal Trade Commission has accepted an agreement, subject to final approval, to a proposed consent order from respondents AJM Packaging Corporation, a Michigan corporation, and Abram Epstein, an officer of said corporation. The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement and take other appropriate action, or make final the agreement's proposed order. This matter concerns the package labeling of ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates. The Commission's complaint in this matter charges that respondents' labeling falsely represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates are recyclable after ordinary use. In fact, the complaint alleges, while ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates are capable of being recycled, the vast majority of consumers cannot recycle the product because there are virtually no collection facilities that accept used paper plates for recycling. The complaint further charges that the respondents' labeling contained unsubstantiated representations concerning the plates' alleged degradability and the environmental benefits that could be obtained when the bags were disposed of as trash that is subsequently buried in a sanitary landfill (customary disposal). The complaint alleges that the respondents represented that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates offer a significant environmental benefit when consumers customarily disposed of them, and that ``Nature's Own Green Label'' disposable paper plates will completely break down, decompose and return to nature_ i.e., decompose into elements found in nature_within a reasonably short period of time after customary disposal. The proposed consent order contains provisions designed to remedy the violations charged and to prevent the respondents from engaging in similar acts and practices in the future. Part I of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease representing, in any manner, directly or by implication, that any of their paper products or packages are ``degradable,'' ``biodegradable,'' or ``photodegradable,'' or through the use of such terms or similar terms, that any such product or package offers any environmental benefits when consumers dispose of them as trash that is buried in a sanitary landfill, unless the respondents have competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate the representations at the time they are made. Part II of the proposed order requires that the respondents cease misrepresenting, in any manner, directly or by implication, the extent to which any paper product or package is capable of being recycled or the extent to which recycling collection programs are available. Part III of the proposed order requires the respondents to cease representing that their products or packages offer any environmental benefit, unless at the time of making such a representation, the respondents possess and rely upon competent and reliable evidence, which when appropriate must be competent and reliable scientific evidence, that substantiates such representations. Part IV of the proposed order permitted the respondents to deplete their existing inventory of certain paper plate product packaging in the normal course of business without violating the order until October 31, 1993. The proposed order also requires the respondents to maintain materials relied upon to substantiate the claims covered by the order, to distribute copies of the order to certain company officials, to notify the Commission of any changes in corporate structure that might affect compliance with the order, to notify the Commission of any changes in the business or employment of the named individual respondent, and to file one or more reports detailing compliance with the order. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed order. It is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms. Donald S. Clark, Secretary.
