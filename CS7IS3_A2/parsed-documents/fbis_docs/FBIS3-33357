A total of 280 men and 311 women were polled with 352 interviews conducted at the middle socioeconomic level, 66 at the upper level, and 182 at the lower level. When asked if they favored the presence of U.S. engineers in Juanchaco, 34 percent of the respondents said yes and 54 percent said no. Asked if they were familiar with the State Council's opinion on President Gaviria's decision to allow the military engineers in Juanchaco, 73 percent said yes and 27 percent said no. Asked if they agreed or disagreed with the State Council's position, 37 percent said yes, 32 percent said no, and 4 percent either did not answer or did not know. When the 600 Colombians were asked if they had heard, watched, or learned of the president's strong reply to the State Council, 71 percent said yes and 29 percent said no. Asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the president's reply, 27 percent said they agreed, 40 percent said they disagreed, and 4 percent said they did not know or did not answer. When asked the final question of whether their image of President Gaviria was positive or negative, 54 percent said it was positive, 41 percent said negative, and five percent said they did not know or refused to answer. Despite criticisms in the past few weeks for flying a folkloric musical group in the presidential plane to celebrate his wife's birthday and the controversy elicited by the U.S. military engineers in Juanchaco, Valle Department, Gaviria's image is still good and his popularity is still well above 50 percent. His popularity rating reached 65 percent last year.
