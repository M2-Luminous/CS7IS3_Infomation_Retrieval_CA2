All of the dead or wounded were army officer cadets. The home-made bomb, hidden in a rubbish bin at a railway station, went off shortly after they were let out for the weekend. A press statement released later by the pro-Kurdish agency Kurd-[H]a said the bombing was carried out by an "underground revenge group" of the Popular Army for the Liberation of Kurdistan. Some 60 people have been killed this month alone in separatist skirmishes in the east and southeast of the country, according to an AFP tally based on official reports. There has been a total of 11,000 deaths, including 3,300 civilians, since the start of the Kurdish rebellion in 1984.
