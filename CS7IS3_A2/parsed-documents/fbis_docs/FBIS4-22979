Semenchenko; UDC 519.6] [Abstract] This article gives a brief outline of the parallel cross sections method implemented on a YeS multiprocessor computer and presents some results obtained in experimental calculations. The basic steps taken to solve a system of linear algebraic equations in this computing system are described. The system of equations is assumed to include a packed matrix. The system is pre-ordered, reducing the matrix to a block-diagonal form with edging. The pre-ordering process is described. The matrix pre-ordering programs are written in Fortran. The second step is the construction of matrix blocks. This is followed by construction of external files of initial data for the computing system. The results are sent to arithmetic processors and the pre-ordered system is solved using special algorithms described in this article. Examples are presented. Conditions in which this method may be efficiently used are described. Figures 3; table 1; references 7 (Russian).
