Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias confirmed this late last night and mentioned that the meeting was held last Friday [14 January], and that the Greek ambassador conveyed the Greek positions. AS ELEVTHEROTIPIA reported late last week, Vance asked to meet the Greek side for a new discussion on Skopje. Last Friday's meeting is the first visible move by the special mediator to examine the possibility of resuming the dialogue, either directly or through the United Nations. He Confirmed It is recalled that UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali last week expressed both officially and unofficially the UN intention to move the issue again (following Papoulias' letter postponing the dialogue). So far, Vance has not commented. Lord Owen, the international mediator on the Yugoslav issue, arrived in Athens yesterday afternoon and fully confirmed UN moves on Skopje. Although Skopje is not among the issues he is handling, Owen (who last year was a mediator on Skopje) said: "...As you know, the UN secretary general asked Vance to facilitate, if he can, any dialogue either through the UN process or through direct talks between Athens and Skopje...." With this statement, Lord Owen confirmed that "something is going on" within the UN to resume the talks but presented two alternative solutions: either through the United Nations or through direct talks. Some of the media misinterpreted Owen's remarks, initially giving the impression that the mediator on the Yugoslav issue "was revealing" that a "secret dialogue" or secret diplomacy between Athens and Skopje existed. During their joint news conference, Owen clarified his remarks, saying: "I do not believe there is a secret dialogue.... I mentioned two alternative solutions, direct talks or talks through the United Nations." He did not hide his preference for direct talks. For his part, Papoulias stressed: "There are no secret or behind-the-scenes negotiations." He reiterated the well-known Greek position and stressed that Greece is ready to accept a move from [Macedonian President Kiro] Gligorov's side (about the flag, symbols, constitution) before the talks can resume.
