Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) developed the project, which costs more than 700 million German marks [DM], with the Israeli arms firm Elta. "As a result of imprecise descriptions of the situation, it was possible at times to give the impression" that there is "no firm contract" beyond the delivery of the first series of 60 devices, the Defense Ministry admits in a confidential "situation note." However, what is correct is "that from the very beginning, there has been a commitment to buy 110 system units from the Israeli side." Social Democratic Party Deputy Horst Jungmann in the past has criticized innumerable inconsistencies in the procurement and accused the ministry of "deliberate deception." However, there is still no end to the tricks. While the approval of another 50 devices has so far been made dependent on "proof of their effectiveness in troop tests," now one only speaks of "integrated company and official tests" in test labs, even though in the budget the military pushed through a DM1-million test stand for testing Cerberus in the troops.
