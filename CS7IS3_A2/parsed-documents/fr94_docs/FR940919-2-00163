FR940919-2-00163 FR940919-2-00068 [Rel. No. 34&hyph;34653; File No. SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;32] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change Amending the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation Relating to Short Sales September 12, 1994. On July 28, 1994, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD'' or ``Association'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change 1 pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 2 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. 3 The rule change amends the Prompt Receipt and Delivery of Securities Interpretation (``Interpretation'') issued by the NASD Board of Governors under Article III, Section 1 of the NASD Rules of Fair Practice. 4 1 The NASD amended the proposed rule change subsequent to the original filing on May 26, 1994. Amendment No. 1 was filed in order to clarify that the proposal applies to both NASD members and persons associated with NASD members. 2 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 3 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4. 4 NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice, Art. III, Sec. 1, (CCH) ¶2151.04. The NASD proposes to amend the Interpretation to require members or persons associated with members, to annotate the affirmative determination made prior to effecting a short sale. The affirmative determination requirement already appears in the Interpretation and requires, among other things, that members or associated persons assure that the securities involved in a sale will be available by settlement date. For long sales, the affirmative determination is required to be noted on the order ticket at the time the order is placed. The Interpretation as it currently reads, however, does not require that such determination be evidenced in any specific manner with respect to short sales. Under the Interpretation as amended, members or associated persons will be required to annotate, on the trade ticket or on some other record maintained for that purpose by the member, the following information in order to comply with the affirmative determination requirement for short sales: 1. Where a customer assures delivery, the member or associated person must annotate that conversation noting the present location of the securities; whether the securities are in good deliverable form; and whether the securities will be delivered to the firm within time for settlement; or 2. Where the member or associated person locates the stock, an annotation must be made that identifies not only the number of shares needed to cover the short sale but also the individual and firm contacted that offered assurance that the shares would be delivered or were available for borrowing by settlement date. 5 5 Pursuant to Rule 440C, The New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE'') also requires NYSE members to make affirmative determinations prior to effecting short sales and to annotate such determinations. NYSE Information Memo 91&hyph;41 (October 18, 1991). In its proposed amendment to the Interpretation, the NASD has not specified the manner in which a member or person associated with a member must annotate compliance with the affirmative determination requirement applicable to short sales. It is clear, however, that the affirmative determination requirement contained in the amendment to the Interpretation applies to each and every transaction; a ``blanket'' or standing assurance that securities are available for borrowing is not acceptable to satisfy the requirement as is evidenced by the duty to annotate. Notice of the proposed rule change, as amended, together with its terms of substance was provided by issuance of a Commission release 6 and by publication in the Federal Register . 7 No comments were received in response to the Notice. This order approves the proposed rule change. 6 Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 34487 (August 4, 1994). 7 59 FR 40931 (August 10, 1994). As the NASD indicated in its filing, requiring annotations will enhance member compliance with the affirmative determination requirement already imposed by the Interpretation and will enable the NASD to examine member compliance with the rule more effectively. The NASD also noted that the amendment will make clear the NASD's longstanding policy that firms may not rely on daily facsimile sheets of ``borrowable stocks'' to satisfy their obligations under the Interpretation. The addition of the annotation requirement will preclude this practice as members or their associated persons will have to annotate the name of the person contacted, the name of the firm contacted and the number of shares for each short sale. The Commission has determined to approve the NASD's proposal. The Commission finds that the rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD, including the requirements of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. 8 Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and in general to protect investors and the public interest. The proposal will enable the NASD to more effectively enforce an already existing provision of the Prompt Receipt and Delivery Interpretation requiring members of their associated persons to affirmatively determine that shares relating to a short sale are available for delivery to a purchaser. 8 15 U.S.C. 78o&hyph;3(b)(6). Requiring annotation of affirmative determinations will also enhance the NASD's ability to examine for member compliance with various other NASD short sale rules including those found in Article III, Section 21 of the Rules of Fair Practice (record keeping) 9 and in the Uniform Practice Code, Section 71 (mandatory close-outs). 10 Further, the annotation requirement will assist the NASD in examining for member compliance with the short sale rule or ``bid test,'' recently granted temporary 18 month approval by the SEC. 11 9 NASD Manual, Rules of Fair Practice, Article III, Sec. 21, (CCH) ¶2171. 10 NASD Manual, Uniform Practice Code, Sec. 71, (CCH) ¶3571. 11 Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 34277 (June 29, 1994), 59 FR 34885 (July 7, 1994). It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule change SR&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;32 be, and hereby is, approved. For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 12 12 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
