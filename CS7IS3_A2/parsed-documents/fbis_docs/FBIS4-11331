According to press reports, 47 men, 27 women, and 20 children had been aboard the boat "Casilda 127," which sailed furtively from the island on 15 April bound for Miami, Florida. The boat, however, was forced to change course for Mexico because of an engine malfunction. Mario Villanueva, governor of Quintana Roo, has told EL FINANCIERO that Cubans apparently use this state as a "springboard" to the United States. As for another group of 85 Cubans who arrived at Chetumal on 11 April, the Government Secretariat has reported that they were given legal authorization to stay on Mexican territory for 180 days under a non-immigrant visitor status. The Secretariat announced that the boat, "Ferrocemento 25," will be put at the disposal of its legal owner, the Cuban Government, as soon as its legal ownership is determined. [sentence as received] The U.S. Department of State recently announced that it will continue to refuse entry into the United States of Cubans who use third countries. In turn, the Havana Government has systematically denounced the political manipulation by the United States of the flow of Cuban emigrants. It has been said that, while the U.S. Interests Section in Havana grants visas to 30 percent of those who request them, the U.S. Government accepts and gives special treatment to those who arrive illegally. U.S. legislators have pointed out the discriminating treatment given to other illegal immigrants, including Haitians and Mexicans, who are returned to their countries.
