"ABRI's social-political role cannot be separated from a discussion of ABRI's dual function as a moral and political concept, given the background of its identity and the way it came into being," said Armed Forces Chief of Staff General (Army) Feisal Tanjung in a speech to Kostrad [Army Strategic Reserves Command] officers at Kostrad's 33d anniversary on Saturday (5 March). The Armed Forces Chief of Staff said that as people's social life has grown more critical and has developed further, ABRI has to update its role as pioneer, stabilizer, and dynamizer in national life. "We carry out this role actively by making decisions about state and government problems, by developing Pancasila [Five Principles of the Nation] democratic life, the constitution, and the rule of law," said Feisal Tanjung. To understand ABRI's social-political role in the widest sense, the Armed Forces Chief of Staff explained that what is needed is the ability to think within the general macrosystem which is integrated into the paradigm of Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution. We must also think within the special microsystem of our ideological, political, economic, sociocultural, and defense-security life. "In order to anticipate problems, ABRI's social-political role must in fact be increased," said Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung. That is why every ABRI soldier is always aware that he plays both a defense and security role and a social-political role. Members of ABRI must lend support to creating conducive social-political conditions. The approach used must persuasively put forth arguments acceptable to all sides. "Avoid giving the impression that ABRI is showing off its power," the Armed Forces Chief of Staff asserted. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung said that in the next five years ABRI's social-political role will take the form of a force of thought rather than a purely physical form. This means that ABRI personnel will have less of a presence in the executive and judicial fields. "Only strategic positions will still be occupied by ABRI personnel. However, ABRI will still be present in the legislative bodies, both at the federal level and in the provinces," said the Armed Forces Chief of Staff. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung's speech reemphasized that ABRI will continue to push for a structured national and state life. "ABRI will continue to try to put the implementation of Pancasila democracy on a firm basis in order to create high quality, dynamic, creative, and responsible political superstructures and infrastructures," said Armed Forces Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung.
