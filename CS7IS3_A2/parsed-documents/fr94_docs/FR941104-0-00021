FR941104-0-00021 FR941104-0-00009 C. Washington's Corrective Action Program The State of Washington's authorized RCRA program is set forth in Chapter 173&hyph;303 of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC), entitled ``Dangerous Waste Regulations''. The Dangerous Waste Regulations include both authorized and non-authorized requirements. Washington has amended the Dangerous Waste Regulations to include corrective action requirements; however, Washington may also rely on its existing state ``superfund-like'' cleanup authority, Model Toxics Control Act (MTCA), and its implementing regulations in Chapter 173&hyph;340 entitled ``Model Toxics Control Act Cleanup Regulation'', to implement corrective action requirements and to compel corrective actions. The statutory authority for the Dangerous Waste Regulations is found in the Revised Code of Washington (RCW), Chapters 70.105 and 70.105D. RCW 70.105D.030(1)(d) is the statutory provision which allows the State of Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) to carry out all state programs authorized under the federal RCRA statute. RCW 70.105.130 designates Ecology as the agency tasked with implementing the authorized RCRA program and provides Ecology with the authority to establish a permit system for owners or operators of facilities which treat, store, or dispose of dangerous waste. RCW 70.105.020 authorizes Ecology to revise and modify the Dangerous Waste Regulations. Statutory authority for MTCA is also found in RCW Chapter 70.105D. RCW 70.105D.030(2) authorizes Ecology to adopt rules to set cleanup standards for remedial actions taken under MTCA authority. RCW 70.105D.050(1) explicitly grants Ecology the authority to issue orders under MTCA to direct potentially liable parties to conduct remedial action. Washington may compel corrective action by issuing orders pursuant to MTCA to owners and operators of facilities seeking or required to have a permit to manage dangerous waste. Such orders are referred to as ``state corrective action orders''. State corrective action orders will be somewhat hybrid, presenting RCRA corrective action requirements in the context of a state ``superfund-like'' cleanup. EPA emphasizes that corrective action requirements are not being deferred to a state superfund-like authority; rather, the state authority will be used to compel RCRA corrective action requirements. In order to fulfill the RCRA Section 3004 (u) and(v) requirement that all RCRA permits must include corrective action permit conditions, state corrective action orders will be incorporated into RCRA permits issued pursuant to the authorized State program permitting regulations. Washington's corrective action program would allow corrective action to be specified through the terms of a State-issued order which is incorporated by reference into operating or post-closure permits issued to facilities. The State could: 1) issue the order in advance of the permit; 2) modify the permit to incorporate the order; or 3) simultaneously issue the order and the permit with the order incorporated into the permit. Under the Washington program, a State order would be considered to be part of the authorized RCRA program only when the order is incorporated into an existing RCRA permit, or when the order is issued simultaneously with and incorporated by reference into a new RCRA permit. D. Comparison of Washington's Corrective Action Program to the Federal Program Ordinarily, States await promulgation of Federal regulations prior to submitting their applications. However, there is no impediment under the RCRA statutory provisions which would bar a State from seeking authorization of a program in advance of Federally promulgated regulations provided the State bases its program on existing Federal statutory language. An existing Federal counterpart is the critical nexus in the authorization program. Washington's corrective action program goes slightly beyond the EPA-promulgated regulations (see 40 CFR 264.100 and 264.101) which implement the statutory provisions of sections 3004(u) and (v) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6924(u) and (v), in which facilities seeking a permit are required to undertake corrective action for all releases of hazardous waste or constituents from any solid waste management unit (SWMU) and to undertake such corrective actions beyond the property boundary where necessary. Washington's program will instead utilize its existing Superfund-like cleanup order authority (the Model Toxics Control Act) through the State's authorized RCRA program by linking the cleanup order authority with the State's authorized RCRA program permitting requirements to fulfill the mandates of sections 3004(u) and (v) of RCRA, 42 U.S.C. 6924(u) and (v). The statutory language of Section 3004(u) of RCRA applies to corrective action at solid waste management units. Although no statutory or regulatory definition of ``solid waste management unit'' has been promulgated, EPA's proposed Subpart S corrective action rule, published in the Federal Register on July 27, 1990 (55 FR 30798), contains EPA's most current interpretation of key terms in section 3004(u) of RCRA. This is and will be the controlling interpretation against which Washington's regulatory definition of solid waste management unit shall be measured until EPA codifies a statutory or regulatory definition. The statutory language of section 3004(u) of RCRA also applies to ``facilities seeking a permit.'' Such facilities include those hazardous waste management facilities which are required to obtain permits to operate and to those subject to post-closure permits. EPA has interpreted this language to mean that corrective action must be specified in operating or post-closure permits issued to such facilities.
