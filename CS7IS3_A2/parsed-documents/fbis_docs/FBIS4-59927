This statement was made by Police Minister Moshe Shahal to our correspondent Nisim Qeynan. Shahal added that responsibility for guarding the Green Line between the Gaza Strip and Israel will be handed over from the army to the Israel Police. In the next few days, the police command will take charge of the Lakhish region and the Southern Command's home front headquarters, thus creating a continuous and uniform command. The minister noted that within two weeks, he will announce the establishment of a sixth police district to be in charge of the autonomy. The police minister made the remarks during a tour of northern Gaza Strip today. Commissioner Asaf Hefetz, Israel Police commander, expects no special problems in conducting safe passage between the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He expects tight cooperation between the Israeli and the autonomy police forces. Today, Commissioner Hefetz visited the Northern District for the first time since he assumed duty as police chief. He told our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv that he sees no change taking place on the ground following Yasir 'Arafat's call for a jihad.
