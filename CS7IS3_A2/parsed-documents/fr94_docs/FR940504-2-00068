FR940504-2-00068 FR940504-2-00058 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Finance Docket No. 32482] Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc.; Continuance in Control Exemption; GWI Switching Services, L.P. Genesee and Wyoming Industries, Inc. (GWI), has filed a notice of exemption to continue in control of GWI Switching Services, L.P. (GWISS), 1 upon GWISS becoming a class III rail carrier. 1 GWI Dayton, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of GWI, is the sole general partner of GWISS and has exclusive management control. GWISS, a noncarrier, has concurrently filed a notice of exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481, GWI Switching Services, L.P._Operation Exemption_Southern Pacific Transportation Company, to operate a rail car storage yard owned by CMC Railroad I Ltd., and to operate under trackage rights over a railroad line owned by Southern Pacific Transportation Company (SP) between SP's rail yard and CMC's yard in the vicinity of Dayton, TX. 2 That transaction was expected to be consummated on or after April 5, 1994. 2 Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) has filed a petition to reject the notices of exemption and the United Transportation Union (UTU) has filed a petition to revoke the notices of exemption and a motion to stay the transaction. BLE argues that the notices should be rejected because the Commission does not have jurisdiction over the transaction in Finance Docket No. 32481, as it involves yard operations which are exempt under 49 U.S.C. 10907 and not operations over a line of railroad under 49 U.S.C. 10901 and 49 CFR 1150.1. UTU argues that the exemption in Finance Docket No. 32481 should be revoked, alleging that this is a sham transaction to avoid Commission regulation and labor protective conditions under 49 U.S.C. 11343. These issues will be addressed in a separate decision. GWI also directly controls eight existing class III common carriers by rail: the Allegheny & Eastern Railroad, Inc., the Bradford Industrial Rail, Inc., Buffalo & Pittsburgh Railroad, Inc., the Dansville and Mount Morris Railroad, the Louisiana & Delta Railroad, Inc., the Rochester & Southern Railroad, Inc., and the Willamette & Pacific Railroad, Inc. GWI indicates that: (1) The rail lines to be acquired and operated will not connect with any of GWI's rail subsidiaries; (2) the continuance in control is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any other railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction therefore is exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist., 360 I.C.C. 60 (1979). Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: James B. Gray, Jr., 700 Midtown Tower, Rochester, NY 14604. Decided: April 28, 1994. By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings. Sidney L. Strickland, Jr., Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;10691 Filed 5&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 7035&hyph;01&hyph;P
