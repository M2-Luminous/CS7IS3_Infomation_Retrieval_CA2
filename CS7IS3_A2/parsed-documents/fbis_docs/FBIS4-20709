The prime minister, accompanied by the transport minister, made a point of inspecting the port of Algiers in person, during a surprise visit yesterday. During his tour, Mr. Redha Malek was informed by EPAL [Algiers port authority] officials of the degree of completion of the container terminal construction project, of the port development strategy and, of course, of the considerable delays in unloading and delivering goods. At present, 140,000 tons of goods are stored on the quays and in the hangars, waiting for their owners to come and get them. This excessive use of storage areas, therefore, considerably hampers the port traffic, even though all maritime activities are directly affected by the recession. For instance, 30,000 tons of lumber and iron, most of which were imported by Metalsider, Cosider and Enab, are awaiting delivery. In addition, 3,800 containers containing household appliances, agricultural, chemical, and food products, and vehicles are awaiting an improbable delivery. This situation is due to the dilapidated state of the handling and processing facilities. The port of Algiers has about 80 cranes, much more than half of which are broken down. Forklifts are not doing any better; most of them do not work. The congestion at the port is also due to the small depth of casting off stations. Since the port has not been dredged for many years, the average water depth has decreased from 11 to 6 meters. High-draft ships must sometimes wait until a dock of suitable size becomes free. Actually, ship traffic decreased by 4.63 percent in 1993. During that year, 473 ships docked at Algiers, compared with 496 the year before. Paradoxically, the EPAL is doing better, financially, under these crisis conditions. Its net results showed a 19.1-percent increase. But this performance is the result of increases in port tariffs. In other words, the port authority still must solve a major problem: that of congestion. The government is expected to take measures to do just that.
