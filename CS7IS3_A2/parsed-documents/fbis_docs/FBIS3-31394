Commenting on the WASHINGTON POST's article in the TV evening news bulletin "Panorama" on Tuesday, Kolodziejczyk said: "I have reasons to believe that this is merely a big provocation against the Polish Army and, perhaps, not only that." The U.S. paper wrote on Monday that Poland had sold Soviet arms, radars, tanks, torpedoes, and parts of anti-aircraft systems to the United States for about 150-200 million dollars during the 1980s.
