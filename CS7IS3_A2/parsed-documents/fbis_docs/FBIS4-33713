FBIS4-33713 "drlat112_m_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-112 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 Brazil Cardoso Claims `Copyright' for Economic Plan Cardoso Claims `Copyright' for Economic Plan PY1006012894 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2122 GMT 8 Jun 94 PY1006012894 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO Portuguese BFN [By Marta Salomon] [Text] Brasilia, 8 Jun (AE) -- Fernando Henrique Cardoso, presidential candidate of the PSDB-PFL-PTB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party-Liberal Front Party-Brazilian Labor Party] coalition, today contended that he has a copyright for the economic plan, and that he does not intend to separate his presidential campaign from the new currency, the real. Upon being informed that he will be served notice by the Superior Electoral Court (TSE) about his using the economic plan in his electoral campaign, Cardoso angrily said: "They have no right to take that away from me." TSE Judge Flaqquer Scartezzini sent the notice to Cardoso's apartment. Cardoso will have to answer the charge in five days. Before even reading the notice, Cardoso said: "They are exaggerating." Showing disbelief about the TSE proceeding on the basis of a charge made by Deputy Carlos Lupi (Democratic Labor Party-Rio de Janeiro), he said: "The court is not going to do that." Lupi is asking the TSE to declare Cardoso ineligible on grounds of abusing his authority and using the economic plan for electoral purposes. Lupi contends that Cardoso set the timetable for the economic plan to suit his electoral interests. Cardoso said: "I feel hurt." He charged that "they should instead be chasing the thieves operating in areas where the justice system is faltering." He added: "This is hard to believe. A Stalinist regime is going to be reinstated here." As of this afternoon the campaign command of the PSDB-PFL-PTB coalition has not yet received an official notice. This court action threatens to undermine Cardoso's main campaign strategy. His allies are indeed seeking to strengthen his links with the economic plan and with declining inflation rates. "I am the father of the idea. They cannot say that Fernando Henrique Cardoso has nothing to do with the real," he said. PSDB President Pimenta da Veiga contends that "one cannot overlook the biography of the author of the plan." He added: "An absurd attempt is being made to separate Cardoso from his plan, to which he is closely linked." PFL leader Luiz Eduardo Magalhaes (Bahia State), who is a member of the campaign political command, said: "Cardoso is the author of the plan, and can claim his copyright." In the opinion of Cardoso's allies, the first concrete results of the fight against inflation will in early August cause the PSDB candidate to leap forward in the opinion polls. Cardoso's political command does not concede the charge that the date for implementing the new currency was moved up to suit Cardoso's electoral interests. Cardoso has not denied, however, that he has kept in close touch with the economic team and with President Itamar Franco, who openly works for his presidential candidacy.
