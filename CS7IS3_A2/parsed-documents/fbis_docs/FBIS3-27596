The president of China Southern, Yu Yanen, is likely to be stripped of power and replaced by a manager from another Chinese airline, according to mainland sources. The conflict erupted in the State Council last month after a Vice-Premier, Zou Jiahua, backed Yu in resisting attempts by civil aviation officials to force China Southern to buy six Airbus A-340s, the sources said. Zou's 10-character letter of support for Yu, a copy of which was sent confidentially to Yu, read: "He [Yu] has a point. We need to reconsider it." But Zou's attempt to intervene on behalf of his close associate was criticised by other senior leaders. "Mr Zou does not speak for the whole State Council," several unidentified state councillors said in an internal circular. When China signed contracts for the aircraft, during a visit to Beijing last November by the Gerrnan Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the main motivation was to show the United States "we can do without Boeing", the sources said. Yu, whose China Southern flew only Boeings, argued that individual airlines should have autonomy in making aircraft purchase decisions. He accused the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) of withholding approval for long-haul flights to Europe and the U.S. unless China Southern accepted the A-340s. But CAAC officials cited a 1984 document which said airlines could make decisions on "aircraft-related equipment" but did not have the power to determine which aircraft are purchased. The State Council decided to support the CAAC's enforcement of the document, allowing the agency to determine which airline would be saddled with the aircraft. But Yu had remained defiant. "What are you dragging out this old document for?" he reportedly demanded in a meeting with CAAC in late January. "It was written before our airline even existed." China Southern was created as a regional carrier in 1988, three years after China began breaking up its civil aviation monopoly. "If you really want us to take the planes, then you pay for them!" he is reported to have told officials. Yu's outspokenness on the issue, which included drawing on his close relationships with the Premier, Li Peng, and the Guangdong Government, as well as Zou Jiahua, has landed him in the CAAC's bad books. "This was the worst example of Yu's belligerent behaviour towards the administration," a source said. Yu will be stripped of his president's office and moved into the newly-created symbolic position of chairman of China Southern. The changes were being handled by CAAC's deputy director, Shen Yuankang, who has been given the task of whipping independently minded regional airlines into line. This move, as well as other senior management changes within China's main airlines, will be announced when the CAAC holds its first national work meeting under its new director, Chen Guangyi, at the end of this month or in early March. Airbus officials said they are confused by the affair. "I don't know their reasoning for signing a contract with no airline in mind. Only the Chinese can answer that," a spokesman, David Vellupilai, said. However, he said a decision needed to be made this year so that peripheral equipment selections could be made in preparation for the scheduled first delivery in 1995. China Southern hoped to order Boeing 777-Bs, equivalent to the A-340, to begin its long haul flights. The airline management has been told its technical staff would have to be doubled to service the complex and unfamiliar Airbus planes.
