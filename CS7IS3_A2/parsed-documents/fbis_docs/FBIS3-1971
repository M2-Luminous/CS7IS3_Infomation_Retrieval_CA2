The two sides exchanged views on economic cooperation between Hainan and the ROK and some other issues. When giving an account of Hainan's achievements over the past six years since the Hainan Special Economic Region was established, Chairman Du Qinglin noted: There are now more than 5,000 foreign- funded enterprises in Hainan, 13 of which are ROK-funded enterprises, ranking 14th in numerical order among all the foreign investors in Hainan. Many ROK conglomerates have expressed an interest in investing in Hainan. We welcome all of them to come and invest here. Mr. Hwang In-chong said: Though relatively backward with regards to its level of development, Hainan is more advanced in urban management in comparison to the ROK. The 100,000 qualified personnel Hainan has invited from other Chinese provinces and regions have now become your biggest asset. I am convinced that Hainan's numerous preferential policies are bound to attract more investment from the ROK and other foreign countries.
