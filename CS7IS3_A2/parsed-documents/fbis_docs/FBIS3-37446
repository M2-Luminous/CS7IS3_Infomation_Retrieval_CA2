According to preliminary information, between 8 and 12,000 inhabitants remain. They are in an extremely difficult situation, hiding in tea plantations in the daytime and gathering in groups of 10 to 15 people at night in order to flee via mountainous paths to safety. Mr. Kolbaia called for the immediate arrival in Gali Rayon of international experts and observers to establish supervision in the Gali zone. In order to save the remaining population, it is necessary to set up a life corridor through which people could be evacuated. The Abkhazian separatists and their hirelings are taking people prisoner, especially young people of Georgian nationality, whom they drive to Tkvarcheli and Ochamchire. The criminals commit their atrocities with such ingenuity that no traces are left. They bring both those who are alive and dead together into houses and set them on fire, turning residential quarters into ashes. Every day there are executions and acts of violence. Innocent people are being burned to death.
