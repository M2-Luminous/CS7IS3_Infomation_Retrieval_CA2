Makismovskiy under the rubric "The Future is Being Born Today": "The Next Shift"] [Text] All who work in space science are bothered by the question of who will come into this sector tomorrow--and will they come at all? This concern is elicited by the fact that this intellectually capacious form of human activity is today losing its attraction owing to the low pay. Time will pass, and the prestige of the "space" professions will be restored. But won't the potential created over decades be lost? Many people, despite the difficulties, are countering this destructive process by their deeds to keep this from happening. Among them are those who train the cadres for space science. Our correspondent Lieutenant-Colonel V. Maksimovskiy visited Kaliningrad near Moscow and met with the director of the College of Space Machine Building and Technology, P. Timoshchenko, and his deputy for educational work V. Nikolayevets. [V. Maksimovskiy] First a little history, Petr Stepanovich. [P.S. Timoshchenko] The very first steps in the development and manufacture of ballistic missiles in the postwar years showed that one cannot manage such a complex matter without the purposeful training of specialists. This pertained first and foremost to those who are engaged in production. Skilled people trained in new fields and the chiefs of sections and shops were needed. Chief Designer Sergey Pavlovich Korolev understood that very well. He came forward to the Ministry of Armaments of the USSR with an initiative to create an evening technical school based on Trade School No. 3 at NII-88 [Scientific-Research Institute 88], today the Machine Building TsNII [Central NII]. Then Minister D. Ustinov, taking into account the importance of the task, on 15 March 1947 signed an order to organize a branch of the Moscow Military- Mechanical Technical School with evening training in the city of Kaliningrad. The first graduation of degreed mechanical technicians, design engineers and technicians for electronic equipment took place four years later. Among them were Georgiy Mikhaylovich Paukov, Viktor Andreyevich Frolov, later deputy chief designers, along with future chiefs of the famous shop where the spacecraft were and are assembled--Vladimir Ivanovich Zudinov, Grigoriy Markovich Markov and Konstantin Georgiyevich Gorbatenko. Valeriy Vasilyevich Ryumkin, today a famous pilot and cosmonaut of the USSR and twice Hero of the Soviet Union, completed the school in 1958. [V. Maksimovskiy] So your educational institution has existed as a branch for a long time? [P.S. Timoshchenko] A day division was organized after the first graduation, and the branch was re-organized into the Kaliningrad Mechanical Technical School. Korolev knew how important it was to maintain a contemporary level of sophistication for the teaching laboratories and constant and direct contacts of the trainees with the enterprises where they would be working, and he did everything necessary. Missiles and test beds on which the designers themselves studied, an engine installation from the V-2, a Schmetterling cruise missile, prototypes of Soviet missiles and much more were transferred there at his orders. These traditions have been preserved. The Soyuz spacecraft, a lunar landing module and a lunar orbital craft have also appeared here with us. A noteworthy instructional collective has been formed here since the very beginning. N. Vorontsov, V. Postnikov, M. Rusov, M. Belin, M. Zimin, M. Khokhlov, A. Shalashov and others conducted special topics, while A. Khokhlova, A. Pyankov, S. Pomyalov, B. Rukavishnikov and A. Kirimova (and not only they) handled general education. We recalled our veterans warmly when celebrating the 45th anniversary of the school-- Hero of the Soviet Union A. Turikov, T. Tikhonova, L. Kabakova, V. Belyayeva, N. Kostyukova, V. Lavrentsov and L. Yudicheva, among others, along with the first directors--S. Malnikov, S. Shcherbakov and Yu. Klimov. They were the ones whose labor created the technical school and its traditions. Classes were held and are held by specialists from Kaliningrad defense industries, aside from the permanent instructional personnel--from the Energiya NPO [Scientific-Production Association], the Machine Building TsNII, the Chemical Machine Building KB [Design Bureau], the Measurement Engineering NPO and the Kompozit NPO. Technological and pre-diploma practice takes place there for our students--the places they will later be working. Approximately two thirds of our graduates, by the way, have linked their activity with those enterprises, either permanently or for a long time. [V. Maksimovskiy] Today your "personnel plant" has a different name. Why? [P.S. Timoshchenko] The high level of instruction and sophistication of the teaching process made it possible for the technical school to become the Kaliningrad College of Space Machine Building and Technology. This is not just a new name, but a new quality as well. [V. Maksimovskiy] I would like to address these questions to your deputy. Valentin Vasilyevich, do you train a great many specialists? [V.V. Nikolayevets] We have about a thousand and a half people training here. It is instructive that there have not been fewer candidates in recent years, the passing score on entrance exams is 8--9 for various fields, and we have many of them: industrial engineer for the cold machining of metals, technician for rocket engines or for airframes, programmer, radio technician and control systems instruments, clerk. There are also fields that have appeared owing to the necessity of working under the new economic conditions and conversion. These are specialists in orthopedic engineering, and in management and marketing. [V. Maksimovskiy] The latter is clear enough--you can't go into the market without such training. But the former is quite unusual. [V.V. Nikolayevets] The fact that one of the most important directions in the conversion of the Energiya NPO is the creation of prosthetic and orthotic hardware using advanced space technologies prompted us to engage in the training of technicians for the most varied, complex and modern prostheses. V. Legostayev, Deputy General Designer Yu. Semenova and Frau N. Riedrich--a representative of the German firm of JPOS, which is collaborating with the Energiya NPO in this noble cause--helped us a great deal in "discovering" this new field. [V. Maksimovskiy] Valentin Vasilyevich, tell us about the problems that you are encountering in training personnel and your views of the future. [V.V. Nikolayevets] The structural restructuring that our country is undergoing today, in my opinion, has affected the non-production sphere and the defense sectors for which we train specialists first and foremost. There is uncertainty in financing, and in the quantity of them needed. The attempt to make an abrupt transition to a market economy has led to the fact that existing ties have been disrupted. Everyone is "getting by" as best he can, and it must be said not always efficiently. We naturally worry about the fate of our educational institution. The unique laboratory base and skilled instructional collective cannot be lost. That has not happened yet, but the base fields are being displaced by others in some places, often out of opportunistic considerations. But I think this is a temporary matter. New and objectively essential fields will appear, but will those in which we have trained, and are training, the young people be preserved or resurrected? The spiral of the development of society will move out of the shadows and into the light. [V. Maksimovskiy] I share your optimism. Success to your collective, students and graduates!
