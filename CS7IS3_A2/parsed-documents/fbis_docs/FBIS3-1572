The main items on its agenda were: to comprehensively implement -- under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line of the party -- the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; to review and sum up -- in accordance with the principle of "seizing opportunity, deepening reform, opening up wider, promoting development, and maintaining stability" that serves as the general requirement for the work of the whole party and pursuant to the Central Committee's requirements for deepening the drive against corruption -- the implementation of the decision of the Central Committee on the tasks of the anticorruption drive in the near future since the CCDI Second Plenary Session; and to study and make plans for the tasks of the anticorruption drive in 1994. On behalf of the CCDI Standing Committee, Wei Jianxing, member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee and secretary of the party CCDI, delivered a report entitled: "Conduct In-Depth and Persistent Struggle Against Corruption and Make the Drive Serve Reform, Development, and Stability." Wei Jianxing first reviewed and summed up the implementation of the anticorruption drive since the CCDI Second Plenary Session. He said: In accordance with a directive of the Central Committee, the CCDI Second Plenary Session set out the specific tasks of stepping up the anticorruption drive, improving the party's style of work, and building a clean and honest government in the near future. In taking the anticorruption drive seriously, party committees and government at all levels have immediately swung into action and have done a great deal of work. Over the past six months, we have made fair progress in implementing the anticorruption drive and have achieved varying degrees of success in the three tasks set by the Central Committee. Some of the regions and departments that have been more conscientious have achieved marked results in some areas. Many negative and corrupt practices have abated somewhat. All in all, the momentum of the anticorruption drive is good, and progress has been healthy. We have, by and large, achieved the results expected of us by the Central Committee. Our efforts have been quite helpful to safeguarding political stability, to advancing reform and opening up, and to guaranteeing the execution of the tasks of macroeconomic regulation and control. Wei Jianxing said: Following the CCDI Second Plenary Session, party committees and government at all levels have conscientiously implemented -- and scored fairly good successes in -- the five-point regulations for observing clean standards and self-discipline by leading officials at and above the county (division) level in party and government organs. The provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government as well as the various ministries and commissions -- state organs at the central level -- have convened meetings on democratic activities. By carrying out self-examination and self-rectification, the overwhelming majority of leading cadres have enhanced their sense of observing clean standards and self-discipline. The problems uncovered by many cadres themselves through self-examination have been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations. Some localities and departments have even formulated rules and regulations in regard to observing clean standards and self-discipline. During this time, localities and departments have concentrated their resources on the investigation of a number of major cases. Compared to the corresponding period in 1992, the number of major bribery cases involving over 10,000 yuan that were investigated nationwide from September to December last year rose by 2.1 times, the number of cases involving economic offenses by leading cadres at the county (division) level rose by 6.8 times, and the number of cases involving cadres at the department and bureau level rose by 11 times. From September to December last year, 42,195 persons were punished by party sanctions and 16,169 were punished by administrative sanctions nationwide. The masses became more aware and took a more active part in the anticorruption drive, resulting in a sharp increase in letters and visits to authorities reporting irregularities. Compared to the corresponding period in 1992, the number of such letters, visits, and tips received by the nation's discipline inspection and supervision departments between September and December last year rose by 78.5 percent. Many of the informants used their real names, and many of the reports targeted leading cadres, key departments, and major irregularities. Localities and departments have also made progress in handling special projects and in rectifying various unhealthy trends. With the approval of the State Council, the Finance Ministry and the State Planning Commission have, in two separate pronouncements, abolished 143 illegal fees. The 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government have announced the abolition of 5,227 illegal fees. The localities and departments have also cracked down on government-funded sightseeing tours abroad and have stopped some 1,600 unqualified groups from taking tours abroad. Competent departments in many key sectors took steps to deal with the major problems in their respective sectors; some sectors such as the railways have done comparative well and have made rather remarkable progress. Many other negative and corrupt manifestations -- such as using public funds to entertain guests and give presents -- have also been curtailed somewhat. Wei Jianxing said: Judging from the country as a whole, the anticorruption drive has developed unevenly, with some localities failing to achieve concrete results. While affirming the achievements of the drive so far, we must also notice that negative phenomena and corruption remain serious and require us to continue to make painstaking efforts without the slightest lowering of our guard. Wei Jianxing said: The implementation of the anticorruption drive so far has fully testified that the Central Committee's plans to fight corruption are entirely correct. In the course of practice, we have explored a number of effective measures, which can be summarized mainly as the following: We must understand and grasp the importance of the anticorruption drive from the height of reforms, development, and stability; although the anticorruption drive is a protracted strategic task which cannot be accomplished in one stroke, we must imbue ourselves with a realistic sense of urgency and carry out the drive step by step to continuously score periodic achievements; we must adopt an overall view of the anticorruption drive and adhere to the pattern of the three tasks set out by the Central Committee in order to achieve the comprehensive effects of the drive; we must not only clearly and specifically decide on the tasks and goals for the various stages of the anticorruption drive but also must strengthen the supervision, inspection, and guidance from the top and from below; the whole party membership and both party and government organizations must be mobilized in the anticorruption drive; and to create a macroclimate, the anticorruption drive must be strongly supported by public opinion. In discussing the tasks for 1994, Wei Jianxing said: This year will be crucial for comprehensively implementing the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and expediting the establishment of a socialist market economic structure to bring about the sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. It will also be a year in which we will see the largest-scale reform measures launched in more than a decade and in which we will face arduous tasks in reforms, development, and stability. The new situations will require us to more steadfastly implement the strategic principle of grasping two links at the same time, more firmly and thoroughly carry out the anticorruption drive, and step up the efforts to improve the style of the party and promote clean government, so as to provide the conditions and a guarantee for reforms, development, and stability. Wei Jianxing pointed out: In line with the Central Committee's instruction, the overall pattern of the three anticorruption tasks will remain unchanged but will be enriched with new content based on the special features of circumstances. As far as requirements for leading cadres to be honest and self-disciplined are concerned, leading cadres at and above the county (division) level in party and government organs must strictly observe the various regulations formulated by the party Central Committee and the State Council for improving the party's style and promoting clean government, and must continue to unremittingly implement the five regulations on the honesty and self-discipline of leading cadres formulated by the Central Committee last year. In addition to these regulations, the following requirements for this year are listed and reiterated: 1) Nobody is allowed to violate regulations and to buy or change to imported and luxury cars; or to use one's power to exchange and borrow cars from subordinate enterprises and units, or to collect money from them to buy cars; nobody is allowed to buy cars for leading cadres with loans, money collected from people, and funds for special projects; county (city) leading party and government organs and units which still owe wages to staff members are not allowed to buy cars. 2) Nobody is allowed to operate counter to the regulations of the State Council on reforming the housing system and to buy houses at prices lower than promulgated; or to abuse power to provide preferential treatment for spouses, children, relatives, or friends to buy houses; or to decorate private houses lavishly with public funds. 3) Leading cadres should attend domestic public activities without fanfare; their accommodations should not exceed the local criteria for being received; and no special dance parties should be organized for them. 4) Nobody is allowed to organize lavish activities and to spend without restraint on occasions of marriages, funerals, changes of jobs, birthdays, and moving to new housing, either for oneself or family members. Using public funds and materials for such activities or earning money through these occasions are especially forbidden. 5) Nobody is allowed to abuse power and to refuse to return public funds; or to buy or build houses with public funds for oneself, one's relatives and friends, or to engage in profit-making. In investigating and handling cases, this year attention should continue to be focused on violations of the law and discipline by leading party and government organs and their top officials, by judicial and administrative law-enforcement departments, and by economic management departments and their functionaries. Efforts should be concentrated on probing and handling major and serious cases, paying particular attention to leading cadres who embezzle, take bribes, or abuse power for personal gain; and law- and discipline-enforcement personnel who bend the law to benefit relatives and friends or who take bribes, or who violate the law and discipline while enforcing them; as well as to violations of the law and discipline by corporations. It is necessary to select typical cases and to publish the results of investigations for the benefit of the masses so as to improve the social benefits of investigations. This year we shall focus attention on strengthening supervision over the work of rectifying unhealthy practices found in government departments and in trades and professions and shall vigorously carry out this work. First, we shall continue to vigorously stop the unwarranted collection of fees. Meanwhile, we shall earnestly solve the problem of the abuse of power by party and government organizations and by their working personnel to requisition enterprises' vehicles, computers, and communications equipment without making payment for them and to transfer enterprises' funds under various pretexts to their own small coffers and to provide services to their staff members and workers. The unhealthy practice of exacting donations from enterprises under various pretexts must be stopped resolutely. We must continue to do a good job of lightening peasants' burdens. Second, we must continue to rectify the unhealthy trend of using public funds to go abroad for reasons of tourism, and we must put an end to going abroad on routine official business and for routine training. Third, all areas and departments must continue to make efforts to succeed in handling the task of rectifying unhealthy trends and to solve one or two conspicuous problems in a down-to-earth manner. While rectifying unhealthy trends, we must address the problem by looking into both its root cause and symptoms; attach importance to studying how to solve the profound problems involved with the rectification of unhealthy trends and the consolidation of discipline; persist in closely integrating the anticorruption drive with deepening reform, improving the party's style, and strengthening the building of a clean and honest government; and persist in closely integrating honesty with industriousness in the performance of official duties. Wei Jianxing stressed: This year's task of fighting against corruption is still arduous. It is very difficult. Party committees and governments at all levels must conscientiously strengthen leadership and expend time and effort on guiding the drive to unfold in depth and on producing concrete results in a bid to achieve phased successes. Wei Jianxing pointed out: While paying attention to successfully launching the anticorruption drive, discipline inspection organs at all levels must further strengthen supervision over law enforcement, conscientiously supervise the implementation of democratic centralism, strictly enforce political discipline, and ensure the smooth transmission of government decrees. They must carry out supervision over law enforcement at focal points and in a planned way by making their efforts revolve around the implementation of a series of important policies and measures adopted by the CPC Central Committee and State Council on deepening reform, developing the economy, and maintaining stability. Finally, Wei Jianxing pointed out: This year is important for our implementation of the resolution adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee to enable China's economy to maintain a good momentum of development. It is a crucial year for us to shift the economic system to a new track. As such, our tasks are very great. The broad masses of cadres of discipline-inspection organs shoulder a glorious and sacred mission and face a good opportunity to temper themselves. They must rally closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, surmount difficulties, work hard, and make positive contributions to more effectively launch a sustained, in-depth anticorruption drive; to improving the party's style and strengthening the building of a clean and honest government; to promoting economic construction, reform, and opening up; and to maintaining political stability in a sense of urgent political responsibility and under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as well as of the party's basic line. CCDI Deputy Secretary Hou Zongbin presided over today's meeting. Altogether, 103 CCDI members attended the meeting. Persons in charge of discipline inspection organs in all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, all the departments under the central authorities; the People's Liberation Army, and armed police forces, together with persons in charge of relevant departments, attended the meeting as observers.
