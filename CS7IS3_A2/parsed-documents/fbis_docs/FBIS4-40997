Marine subunits from the Russian Pacific Fleet and from the crew of the American amphibious vessel Dubuque, which has been visiting the Far East, participated in the exercises. Two columns of "amphibians" landing from the Russian and U.S. vessels met precisely at midday at a crossroads that led to a previously prepared training ground. After receiving orders from the command point, they marched rapidly to the training site, where, according to a plan developed by representatives of the Pacific Fleet headquarters and the Dubuque command, it was necessary to immediately clear up the consequences of a hypothetical earthquake. In the "natural disaster" area, which lay in ruins, a support group was already at work and equipment was being used. Powerful machines that had been carried off the vessels started moving the rubble and putting out fires. A flow of the "dead" and "injured" started arriving at the evacuation points, where they were put on helicopters and immediately taken to hospitals. But the most interesting and exciting moment was the landing of the assault force. A stormy wind and waves created serious obstacles for the assault force, but the Russian armed vehicles and the U.S. amphibious vehicles carried out the assault across the water barrier and easily "captured" the prescribed area of land. Their reward was praise from the leaders of the exercises: Vice Admiral Igor Khmelnov, deputy commander of the Pacific Fleet, and David Baze, brigadier general of the U.S. Navy [name and title as received]. Both sides believe it is necessary to regularly carry out exercises like these on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, both in Russia and in the United States.
