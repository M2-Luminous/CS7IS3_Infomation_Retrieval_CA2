(NTT) said Tuesday [29 March] it will review its procurement policy under a 1981 Japan-U.S. agreement as part of efforts to increase foreign companies' opportunities for NTT-related business. Japan's telecommunications giant privatized in 1985 will improve its procedures for buying components and other products for use in equipment to facilitate foreign companies' access to NTT business, a company spokesman said. Specifically, NTT will provide prospective bidders with information on its procurement plans before they are unveiled in the government's official gazettes, the spokesman said. At present, such information can be obtained only after specific procurement plans are made public in the gazettes. The latest step follows a U.S. request that the Japanese Government treat NTT purchases as part of its procurements. The government has rejected the request, saying that NTT "is basically a private business," not a government agency. The 1981 pact calls for nondiscriminatory treatment of foreign bidders by NTT in its procurement policy. "NTT will maximize its efforts to respond to foreign demand," the spokesman said.
