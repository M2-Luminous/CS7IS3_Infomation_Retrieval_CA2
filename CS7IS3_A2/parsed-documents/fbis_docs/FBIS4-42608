There is a shortfall of nearly 700 million kronor for this fiscal year. A contributing reason is that the JAS project has become 5 to 6 billion more expensive than estimated due solely to the lower value of the krona and the high dollar exchange rate. Later Payment "We have been forced to postpone several of this year's materiel orders, primarily for the JAS project, to next year. We have also negotiated with industry, so that we can pay a little later," says Lieutenant Colonel Arne Heden, head of the coordination section of the Air Force command at the military headquarters in Stockholm. Last winter it was the Navy that was struggling with an acute deficit of 800 million. That problem was solved by Defense Minister Anders Bjorck with very tough demands for savings and an extra supplement of 400 million kronor through the sale of oil from the emergency stores. Now it is apparently the Air Force's turn. Air Force chief Lars-Erik Englund has been summoned to the Defense Committee on Thursday [5 May]. There he will, among other things, reply to questions about the strained financial situation of JAS and why the costs of the JAS project are not accounted for in a satisfactory manner, something which the parliamentary JAS Committee has pointed out. Worried Command Commander in Chief Bengt Gustafsson and Lars-Erik Englund themselves recently took up the question of the Air Force's runaway expenses in the military command's advisory commission, which also includes politicians from the Defense Committee. According to what SVENSKA DAGBLADET has learned, the military command is somewhat concerned that the Defense Ministry does not really want to face the future seriousness of the situation. Arne Heden maintains that the Air Force's problem is not about an acute liquidity crisis but about the space within the Air Force's planning framework that has shrunk due to the reduced value of the krona and the previously very high dollar exchange rate. High Exchange Rate Approximately 30 percent of the technology of the JAS aircraft was bought abroad at a high exchange rate, which has resulted in a collapse of the financial planning calculations. "I believe that we have the situation under control. We will hardly exceed the budget for this year. But if the krona does not strengthen and the dollar rate goes down, after 1994/95 we will have problems of financing what we have planned for," stresses Arne Heden. He admits that the Air Force planners to some extent have postponed the problems in the hopes that the Swedish economy and the foreign exchange rates will stabilize. If the high costs continue, there are really only two things to do: reduce operations, disband units, or allocate the Air Force new money. The government will shortly decide about buying a radar-guided interceptor missile for the JAS 39 Gripen. If the government chooses to buy approximately 500 missiles, although a lower number is being discussed, the order amount will be at least a couple of billion kronor. According to Arne Heden, the missile deal is not affected by the situation that has developed, "since money has already been allocated for missiles for the JAS."
