FBIS3-11850 "drlat059_o_94007" FBIS-LAT-94-059 Document Type:Daily Report 22 Mar 1994 Colombia Negotiations Stall on Cuban Oil Sales PA2603000594 Hamburg DPA in Spanish 1734 GMT 22 Mar 94 PA2603000594 Hamburg DPA Language: Spanish Article Type:BFN [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 22 Mar (DPA) -- Juan Maria Rendon, president of the Colombian Petroleum Enterprise [Ecopetrol], today disclosed that the announced daily sale of between 15,000 and 20,000 barrels of oil to Havana is in doubt because of Havana's failure to offer payment guarantees. The official said negotiations on the oil sales stalled after Cuba proposed to make its payments contingent on its sugar sales, something that could represent problems for Colombia if Cuba encounters problems in its sugar trade. Rendon said the Colombian Government is demanding the oil sales be backed by letters of credit from major international banks, something Havana apparently has not considered. The announcement on the sale of oil produced serious protests among Cubans exiles in Miami, whose most radical sectors have proposed boycotting Colombian products exported to Florida. Meanwhile, Colombian political sectors have asked the Gaviria administration to reconsider its diplomatic relations with Cuba after the media disclosed the holding of a "summit" in Havana in which several guerrilla leaders and a Catholic bishop allegedly participated. According to media reports, it appears the meeting took place between 23 and 28 January with the presumed consent of Fidel Castro's government. This is why the Colombian Government asked for an explanation of the matter in a diplomatic note signed by Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin. The Cuban Government denied that such a "summit" was ever held. In turn, Colombian Government Minister Fabio Villegas said, "we have to believe" Cuba, and he ruled out the possibility of breaking relations. Diplomatic relations between Santa Fe de Bogota and Havana were reestablished in October after having been suspended for 12 years. Former President Julio Cesar Turbay (1978-82) broke off relations after intelligence reports indicated Colombian guerrillas had been trained in Cuba.
