Some 40 enterprises, which are at present in the red, are required to make a profit this year. Eleven of these have already put forward detailed plans based on their particular conditions. The city government has helped enterprises to find the causes for their losses. Results show that the losses come from inefficient operation and poor management, as well as left-over debts and the heavy financial burdens imposed on them. The city government formulated measures and policies to help change the situation so that they can thrive and enhance their competitive ability in the market. Strong leadership and qualified staff were considered as the key to making profits, and a contingent of outstanding business operators have been selected or assigned to be managers of these enterprises. Enterprises with no hope of becoming profitable, whose low- quality products can find no demand, will be forced to go bankrupt, be merged with successful companies or have their ownership transferred.
