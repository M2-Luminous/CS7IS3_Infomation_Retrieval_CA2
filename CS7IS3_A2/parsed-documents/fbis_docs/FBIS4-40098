The decision came after Gaydar had announced that he would personally appear in court to defend his statement that Zhirinovskiy resembles him the "Hitler of 1929". Zhirinovskiy's lawyer Sergey Belyak told TASS that the lawsuit was withdrawn on June 7, but Gaydar, who came to the court on Tuesday, said he knew nothing about that and showed a summon, according to which he had to be present in court as a defendant. Gaydar believes Zhirinovskiy should have appeared in court to explain his decision which, according to him, is "another evident proof that aggressive people are often very cautious". However, Zhirinovskiy plans to file a new lawsuit against Gaydar and the "IZVESTIYA" newspaper which published his article in which Gaydar insists that Zhirinovskiy is a fascist and analyses his rhetorics. The lawsuit is to be filed on June 17, Belyak told TASS. He added that another lawsuit will be filed on June 27 against Nikolay Svanidze, an anchorman of the Russian TV, who claimed that Zhirinovskiy had paid members of his Duma faction 500 US dollars for voting in favour of the 1994 budget. According to the lawyer, some 20 lawsuits against various media and politicians had been already filed by his client.
