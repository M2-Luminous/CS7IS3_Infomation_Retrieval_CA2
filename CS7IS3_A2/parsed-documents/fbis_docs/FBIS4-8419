This assumption is not bold, but realistic, because this is an area which can more than feed itself, one that possesses an impressive stock of timber, considerably greater than the capacity of its own wood manufacturing industry, mineral wealth, sufficient power to meet its own needs, and a relatively advanced industry which by and large was not destroyed in the war. If it were not for the destructive activity of the domestic human factor and the ill will of the world's powerful toward the Srpska republic, the present hard times would quickly become the past. Just as elsewhere in wartime, in the Srpska republic agriculture is at the moment the most productive part of the economy. And the figures themselves indicate how wrong people are who see the Srpska republic exclusively as a land of mountains, forests, and meadows. That is, no less than 97 percent of the plains in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina were in the Serbian area. The Srpska republic, at least in its present boundaries, possesses 64.3 percent of the farmland, land which produced about 80 percent of all the wheat and corn in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has even been calculated that the Srpska republic has more plowland per capita than the present Yugoslavia. Ores in the Serbian Areas Mineral wealth, which at one time was the principal economic potential of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, was also largely in the Serbian section of that former Yugoslav republic. To be specific, according to the figures of the Srpska republic Chamber of Commerce, its territory accounts for 37 percent of the brown coal reserves, 35 percent of the lead and zinc reserves, 84 percent of the bauxite, 68 percent of the iron, 12 percent of the lignite, 88 percent of the gypsum, 89 percent of the quartz.... Although the Serbian side perhaps did not fare all that well in the redistribution of electric power potential in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, even what has remained on the territory of the Srpska republic is enough to meet its needs. The installed capacity of electric power generating units on the territory of the Srpska republic amounts to 1,592 megawatts, but because most of the Drina watershed is on its territory, and this is the largest unutilized power potential in the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, the energy prospects of the Srpska republic are nevertheless favorable. The Serbian area also includes about two-thirds of the total forest area of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina. Forests cover half of its area. The timber resources of the Srpska republic are estimated at about 214 million cubic meters. Although the main industrial centers have remained on Muslim and Croatian territory (central Bosnia, Tuzla, Mostar), the Serbian side has not really been short-changed in this regard either. On the contrary. The Serbian areas have about 60 percent of the textile industry of the former Bosnia and Herzegovina, then 50 percent of the leather and footwear industry, 55 percent of the food manufacturing industry, most of the paper and building materials industry, all the petroleum refining (it is true that the refinery in Bosanski Brod has been considerably damaged, so that repairs would cost nearly $30 million), and, especially important, most of the electrical equipment and metal manufacturing industries are also on Serbian territory. The Established Boundaries of the Serbian Space Certain extremely profitable industries, like the alumina mill in Zvornik, are also on Serbian territory. According to Jefto Subotic, its manager for many years, this firm, which employs about 2,500 workers, had exports in 1990 worth $296 million, which is more than our present foreign exchange reserves. As for the plant itself, he says, it could go back into operation overnight. However, this mill, along with all the industry in the Srpska republic for that matter, is suffering from a chronic shortage of the most highly trained personnel. Bozidar Antic, chairman of the Srpska republic Chamber of Commerce, has said in a statement to the press that at the plants which are somehow operating the number of highly trained personnel is no more than 10 percent of what it was before the war. Subotic, who in 1990 was proclaimed the best business executive in the Yugoslavia of that time (he retired six months ago), points to another phenomenon which could be a hindrance to rapid economic recovery. The SDS [Serbian Democratic Party], he says, must free itself of the role of supreme arbiter in all matters, including even the economy. In some situations it behaves for all the world like the former party committees, not stopping short of determining even who is going to work where. And while this might make some sense under these wartime conditions, if it becomes established practice, it could be disastrous for the economy when the guns go silent, Subotic warns. All the figures given are for the territory which belongs to the Srpska republic at this moment. Whether its present borders will coincide with the final borders, whether it will be independent or in some alliances with others, these are dilemmas which no one has answered as yet. The three-year Yugoslav war drama has nevertheless resolved one riddle: For the first time in history, Serbian space has been precisely marked off with borders. The coming months will probably answer the question of whether and when they will be under the roof of a single state. But one of our eminent economists, who for reasons of his own does not want his name in the paper, examined that Serbian territory in the light of interesting figures. It has a population, according to his calculation, of about 12 million. And if it should turn out that all the Serbian space should become a single state community, it would be the 14th most populous country in Europe. In national income, the possible community of the Serbian lands would be larger than 14 European countries, in per capita income it would be greater than only seven countries, in per capita plowland it would be no lower than eighth place in Europe (which at the moment has 38 states), and in its energy potential, relative to its own needs, it also has a high 10th place. It is also in a high 11th place on the Old Continent for its rivers and streams, but in terms of road development it drops all the way to 27th place, and in terms of the age-specific and education-specific structure of the population it is in 20th place. Regardless of what the future political map of the former space of Yugoslavia looks like, it is good for the Serbs to finally learn where they live and what as a people they represent on the territory of Europe.
