"It's about time North Korea recognized universal values, such as freedom, respect for human rights and welfare," Yi told reporters. "North Korea must also ride the trend of world history for inter-Korean reconciliation and coprosperity, and for this we must tell the North Koreans things that sound harsh to their ears." Values respected in democratic societies must also be respected in North Korea, said Yi, who is also unification minister. "We must induce the North Koreans into realizing the basic value of respect for human rights," he said. Noting that the most important human rights problem facing both South and North Korea is the issue of separated families, he said it shames the Korean people that these families still do not know whether their beloved are alive. "Meeting itself is no longer an end in inter-Korean relations, and we must now make this relationship move forward to a higher goal," he said. "If they don't agree on our principle, we won't respond unconditionally to their proposal for a meeting. So far we've tried to bring them over to the meeting table and we've avoided telling them what they don't like to hear. But now we need to awaken them to the universal values of mankind, however harsh it may be to their ears."
