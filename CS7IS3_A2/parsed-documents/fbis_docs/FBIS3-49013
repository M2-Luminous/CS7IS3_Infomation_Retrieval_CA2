Should this happen, half of Hungary's energy production would be lost, Laszlo Kemenes, leader of the company's information service, said. In the past, the expended fuel was transported to the Soviet Union. In the summer of 1992, the Russian parliament accepted an environmental protection law that bans the import of dangerous waste. In spite of this, in February 1993, Russia accepted expended fuel filling a railway carriage. However, it is not at all certain that it will again do this, although it has not indicated, either, that it will refuse to process waste from Paks in the future. The Ukrainian side has already indicated that it would let the deliveries pass through. Considering the favorable atmosphere of talks with the Russians, it cannot be excluded that future deliveries will be possible. As Hungary cannot expose itself to the decisions of other countries, a solution will definitely have to be found within a short time. For five years, the used-up fuel elements has been stored in a resting basin at the Paks Nuclear Power Station, then they were transported in special containers. At the moment, the free storage capacity at Paks is enough for 18 months, therefore, if no solution is found in the coming 18 months then, failing all else, the nuclear power station might be halted. Being aware of this situation, to safely solve the further placement of waste, the company had internationally announced bids for building a transitional storage, and this was won by the French-British GEC-ALSTHOM. This company, which has built several of this type of storage, will have to complete the reception building and the storage area in 18 months. Although temporarily, the Paks Nuclear power station would gain time through this 3 to 3.5 billion forints investment.
