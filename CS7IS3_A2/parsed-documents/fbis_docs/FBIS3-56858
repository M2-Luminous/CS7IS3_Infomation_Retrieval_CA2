He stressed that, regardless of individual political personalities, nothing will change in the implementation of economic reforms. The prime minister recalled that the reforms in Russia continued even after 14 December 1992, when Yegor Gaydar left the government, and again after his return to the Cabinet in September 1993. They will continue irrespective of the fact that he has now left the government again, he assured his audience. Journalists were, no doubt, most interested to hear about Boris Fedorov's future. In response to numerous questions about this, Chernomyrdin repeated that Fedorov's reply to the invitation to head the Ministry of Finance had not so far been received. He also noted that if the invitation were turned down, someone else would be found instead. Journalists reminded the prime minister that recently Fedorov made his acceptance of the post of Minister of Finance conditional on the dismissal of Viktor Gerashchenko, chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. In this connection, Chernomyrdin said that no conditions from anybody were accepted when the cabinet changes were made. He added that candidates for the chairmanship of the Central Bank of Russia had to be examined and endorsed by the president and parliament. For my part I see no reason, at the moment, why Gerashchenko should not keep his post, the prime minister said. Touching on the fate of Ella Pamfilova, minister of social protection, who has submitted her resignation, Chernomyrdin said that: Her resignation has not been accepted. She is on ordinary leave at present. If she does not wish to work in the government, the question of who will head this ministry will be decided in the first 10 days of February, the head of the Cabinet said. Speaking of the alterations in the structure of the Russian Government, Chernomyrdin stressed in particular that: They are not connected with specific individuals but are dictated by the tasks that at present face the Cabinet of Ministers. In order to raise the efficiency of the government's work, the number of members of the government has been reduced from 93 to 29; chairmen of state committees are no longer members of the Cabinet. The number of deputy prime ministers has been reduced from nine to four. Replying to a question about the controversy over the construction of a new building for the Russian Parliament, Chernomyrdin said that so far the government has only taken the decision to study the possibility of constructing such a building and that no one had determined that this work would cost $5 million. If both chambers of parliament come out against the construction then it will not take place. But I support the position that a specialized building for parliament is essential, he made clear. Concerning Western assistance for Russian reforms, Chernomyrdin acknowledged that this factor could not be ignored. However, Russia must count on its own efforts above all. No assistance will provide a cardinal solution to our problems, the prime minister stated.
