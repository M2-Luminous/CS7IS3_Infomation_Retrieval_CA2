Del Toro is a first vice minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces [FAR]. A group of leaders and specialists from Minaz [Ministry of the Sugar Industry], Minbas [Ministry of Basic Industry], Micons [Ministry of Construction], and (CATM) participated in this class. Earlier, FAR specialists led by Division General (Ramon Pato Guerra) had contributed to creating the conditions that facilitated this demonstration -- which is today extremely important, according to Army General Raul Castro, because the nation has the unavoidable need to maintain the equipment, parts, and technical resources that are temporarily immobilized. Castro also said this is a timely moment to extend the FAR's preservation expertise to all branches of the economy. The Armed Forces are so far maintaining millions of pieces of equipment, which range from tanks and armaments of all kinds to gas masks. Over 500 technical cadres and machinery experts in Havana and other provinces have seen this demonstration. The intention is to hold this kind of workshop all over the country. The participants in this class toured various departments, warehouses, and workshops belonging to this enterprise, where they saw what measures have been taken to counteract humidity and to preserve hydraulic and lubrication systems and the costly resources used in irrigation. Everywhere, there is one constant: economizing with material and human resources, with new principles of organization, and technical discipline.

[rephrases] on an organizational system about which, as is known, we indeed have quite a bit to learn (?from) our FAR comrades. [Rosales del Toro] In the demonstration that was given here, we have been able to see how, very simply, using the same installations and the same comrades -- with the magnificent training and experience they have -- but by establishing a system, and maintaining the methodological procedures, and applying these experiences that all the organizations... [changes thought] and we can say that it is not just the FAR, because we have (?drunk deeply) of the nation's experiences [returns to original line of thought], these things can be introduced. I am completely sure that the year 1994 can become a year in which to rescue the Revolution's fundamental resources, to preserve them, and guarantee that for the next two or three years, we have at least a response, on the basis of what we already have, on the basis of what we already possess.
