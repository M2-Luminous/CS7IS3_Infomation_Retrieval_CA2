If confirmed by the UN Security Council, he will replace compatriot General Jean Cot at the end of March, Butrus-Ghali told a news conference. Paris had proposed de Lapresle as Cot's replacement one week ago. France has the largest contingent of troops in the former Yugoslavia with 6,000 soldiers. Butrus-Ghali and Cot had disagreed over the general's repeated public demands that he be given the authority to order use of air support in Bosnia-Hercegovina if he deemed it necessary. Butrus-Ghali delegated this authority to his civilian representative in Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi of Japan, for two operations specific to Srebrenica and Tuzla.
