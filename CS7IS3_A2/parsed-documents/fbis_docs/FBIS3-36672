Dmitry Ryurikov, the president's international affairs aide, in an interview with Interfax reaffirmed that Yeltsin would shortly discuss the Bosnian crisis with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other world leaders. "We still believe there are chances to settle it by non-violent means," Ryurikov said, citing the Russian Foreign Ministry's recent proposals for the demilitarization of Sarajevo. "It's along those lines that discussions should proceed," he said. He expressed the hope that the incident in the Bosnian capital would bring it home to all parties to the conflict that "they should end their confrontation, which will be of no benefit to anybody, neither to the Serbs nor to the Croats nor to the Muslims, and which may provoke a negative reaction on the part of the world community." Ryurikov was skeptical about the idea of making one of the parties a potential target for an air strike.
