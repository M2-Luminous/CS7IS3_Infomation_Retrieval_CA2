During his inspection of Guanghan, Comrade Xie Shijie stated: Guanghan City is the banner of Sichuan's county-level comprehensive economic structural reform and has had a positive influence on the entire country in this connection as well. At present, Guanghan should continually make every possible effort to seize each and every opportunity to further emancipate the mind, intensify reform, and expand opening up to the outside world and should strive to take the lead in the county-level comprehensive economic structural reform in the years ahead. Comrade Xie Shijie emphatically stated: Reform has substantially boosted Guanghan's development. In the years ahead, Guanghan should continually hold aloft the banner of reform, firmly bear in mind all major tasks set for this year by the central authorities, and firmly seize each and every opportunity to deepen reform, expand opening up, push ahead with development, and maintain stability. We are currently being confronted with a completely new situation in which we should follow good examples and help relatively backward areas to catch up. Only by successfully developing the economy will we be able to remain in an invincible position. Comrade Xie Shijie expressed the hope that Guanghan City will conscientiously draw upon the successful experiences and practices of all fraternal counties and cities across the province. It is a good phenomenon, he noted, that various counties, cities, and prefectures across the province have already started competing with one another and learning from each other. Only by invigorating and successfully developing the county-level economy will Sichuan be able to stand a very good chance of success. Comrade Xie Shijie maintained: The leading organs should both strengthen internal solidarity and support and help each other. Within each leading organ, given each individual's different personal experiences, members play different roles. It is therefore necessary for members of every leading organ to learn from one another's strong points and offset any weaknesses. Only by so doing will we be able to create a unifying force, fully develop collective superiority, and lead the broad masses of the cadres and people to overcome all types of difficulties and push Guanghan's economic development onto a new stage.
