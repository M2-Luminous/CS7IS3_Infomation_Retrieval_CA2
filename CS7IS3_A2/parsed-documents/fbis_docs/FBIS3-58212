The explosion took place on the eve of the NATO summit in Brussels, which U.S. President Bill Clinton is attending. The two-kilo explosive device went off shortly after 0100 in the Eur district on the outskirts of Rome. No one was hurt, but material damage was significant. According to an eyewitness, four people left the scene in an Alfa 33 immediately after the blast in Viale Beethoven, near Piazza Don Sturzo, where the former headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party were located. The explosion caused a one-meter-wide crater. Bomb disposal experts immediately went to the scene to find out what sort of explosive was used by the terrorists. Investigators must also establish whether last night's bomb attack against the NATO offices in Rome is connected with the start of the summit in Brussels.
