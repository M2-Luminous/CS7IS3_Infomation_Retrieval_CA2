ARTICLE II_CONSTRUCTION Section 1._Time and Manner of Work (a) Bidder agrees to commence work on the Project on a date (hereinafter called the ``Commencement Date'') which shall be determined by the Engineer after notice in writing of approval of the Contract by the Administrator, but in no event will the Commencement Date be later than XXXX calendar days after date of approval of the Contract by the Administrator. The Bidder further agrees to prosecute diligently and to complete construction in strict accordance with the Specifications and Drawings within XXXX ( XXXX ) calendar days (excluding Sundays) after Commencement Date. (b) The time for Completion of Clearing shall be extended for the period of any reasonable delay which is due exclusively to causes beyond the control and without the fault of the Bidder, including Acts of God, fires, floods, inability to obtain materials and acts or omissions of the Owner with respect to matters for which the Owner is solely responsible: Provided however, that no such extension of time for completion shall be granted the Bidder unless within ten (10) days after the happening of any event relied upon by the Bidder for such an extension of time the Bidder shall have made a request therefor in writing to the Owner, and provided further that no delay in such time of completion or in the progress of the work which results from any of the above causes except acts or omission of the Owner, shall result in any liability on the part of the Owner. (c) The sequence of construction shall be as set forth below, the numbers or names being the designations of extensions or areas (hereinafter called the ``Sections'') corresponding to the numbers or names shown on the maps attached hereto, or if no Sections are set forth below, the sequence of construction shall be as determined by the Bidder, subject to the approval of the Engineer.

And provided further, that if the cost to the Bidder of construction of the Project shall be materially increased by any such change or addition, the Owner shall pay the Bidder for the reasonable cost thereof in accordance with a Contract Amendment signed by the Owner and the Bidder and approved by the Administrator 2 , but no claim for additional compensation for any such change or addition will be considered unless the Bidder shall have made a written request therefor to the Owner prior to the commencement of work in connection with such change or addition. 1 As long as the total price of this contract including all amendments is less than 120 percent of the original contract price as stated in the acceptance hereto, amendments executed on REA Form 238 are not subject to the approval of the Administrator. Whenever an amendment to this contract causes the total amended contract to exceed 120 percent of the original contract price, that amendment and all subsequent amendments to this contract shall be made subject to the approval of the Administrator. 2 See Footnote 1.
