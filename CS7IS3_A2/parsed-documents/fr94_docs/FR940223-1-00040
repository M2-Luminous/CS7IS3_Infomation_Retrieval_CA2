FR940223-1-00040 FR940223-1-00006 14 CFR Part 121 [Docket No. 27532; Notice No. 94&hyph;4] RIN 2120&hyph;AF34 Extension of Compliance Date for Installation of Digital Flight Data Recorders on Stage 2 Airplanes agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. action: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). summary: This notice proposes to change the final compliance date for installing improved (11-parameter digital) flight data recorders from May 26, 1994, to the next heavy maintenance check, but no later than May 26, 1995, in Stage 2 airplanes subject to the rules requiring a transition to an all Stage 3 fleet. This change would allow carriers more time to take actions necessary to retrofit Stage 2 airplanes, and would make the flight data recorder replacement rule more compatible with the noise transition requirements without having a significant impact on safety. dates: Comments must be received by March 25, 1994. addresses: Comments on this notice should be mailed, in triplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket (AGC&hyph;200), Docket No. 27532, 800 Independence Avenue, Washington, DC 20591.

History On March 25, 1987, the FAA promulgated a final rule that requires operators, by May 26, 1994, to install improved (11-parameter digital) flight data recorders on all airplanes type certificated on or before September 30, 1969, and operated under part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (52 FR 9622). The final rule, ยง121.343(c), was issued in response to a recommendation from the National Transportation Safety Board that was based on accident/incident files for January 1983 to February 1986 that revealed a high failure rate for metal foil flight recorders. The data revealed that 37 recorders (48 percent) had one or more malfunctioning parameters preceding the accident or incident, preventing the recording or readout of pertinent data. Air Transport Association's Petition for Exemption In August 1991, the Air Transport Association (ATA) petitioned the FAA for an exemption from ยง121.343(c). The ATA stated that the compliance date for the digital flight data recorder (DFDR) retrofit was inappropriate when considering the schedule for either retrofitting airplanes with noise abatement equipment or retiring airplanes in order to comply with the Stage 3 transition mandated in September 1991 (56 FR 48628, September 25, 1991). The FAA denied the ATA exemption request, stating that the Stage 3 transition rule did not mandate the retirement of any Stage 2 airplanes. The FAA pointed out that noise abatement equipment was expected to be available for virtually the entire active fleet.
