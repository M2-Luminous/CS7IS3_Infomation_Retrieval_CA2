"If Gaydar's resignation weakens Russia's reform efforts, it would be very regrettable," Saito told a press conference. But Japan-Russia relations, and Japan's policy toward Russia will not change because of the resignation of the reformist, Saito said. Japan has a policy of "adequately" supporting Russia's efforts for democratization and its shift toward a market-oriented economy and that policy will remain unchanged, he said. The Japanese Government hopes the Russian Government will continue doing its utmost to achieve reforms, he said. Gaydar, 37, announced Sunday he was leaving the government over disagreements with its recent decisions.
