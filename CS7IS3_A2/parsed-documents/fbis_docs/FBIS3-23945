Chernomyrdin at enlarged session of Russian Federation Government 4 March 1993: "The Government Intends To Abide by Its Program No Matter How Difficult It May Be"] [Text] Esteemed President, Esteemed participants in the government session! This is our first meeting in this composition in the new year, 1994. However, I want to stress in particular that the Russian Government, which is meeting today in an enlarged session with the participation of leaders of the regions and deputies of the Federal Assembly, is not a new state organ born in January this year. It is the same pro-reform cabinet which, together with the president and under his direct leadership, has carried out and is continuing to carry out the qualitative transformation of the country's economy. The main directions of this multifaceted work have been determined in the Message of the President of Russia to the Federal Assembly and in effect to all Russians. The government fully supports the aim set out in the Message -- the strengthening of the Russian state. It is this which is the basis of the continuation of the reforms, the elimination of the crisis, the implementation of the structural restructuring of the economy, and the creation of conditions for economic, political, and social stabilization. As far as the government is concerned, the president's Message is the point of departure in the formation and implementation of socioeconomic policy. In recent weeks we have often been accused of maintaining a prolonged silence, of lacking an action program, and of having nothing to say. On the one hand, there have been demands for a change of course. On the other hand, there has been a flurry of accusations that we are deviating from the reform policy. Chernomyrdin is being accused of constantly stating his loyalty to the reforms while at the same time being unprepared to prove that in practice. I want to clearly and precisely define my position right now. First of all we see neither a justification nor an opportunity for a radical change of course. The government has its program, adopted 6 August 1993 and approved by the president. We intend to abide by this program and will implement it no matter how difficult that proves to be. At the same time we reject in principle the dangerous theory of "letting things drift." We are not satisfied either with the pace and intensity of the reforms or with the quality of work of management structures at all levels -- from federal to local -- and we fully share the president's alarm and society's concern at the country's economic situation. However, neither are there any grounds for hasty conclusions about an imminent catastrophe or that the reform has stopped and that it is necessary to go back to 1992 in order to "renew" the radical transformations. I should like to recall the old saying: Do not make the same mistake twice. The country, the reforms, and we all are not what we were a year or two ago. One can and must discuss what has been done and what has not been done and why. But we cannot fail to see the obvious: A market economy already exists in Russia. Now it is necessary to move on, not backward but forward, taking into account the qualitative differences in the economic and political situation prevailing at the start of 1994 and drawing the lessons from our own errors and omissions. 1. 1993. Trends and Lessons A detailed account of the characteristics of economic development over the past year is contained in the materials distributed to the participants in the session. So I would like to pay greater attention to the qualitative aspect of the results in 1993 and the government's work to implement the program for the development of reforms and stabilization of the economy. In the complex domestic political situation of 1993 the government succeeded in taking major steps to promote the progress of reforms. The moderately tough financial and monetary policy made it possible to keep inflation under control and reduce it significantly by the end of 1993. Privatization proceeded dynamically and additional measures were adopted to liberalize foreign economic activity. The government did everything it could to support production. Nevertheless, the economic situation remains alarming. At the end of the year the slump in industry intensified. We have come very close to the point of the irreversible destruction of our scientific and technical potential. The country's situation as regards foreign economic activity and hard currency remains tense. The problem of nonpayments has worsened again. I am certainly not saying all this so as to "inflame" the atmosphere or to attribute all our own failings to "objective circumstances." We intend to draw conclusions for ourselves first and foremost. For example, in the fight against inflation we got carried away by the sequestration of budget expenditure but sometimes we cut to the quick and did not examine in detail the consequences of the reduction of this or that budget item. As a result the budget was not able to pay in full for output produced for the state's needs or for a number of other commitments, including the payment of wages in the budget-funded sphere. Instead of seeking reserves to strengthen the revenue base and rationalize expenditure, measures of a "crisis management" character were adopted. I have to say bluntly that we sometimes fail to keep pace with events simply because of the low quality of work by ministries and departments. For over a year we have been talking about the disastrous impact of nonpayments on the financial position of enterprises, the budget, and the economy as a whole and we have been issuing instruction after instruction. But what is the result? We still do not have a full, day-to-day account of reciprocal indebtedness in the national economy. I am not saying that the problem is simple. But at times you get the impression that neither the Finance Ministry, nor the Economy Ministry, nor the State Committee for the Management of State Property, nor the Central Bank considers this to be its problem. Meanwhile the situation is getting worse day by day. I want to talk in particular about sectorial ministries and departments. It seems at times that even now their main aim is to obtain money and benefits for their enterprises in the belief that [the constraints of] state policy and the government's real potential do not apply to them. Meanwhile, very little specific work is being done with enterprises, including work to sort out nonpayments, to evaluate the state of and prospects for enterprises, and to prepare effective recommendations for them. The Finance Ministry must be reminded that it is not merely a bookkeeper and that ultimately the budget and its execution are among the main instruments of the government's economic policy. A host of grievances and mutual recriminations sometimes result from an elementary reluctance to explain the real situation regarding state finances and the reasons for harsh budget restrictions. I know that it is very difficult to work in this area today. Nevertheless, the economy does not exist for the sake of the Finance Ministry, the Finance Ministry exists for the sake of the economy. Last fall we adopted the action plan to implement stage one of the government program. How is it being carried out? An analysis has shown that only one-half of the 88 instructions included in the plan have been implemented in full. Furthermore, in a number of cases that implementation is clearly only formal. The implementation of such fundamentally important decisions as, for example, agricultural production-sharing, the development of agricultural credit and insurance, and the introduction of land as a surety and mortgages, has been frustrated. Yet the Ministry of Agriculture knows that beyond these decisions lies the solution of many difficult problems in agriculture. The leaders of ministries and departments must view the economy as a whole and pursue an overall state policy. By no means all leaders proved capable last year of resisting the pressure of lobby interests especially when these attacks were accompanied by a powerful "barrage of noise," which, furthermore, had political overtones. I want to make one more point. It is impossible to implement a reform if one looks down on the country and the people and does not explain things or ask for the consent of those on whose behalf we are actually working. Or on whose behalf we should be working at any rate. I want our government and leaders of the executive organs of power in the regions to be able to see the country's economic problems from grass roots level -- through the eyes of our citizens. Then I am convinced that the majority of the poeople will understand and support the reforms. 2. Move Forward While Taking Account of Socioeconomic Realities When summing up the results not just in 1993 but also over the past two years of reforms, we must see first and foremost the new problems which the Russian economy is encountering today. First, a new situation has developed over prices. Domestic prices for the majority of goods and services (apart from energy sources) have moved close to world prices. This, on the one hand, has helped to saturate the market and has been conducive to the free establishment of new economic ties and the development of trade and normal market relations. Russian enterprises have experienced the competition of foreign goods and a perceptible blow has been dealt to monopoly practices. But, on the other hand, a steadily growing number of enterprises are running at a loss and are proving inefficient and uncompetitive. Second, the moderately tough financial and monetary-credit policy did yield definite fruit although it failed to stop inflation. The rate of inflation, disregarding January 1994, has slowed perceptibly. In February it was 13-15 percent at most, in other words it was at the level of November-December. There are grounds for hoping that we will be able to maintain that level in the next few months and then achieve better results. However, I make no secret of the fact that we are alarmed by the asymmetrical response of the national economy to the measures contained in the tough monetary policy: On the one hand the swelling of the money supply is a powerful boost to inflation but, contrary to expectations, it is not leading to a stabilization of production and is blocking the so vital processes of its structural restructuring. At the same time, the slowdown in the rate of growth of the money supply is causing a sharp slump in production and increasing the strain on enterprises' financial situation without influencing price movements. This is what we have gained as a result of the powerful pressure on the money supply in June-October 1993. Consequently it is necessary to recognize not only the fact that macroeconomic stabilization has not been achieved yet, but also that this can hardly be achieved by means of a tough monetary policy alone. You cannot make great progress by cutting budget expenditure or by raising taxes alone. Nonpayments and the large tax arrears today are attributable not just to budget debts and the debts of the CIS countries but also to the extremely poor financial discipline and mutual lack of exactingness by partners who prefer to address all their claims to the government. People often talk about the lack of money in the economy as a consequence of the shock therapy policy. But the facts indicate otherwise: On the whole there is enough in circulation, what is lacking is order and the normal control of money movements. Third, the slump in production in 1993 and in the opening months of this year proved greater than anticipated. Efficiency is in decline and there is a threat of mass unemployment and the reduction of the production apparatus. In a number of sectors the volume of production is less than 50 percent of the January 1990 level. Stoppages of work at production units, including such major enterprises as "Avtovaz," "Kirovskiy Zavod," "Baltiyskiy Zavod," and others have acquired a new and hitherto unseen quality. The crisis has affected not just those sectors where the greatest reduction of production was forecast but also those which are producing what is, in principle, competitive output, output which is in demand, such as consumer goods. In these conditions it is obvious that the question can no longer be expressed merely in terms of "more or less money." It is clear that without a sufficiently tough financial and monetary policy no progress will be made here, just as has happened in other countries. But it is hardly possible to radically change the situation in the country for the better by these means alone either. Hence the need to use the full range of market methods of state regulation. Thus today, while not slackening our efforts in the sphere of economic stabilization in the slightest, we must operate equally resolutely on other aspects of Russia's economic life. Many of the reserves of the reform have not been fully utilized. The solution, in our opinion, is to focus efforts on the solution of the following main tasks: -- the strengthening of state power and the imposition of order in all spheres of the economy and society's life; -- the implementation of an intelligent, moderately tough financial policy; -- the resolute stepping up of structural investment policy; -- substantial changes to the privatization policy so as to direct it not simply toward the distribution of state property but also toward increasing production efficiency, stimulating investments, and stepping up the structural restructuring; -- using every opportunity to intensify social policy so as to finally steer the reforms toward the people and eliminate the main sources of people's discontent; -- and the consolidation of all the healthy forces in society to resolve the tasks of the new stage of the reforms and achieve national accord on this platform. I proceed from the premise that virtually the entire range of these tasks of ours was presented in the president's message. That message tells us what we must do. Our duty is to determine how to do this and fulfill what has been planned. 3. Formulating Effective Mechanisms for Economic Stabilization Let me begin with the imposition of order and the strengthening of the state principle in the economy. The measures we have proposed have nothing to do with unquestioning administration by decree or autocratically putting the screws on. It must be understood that we are not talking about reverting to the old methods of government or restoring the omnipresent role of the state. The objective is to put an end to chaos and secure elementary things that are natural in any civilized state, but which are regrettably lacking in ours, namely the proper fulfillment of commitments to partners, the payment of taxes and debts, or failing that, a declaration of bankruptcy. Therefore, as far as I am concerned, order is synonymous with reliable laws that work and a developed system of institutions which are needed for a full-fledged market economy. Let me say that the president's message says outright that the institutional avenue of reform should be the main one. On the other hand, the creation of new market institutions effectively means the continuation in the economic sphere of the general guidelines for state building that Russia is implementing today. What are the immediate urgent tasks here? We will set up the missing institutions in the investment and social spheres and in the management of the domestic and foreign state debt, as well as support for Russian industrial exports. On the other hand, it is necessary to take a careful look at what has been achieved by, for example, existing institutions like the State Investment Fund, the Financial Corporation, the Russian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and countless extrabudgetary funds. Plenty of time has already elapsed since they were set up. What return have these structures provided, especially since many of them were given the rights of government agents? There is just one approach here -- state funds and state prestige must serve national economic interests. Institutional transformations will be continued in the sphere of banking. The Central Bank regrettably does not always rise to the situation. We expect it to make specific proposals on how to develop the banking system. We are in favor of amalgamating banking capital and bringing it closer to production up to the point where it would be directly involved in the financial-industrial groups that are being formed. We are also in favor of lifting the unwarranted restrictions on participation in privatization and the investment process in 1994. I think that life will force us to take a different approach to competition with foreign banks. Our bankers by no means benefit from "hothouse" conditions. We cannot see or feel any initiative, where is it? Strengthening legislative backup for market reforms remains the government's special concern. Using its constitutional right of legislative initiative, the government has prepared over 60 top-priority draft laws for the State Duma to examine. Suffice it to mention the draft Civil, Commercial, and Criminal Codes, amendments to the laws on enterprises and on banks, draft laws on state monopolies, on the fundamental principles of self-government, on mortgages, and so on. It would take too long to list all the draft laws we have initiated. A list of them has already been sent to the State Duma. What is more, it is very important that the draft federal constitutional law "On the Government of the Russian Federation" be drafted and submitted to the Duma forthwith. The adoption of this law would be the culmination of the reorganization of the federal executive structure in line with the Constitution. The government's work is also being restructured to preclude duplication and draw a distinct line between the areas of competence of the Presidential Administration, the Security Council, and executive organs at local level. To date the number of federal executive and state government organs has dropped from 93 to 77, including a fall in the number of organs in the Government from 37 to 23. The number of apparatus personnel, including government apparatus personnel, is also being cut. Agrarian reform provides a classic example of the formation of new market institutions. I will be frank and say that its future is beginning to cause misgivings. The government's interest in this is supremely clear. The more intensive the transformations in the agrarian sector, the more effective the structure of ownership, the fewer problems with reform, and the less strain on the budget. Subsidies for agricultural producers are essential, but they are burdensome for the budget and often ineffective now. We must be realists after all! By the middle of last year we had not only drawn close to, but had effectively overstepped the mark in terms of the amount of budget aid that we can give agriculture without jeopardizing other sectors of the economy. At the same time I must also mention the unscrupulous speculation regarding the government's policy on the agrarian sector. The figure of 34 trillion rubles [R] -- which Chernomyrdin allegedly wants to earmark for agriculture from budget funds -- has been brought up by someone and has begun to appear in the press. That is not true, I would willingly provide that amount, but where is it to come from? The measures of state support in force in 1993 will remain the same in 1994, but no more. We are embarking on the radical reform of the whole system of state support for agriculture. We will provide money in return for a guaranteed result and for strictly defined purposes. We must know how much food -- and of what quality -- Russian citizens will receive in return for the budget funds allocated. We will extend our support for agricultural production via the network of specialized credit and other market institutions: cooperative, mortgage, and land banks, consumer credit companies, and wholesale food markets. Everything that I have mentioned, plus rigorous observance of the balance of powers and responsibility between the Center and the regions, are the main components of policy in 1994, a policy that is designed to streamline the economic system. But there are also urgent problems that need to be resolved over the next two-three months. These are primarily the creation of mechanisms to resolve the crisis of reciprocal nonpayments in the national economy. In order to combat nonpayments the government has formulated additional measures to improve settlements in the national economy. We will introduce compulsory registration of all enterprises' accounts, including those abroad, and tighten up administrative and financial liability for concealing such accounts and for exceeding the timeframe for processing payment documents. The work on converting overdue debts into bills of exchange will be completed in March or April. This will make it possible to tackle the nonpayment problem on a regular basis in line with the requirements of a market economy. And we will rigorously apply the following rule: If you do not have the money to pay your debts, your property is forefeit. It is time that creditors learned to recover their debts via the courts and not put their trust in "kind uncles" in the government. However, resolving the problem of nonpayment and collecting taxes in full is not just the task of the Federal Government. The Central Bank of Russia is being intolerably slow in its work to create a reliable, fast payment system based on interbank clearing and the use of modern technical facilities and new means of payment. Controls have been relaxed with regard to the activity of commercial banks which "hold" to their own advantage money which enterprises have paid to cover reciprocal debts or in taxes. Tough, prompt steps must be taken here. Consider this both a request and an instruction to the Central Bank leadership. The economic situation requires a resolute enhancement of the effectiveness of financial policy. We cannot allow ourselves the luxury of living for two years without a ratified budget, to all intents and purposes amid financial lawlessness. Therefore the number one task is to complete the work on the draft budget for 1994. The key task here remains to prevent the budget deficit rising through inflationary sources of funding. The main means of stopping this is to reduce the rate of inflation to 7-9 percent by the end of the year and the federal budget deficit to no more than 9-10 percent of GDP. I would point out that these parameters must be regarded as the maximum permissible levels -- particularly in terms of the level of inflation -- as a kind of "minimum program." When implementing the budget and carrying out other measures, we will actively seek reserves which make it possible to consistently move toward the figure of 3-5 percent inflation by the end of the year mentioned in the president's message. Needless to say, this represents a fairly tight framework especially since we have to pay in full the debts carried over from 1993. Regrettably, this year too we will be unable to avoid sequestration. But how are we to approach this? A simple repetition of last year's method, using the principle of something for everyone, can only aggravate the situation. We may "lose" all structural and investment policy if we do not carry out a detailed preliminary analysis of the financial situation in each sphere of budget funding and the consequences of a further reduction in spending. And we have no right to permit that now. The structure of budget spending and the mechanism for funding this spending are being substantially reformed. Extremely tight supervision is being established to ensure that budget appropriations reach their destination promptly and are used for their prescribed purpose. The results of 1993 showed that state funds by no means always reach those for whom they were destined. As happened, for instance, with the budget loans to cover grain procurements, which were used by Roskhleboprodukt to fund its current spending. Beginning in March, the Ministry of Finance will be responsible for delivering monthly reports to the government regarding the results of inspections to verify that budget appropriations have reached their destination. A government commission will carry out similar inspections regarding the utilization of centralized credit resources. The situation here, as you know, is even worse: The recipient receives the money every six months, or not at all. Things are particularly bad with regard to credits for "shipments to the North." Funding of targeted social security, along with support for certain sectors of industry, the agro-industrial complex, the fuel and energy complex, and the investment complex remain a priority in state spending in 1994. It is envisaged that over 20 percent of all budget spending will be channeled into these areas. Spending on financial support for the regions is up from 10 to 13.4 percent. Compared with 1993 appropriations for payment of wages in the budget-funded sphere are also up (from 6.7 to 7.2 percent). Financial stabilization cannot be ensured without an effective /tax system./ It is here that the main reserves for raising budget revenue are concentrated. The government regards the following as priority tasks: ensuring the stability of the tax system, considerably simplifying and streamlining taxation procedures, abolishing individual concessions to enterprises and regions, and reinforcing the tax service. At the same time we will improve tax legislation in order to ensure that it helps to support commodity producers and stimulate investments. That will ultimately enable us to avoid introducing new taxes and levies and reduce the overall burden of taxation. Tax arrears and extremely poor financial discipline are still the major problem. The situation here is not merely intolerable, but effectively an emergency. In 1993 alone the federal budget failed to receive R7.5 trillion or 30 percent of the total predicted revenue. Enterprises' and organizations' tax arrears which are increasing every month amid the ongoing nonpayments crisis are particularly alarming. In January 1994 alone the federal budget was owed almost R1 trillion in tax arrears. These figures conceal a scandalous situation, one that affects virtually all sectors of the national economy, moreover. In the fuel and energy complex, in particular, in the last six months alone tax avoidance has been revealed to total R200 billion! Especially major irregularities have been revealed at the "Kirishinefteorgsintez," "Permneft," and "Orenburgneft" Production Associations and other enterprises. Thus an audit at the "Kirishinefteorgsintez" Production Association revealed that hard-currency profits had been concealed along with major irregularities in financial documentation. The budget has recovered around R13 billion, including fines. Nevertheless, the tax service and the tax police still have an extremely low success rate. Since it spends a considerable amount of money on over 135,000 personnel in these organs, the state has a right to expect them to be more effective in suppressing tax crime and in collecting the state revenue due in full and on time. I would particularly like to dwell on the radical restructuring of budget relations with the regions, which is one of the main areas of financial policy in 1994. The new system of budget federalism will be based on unified rules whereby state spending and revenue are to be allocated among the federal budget and the budgets of Federation components. With no exceptions. That will make it possible to avoid unnecessary centralization of spending and to create a real revenue base for federal and regional budget autonomy. The main principles and avenues for the reform of budget relations have been laid down in the president's message and his 22 December 1993 edict. Our task is to work out forthwith a coordinated mechanism for their implementation in the 1994 budget. To wind up the subject of the budget I would like to underline particularly the following point: To all intents and purposes in this document we have tried for the first time in many years to tell the truth and nothing but the truth. It is all there for the public to see: How much we have at our disposal, how we intend to handle what we have got. The government has no "secret hiding places." Let us act on the basis of reality and learn to live according to our means. There is no, and there will be no other option. The choice is an extremely tough one: If we allow hyperinflation, we will break into a flat spin from which there is no escape. If we stop production, we will end up with a country in ferment, amid collapse and chaos. Thus, we have to literally walk on a knife edge and show strength of character in order to prevent any breakdown. That is the main question today, Structural-investment policy is taking center stage today among the priorities of economic reform. Very many industrial enterprises have found themselves in an extremely difficult situation -- either they reorganize production and find themselves a real long-term foothold in the market or they close down, forever. I think that everyone is aware of the social consequences of this choice, which may be an extremely common phenomenon. This is why the state simply no longer has the right to remain aloof. We have no more resources. Financial restrictions are becoming tighter and tighter. But we must therefore start the maneuvers that will in time enable us to expand the frontiers and create the conditions for stable growth. The national economy already has certain resources in the form of private savings. But they are not geared to production investment in current conditions without state support. At the same time the amount of budget spending on state investment is far inferior to subsidies and grants and, at the same time, the bulk of this money is invested in facilities with a dubious return, to put it mildly. This is an impasse from which we must extricate ourselves. We will first embark on the radical redistribution of budget funds into state investment. To total 3 percent of GDP (up from 1.7 percent). Three-fourths of budget funds destined for capital investment will be used to fund the construction of federal installations within the framework of the corresponding state programs. Naturally, we must review the list of these installations and considerably tighten our belts. Without abandoning our avowed priorities in structural policy we are now switching to a more specific "point-by-point" definition of these priorities. Investment policy in 1994 is being adjusted with an eye to this. Around 40 of the 66 federal programs that have already been ratified and submitted to the government this year will be implemented. At the same time we are revising the procedure for the provision of subsidies and grants. They will drop from 9 to 7.4 percent of total budget spending in 1994. And that is not the end. It is also necessary to learn that state investments are not only investments in capital construction but also in enterprise reorganization, improvement of management, scientific developments, the development of a sales network and marketing services, and personnel training. Small investments in "eliminating" countless difficulties and adapting enterprises to market requirements that will bring a return in a year or two can more rapidly ensure a breakthrough in the production sphere. We cannot further delay work to shut down ineffective production units. We already have a list of enterprises whose viability is to be checked out. Many will simply have to be shut down. Needless to say, we will do that in our own good time, mindful of people's interests, the state of cities and regions, and opportunities for creating new jobs. It will be a hard decision. But it must be done. The government will help in carrying out major investment projects involving private capital that are of fundamental importance for the future of the Russian economy. We have something to offer the private sector and foreign investors. We already have projects for housing construction, the construction of toll highways and bridges, and the development of civil aviation and the automobile industry, projects whose implementation will provide hundreds of thousands of extra jobs by forming new markets and reviving business activity in these and associated sectors -- namely the development of highway machine building, the construction industry, and so on. It is particularly important that real conditions should emerge for major resettlement programs in many parts of the Chernozem Zone, the Nonchernozem Zone, and the Urals, for instance, which people left in order to open up new areas and build industrial complexes in the former USSR republics, and so on. I think that state funds will bring the greatest return if they are provided on commercial principles, via banks and other financial institutions. It is these institutions that can select, professionally formulate, and evaluate investment projects, invest their own resources and those they have enlisted in these projects, and bear economic accountability for their effective use as scheduled. I must say that banks and entrepreneurs are already beginning to show interest in this work. I have got to sign a government decree which envisages measures to stimulate private investment organized by a consortium of Russian banks and entrepreneurs. It is intended to provide state guarantees for private investment in projects they have chosen in conjunction with the Russian Ministry of the Economy. New proposals of this kind must be implemented and formulated without fail. I take this opportunity today to urge entrepreneurs, bankers, and leaders of major joint-stock companies, in a word, Russian business people to be bolder in participating in investment projects and enlisting capital to our Russian market. And there are projects in which to invest. Splendid projects, interesting, highly profitable projects in which investors can recoup their investment. The government will do all this and will be accountable, jointly with you, for the results. I am convinced that only then will foreign investors be bolder and more confident about following your lead. The result being that we will obtain what the country needs so badly today -- highly productive labor, "high" technologies, modern machinery and equipment, and production discipline and order that are up to world standards. And we will therefore be able to produce output that society really needs, output that will not be afraid of competition on either the home or the foreign markets. I am convinced that we can achieve this by joint efforts. During the next stage of reform one of the most important instruments for the structural restructuring of the economy, which is proceeding by strengthening the institutions of private ownership, is /privatization./ By 1 July we must complete the program of mass (check) privatization. This means that we must provide every Russian citizen with an opportunity to invest vouchers in shares in enterprises or investment funds, in plots of land, and other facilities. A new phase of privatization policy will start as of the second half of the year. During this phase the main form of privatization will be commercial and, most importantly, investment tenders with fairly tough terms which ensure the reorganization and modernization of enterprises and the requisite flow of investment, including from abroad. The progress of privatization is undoubtedly one of the most important criteria by which one can judge the extent to which the Russian economy is acquiring market qualities. From this viewpoint it is extremely important to ensure that in 1994 privatization becomes a kind of locomotive of reform at microlevel. We must bring reform to enterprise level and consolidate it via real changes in the economic behavior of Russian commodity producers. In order to achieve this it is necessary to, first, launch mechanisms for financial recovery and bankruptcies at enterprises that are recognized to be insolvent debtors, which are essentially unnecessary and operating at a loss. Second, it is a question of postprivatization support for enterprises. One "sound" plan based on the "LOMO" Association in St. Petersburg is already prepared. I know that another 12 similar projects are in the offing. That is something. But efforts must be stepped up. In 1994 we must create a continuous flow of projects to restructure enterprises. We will use foreign credits provided by the G-7, the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for this purpose. The purpose of all our privatization efforts today is to move away from distributing and redistributing property to creating the conditions to enhance the effectiveness and competitiveness of production, improve management, and stimulate investment. There are tremendous reserves here and we must utilize them. 4. Carrying Out Reform for People It should be acknowledged that social policy has proved to be a weak point in the government's work. Such a situation cannot be tolerated any more and must be rectified forthwith. The majority of citizens should feel that the reforms are bringing real benefits to them, their families, and the people around them and that the full burden of the crisis is being borne not only by ordinary working people but also by those who -- in the new conditions -- have drastically shot ahead in terms of prosperity. We are, of course, carrying out reform not in order that "there be no rich" but, on the contrary, in order that there be no poor. But we have no right either to allow a ten- to elevenfold gap to develop in incomes and standard of living between the lowest-income and highest-income groups of the population and let Russia become the world record holder in this regard. Reform should be not just economically effective but also socially just! In this regard the government has recently been working on the formulation of a more vigorous social policy course. You have been issued with the draft Basic Guidelines of Social Policy of the Russian Federation for 1994, supported by a list of priority tasks. Incidentally, several of them have already been implemented. Seeking to ensure that social policy take more specific account of the interests of all strata of the population, the government intends first and foremost to enhance targeted support for the disadvantaged and strengthen the financial base of the relevant funds. Recalculation of the old-style pensions will start on 1 April 1994, in accordance with the president's edict. The new pensions law, the draft of which will be submitted to the Federal Assebly for examination, will be the next step aimed at improving pensioners' material position. It is extremely necessary to do everything possible to ensure that priority is given to veterans and those people who simply cannot wait for an overall solution of the problem during the process of /gradually restoring the savings/ of citizens. Some of the savings could and indeed must be restored by transferring some state property -- shares, state enterprises, and land -- to depositors. The government is now working on this task. Unemployment has become tangible. There is still relatively little overt unemployment, but almost 4 million people are now working part time. And we must be prepared for an upsurge in the problems of unemployment in the immediate future -- we must be prepared in psychological, material, and organizational terms. It is essential to start considering right now in specific terms the organization of public works, particularly the construction of housing, roads, bridges, and other socially important facilities. I am repeating myself again, but I do regard this as extremely important. We will give priority support to all private capital initiatives in this sphere. The government intends/to intensify incomes policy/ substantially, we will introduce tougher progressive taxation of high and very high incomes and the declaration of incomes when carrying out major purchases, and will make changes to the taxation of real estate. The procedure for regulating enterprises' outlay on labor remuneration is being changed. The gap between the wages of enterprise directors and the wages of the bulk of the workers -- which is sometimes gigantic -- must be closed. It is unacceptable when the average wage of a worker is 50,000 rubles [R] while the director allocates himself 3-4 million for his vacation. The introduction of an official subsistence level and the linking of the size of the minimum wage and minimum pension to it will be an important step. The country's financial position does not permit their equalization during 1994. However, the government does consider the creation of conditions for their subsequent harmonization to be one of its most important tasks. And one more thing I would like to say. Is there anyone at local level and in the sector departments thinking about what people will do if their plant goes bankrupt or production comes to a halt? They may have skilled hands, a clear brain, and an enormous desire to work, but a host of bans, restrictions, and bureacratic obstacles prevent their opening up a "business" -- the business may be small but it could develop with time into a major production unit of Russia-wide importance. I see the government's task here as being to remove as quickly as possible all obstacles to displays of initiative, enterprise, and hard work by our citizens. Today we should promote the task of drastically boosting housing construction and making the acquisition of housing easier for the population, particularly for low-income groups. This is, in the full meaning of the word, a nationwide task. A package of decrees has already been adopted on the development of a system for granting credit in the housing sphere and on subsidies for the construction and acquisition of housing, including subsidies to people on waiting lists, servicemen, and others in preferential categories. But this is extremely little. In future we intend to increase out efforts, developing above all extrabudgetary forms of investment in housing construction, attracting private capital and foreign investment into this sphere, and bringing new credit and mortgage mechanisms into operation. It has to be honestly admitted that today we are not in a position to repay in full from the federal budget all that is owed to the spheres of science, education, and culture, notably as regards compliance with the president's edict No. 1. This is both our misfortune and our pain. I consider that it is impossible for the regions either to stand aloof from this now. At the same time, while I do understand the sense of dissatisfaction felt by higher education lecturers, students, and staffers of scientific institutes, I have to say frankly that the system of science and higher education will not survive without rationalization of their activity, sensible redistribution of resources, and jettisoning of superflous tiers. A selective approach is also required here -- the best must be kept. The underfinancing of social expenditure is a very serious question. But there is also another aspect too. The preparation of documents and decisions aimed at radically reforming the social sphere has been dragged out intolerably and the new mechanisms for social protection and the implementattion of incomes policy are being developed and introduced into practice extremely slowly. I want to draw the attention of ministers with a social brief to this. Fighting crime is our nationwide social, political, and -- I would also say -- economic priority task. I would like to convey to you our serious concern over the current state of law and order in the country and the ability of the authorities to counter the aggression of the criminal world. There are still to date very, very few real and, most importantly, effective measures capable of easing the tension surrounding the growing threats to society and to people's life, health, and property. Russians have the right to expect and demand more from us all. I will refer to just a few trends, first and foremost those in the economic sphere. The danger of organized crime and corruption is growing. According to the figures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, criminal associations control at least 40,000 businesses, including buisnesses in the state sector. The unprecedented scale of criminal activity in the finance and banking systems is causing special alarm. We estimate that the damage now runs into hundreds of billions of rubles. All this is no longer just a list of unpleasant facts. What we have here is a dangerous trend toward the malignant degeneration of a number of pieces of the living tissue of the economy. We see the danger and will block it. We are carrying out tough measures aimed at freeing state structures from the influence of mafia elements, organized crime, and corrupt individuals. We will act regardless of the person involved, as it were. We are also implementing the task put forward in the president's message of taking all necessary financial, cadre, and organizational measures necessary to ensure the normal operation of the law enforcement organs. We will be doing all within our power to ensure that the just-adopted federal anticrime program operates to its full potential. Esteemed participants in the session, the government bears a great responsibility today -- responsibility for the progress of reform, its cost to the millions of people, and for the political temperature of the young Russian democracy, which is going through the difficult period of its self-determination both in this country and the world. Each week this year will see this responsibility merely augmented by more and more facets. We do not have classic "government parties" in our country. Nor do we have monotonous "orthodoxy" subject to some kind of party discipline. We have already gone through all that. There are parties whose representatives work in the cabinet on a professional basis. In presenting to society today our understanding of the tasks at the new stage of reform we can see that they are in keeping with the demands and manifestos of many parties and movements. And it follows from this that political consolidation and national accord are gaining real ground in Russia today. I would like to express the hope that the State Duma's act of political and economic amnesty will, for all the differences in interpretation of that decision, nevertheless become a step toward reconciliation and not signify another spiral in confrontation and destabilization of the situation in society. The president and the government stand as firm guarantors ensuring that no such development of events occurs. I cannot today avoid touching on a problem that is extremely important both for me personally and for the government I head. The point is that a noisy campaign has recently been launched by some mass media organs aimed at "convicting" the government chairman of concentrating power, of taking too much upon himself, and of virtually organizing plots to take over the presidency. Even some polls have begun to be organized on this topic. Let me tell you honestly and frankly that I am not one of those versatile "whizz kids" who can immediately leap from being laboratory head to being a minister and then president. First: Russia is not a racing car and I have not gotten behind its wheel, taken it for a spin, and then gotten out of it, leaving the whole country trembling as if suffering from a fever. Second, I consider it impossible and simply unethical to hold any discussion on the presidency while there is a president in office. We have a nationwide leader elected by all the people, and I have no intention of scheming against him. And, third, attempts to drive a wedge between the president and the chairman and cause us to fall out are in vain. It won't work. There is no point in trying. We all need accord today. All branches of power and all leaders, whichever posts they occupy, need it. Accord is essential for all the people. All the conditions for this are in place. There is the new Constitution. There is the president, who acts as a reliable guarantor of reforms and stability. There are the bases of the concept of national development formulated in the president's Message. There is parliament, which, for all the diversity of views on the country's present and future represented in it, aims to secure Russia's strategic interests. There is the government, which is committed to the president's course and is open to businesslike cooperation and professional work with everyone who is ready and really want this. There is finally the Russians' common desire to revive the country as a great, powerful, and prosperous state. This year promises to see the development and strengthening of many healthy economic processes. There is therefore every reason to hope that the gradual stabilization of the economy and normalization of life will finally become a tangible reality for miliions of people. For all this to happen we have to think more about work today. Strict dicipline, order, and a sense of responsibility are absolutely essential to us. All of us must really shake ourselves up and realize that what we need today is to create and work, ditching old relations and old production units while maintaining and supporting modern high-tech production and the fundamental sciences, for otherwise we will fall into the trap of stagflation, which will lead in turn to the total degradation of the whole economy We must not fall below the start-up level so essential if a powerful upsurge in the industrialization of the country is to be launched. Although certain "friends" very much wish this upon us. We cannot allow the people of a country, which possesses powerful resources and all that is required for [economic] reproduction, to live in poverty -- that is a crime, a crime which can be neither explained nor understood. I appeal to members of the government, the leaders of departments, the intelligentsia, and academics -- we must create the conditions and mechanisms for free labor, and we need to do this quickly, without delay. I appeal to parliamentarians and the two speakers of the chambers -- we expect of you the laws and statutes that are so essential and necessary, and also perhaps provisional statutes at times during this transitional period -- the main thing is that work should not stop. I appeal to our labor collectives in all regions of the country -- the difficulties we face are enormous, but trying to solve them by strikes and stoppages is a delusion, it will only make the situation of your families and friends worse rather than improving it. That is not what is required today -- we must all stand firm together, that way we will pull through. We need less moaning and whining today and more initiative and self-discipline. That is the only way we will be able to pull out of the spin we are in, gain height, and develop a cruising speed for reforms. This is where I today see the thrust of the government's work in 1994.
