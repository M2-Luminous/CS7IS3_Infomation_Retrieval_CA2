Sources of the DIEX, which comes under the Interior Ministry, have told EL NACIONAL the entries of the former chief of the CIA's counterespionage Soviet Division to the country did not appear in immigration records. The visits to Venezuela attributed by REUTERS to Ames' wife Maria del Rosario Casas Ames, of Colombian origin, were not recorded either. It should be noted the entries and departures file has computer records for the last three years. Arrivals or departures made before 1990 must be looked up manually. International wire reports have reported Ames had been meeting with CIA personnel since 1985 in the Venezuelan capital. It is therefore presumed he entered the country with false identification. Ames has been accused of counterspying for the Soviet Union and later for Russia. He reportedly earned $1.5 million for his efforts. When this report was written, DIEX officials had not received the official order to determine the migratory movement of the spy or his wife. Editor's Note: In a NEW YORK TIMES report published yesterday, it is said U.S. authorities have revealed Ames met with his contacts during two secret trips to Santa Fe de Bogota (in October of 1992) and Caracas (in November of 1993). U.S. authorities have found cryptographic messages in the middle of papers investigated which are related to Caracas, and they said $86,700 were deposited into Ames' accounts at the Dominion Bank of Virginia and The Riggs National Bank upon his return from the Venezuelan capital.
