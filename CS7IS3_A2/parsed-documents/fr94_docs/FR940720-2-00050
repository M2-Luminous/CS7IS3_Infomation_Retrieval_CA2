FR940720-2-00050 FR940720-2-00040 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Administration for Children and Families Reallotment of Funds for FY 1993 Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) AGENCY: Office of Community Services, ACF, DHHS. ACTION: Notice of Determination Concerning Funds Available for Reallotment. SUMMARY: In accordance with section 2607(b)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621 et seq.), as amended, a notice was published in the Federal Register on June 6, 1994 announcing the Secretary's preliminary determination that $22,591 in FY 1993 LIHEAP funds may be reallotted. After further evaluation, the Secretary has determined that no funds from FY 1993 would be reallotted. This determination was based on the fact that a large number of grantees would receive grant awards of less than one dollar ($1.00). Other grantees would receive grant awards of less than one hundred dollars ($100.00). It would not be cost effective to reallot these small amounts of funds. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Janet M. Fox, Director, Division of Energy Assistance, Office of Community Services, 370 L'Enfant Promenade, SW., Washington, DC 20447; telephone (202) 401&hyph;9351. Dated: July 13, 1994.
