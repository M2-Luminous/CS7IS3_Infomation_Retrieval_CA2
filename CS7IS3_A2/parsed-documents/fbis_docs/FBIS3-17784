FBIS3-17784 "drsov061cc_94004" FBIS-SOV-94-061 Document Type:Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 INTERREGIONAL AFFAIRS Kozyrev Interviewed on Baltic Issues WS3003094794 Tallinn BNS in English 1756 GMT 30 Mar 94 WS3003094794 Tallinn BNS Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Moscow, Mar 29, BNS -- The Baltic states didn't join the Soviet Union in 1940 of their own free will, but it cannot be regarded as annexation, either, Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev stated in an interview to BNS today. "Despite everything, Russia condemns the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and the Stalinist oppression," Kozyrev said in the interview. The Russian foreign minister met today with the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe High Commissioner for National Minorities Max van der Stoel to discuss the problems of ethnic minorities in Estonia and Latvia. Stoel voiced the opinion that there are many problems in the framework of the ethnic issue which are waiting to be solved. "On the one hand, the preservation of those states' national character needs to be safeguarded; on the other, the future of the Russians living there must be secured on an equal footing," the CSCE high commissioner maintained. Speaking about the alleged human rights violations in Estonia and Latvia, Stoel admitted that "neither torturing nor deportation of members of ethnic minorities occurs there." Yet, he said, both countries have serious problems pertaining to the legal status of the Russian-speaking population. "I drafted numerous recommendations to remedy the matter and I hope they will be accepted," Stoel said. Kozyrev said Russia expects the Baltic Sea countries to establish the post of a regional national minorities commissioner. The Russian foreign minister said that the troop withdrawal negotiations with Estonia and Latvia have reached the final stage. All issues, including that of social protection for Russian military pensioners, have been resolved, he claimed. "The package of agreements will be signed after discussion in the Estonian and the Latvian parliaments and approval by those countries' heads of state," was Kozyrev's opinion. Kozyrev emphasized that Russia managed to coordinate the troop withdrawal with Lithuania and Latvia "in a civilized manner, on a contractual basis." The signing of a similar agreement with Estonia now depends on that Baltic nation, he said. In Kozyrev's view, this will help "Russia's friends in the West" to focus attention on the protection of human rights in Estonia and Latvia. Russia withdrew its troops from Lithuania by September 1993. To date, also a troop pullout agreement with Latvia has been initialed. The problem of the status of Russian military pensioners remains the stumbling-block at the Estonian-Russian talks.
