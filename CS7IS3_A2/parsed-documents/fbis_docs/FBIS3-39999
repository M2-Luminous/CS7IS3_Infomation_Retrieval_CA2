In the first stage (1994-1995), the business sectors concerned are machine-tool building, material motion technology, furniture, and medical technology. In the second stage (1995-1996), they are presumably ship's equipment, building machines and equipment, packaging machines, and waste-treatment technology. The budget for the whole project is about 14 million German marks. Seminars for enterprises in these fields are being organized and planned in Europe in May and June this year and next year. As a second step, the joint participation of a selected group of enterprises in Japanese trade fairs will be organized, that is, the Logis-Tech (material motion technology/logistics), which is taking place now, the JIMTOF [expansion not given] machine-tool fair this autumn, the Jetro Health Care in March 1995, and the Japan Pack, the Japan Home Show, the New Earth, and the International Furniture Fair from October to December 1995. As a third step, follow-up visits to Japan will be organized for the enterprises within the framework of this project about half a year after each respective trade fair. The basic costs of participation in the fairs and the visits, the publication of brochures and catalogues, the organization of receptions, news conferences, and seminars, the rent for stands, and the costs of the decoration of stands will be paid by the EU project budget. The participating enterprises, however, will have to pay for travel and accommodation themselves. The implementation of the whole project is in the hands of the Association of European Chambers of Commerce (Eurochambers), while the enterprises that are to be supported are selected by national coordinators in cooperation with the consultants Roland Berger GmbH, which belong to the Deutsche Bank Group. On the Japanese side, the EU initiative is supported in particular by the Economics Ministry (Miti) and its foreign trade organization, Jetro.
