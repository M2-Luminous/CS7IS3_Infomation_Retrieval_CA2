He said it will be within the framework of reorganizing the economy on the basis of the stability program, which was negotiated with the IMF. Meanwhile, Benachnou affirmed the commitment of the new Prime Minister Mokdad Sifi to honor Algeria's international pledges. He added that without restructuring the economy -- which is the second stage of the government's policy after balancing finances -- the stability program could never succeed. He said that options that accommodate Algeria's social reality should be found. The prime minister, who installed Benachnou in his new duty, said that the aim of creating this new ministry was to create a new nucleus in order to restructure the economy along the path of industrial restructuring and crossing into the market economy.
