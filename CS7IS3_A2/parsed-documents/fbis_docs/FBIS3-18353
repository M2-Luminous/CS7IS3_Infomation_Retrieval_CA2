He is too cautious and too polite to speak this dirty word during an election campaign. Fini is not [Communist Renewal leader] Bertinotti and does not believe that [Forza Italia leader] Berlusconi should be fooled with. So in his article, published in small print in IL SECOLO, the MSI organ, it is difficult to find "Renewing NATO," the proud MSI objective proclaimed anew in the National Alliance's program. NATO has caused real problems for the progressive alignment, and it looks like it is now about to create disarray within the freedom alignment. Mistrust is perhaps too weak a word, but hatred is perhaps too strong. The fact remains that the National Alliance absolutely cannot abide the Americans. Its dream is a great Europe, with East and West at last united, with "no subjugation" to the United States. "European autonomy in political and military decisionmaking." The first political decision would be an alliance with South America. "A comprehensive understanding embodying broad plans, with Italy and Spain as its vanguard of special influence." There would also be a "30-year European plan for Africa." This is the "European pillar" -- a force "competing" with the United States and the Far East. This is no mere side issue and related issues are clarified still further: The National Alliance says that the Maastricht Treaty too must be rejected (it is demanding a revision of the treaty) and of course that it is necessary to ensure that, "Germany's reunification" be followed by Italy's, with the return of Istria, Fiume [Rijeka], and Dalmatia, "by means of international treaties." This Super Europe must also have a seat on the UN Security Council. Remember Berlusconi? He said: "I will confine myself to the facts. I have read Fini's program; it is a liberal democratic program." Another disappointment: Berlusconi's free market economy, the driving force behind the promised Italian miracle, is virtually rejected by Fini. Of course, free enterprise is encouraged, but beware: "The state must create a social market economy." Privatization, sure. But it must facilitate "popular share ownership" across the nation. So it is necessary to avert the danger "of outright colonizations of entire production sectors." This, because "we must not forget that our European partners vigorously protect their own enterprises." So privatization must be carried out without encouraging "domestic or foreign competitors that want only to acquire centers of production with the aim of creating monopolies or oligopolies." There must be some protectionism, and let this not upset Professor Martini, Berlusconi's economist. Will a conflict now break out? Fini and Berlusconi have other things to think about. However, free trade and Atlanticism have always been fixed principles for Giorgio Caradonna -- a long-time deputy with 11 trials and seven sentences behind him, one of the few MSI figures friendly toward Israel. He is a nonconformist. His motion at the National Alliance constituent assembly was thrown out and he was left without a job. He is not running for reelection. Caradonna has therefore turned to bureaucratic channels. Unable to have the judiciary approve his motion, he has initiated proceedings against the entire MSI. Who decided on its new symbol? Who decided on its candidates? "If I win this case," he explained enthusiastically at Rome's law courts yesterday, "the National Alliance lists throughout Italy will be invalidated, and the party will be unable to contest the elections."
