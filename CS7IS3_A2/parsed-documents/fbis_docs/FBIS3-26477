Consequently, the leading indicators of social and economic development for this inland province have reached record levels: The province's total annual output value of goods and services amounted to 94 billion yuan in 1993, an increase of more than 19 billion yuan over the previous year, and equivalent to the total increase of any given four years during the eighties. The output of major agricultural products reached an all-time high, with the output value increasing 8 percent over the previous year. The province achieved 132.8 billion yuan in total industrial output value, up 37 percent over the previous year. Financial revenue exceeded 7.3 billion yuan, up 1.8 billion yuan from the preceding year. Village and town enterprises, infrastructure construction, and foreign trade all reached record levels, registering the highest increases in the nation. It is reported that Anhui has reached new levels in three areas of reform: -- Changing concepts and opening up in all directions. Anhui recovered rapidly following the massive [flood] disaster in 1992. Mindful of the fact that coastal areas were developing rapidly and inland areas were catching up, the Anhui provincial committee and government made the correct policy decision to raise its economy to a new level through internal and external cooperation, beginning with changing concepts and opening up in all directions. The implementation of the policy of opening up to the outside world based on "two points and one line" -- in Hefei and Huangshan and along the Chang Jiang -- quickly turned the hinterland into the forefront of opening up to the outside world, thereby promoting the opening up of the entire province. Meanwhile, unremitting efforts were made to cultivate a new type of cadre. The relevant departments selected and educated cadres based on their creativity and awareness of market forces and overall interests, and they organized efforts to ensure substantial headway in reform and opening up. Last year, Anhui reversed the previously unstoppable flow of trained personnel and funds to coastal areas, as developed coastal areas scrambled to invest and find cooperation opportunities in Anhui. All this injected strong vitality into Anhui's rapid development. -- Seizing opportunities to make reform the largest growth factor. By deepening reform, Anhui tapped its potential, inspired enthusiasm, and solved problems arising from the need for high input in development. In 1993, Anhui scaled new heights in rural reform as it took advantage of changes in the rural labor force, as well as urban construction in the countryside, to introduce a series of measures to reform the rural ownership structure, the industrial structure, the development of markets in factors of production, and household registration administration. This effectively promoted high quality and high efficiency in agricultural production, as well as the industrialization and urbanization of the rural economy. More than 3,000 small towns of a substantial size were initially built across the provinces, and a market system was born. More than 5 million peasants switched to secondary and tertiary industries. The output value of village and town enterprises totaled 110 billion yuan, increasing by nearly 100 percent in a year. The per capita income of peasants across the province increased by more than 100 yuan. -- Improving overall competitiveness through comprehensive reform and solving new development-related problems through reform means. Anhui accelerated supplementary reforms aimed at changing governmental functions, establishing a social security system, cultivating markets, and developing individual and private enterprises. This ensured breakthroughs in economic reform and improvements in overall strength, resulting in a three-way development pattern. Specifically in market construction, more than 4,000 good-sized markets were built across the province. With the approval of the province and the state, more than 50 specialized markets concerning factors of production were established, and there were a dozen or so country markets whose annual business volume exceeded 100 million yuan.
