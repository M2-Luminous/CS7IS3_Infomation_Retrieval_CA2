He referred to the statement issued by his government concerning the noncompliance by the United States with the New York agreement for a global solution of the nuclear issue. The document notes that the U.S. attitude has created a serious situation on the Korean peninsula that can take the nation to confrontation and war. Taking into account the stand of the U.S. Administration, Korean officials have decided unilaterally to cease compliance with the provisions concerning simultaneous measures; neither will they send a delegation to the third round of talks with the United States in Geneva. [Begin Kim Sung-yong recording, in Korean with superimposed translation into Spanish] As the statement says, we have fulfilled all our obligations included in the agreement signed with the United States in New York. But the problem is that the United States is not fulfilling its task and is putting much pressure on us. Therefore, we are not sending a delegation to the third round of talks scheduled for 21 March, and our talks with South Korea on the exchange of special envoys have also been suspended. [end recording] The DPRK and the United States have agreed to fulfill four simultaneous measures, which are: cancellation of the Team Spirit-94 joint military maneuvers; resumption of contacts of experts for the exchange of special envoys between North and South Korea; inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency intended to provide the continuation of the guarantee; and, beginning on 21 March, the third round of talks in Geneva.
