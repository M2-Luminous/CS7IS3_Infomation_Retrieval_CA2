During a speech to the America's Society, which groups most of the bankers with whom Brazil is renegotiating its foreign debt, Hussein said Brazil is the biggest cloud on the Latin American horizon. In his letter, the Brazilian ambassador said he is surprised at this statement because a World Bank official like Hussein cannot denigrate the image of a country which that bank should help.
