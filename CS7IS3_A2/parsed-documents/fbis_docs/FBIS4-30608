"There are good reasons for the key central banks ... to give clear signals to the market that this instability is nonsense and must be stopped," he said in an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE. The IMF chief said big swings in currency markets are bad for the economies involved. "Too rapid rise of the yen would be bad for the recovery timidly starting in Japan." For the United States, he said, further depreciation of the dollar does not make sense because the U.S. economic fundamentals "are certainly at the best levels during the last 20 years." Camdessus also dismissed arguments that the dollar-buying operation launched by the monetary authorities in the U.S. and other industrial powers has little effect on the market. "This kind of thing cannot be (measured) on a daily basis, or on an hour-to-hour basis," he said. "These interventions are effective not so much by the equilibrium of the market at a given moment but by the signal they give to the market players," he said. Camdessus said that over time the currency market does serve as a barometer of economic health. If intervention fails to produce a positive effect over time, "this could signal that further measures such as strengthening the macroeconomic picture could be needed, be it stimulating a little bit more the recovery in Japan, be it in the U.S. to make efforts to cut the deficit," he said. "But," Camdessus added, "this is not the problem of today." Camdessus also argued for the establishment of a so-called target zone for currencies, saying such a monetary system would yield more benefit than cost. In the short term, he said, countries participating in a currency target system may have to pay higher prices in terms of economic growth or employment. Over the long term, Camdessus said, the economic benefits of a target-zone system would be bigger because of stable currencies. "It is my conviction that target zones, target ranges, target techniques, could be an important instrument to get a strengthened stability of exchange markets," he said.
