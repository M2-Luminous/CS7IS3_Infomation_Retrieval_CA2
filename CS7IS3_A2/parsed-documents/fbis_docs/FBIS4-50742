At today's press conference, a ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE reporter asked: According to a NEW YORK TIMES report, a senior U.S. official who accompanied Christopher on his visit to the Middle East said that China had agreed with the U.S. side on sending technicians to discuss measures to stop the jamming of VOA. The report says that this is another major concession made by China to win the MFN renewal. Could you please confirm this? Wu Jianmin replied that the Chinese side has agreed with the United States to send technicians to China to talk about technical matters, such as the question of overlapping frequencies. The study of the technical problem of broadcasting frequency overlapping by the experts from the two sides has nothing to do with the most-favored-nation trading status.
