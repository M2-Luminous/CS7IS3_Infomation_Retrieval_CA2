[Reporter] The agreement on the cessation of combat activities between the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO will go into effect on 25 February at 1200. This is stipulated by the agreement signed in Zagreb this evening after six hours of negotiations by the commanders of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and the HVO, Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso. The agreement precludes all offensive operations and envisages the cessation of combat activities in all combat zones. UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] units are to be deployed along the separation lines in all the combat zones. Heavy artillery is to be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn to a minimal distance from the front line -- mortar launchers to a 10-km distance and tanks and heavy guns to a 20-km distance. A joint commission, presided over by UNPROFOR, will be formed beforehand, on the 25th, when the cease-fire goes into effect. The commission will be based in Kiseljak and its task will be to resolve disputed issues through UNPROFOR's mediation. Butrus-Ghali's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, declared that this evening's agreement was historic and that it will bring Bosnia-Herzegovina closer to a final peace. [Presenter] We will acquaint you with this peace agreement in its entirety in continuation of our program. According to the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center in Zagreb, the two delegations agreed the following: The cease-fire, which includes an immediate and absolute cessation of hostilities, comes into effect at 1200 on 25 February of this year and envisages the following: -- There will be no further offensive activities or attacks; -- All forms of propaganda spread by each side against the other will cease; -- The separation lines and positions must remain as they were at the aforementioned time; -- UNPROFOR will be deployed in sensitive areas and at key locations in order to monitor the observance of the cease-fire agreement; -- All heavy weapons over 12.7 caliber shall either be placed under UNPROFOR supervision or withdrawn to a minimal distance from the separation lines by 1200 on 7 March -- mortar launchers to a distance of 10 km and tanks and artillery to a distance of 20 km; -- A mixed commission presided over by UNPROFOR is to be formed to tackle the problems listed in the appendix which is an integral part of this agreement. The commission will be formed on 25 February 1994 in Kiseljak; -- The agreement also envisages measures to be implemented according to their order of priority: the opening of roads for the passage of humanitarian aid and UNPROFOR convoys, the passage of commercial and civilian traffic, especially, but not exclusively, between the following towns: Zenica-Stari Vitez, Mostar-Jablanica-Konjic-Sarajevo, Kiseljak-Vares, and Kiseljak-Bilalovac-Busovaca. Only the checkpoints on these roads will be controlled by UNPROFOR, although both sides will be permitted to man them as well; -- The disbanding of internment camps, the release of POW's and the exchange of bodies with the help of international organizations such as the International Red Cross; -- The unhindered and regular distribution of humanitarian aid by the UNHCR, including heating fuel for domestic consumption as well as the steady supply of water, electricity, and gas; All the above-mentioned measures are to be taken with the aim of bringing living conditions of the population of Bosnia-Herzegovina back to normal. This agreement in no way prejudges political discussions or accords that could possibly take place or be reached in future. It was also agreed that monthly, or more frequent, high-level meetings should take place between Generals Roso, Delic, and Rose, or their representatives in case they are prevented from attending. The signing of the agreement was attended by the UN secretary general's special envoy, Yasushi Akashi, as well as UNPROFOR commanders, Generals Jean Cot and Michael Rose. The Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation insisted in the talks on the withdrawal of regular Croatian troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was rejected by General Roso who denied the presence of such forces on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina. This was a report on the agreement signed by Generals Rasim Delic and Ante Roso in Zagreb today, which we received from the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army's press center.
