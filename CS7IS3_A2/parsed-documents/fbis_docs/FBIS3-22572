This is due to the fact that the population is taking care of its health." He emphasized: "If the population continues to adopt preventive measures of a hygienic and sanitary type, we shall soon be able to state that cholera has been eradicated." He stressed the importance of reiterating certain measures, such as boiling water, protecting water supplies by chlorinating them, washing fruits and vegetables, washing hands, and others. 1994 Budget He also reported that the Ministry of Economy and Finance has expressed an interest in supporting the Health Ministry, by increasing the 1994 budget by 700,000 new soles. He explained that this will enable the sector to deal more easily with the health problems on the national level, especially those associated with infectious-contagious diseases. Yong preferred not to comment on the suspension of the state employees' registration in the AFP [Pension Fund Associations] ordered by the government. He remarked: "That comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economy and Finance, not the Health Ministry. I think that the measure should be analyzed and assessed in its entirety, with the necessary good judgment, by those who have issued these orders." Yong Motta was in this city to inspect the status of the Health Ministry's services in Pucallpa, and to coordinate measures with the pertinent authorities. Health Policy With the regional health director, Antonio Mundini Medrano, he toured various settlements in the rural and riverside areas, coordinating national health policy action that must be implemented on the regional level. According to the report, they also inspected the health stations and centers, to assess the possibility of transferring them to the future private health service organizations (OSS).
