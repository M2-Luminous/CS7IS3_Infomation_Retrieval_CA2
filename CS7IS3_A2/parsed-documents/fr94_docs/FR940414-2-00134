FR940414-2-00134 FR940414-2-00084 DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Customs Service [T.D. 94&hyph;38] Amendments to Customs Bond Cancellation Standards AGENCY: U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury. ACTION: General notice. SUMMARY: Under the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury is required to publish guidelines for cancellation of bond charges. The guidelines in effect at the time the Act was promulgated were published by Treasury Decision 89&hyph;48, dated April 14, 1989. This document amends certain portions of the guidelines that have proven to be inequitable or outdated, provides for new guidelines for cases in which petitions are filed untimely and for certain violations of regulations that have recently been promulgated, and republishes those guidelines which have worked successfully. The authority to promulgate these guidelines was delegated to the Commissioner of Customs by Paragraph 1 of Treasury Department Order No. 165, revised (T.D. 53654). A document published in the Federal Register (59 FR 17144) on April 11, 1994 set forth the explanation of the guidelines, but inadvertently omitted the actual guidelines. This document republishes the explanation and sets forth the guidelines. EFFECTIVE DATE: These guidelines will take effect upon April 14, 1994, and shall be applicable to all cases which are currently open at the petition or supplemental petition stage. No second supplemental petitions shall be accepted solely to gain the benefit of a less harsh guideline. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jeremy Baskin, Penalties Branch, U.S. Customs Service, Franklin Court, 1301 Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20229, (202) 482&hyph;6950. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Section 1904 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (Pub.L. 100&hyph;418) amended section 623 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1623) by adding the following sentence at the end of section 623(c) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1623(c)): In order to assure uniform, reasonable and equitable decisions, the Secretary of the Treasury shall publish guidelines establishing standards for setting the terms and conditions for cancellation of bonds or charges thereunder. In T.D. 89&hyph;48, dated April 14, 1989, the text of guidelines for cancellation of claims for liquidated damages in effect at the time of enactment of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act was published. Because of changing enforcement priorities and the need for more efficient administrative processing, the guidelines require amendment. Through this document, Customs is publishing those changes.
