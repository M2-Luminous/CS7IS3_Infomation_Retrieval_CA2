Presidential Committee on Flagship Programs and Projects (PCFPP) Chairman Emilio Osmena told reporters yesterday his committee of seven is formulating a more focused priority list that will identify which projects can be accomplished in the next four years; which ones are to be put in place or begun; and, which ones are to be left for the next administration to implement. The current list consists of 79 "different and discrete" projects representing components of the original 19 flagship projects identified by Mr. Ramos in his First Quarter Report. Flagship projects are infrastructure projects eyed for their high impact on the economy or their necessity in supporting and encouraging the inflow of private investments. These are part of the 400 or so projects identified by the Core Public Investment Program of the National Economic and Development Authority [NEDA]. According to Mr. Osmena, the setting up of the PCFPP and the two calendars will mean better implementation of the projects. The committee, whose members include the Secretaries of Transportation and Communications, NEDA, Public Works and Highways, Tourism, Agriculture, and Trade and Industry, "will be putting on a national hat so that government does not become like an octopus where each tentacle does not know what the others are doing," said Mr. Osmena. The PCFPP head said the strategy for prioritization will take on the demographic approach. That is, creating population density centers with high domestic output. This is otherwise known as "growth corridors." Geographically, Luzon has the most number of projects, with a total investment of Pl00 billion [Philippine pesos]; the Visayas, P11.3 billion; and Mindanao, P10.2 billion.
