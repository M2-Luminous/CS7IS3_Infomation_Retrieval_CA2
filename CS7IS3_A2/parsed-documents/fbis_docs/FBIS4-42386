In his opening speech Kinkel, on behalf of the Presidium and the Federal Executive Committee, presented a corresponding resolution to the congress to vote on it. The resolution says: "On the basis of its liberal program, the FDP wants to continue the successful coalition with the CDU/CSU in the next legislative period." Kinkel stressed that this signal must "emanate" from the congress "to the outside." It is considered certain that the about 660 delegates will approve the coalition statement by a great majority. Kinkel harshly attacked the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Greens. The SPD wants to come to power together with the Greens. This would mean an SPD government program that is hostile to the economy, a hindrance for economic recovery, and a killer of performance, embellished with the demands of the Greens, up to the dissolution of the Bundeswehr and getting out of NATO. "I can only say: red-green -- good night, Germany." According to Kinkel, a grand coalition would not be better, either, but would just be a policy of following the path of least resistance and conducted at the smallest common denominator. Rather, it has been the coalitions with the FDP that have brought progress in Germany, Kinkel said. A strong FDP is the guarantee against red-green and against a grand coalition. Even in this difficult time there is no need to hide the successful record of the current coalition in Bonn. "We want to continue our successful work after 16 October." There are still important tasks to do, which can best be solved together, Kinkel said.
