An Air Inter A330 periodically refuses to retract its landing gear, and an almost brand new Air France A340 was destroyed by fire on the ground yesterday. Once again, malfunctions occurred with the first Airbus A330 delivered to Air Inter. While all the test and air trials were carried out normally, the aircraft -- put into service early this year by Air Inter -- is demonstrating a bad attitude. Last Monday [17 January], after taking off from Orly airport en route to Toulouse, the crew noticed that the landing gear was not retracting normally. The aircraft landed and the passengers were sent on the next flight, while the plane was subjected to a battery of tests supervised by technicians from the airline as well as from Airbus Industrie. Since nothing suspicious could be found, the aircraft was put back into service Wednesday. A340 Destroyed on the Ground Nevertheless, while the first flights of the morning went off without the slightest incident, the crew noticed just after the takeoff of flight IT-423 that the same symptoms were back. Once again, the landing gear refused to retract into its housing. One might think that the aircraft had become allergic to Toulouse, its place of birth. Since last September, Air Inter has performed many test flights without the slightest incident. According to Airbus Industrie, the incidents that occurred Monday and Wednesday are probably only due to a "simple adjustment." The fact remains, however, that this makes a bad impression. The Air Inter A330 is the first one delivered and put into commercial service, and the French airline still has yet to receive 15 units out of a total of 118 aircraft ordered from Airbus. The A330 is very similar to the A340, the only difference being the number of engines fitted onto the planes. The Air Inter twin-engined aircraft, planned for use on the busiest routes, are configured to carry 412 passengers. The incidents that arose on the A330 following the two takeoffs from Orly are, however, completely different and less serious than the incident that affected a four-engined Air France A340. This is the long-haul version of the aircraft manufactured by Airbus Industrie, 117 units of which have been ordered and 22 already delivered and in put into service. The airplane, which had just been through one of its periodical technical checkups, was brought out of the maintenance hangar around 0100 [2400 GMT]. Four hours later, a fire broke out. Air France firemen, assisted by firefighters from Aeroports de Paris, brought the fire under control after fighting it for half an hour. Nevertheless, the fire had no impact on the airlines traffic, despite the fact that the aircraft was scheduled to fly at midday. The cause of the fire remains unknown, and the air transportation gendarmerie has taken charge of the investigation. [passage omitted]
