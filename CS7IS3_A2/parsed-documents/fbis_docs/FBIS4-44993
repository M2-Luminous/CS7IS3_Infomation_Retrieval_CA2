This bloc has become known as the Resalat group, in reference to a daily morning newspaper RESALAT (Message) that speaks for them. The Resalat bloc does not rally under the banner of a party organization or the like. The group is united only by ties of mutual acquaintance and cooperation based on common principles and economic interests. Terms used in the media, such as rightist, leftist, fundamentalist, and other similar terms do not apply to the Iranian Resalat group. Basically, we can say that it is religiously and culturally conservative, but believes in allowing free scope to the private sector, supporting the national economy, and resisting foreign hegemony. The group maintains very strong links to circles of the ulama and their entourage of religious students, especially in Qom at present and in Mashhad. It is certain that the streets of the Iranian bazaar, in agreement with the halls of Shiite religious schools, were what initially undertook to spread the seeds of the Iranian revolution, sustaining it physically and morally until it took root, grew, flourished, and bore fruit. In the summer of 1963, the bazaar led a violent uprising in Tehran, Qom, and Mashhad, which the shah's government suppressed without mercy, slaying or wounding many victims. In the wake of the uprising, Imam Khomeyni, the mastermind of the bloody uprising, was banished from the country. He remained with his family in his place of exile in Turkey for a year and a few months, then went to Iraq and settled in al-Najaf. He worked openly and secretly to overthrow the imperial system in Iran. He succeeded in realizing his goal in February 1979, after about 16 years. The bazaar had been the firm base of the revolution since it began fermenting in the forties. Leftist and extremist organizations joined the revolutionary mass shortly before the outbreak of the revolution. That was the unruly sea that overthrew a venerable regime whose roots went back 3,000 years into history and brought an entirely new regime, the Islamic Republic of Iran. Using methods at which only they excel, the extremist organizations succeeded in riding the wave of the Iranian revolution during its prime and infiltrating strategic centers in it. During the first days, they publicly or secretly eliminated most of those they considered their enemies. So influential did they become in sensitive areas that they eliminated the chosen elite of revolutionary leaders that had sprung from that conservative traditional milieu, such as Ayatollah Beheshti and Ayatollah Motahhari. Some of them they assassinated individually; in the case of over 70 of them they blew up the hall in which they had gathered. With the speed of an irresistible whirlwind, these extremist groups nationalized companies and institutions and seized homes and real estate on various pretexts. However, the revolution's top leadership was gradually able to free itself from these extremist groups, one of which was the Tudeh party, the largest Moscow-oriented communist party in the Middle East. Some of the party's leaders are still in prison. Death on the gallows awaited some of its military leaders. Days upon days pass. Domestic events react with international and regional developments. Circumstances help the traditional bazaar group regroup and rebuild their ranks. They seize the opportunity to banish extremist ulama such as Mohtashami and Khoi'niha from the parliamentary arena. The group slips quietly without noise into the Majles. It chooses one of its supporters, Hojjat ol-Eslam 'Ali Akbar Nateq-Nuri, as speaker of the Majles. The group practically holds the reins of the Iranian Majles. It emerges into view as able to exert more influence on President 'Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani than the hard-liners who had ridden roughshod throughout the third session of the Majles, which preceded the present session. For the first time since the revolution, observers can witness in Iran the formation of a class or quasi-class on the way to gaining power in the country and adopting a policy with more or less clear features on the domestic and foreign level. It then will be feasible for the major forces that control the courses of international policies to enter into fruitful dialogue with the bodies representing that class or quasi-class for the benefit of Iran, the region, and the entire human community. This class or quasi-class, starting from its interests, its historical roots and social position, and its relations with other sectors of the Iranian people, is trying to play an active role in the following four directions: 1. Not to turn its back on the revolution that has taken place in the country, but to make a strenuous effort to safeguard its accomplishments and gains and strive to preserve its Islamic Shiite character. 2. Not to neglect Iran's national interests, however strong the external pressures, and to strive continually to protect those interests, making sacrifices if necessary to defend them. 3. To maintain the existing broad relations between it, religious scholarly circles, and the traditional religious seminaries. 4. Defend stubbornly and without yielding the interests of this class and its traditional allies among learned religious bodies; this by maintaining the strength of the private sector, encouraging its role through the market economy, and facilitating government support to it. There is evidence that this development that has emerged from events in Iran has not escaped the notice of some major countries. These countries now are busily seeking ways to help them approach the centers that represent the Resalat group and enter into dialogue with them. The beginning of the story of this group coincides with the revolution and a religious scholar named Ayatollah Azari-Qomi, the second greatest judge of the Iranian revolution after its victory. Arrested and imprisoned during the time of the shah, he is said to have memorized the Koran during his stay in prison. Appointed the revolution's public prosecutor, he followed a moderate path, helping many of those arrested to leave prison and saving them from death. He became known for gentleness and tolerance. On account of this, stubborn hard-liners opposed him and forced him to resign. He traveled to Iraq to make contact with the ulama of al-Najaf. (It was before the outbreak of war between the two countries.) When he returned to Iran, he taught religious courses at the seminary in Qom. He established a bond of cooperation with the Association of Revolutionary Teachers supported by Imam Khomeyni--it is now sponsored by Ayatollah Sayyid 'Ali Khamene'i, leader of the revolution. Azari-Qomi was elected to membership in the second session of the Majles as representative of the city of Qom. The session began in 1984 and ended in 1988, a period of four years, as the Iranian constitution specifies. During the session he was elected to membership on the parliamentary committee on economic and financial affairs. Ayatollah Azari-Qomi is considered a superior jurist. Responsible parties in the Islamic Republic of Iran refer to him for his opinion on various matters of Islamic law. Imam Khomeyni and the regime assigned him major tasks, including serving as the revolution's public prosecutor and representing Imam Khomeyni in the Majles to review the constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Azari-Qomi was one of Imam Khomeyni's outstanding students. Azari-Qomi became famous for his independent positions and his opposition to the governments that successively assumed responsibility for administering the Islamic Republic of Iran. One of the most important things to be mentioned in this regard is his opposition to the policy of the former prime minister, Engineer Mir Hoseyn Musavi Khamene'i, who followed a line very close to socialism when it came to safeguarding private property and big corporations. Azari-Qomi was the regime's religious scholar who presented the greatest challenge to Musavi, whom Imam Khomeyni had no other choice than to support strongly as prime minister during the Iraq-Iran war. Azari-Qomi strongly attacked the government's economic policy and received threats from some enthusiastic supporters of that policy. In 1985, Azari-Qomi and his group of supporters began publishing a daily newspaper entitled RESALAT as a free pulpit to spread their ideas and explain their political ethic. It was said at the time that there might be a degree of understanding and mutual rapprochement between Ayatollah Azari-Qomi and the then deputy speaker of the Majles, Ayatollah Shaykh Mohammad Yazdi. Shaykh Mohammad Yazdi is currently head of the judiciary. The newspaper was known from the beginning for following a moderate line calling for establishing balanced international relations and a market economy. Observers in Iran believe that Azari-Qomi speaks for the bazaar people (the big merchants in the Iranian market). He has been and remains an indefatigable critic of state interference with the private sector. He supports the private sector's administering most economic affairs, including civil services, communications, and such development projects as dams and the like. This attitude has encouraged the major bazaar merchants to support the newspaper RESALAT and its owner. It should be mentioned that this group's support of the country's top policy achieved an overwhelming victory for the government wing. This group took the lion's share in the results of elections for the fourth and current session of the Majles. The Resalat bloc has the most powerful influence in the Majles. Its legislative weight gives it the power to make any bill in the Majles succeed or fail. The full name of the bloc's leader is Ayatollah Ahmad Bigdeli Azari-Qomi. He is considered one of the influential teachers and jurists of the Qom seminary, and is a senior founder of the Association of Teachers in Qom, which we can consider to some extent the official society of Shiite jurists in Iran.
