FR940617-1-00065 FR940617-1-00012 A surveillance report (Ref. 1&hyph;C132) of hospital infections showed that the use of povidone-iodine in preparing patients for catheterization significantly reduced the rate of urinary tract infections. A 5-year study showed that the rate of urinary tract infections before October 1977 ranged from 5.2 percent to 11.5 percent (mean 7.8 percent), but beginning in October 1977 when povidone-iodine was the antiseptic solution in use, the rate ranged from 1.0 percent to 4.0 percent (mean 2.4 percent). At the 95 percent confidence level this is statistically significant. No method data accompanied the report except that the urethral meatus was cleansed with cotton dipped in the antiseptic solution before catheterization. The agency believes that these studies and other published and publicly available medical and scientific data demonstrate that povidone-iodine is effective for use as a patient preoperative skin preparation. Although all of the trials were not done the same way, and thus they are not strictly comparable, the weight of the evidence shows that povidone-iodine is effective both as a preoperative skin preparation and surgical hand scrub, reducing the normal microbial flora by more than 90 percent and not showing any significant qualitative selection among the normal species found on the skin. In conclusion, povidone-iodine was effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic and normal skin micro-organisms and maintained some suppressive effect on skin counts after the initial use. In addition to the data reviewed supporting the safety and effectiveness of povidone-iodine for these professional uses, the agency classified povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent as Category I as a first aid antiseptic in the tentative final monograph published in the Federal Register on July 22, 1991 (56 FR 33644). Accordingly, the agency is reclassifying povidone-iodine 5 to 10 percent from Category III to Category I for use as a topical antiseptic ingredient for use in surgical hand scrub, patient preoperative skin preparation, and antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash drug products.
