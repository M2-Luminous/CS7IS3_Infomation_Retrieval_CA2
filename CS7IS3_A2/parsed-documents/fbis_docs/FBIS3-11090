"But first the 32-year-old economic embargo against our country must be lifted. It has cost us $40 billion in damage, goes against international law, and has been condemned throughout the world. With such an embargo, how could it be possible for us to talk about compensation for U.S. possessions (which were nationalized after the 1959 revolution, ed.)?" Washington recently lifted the economic embargo against Vietnam without imposing political preconditions. Deputy Minister Allende does not have much hope that this will also happen to Cuba in the near future. "It is a good, rational thing that the embargo against Vietnam was lifted," she says. "But Cuba is a special case for U.S. Governments. Their policy toward us goes beyond pure rationality. Cuba is something like an obsession. Of course, one can also interpret the maintenance of the embargo against Cuba as a warning to the rest of Latin America," a warning that a high price is paid for any reduction in U.S. influence on the continent. "The Americans," Allende sighs, "make demands on us about human rights and democracy. But they are just excuses. They do not want Cuba to follow an independent course." These demands are largely linked to domestic U.S. politics, she says. There are more than 1 million Cubans living in the United States, and they are U.S. citizens and voters who are hostile to the Castro government. Wealthy exiles finance the election campaigns of U.S. politicians like Torricelli, who ensured that the Cuban embargo was further tightened at the end of 1992. "Not all of them are hysterics who want to further strengthen the embargo," according to Allende. "Others do not want that at all. In April, we will talk with those exiles who accept that Cuba makes its decisions itself." The distinction between "fanatics" and other Cubans in the United States is a new element in Havana's attitude. Until recently all exiles were regarded as "gusanos" (worms) and defectors who had betrayed their country. The deputy prime minister speaks passionately in support of the democratization carried out by Cuba within the one-party system. "What is democracy?" she asks. "Does it only exist in one form, such as the one applied in the United States? For me, it still means government by the people. In Cuba the people participate in the government. Where else are planned economic measures subjected to popular consultation in the workplace?" Allende refers to the planned government cutbacks, the introduction of a progressive income tax, and other far-reaching changes, which after an initial debate in parliament, are being discussed in the factories under the leadership of the trade unions. The minister defends last year's general elections. "It was the people who chose the candidates for the election lists," she says. "Directly and by secret voting." She agrees with parliamentary Chairman Ricardo Alarcon. He said proudly that "the political map of the world would look very different if everywhere, like in Cuba, the people selected the candidates, rather than the political machines greased by the financial powers." Havana feels that Washington, with regard to Cuba, limits the concept of "human rights" to individual and political rights, while discounting economic and social rights. "There are human rights in Cuba, which are not even discussed in other parts of the world," Allende says, referring to free education and health care and the absence of hunger and poverty. "In addition, Washington violates human rights itself," she says. "U.S. companies are not allowed to trade with us and U.S. tourists are not allowed to go to Cuba." Nicanor Leon Cotayo, a columnist for the Trabajadores trade union newspaper and member of the Communist Party's Central Committee, also calls the U.S arguments for the embargo excuses. "The original justifications given for the embargo were that Cuba was a danger to U.S. security, that it encouraged subversion in Latin America, that it was the ally of the Soviet Union, that it intervened in Angola. With the passing of time they could no longer use these arguments. Now human rights and democracy have once again come to the forefront in their arguments." Nicanor Leon says: "But when Washington had to explain to the United Nations why it supported the embargo, it dropped all these arguments and maintained only the demand for compensation for nationalized U.S. interests in Cuba." Only the United States is still making problems about the nationalization; in other countries the problem has been cleared up, according to him. And the real reason for the embargo? "The United States has not forgiven Cuba for shaking off its neocolonial status in 1959 in a traditional sphere of U.S. influence." Leon points out that to a large degree Cuba "is a theme of domestic politics in the United States. Nearly 1 million Cubans live in Florida, the state with the fourth biggest electorate in the United States. The U.S.'s Cuba policy is decided in Miami. Up to now it was Jorge Mas Canosa who decided this policy." Mas Canosa, a businessman originally from Cuba, is president of the Cuban American National Foundation, a right-wing, extreme anti-Castro organization. He was the architect of the tightening of the U.S.'s embargo on Cuba during the 1992 presidential election campaign. "That is the core of the problem," says Leon. "The U.S. policy toward Cuba is hostage to Cubans in Miami." Leon does not say "the" Cubans in Miami: he, too, makes a distinction between Cuban exiles who want to talk to Castro and the "fanatics" around Mas Canosa. How are things in Cuba now? "The lifting of the embargo would make it easier to solve our internal problems," says Leon, "simply because it would be cheaper to import a range of products." Investments Deputy Minister Allende identifies two priorities: "We must seek new markets, and we must encourage foreign investments, for without these investments we cannot get production up to an adequate level." Cuba has rolled out the red carpet for foreign investors. They can have full ownership of companies and repatriate profits. Recently Cuba has been inundated with businessmen eagerly looking for opportunities. Many made investments, but others wonder how they can repatriate profits if they cannot convert their money into foreign currency. Cuba is considering making the peso convertible, but is still hesitating because that would entail a large devaluation. "For us,two principles cannot be negotiated," says Allende,"and those are our independence and sovereignty; and the benefits of the revolution, a social security system like that on which Europe prides itself. And the fundamental sectors of the economy will not be considered for privatization."
