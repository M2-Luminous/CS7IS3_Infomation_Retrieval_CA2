The Temelin nuclear power station in the Czech Republic near the Austrian border will be completed. This has become possible because of a decision by the U.S. state bank promoting exports, which has guaranteed a loan of about 4 billion schillings to ensure the completion of this giant Czech nuclear power station. The money will be used also to equip Soviet-type reactors with Western safety technology. The decision by the U.S. bank did not come as a surprise, even though many Austrian politicians and environmental organizations tried to prevent these U.S. credits. Austrian officials reacted in the following way: Chancellor Franz Vranitzky has been sobered by the fact that efforts to prevent the completion of the Temelin nuclear power station have failed for the time being. Still, he is not discouraged. The chancellor pointed out that the credit still has to be approved by the U.S. Senate. [Vranitzky] We will take all possible political measures to achieve a change of heart in the U.S. Senate and to initiate a new discussion. [Stoppacher] What possibilities do you see? Some of your government's ministers contacted U.S. authorities in the past. Yet they did not achieve anything. [Vranitzky] You are quite right. We have undertaken a great deal. Ministers, members of parliament, and provincial politicians launched initiatives. I myself drafted comprehensive statements and intervened in other ways. The opportunity of bringing about a change of heart in the United States is to be considered very slim. One must say that, if Temelin is completed, Austria's and my own efforts will not have led to the desired goal. [Stoppacher] Do you see other possibilities, apart from talking with U.S. senators and trying to convince them? [Vranitzky] I see only a limited number of possibilities because, by guaranteeing the credit, the U.S. Administration is primarily supporting a U.S. supplier during difficult economic times. One can imagine that the U.S. industry is presenting very convincing arguments in favor of this project. [passage omitted]
