FR940419-2-00148 FR940419-2-00086 (2) The $316,879,804 available to CIAP agencies (which includes the $16,299 carryover) is allocated between Public Housing at 92.1249% or $291,925,067, and Indian Housing at 7.8751% or $24,954,737. This allocation also is based on the relative shares of backlog needs (weighted at 50%) and accrual needs (weighted at 50%). (d) Subassignment of Funds to Non-Indian Field Offices Headquarters has determined the distribution of Public Housing CIAP funds for each HUD Region based on the relative shares of backlog and accrual needs for CIAP agencies. In assigning funds to each Region, Headquarters will designate an amount to be subassigned to each non-Indian Field Office, based on each Office's FY 1993 subassignment and adjusted as necessary. The FY 1993 subassignments reflected both relative shares of modernization needs within the Region and PHA capability to administer the modernization. (1) The Field Office Public Housing Division Director shall have authority to make Joint Review selections and CIAP funding decisions. (2) If additional funds for Public Housing CIAP become available, as set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, Headquarters will allocate the funds to one or more Field Offices based on their relative shares of modernization need, approvable applications, and PHA capability to carry out the modernization. (3) If a Field Office does not receive sufficient fundable applications to use its allocation, Headquarters will reallocate the remaining funds to one or more Field Offices based on approvable applications and PHA capability to carry out the modernization. Of the $291,925,067 available for Public Housing, 1% or $2,919,251 has been set aside to carry out goals related to pending civil rights litigation (e.g., Young v. Cisneros), which is subject to judicial oversight.
