The document was signed before the Federal Electoral Institute [IFE] General Council, where it was also announced that there could be changes in the Electoral Law in advance of the 21 August elections. The first meeting was chaired by Government Secretary Jorge Carpizo, who serves as IFE president. He disclosed a commitment made by the political parties and their presidential candidates. The commitment is for peace, democracy, and justice, and it is designed to put an end to violence and to further the democratic process by way of the law. For this they agreed: [Begin Carpizo recording] To adopt decisions that will lead to create conditions of trust and stability in all of the institutions that will participate in the elections. [end recording] In addition, the political parties agreed to foster and maintain the social and political conditions that will guarantee a climate of trust for productive investment and economic growth within a framework of stability and respect for everyone's rights. To conclude, the government secretary insisted that this year's challenge is to hold honest and open elections within a legal framework. [Begin Carpizo recording] We must act responsibly, and we must all take up truth as our motto and our aspiration. Let us struggle for our causes, but within a legal framework. We have a point of reference in the law. When it becomes necessary to apply or to modify the law, it should be within the commitments made and within the correct institution, and this is precisely the goal of the IFE General Council. [end recording] The IFE General Council fixed at 134.460 million new pesos the ceiling for campaign expenses that each party can spend in this year's presidential election. This amount is more than five times less than an original estimate of 722 million new pesos. In December this amount had already been reduced to 336,151 million new pesos. The ceiling of political campaigns was reduced by 82 percent, taking into account the 722 million pesos originally proposed. This is the result of a complex mathematical operation. It is based on the unit value of six pesos and 39 cents per deputy seat assigned by relative majority, to which is added the inflation rate; then it is multiplied by the number of voters registered, and it is also multiplied by a value fittingly assigned for the duration of the political campaign.
