The talks are held according to a decision by the great powers' foreign ministers that was reached in Geneva two weeks ago. There is every reason to hope that this time an agreement on halting hostilities in Bosnia will be reached. This is what Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin said in an exclusive interview for KOMMERSANT-DAILY observer Sergey Tsekhmistrenko. According to Vitaliy Churkin, Russian diplomacy has conducted intensive work since Geneva, primarily to convince the Bosnian Serbs to sit down at the negotiating table. Presently one can state that their attitude to the Geneva documents is on the whole fairly positive. This conclusion can be drawn at least from the fact that the Serbs, who control over 70 percent of Bosnia, calmly reacted to the Geneva plan of Bosnia's territorial partition that gives 51 percent to the Muslim-Croat federation and 49 percent to the Serbs. At the negotiations that have just begun the Bosnian Serbs are represented by Momcilo Kraisnik, "the chief specialist on work with maps," who has already established fairly good contacts with Muslim Prime Minister Haris Silaidzic. The Serbs have also refrained from escalating hostilities, something for which the Geneva communique also called. Unfortunately, the Russian diplomat observed, the Muslim-Croat side has so far not shown any desire to conduct a constructive dialogue. Mr. Churkin emphasized in particular that this conclusion should not be interpreted as "Moscow's pro-Serb stance:" Russia is holding an objective stance regarding all parties to the conflict, which was confirmed by events in Gorazde. At present, representatives of the newly created federation (where the Muslims call the shots) question many provisions of the Geneva plan, including the principles of territorial partition and the cessation of hostilities for four months. One is getting the impression that the Muslims are also deliberately trying to delay the settlement in Gorazde by refusing to sign a special agreement with UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] (the Serbs have already signed it) so as to have an excuse to avoid halting combat operations in all of Bosnia. To all appearances, Mr. Churkin said, the opinion seems to be still holding sway in the Muslim leadership that much more could be gained on the battlefield than by dialogue. However, there are more than sufficient reasons to hope for success at the current negotiations. This, in turn, will pave the way to a new meeting of the great powers' foreign ministers, which could also be held in Geneva (but this time in the Russian mission, not the U.S. one -- there should be parity after all!) in mid-May. Events in Bosnia have somehow relegated to the back burner other hot spots in the former Yugoslavia, including the situation around Croatian Serb Kraina. Mr. Churkin did not hide his disappointment with the fact that, having started their dialogue with signing a cease-fire agreement, the sides have gotten bogged down in matters of procedure, for instance arguing over the venue of their next meeting. Changes in the leadership of Serb Kraina have also played a part. As a matter of fact, when at his first meeting with Milan Martic, the new president of Serb Krajina, Mr. Churkin said that Moscow's attitude to Krajina leaders would largely depend on how they cooperate in the investigation of the circumstances accompanying the murder of two Russian citizens, journalists Viktor Nogin and Gennadiy Kurennoy. In that regard IZVESTIYA's hint in its 24 May issue that the Foreign Ministry has allegedly prevented publication of the results of the investigation by a commission of Supreme Soviet deputies under Vladimir Mukusev was not correct, Mr. Churkin said -- "no Russian diplomat has ever thought of interfering in an investigation proceeding from political considerations, either major or minor, at least in the two years that I have been holding the post of deputy minister."
