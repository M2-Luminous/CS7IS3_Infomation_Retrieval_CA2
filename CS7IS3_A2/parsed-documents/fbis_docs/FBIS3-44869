The article says: Doing more practical things and less empty talk is another important content of Comrade Jiang Zemin's emphasis on improving leadership style. To advocate doing more practical things and less empty talk means that leading cadres at all levels should set an example and lead the broad masses in doing practical things and solid work to contribute to the promotion of reform, opening up, and modernization; and they should prevent and overcome such bad work style as indulging in exaggerations, performing only lip service and no actual deeds, practicing formalism and seeking only a pretty appearance. The article says: What is the most practical thing at present which we should go all out to do well? It is to accelerate reform and development. The decision of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee has drawn a blueprint for us to establish a socialist market economy. In accordance with the guidelines of the "decision," the central authorities this year are promulgating measures to reform the management systems of finance and taxation, banking, foreign trade, investment, and planning; and all localities are actively organizing the implementation of the measures. During the course of reform and development, we certainly will encounter new contradictions and new difficulties. Our cadres at all levels must rack their brains and do down-to-earth work to solve all the contradictions and difficulties and to implement all the central authorities's measures for accelerating reform and development. The article says: During the course of doing practical things, we should correctly understand and handle the relationship between doing practical things and making administrative achievements. We should be concerned about the masses' hardships and solve difficult problems for them. While the purpose of our party is to serve the people wholeheartedly, the objective of reform and development is to give the people an even happier life. Leading cadres at all levels should constantly keep in mind the broad masses' well-being, discover problems in good time, and solve them without delay. Only in this way can the masses' enthusiasm be protected, can the masses be mobilized to the maximum extent and actively participate in and support the reform, and can a stable social and political environment for reform and development be created. To do more practical things, we should display a spirit of hard struggle as well as a scientific and realistic spirit. We should conduct scientific appraisal and make policy decisions scientifically on the basis of investigation and study. We should strive to reduce minor slip-ups and avoid major mistakes so that each and every practical thing will yield the best economic returns and social benefits. In conclusion, the article says: Since the start of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has consistently emphasized the necessity for leading cadres to display a good style of work. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently has more than once called on leading cadres at all levels to do more studying and engage in less social intercourse, to conduct more investigation and research and make less subjective decisions, and to do more practical things and indulge in less empty talk. These three points are the extremely important contents of the way to improve leadership style. As the new year has just begun, may the leading comrades at all levels display the good work style of doing more studying, conducting more investigation and research, and doing more practical things, and do an even better job in uniting and leading the broad masses in forging ahead.
