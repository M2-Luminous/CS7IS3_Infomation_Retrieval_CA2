It was held by the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO). ``Some 60 directors of, and experts in, nuclear electric power stations [AES] from 14 states came to Sosnovyy Bor, where the Leningrad power station is located,'' I was told by I. Valovich, vice director of WANO's Moscow center. ``For the first time in WANO's four-year existence, the interregional seminar was devoted to issues affecting the organization of repair work and technical servicing of nuclear power stations. We chose Sosnovyy Bor because we believe that the way in which the reactor units at the Leningrad AES have been reconstructed is instructive.'' ``There is basically a big difference between the RBMK reactors we operate today and the ones we operated prior to the Chernobyl accident,'' Leningrad AES Director Anatoliy Yeperin stressed. ``We have introduced a number of new features, and our first reactor unit has been rebuilt and licensed by Gosatomnadzor [Federal Inspectorate for Nuclear and Radiation Safety] to operate at a full power of 1 million kilowatts. At the moment we are renovating the second reactor unit from both the engineering and technological viewpoint. Much of the work being carried out by our personnel, who are relying on creative collaboration with scientists, designers, planners, and fitters, is the first work of its kind that has ever been done in the world. Our experience is already being used as an example at the Kursk and Smolensk AES's.'' Anatoliy Yeperin categorically rejected as unfounded the claims made by the authors of an IZVESTIYA article entitled ``Agent of Extinction'' who said that the Leningrad power station was unsafe. The efforts made by the collective to increase the reliability of its equipment and safety of its operation have enabled the Ministry of Atomic Energy to grant Leningrad AES the rights of an operating organization. The station is not part of the ``Rosatomenergo'' concern, but Gosatomnadzor, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the foreign experts who have frequented Sosnovyy Bor for all sorts of reasons see nothing bad about this. A delegation from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was here recently. In an interview he gave to me, Commission Chairman Ayven Selin [name as transliterated] noted that Leningrad AES has a high reputation in the world's nuclear power industry, and that U.S. colleagues are well apprised of the results of station checks carried out by foreign experts. On 21 December the station will celebrate 20 years since its first 1-million kilowatt reactor was brought on line. This means that the station has already done two-thirds of the ``distance''--its design life lasts until the year 2003. But we must not put off until tomorrow what needs to be done today. Now is the time to think about replacement power for a region of such industrial importance as the Russian northwest. Together with the Leningrad AES collective, the city and oblast authorities have acted completely democratically and thoughtfully. An international ``Energy'' competition was held in St. Petersburg at which designs for the best reactors in terms of technical, economic, and environmental features were selected. Authoritative bodies will decide what will replace the existing nuclear power installations at Sosnovyy Bor. But this decision needs to be speeded up. It takes at least seven or eight years to construct a single reactor unit, and designs have to be formulated and translated into blueprints. In order to gain time, Leningrad AES and its associates, which had the biggest input in the construction of the station 20 years ago, have resurrected the ``Union of 18.'' This includes such enterprises as the Kirovskiy Zavod and Izhorskiy Zavod production associations, the ``Leningrad Metallic,'' ``Elektrosila,'' ``Elektroapparat,'' ``Elektropult,'' and ``Obukhovskiy'' combines, the VNIIPIET, the AES All-Union Scientific Research Institute, NIKIET, and planning and design collectives. ``But in order for our plans to become reality,'' Leningrad AES chief accountant Aleksandr Loginov believes, ``We would like to receive payment in full for our electricity from the Russian stock-company `YeES of Russia.' This Russian joint-stock company, and particularly its central control administration, is abusing our patience.''
