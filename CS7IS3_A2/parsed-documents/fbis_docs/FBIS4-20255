Berlusconi has now finished his meeting with Scalfaro. Fabrizio Ferrari reports from the Presidential Palace: [Berlusconi, broadcast in progress] Moderation and the refusal of any kind of extremism and fanaticism are an essential part of the style of government which I intend to follow. The first point is morality in political life. The members of the government whom I will name completely by myself and under my responsibility -- in line with Article 92 of the Constitution -- will be unreproachable people who will be asked to behave in an unreproachable way. The way the state works -- as far as the power and the life of the government are concerned -- will be examined [word indistinct] with the utmost transparency. My predecessors, amid many difficulties and with no clear political majority, tried to relaunch the economy. In order to do so, a new climate of confidence for businesses and work must be created. Public debt must be reduced, unemployment must be reduced, savings must be protected, and investments increased. There is also the need for a more just and simpler tax system. One that is less of a burden for those activities that create wealth. Little by little, we must give the economic system more and more liberty and confidence in harmony with our country's European commitments. The stock exchange trend and other economic indicators confirm that this task is a difficult, but not impossible one. The third point is the unavoidable priority of social solidarity. A modern state must be less intrusive and more efficient. Parties must step back and public institutions must become once again the center of government activity with the aim of protecting the whole of the community, poor and suffering people first. Social solidarity does not need beautiful words, it needs efficient services, run at a cost that is compatible with a market economy having a permanent and methodical fight against waste. But there cannot be social solidarity without giving law and order back to the whole country. Italy is one country and cannot be split. It is a republic based on local authorities. Government and parliament are the center of a public system hugely decentralized. This includes regions, provinces, and towns. A further effort towards forms of territorial self-government, which reflects the present debate on federalism, is desirable. But in order to have a solid republican renewal, we must first have a stable government capable of doing an undisturbed and long-term job. I will do all I can, under my responsibility, in order to form a government without paying any attention to the old political games, to the rule of dividing up [power and posts], or to mean personal interests. Parliament and the citizens will be constantly informed -- it is their right -- about the policies and the activities of the government. As for the problem raised by many people about the possibility of someone like me becoming prime minister, one who occupies an important position in economic life -- including the media -- I think I must give some precise information after the head of state honored me highly by entrusting me with the task of forming the new government. There is an antitrust law in our body of laws: It created a guarantor of competition and free market. He/she has the power to guarantee, check, and also impose sanctions in order to protect the market and fair competition. There is also law number 223 of 1990 which created the guarantor for broadcasting and publishing: He/she has the special power to guarantee, check, and also to impose sanctions in areas which include the press, television, and advertising. However, I really have a special desire to give the widest and most objective guarantees on this issue. This is why I can announce right now that as soon as the government is formed, I will appoint a committee made up of three famous and respected lawyers: Professor Antonio La Pergola, a former president of the Constitutional Court; Professor Giorgio Crisci, president of the Council of State; and Professor Agostino Gambino, commercial law professor at the Sapienza University in Rome. They already have said they are available for the job and the president of the republic has already approved of them. Their task will be to renew and complete the present laws so that the mere hint that those who are in government are mixing their private and public interests shall be avoided. I will take the proposals put forward by the committee to the cabinet so that they are transformed into bills to be approved by parliament. As for the particular field of the media, pending a change of the present law, I will entrust the same committee with studying a formula which would give sufficient guarantees. However, I think that the best guarantees of all are commitment, love for public service, and lack of personal interest with which I am about to carry out this task and possible future government activity. As I was coming here, I met many people. There were crowds outside my house and at the entrance to the presidency. They wished me luck, they sent me kisses and reminded me of the expectations people have right now. I realize this is a difficult moment for our country and that there are serious problems. I realize that there are great expectations and that it would be easy to disappoint people. I believe I can guarantee one thing: that this government, if we succeed in forming a government, will be a balanced team, full of energy and enthusiasm, with a lot of new faces. I will make every necessary effort, work as hard as is required and make any necessary sacrifice, in order to do all that is possible not to disappoint anyone. I believe we can come through the current situation. I do not believe anyone has a magic wand, nor that anyone, even in government, can work miracles. However, I do believe that our people and our extraordinary country can achieve a real miracle. I believe that if everyone together rolls up their shirt sleeves, the country can get back on the road to growth and kickstart the economy, in order that we can think about a country -- an Italy -- which is more just, more open to the needs of those who are suffering, more modern, more efficient, which is better thought of in Europe and the world, and is more prosperous and more peaceful. This is the task I feel I am taking on in the eyes of all Italians. My task will be to give everything I possibly can and to make every effort not to fail expectations, nor to let anyone down. Thank you. [Unidentified correspondent] Excuse me [passage indistinct] [Berlusconi] Of course not, even if I have begun to think about candidates for every ministerial position, in order to find the best man for the right job. To this end, I think it would be opportune to make a final choice only after I have completed all the work that I am undertaking, the work involved in the consultations I am holding. To this end, I will spend the last few days of this week finely tuning the first draft of our program. I will also meet members of the political forces in the Freedom and Good Government Alliance and start to hold the consultations on Monday. As for consultations, I think it would be a good idea to change the order in which I have seen consultations held in the past. I believe it is right that meetings start with exponents of the world of work and production, followed by members of the various [trades unions and employers] confederations, in order to obtain from them an accurate picture of the current situation in the country -- of the economy -- and to listen to the solutions they think would be most likely to solve our problems. Only at the end of this meeting will I meet members of the political forces in order to discuss with them what has emerged from the previous meetings. I will then take what has emerged from these proceedings to both chambers of parliament for approval. [Correspondent] Excuse me, Prime Minister [passage indistinct]. [Berlusconi] I have not set a final date and the president agrees with this. I believe the most important thing is to build the best team and to get the best program ready. I believe this must be done in however much time it takes so the best possible result is achieved. Therefore, I have not set a final date even if I know the current situation is as it is and too much time must not be wasted. [Correspondent] You will be the first prime minister to own and enjoy the support of three important television networks. Is there even the remotest possibility that you will this year give up ownership and control of at least two of these networks? [Berlusconi] In this situation, I must say, for the time being there is no immediate possibility that one of these networks may be sold. They are -- and together they make up an important communications group -- the most important group in the country -- so they are not objects that can be disposed of easily. Anyhow, I believe that the professionalism of all the directors and journalists who work for these networks offers a guarantee that the news services of these networks will operate correctly. I believe there is also the possibility, through the committee we have appointed, to produce norms that can be added to the system of norms that already exists in our legal system, in order to give absolute guarantees to all. I know that our laws, concerning the possible occupations of a prime minister and of a government, contain a whole series of situations and guarantees. Apart from a prime minister's conscience and his interest in his image and prestige -- I believe you can all understand how important this is...[pauses] I believe this insuperable boundary comes first and should reassure everyone. I believe that the functions of the other government components are in themselves a control. Even if they are allies they could find themselves in disagreement with the prime minister. The parliamentary opposition also exercises a control, as does the parliament as a whole. Professionals working in the news services exercise a control. Public opinion exercises a control. There is also the control exercised by the media watchdog, the control exercised by the antitrust authority, and the control exercised by public prosecutors' offices. So, there is already a system of controls in place that I believe should make people look at this problem in a less partisan fashion than has sometimes been the case. To this I can add the appointments of the three people I referred to earlier -- I believe they will proceed to further examine all norms in order to bring about a situation that offers absolute guarantees. [Correspondent] Over the last 48 hours a lot has been said about a possible division of the Interior Ministry. Is this still being debated? [Berlusconi] I do not believe from what we know so far that decisions are possible or that ministries can be merged or that single ministries can be split up or divided. I believe that it is right that we must get to know the machinery of government, of the state. I believe that only afterward can decisions be made in one direction or the other. This is my opinion from having deepened...[pauses] This is a contradictory term because I must immediately and briefly add that having taken stock of the ministries situation it was my intention to give a clear demonstration of my determination to reduce public spending by, among other things, reducing the number of ministries and undersecretaries, but I realized, looking closely at the machinery of public bureaucracy, that for now it is not possible to make a decision that has been properly thought through. It would be making decisions for the sake of decisions -- something I want to steer well clear of. [Correspondent] Could I ask two things? First, do you have any idea how long the work carried out by the three wise men will take -- the committee -- how long will it take? Second, did you feel more emotional today, while you were reading your speech as the prime minister designate, or on the day you decided to enter the political fray? I think both days were emotionally charged. [Berlusconi] As far as your first question is concerned, these men will be appointed immediately -- it will be among the government's first actions -- and they will take the necessary time to carry out what we are asking them to do. For this reason I cannot predict how long it will take, but I do not think it will be long -- a question of a few months, I think. As far as feeling emotional is concerned, I think you have the right to be emotional when on the one hand you change your life completely, as was the case on the day I entered the fray -- and I must say I feel emotional today as well because I feel I have a great responsibility on my shoulders. I have been in touch with the people over these last few months, and above all with some of the poorest people. They told me about their problems and wanted the state to do something to help them. I feel I have an enormous responsibility to these people. I feel this responsibility as I have never felt one before. I feel that I am at the center of a huge responsibility. I believe that I will be able to make every effort, to use all my strength, not to let these people down, and to find in the framework of what is possible -- via the machinery of government, among other things -- to find answers and above all improve the condition of these people and improve life in general in our country. I have often asked what they really wanted. The question [as heard] that I hear most often is that they want something good to happen. I think we will make every effort to do something good. [Correspondent] This question is for a live news program on RAI Due Television Network. You have just explained the main points of what is basically a moderate program. How can it satisfy the extreme demands made by some of your political allies? [Berlusconi] I cannot recall any extreme demand, any demand that is not moderate, balanced, and measured. I think there have been statements made by individuals. They were probably exaggerated by the media. When I sit around a table with my allies to discuss concrete problems, I find they are measured, balanced, and full of common sense. In any case, this is the style of government the prime minister will have to guarantee to his allies, to parliament, and to the whole country. It will be a government of people with common sense, experienced people, people who can come up with original solutions and who have the courage to change. They are balanced, measured, and reflective people. [Correspondent] I would like to ask you a question about your personal interests abroad. Have you come up with some solution, as I think that the three wise men are maybe not in the position to give advice.... [Berlusconi, interrupting] I do not have personal interests abroad. The Fininvest group, which I left as far as operational management is concerned -- as you know I have resigned from all posts in the Fininvest group -- only has a stake in Tele Cinco in Spain. This is the most important company. As for that company, the present managers of the group are thinking about solutions, and it has not been ruled out that the stake could be sold. [Correspondent] Your ally Bossi insists that he wants the Interior Ministry. Some League's members said today that they would enter the government. The Cusani trial is about to finish. Are you still considering Di Pietro? [Di Pietro, prosecutor at the Cusani bribes trial, has been repeatedly mentioned as a possible candidate for the post of interior minister]. [Berlusconi] I do not want to discuss the names of ministers. It is a very complicated issue, which will be tackled in the next few days. We have this period of time, from today to the day when we shall present the complete government team, to consider, in all its aspects, the problem of who the ministers will be. Allow me not to give you an answer on this issue. [Correspondent] Can you tell me how you intend to proceed as far as institutional and constitutional reform are concerned? Do you have a schedule and do you intend to find an agreement with the largest possible part of parliament? [Berlusconi] There is a very precise law, there is the Constitution, which is our first law. It says clearly how the Constitution can be changed. It is clear that only that part can be followed, and quite clearly if the reforms are important ones, they will have to be submitted to the decision of the Italian people through a referendum. [Correspondent] After what you said, I think that the lists for the European elections will be prepared before the government is formed. Do you think that you are going to be a candidate in the European elections in some constituency? [Berlusconi] Allow me for the moment to be the figure I represent, that is the prime minister-designate. That is, someone who must consider the interests of all the Italians and not the interests of one political side, even if mine is not a party, it is only a movement. I am happy to answer your questions but only if they are questions about the future activity of the prime minister. [Correspondent] [question indistinct] [Berlusconi] As you know, we have always paid much attention to what I call the other half of heaven, that is to the world of women. Not only the brave women who work, but also the women who remain at home and who sacrifice themselves to raise children and to take care of the family. I think that we shall pay much attention both to their situation and, more generally, to the situation of families. I think that many of the measures we have been working on already, and which are measures that I hope will soon become law, concern precisely the family. And let me add that, on this issue, our program will really stress our tradition, our cultural tradition, which includes the values we have learned, the basic values of Catholic religion. I can tell you that we are seriously studying the possibility of a ministry of family. I think that what we manage to do will be something really new. [Correspondent] A question about foreign affairs: will the country's policies be followed, in particular as far as our eastern borders are concerned? [Berlusconi] We shall certainly continue the same policy. We shall certainly confirm our love and admiration of the European institutions and for a Europe that is increasingly moving toward unification, even a monetary one. We shall confirm our Atlantic policy. As for the borders, I think that things are already clear. Even those who made certain demands have explained clearly what they meant. I think that what is demanded is only reciprocity as far as the Italian minorities in that state are concerned. Thank you very much for being here. I am now going to inform the speakers of the Chamber of Deputies and of the Senate and outgoing prime minister Ciampi of the task with which I have been entrusted. Thank you.
