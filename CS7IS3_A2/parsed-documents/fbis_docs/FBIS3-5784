Speaking before this year's 224 graduates of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) here, the president said, "There are still those among us who -- instead of helping to rebuild -- offer the counsel of reaction and retreat, who want to stop reform by fair or foul means." Mr. Ramos said he was referring to people who were pushing for a "short-cut change outside of our constitutional system." Defense Secretary Renato S. De Villa also said rightist groups were "creating an atmosphere not conducive to the peace process." De Villa cited recent press statements issued by the Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance [as published] and the Young Officers Union (YOU) criticizing graft and corruption in the government. Peace negotiations between the government and rightist rebels have stalled over several issues, including disagreements on the "talking points." In the government's program of rebuilding and reforming society, Mr. Ramos said, "Our Armed Forces must be the bedrock of support to government." In the face of the "confusion of the times," he urged the PMA 1994 Class, called "Watch-Force," to "talk of programs for growth, not coups and military adventurism. We debate policies and reforms, not who does what to whom, and when we look at the world, we think of catching up, not of falling farther behind," he said. Mr. Ramos, however, cited several hopeful signs that the country was moving toward peace. Most of the brightest rebels, he said, "are now realizing that the battle of ideas is best fought in the hearts and minds of our people, and not in urban centers turned into bloody battlefields." Mr. Ramos also predicted that the 25-year communist insurgency would soon collapse. He said the country had regained its internal political stability and was in a position to achieve high economic growth. "The communist insurgency will soon end altogether," he said. "Our brothers in the hills, who waged war under a failed concept of revolution, are coming to see the practical wisdom of working together for peace." Mr. Ramos was apparently referring to the several thousand New People's Army guerrillas whom officials said had applied for amnesty under a reconciliation policy he launched after taking office in 1992. The military has estimated the present strength of communist rebels around 8,000, from a peak of more than 25,000 in 1987. Officials have said more than 40,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in fighting between government forces and rebels since the Marxist insurgency began in 1969. Mr. Ramos also said Muslim rebels in Mindanao "are seeing that talking peace and development are better alternatives than violent secession." He also stressed that all over the world, military forces "are redefining their missions to put people's protection, relief work and conservation of the environment on par with combat duty." "The AFP's [Armed Forces of the Philippines] concurrent mission of community development and environmental protection possesses the attributes most conducive to economic development and nation building," he said. Mr. Ramos also stressed the need to begin the long-term task of modernizing the Armed Forces to meet the needs of the new time. "Though the Cold War is over, our strategic importance in our Asia-Pacific region remains, and we must be prepared to meet both the challenges and opportunities this strategic importance confers," he said. Mr. Ramos asked the new AFP officers to be "models of social responsibility'' and "paragons of citizenship." He also reminded them "never to mistake an increase in personal wealth and power as a replacement for growth in moral strength and character. Our country will ask you always to place integrity above careerism, honor above self-interest, loyalty to country above loyalty to individualism and class," he said. [passage omitted]
