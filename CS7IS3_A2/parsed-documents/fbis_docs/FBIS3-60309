The Ecological Aspect"] [Text] Yuriy Kostenko, minister of environmental protection of Ukraine, answers questions put by a NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent. We will introduce our interlocutor. He was born in 1951 in the Vinnitsa area. He graduated from the Zaporozhye Institute of Machine Building, worked at the imeni E.O. Paton Institute of Electrical Welding, and also completed graduate study there. He defended his Candidate of Sciences dissertation in the area of plasma technologies. Kostenko has more than 30 certificates of authorship and scientific publications. He has been people's deputy of Ukraine since 1990. Kostenko has been elected deputy chairman of the parliamentary commission for issues of ecology and the rational use of natural resources. Kostenko has been the minister of environmental protection of Ukraine since October 1992. He is a member of the National Security Council of Ukraine. `The Scope of the Ecological Threat May Be Greater Than That of Any Aggression....' NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, recently the Supreme Council of Ukraine discussed a package of the national security issues of our young state. To your mind, how significant has the ecological aspect of the system of national security guarantees become? Kostenko: The economic development of society has reached such heights toward the end of the 20th century that the threat of losing a favorable environment for the residence of people has become a reality. Our own bitter experience can be a case in point. The degree of unfavorable influence on the natural environment in many regions of Ukraine has now surpassed the consequences of the most devastating military aggression. At present, nobody can say with certainty whether at some point children will be able to take walks in the city of Pripyat, whether it will be possible to drink water from the Dnieper without worrying, to swim safely at the sunny beaches of Mariupol, Odessa, and Yalta, or eat mushrooms from the forests in the area of Lugansk without risking one's life. Under existing conditions, the ecological aspect of the system of national security of our state should be virtually the main one. However, we should state that in Ukraine, all levels of society lack the understanding that ecological threats in terms of their scope and the extent of unfavorable influences may surpass the consequences of any aggression. `A Perpetual-Motion Machine for Processing Natural Resources Into Waste' NARODNA ARMIYA: What caused, to the greatest degree, and continues to cause the dangerous condition of the environment in Ukraine? Kostenko: Within the system of national security of the state, ecological threats are due to both domestic and external reasons. That is to say that they are regional or global in nature. Our conviction is that, all the weight of the external aspects of ecological security notwithstanding, the critical condition of the natural environment that has emerged in Ukraine is due mostly to domestic reasons. The nonecological development of industry, the power sector, and transportation; erroneous land-use practices; large-scale land reclamation efforts; infective activities aimed at preserving natural landscapes and their components--forests, lakes, rivers, steppes, and so on--are among the main reasons. Ukraine's industry is one of the most dangerous in the world from the ecological point of view. Think about this: In the late 1980's, two times more iron ore than in the United States was produced in Ukraine, and only somewhat less coal than in Great Britain, France, and the FRG combined. As much steel was smelted annually as in the FRG and France combined. Ukraine's industry manufactured 7 million tonnes of pipes, which exceeded the combined output of Great Britain, Italy, and France. What did we get in return? Did our standard of living rise to the level of the countries mentioned? Has a single social problem been solved in the Donbass or the Dnieper area? We may say "no" with confidence. Instead, we have had a rapid depletion of natural resources, man-made mountains of rock, poisoned air, and dead rivers. A similar situation has developed in power generation. The proportion of the discharge of harmful compounds into the atmosphere of Ukraine by power generation comes to 30 percent of the total discharge. Coal dressing produces 35 million tonnes of barren rock annually. The reservoirs of hydropower stations occupy almost 800,000 hectares of fertile land; approximately the same area is underflooded. As far as nuclear energy is concerned, the great probability of accidents with grave consequences forces us to classify nuclear power stations as the greatest ecological threat. The Chernobyl catastrophe alone has exhausted, for hundreds of years to come, the ecological reserve of all accidents of technological origin in Ukraine. Besides, the further operation of nuclear-energy facilities will be unavoidably accompanied by the accumulation of a large amount of radioactive waste. They do not just pollute the environment, but also pose the threat of irreversible changes both to the population of Ukraine and to all living organisms. In addition to dangerous waste, the Ukrainian economy is one of the largest consumers of natural resources in the world. Land, minerals, water, air, and energy resources are devoured by enterprises in ever greater amounts. It is characteristic that, for example, we continuously have a shortage of electricity--even now that the overall level of production has declined by 30-40 percent--although our power generation per capita is at the level of the developed countries of Europe. Yet this is not surprising if we take into account the fact that the energy intensiveness of our production exceeds that of similar indicators in countries such as the United States, Germany, or Great Britain by factors ranging from six to eight. Thus, the national economy of Ukraine even now functions mostly in keeping with the principle, "Production for production's sake." This is why instead of an economy that would primarily meet the needs of the people, we have something of a perpetual-motion machine for processing natural resources into waste. Without breaking this vicious cycle, a solution to the ecological problems of Ukraine, and consequently guarantees of its national security, are out of the question. NARODNA ARMIYA: What is the ecological status of the agro-industrial complex? Kostenko: Not the best. The share of plowed land in the territory of Ukraine has reached 57 percent (in the United States, it is 17 percent). One-third of these areas have been depleted and are subjected to intensive erosion. If we do not reduce the percentage of plowed land by way of both environmental protection measures and changes in the tax system, Ukraine may be left without its famous Chernozem soils. Unjustified and incompetent land reclamation has caused a great deal of trouble! I will give you only a few numbers, which are based on data from scientific establishments. During the years of land reclamation, the area of drained land in Polesye has doubled, and the danger of deflation and soil erosion has increased by a factor of 27. In the southern regions, changes in irrigation technology are needed on 18 percent of the irrigated land. As little as just over one-third of the irrigated land remains in good condition there. The intake of water to meet economic needs has been growing continuously. The runoff of many rivers is taken in full in years with low, and even average, water availability. The inclusion of small rivers into land reclamation systems and the thoughtless draining of marshlands have resulted in disruptions of their hydrological regimen; the quality of natural water and its self-purification capacity have deteriorated. The current condition of our forests is critical. They occupy one-half of the area that they do in adjacent states--Poland, Slovakia, and Belarus. Only 6 percent of our forests are mature, whereas 15-20 percent should be. `We Will Not Accomplish Anything in the Absence of a Strong Policy of Environmental Protection' NARODNA ARMIYA: Yuriy Ivanovych, what major shortcomings do you see in the organization of efforts to protect the environment in our country? What should be done specifically in the context of guaranteeing our national security? Kostenko: First of all, it should be grasped at all levels of state government that improvements in the natural environment are impossible in the absence of a clear-cut program, continuous attention and, certainly, considerable material and financial outlays. What do we have at present? Our own state budget is the most instructive in this regard. It allocates only 0.2 percent of the gross national product (GNP) for all environmental protection measures in 1993. For comparison, Scandinavian countries spend close to 1 percent of their GNP just to help other states. The fact that economic losses reach one-tenth of the entire gross national product in Ukraine as a result of deterioration in the quality of the environment testifies to our short-sightedness. Moreover, the Ministry of Natural Resources, which in keeping with legislation in effect is supposed to ensure compliance with the norms of ecological safety in Ukraine, controls as little as one-tenth of these funds, of these purely symbolic budget outlays for the protection of natural resources, or 0.02 percent of the GNP. This does not happen in any other country in the world! Our ministry has an extremely broad scope of responsibilities, but the main levers of influence, financial levers, are virtually absent. Therefore, degradation of the environment with all of its terrible consequences will not be stopped without fundamental changes in the system of guaranteeing ecological safety, and without a strong environmental-protection policy for the state. NARODNA ARMIYA: Nonetheless, what has already been specifically done by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in order to stop, or at least, to begin with, slow down the slide of Ukraine into the ecological abyss? Kostenko: Fundamental principles for this work have been developed by the Ministry of Environmental Protection of Ukraine with the participation of a broad circle of scientists and specialists from the national economy in the concept of the National Program for Protecting the Natural Environment, which we plan to submit for consideration to the Supreme Council of Ukraine in November-December of this year. The experience of developed countries testifies that for the most part, two levers exist that stimulate ecologically friendly production and energy savings. These are the use of natural resources at a fee and the active implementation of environmental protection measures. Proceeding from this, the ministry wants to devise a mechanism for assessing the cost of natural resources and fees for their use, to introduce tax relief for resource-effective and ecologically pure technologies, and to impose economic sanctions for the above-the-norm use of natural resources and pollution of the environment, so that it will become economically disadvantageous for enterprises to operate to the detriment of nature. It is precisely to this end that a special section, "Ecological-Economic Policy," was included in our proposal for the plan of actions of the Government of Ukraine to implement and develop the Foundations of the National Economic Policy in 1993. A government decree issued in September introduced norms for the size of ecological losses associated with environmental pollution and the use of resources. Proposals have been prepared concerning the establishment of a fixed proportion of state budget expenditures for environmental protection measures and mechanisms for their implementation. The Source ecological bank has been established. Let us not forget that there are types of environmental protection projects that do not require considerable funds, in particular appropriations from the state budget, and are found within the jurisdiction of the local organs of power. The issue is that the plowing of the bank zones of small rivers should finally stop; straightening their courses and siting cattle farms and complexes and fertilizer and pesticide warehouses in their water-protection zones should be forbidden, and efforts to develop meadows on the banks of small rivers should be made. In this instance, a favorable environmental protection effect may be secured as soon as within a few years. It was precisely to invigorate such efforts that the Green Spring campaign was held in Ukraine on the initiative of the Ministry of Environmental Protection. `If We Do Not Put Up a Barrier to the Illegal Imports of Toxic Substances From Abroad, Ukraine Will Turn Into a European Trash Dump Rather Than a European State' NARODNA ARMIYA: You said that the issues of ecological security have an international aspect, as well.... Kostenko: Yes, and a quite weighty one, too. External ecological threats may be either intentional, i.e., ecological aggression, or unintentional in nature--most frequently, these are global changes in the environment and crossborder pollution. We want to mitigate the unfavorable influence of global ecological changes primarily by making and executing international agreements that regulate the planetary stress of technical origin and by developing national measures for the adaptation of the national economy of the country to these changes. Ukraine has already joined most conventions regulating global ecological security. Nonetheless, it should be said openly that we are still not ready to implement some of them. Thus, Ukraine still does not have a national program to carry out the Montreal Protocol on the Ozone Layer. Meanwhile, its conditions call for abandoning the use of substances that destroy this layer by 1999. Ukraine still has not ratified a number of important international agreements. The Ministry of Environmental Protection proposes to ratify them shortly. At issue are, in particular, the convention on climatic changes, which restricts the discharge of gases producing the greenhouse effect, the biodiversity convention, the Ramsar convention on the protection of wetlands on our planet, and the convention on international trade in the species of wild fauna and flora that are threatened with extinction. As far as measures to adapt the economy of Ukraine to global ecological changes are concerned, their development is envisioned by the aforementioned concept of the National Program for Protecting the Natural Environment. NARODNA ARMIYA: In the last two years, the uncontrolled importation of various types of waste to the territory of Ukraine has become particularly notorious. Kostenko: Indeed, this ecologically dangerous dirt is brought in under the guise of a raw material, products of the chemical industry, fertilizer, and so on. Importation of dangerous substances to seven oblasts of Ukraine was registered in the first half of this year alone. Some 700 tonnes of these substances fall into the highest class of toxicity--they are poison to anything that lives. However, it is perhaps the most terrifying thing that what has been registered constitutes, so to say, the tip of an iceberg, merely a fraction of what is brought in and illegally dumped by the roads, in the forests, in the fields, and in ravines. This is the consequence of an absence in our country of an effective system for the regulation and monitoring of the importation of waste. If we do not put up an effective barrier to the illegal imports of toxic substances from abroad, very soon Ukraine will turn into a European trash dump rather than the European state that all of us wish for. For this reason, the Ministry of Environmental Protection has developed Temporary Procedures for the Issuance of Permits to Import to Ukraine Recyclable Raw Materials and the Waste That Replaces Them, which, in particular, prohibits the importation of waste to Ukraine for the purpose of storing and burying it. Appropriate instructions have been given to the local subdivisions of the ministry. A proposal has been submitted to the government to establish an ecological control service at the border. `The Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Environmental Protection Carry a Weighty Proportion of Responsibility for the National Security of Ukraine. We Should Work Hand in Hand....' NARODNA ARMIYA: There is no concealing the fact that units of the Army and the Navy have contributed considerably to the processes of deterioration if not the direct destruction of the environment.... Kostenko: Yes, until recently, the activities of the military involving the use of natural resources fell beyond the limits of the jurisdiction of our ministry. The actual absence of control did not result in anything good. The examples of it are without number. Favorable changes in relations between the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Environmental Protection have emerged only over the last 1-1.5 years, after the adoption of the new legislation on environmental protection. Efforts have been made to establish special ecological subdivisions of the Ministry of Defense, ecological inspections have begun to operate jointly. It is gratifying that the recently introduced provisional Internal Service Manual includes a specific provision that binds all commanders to work out and implement environmental protection measures. Thus, the first specific results have been attained at the level of ministries, which is not the case directly with most units and garrisons. The Ministry of Environmental Protection is aware of the facts of violations of environmental protection legislation, especially at the Yavor training grounds in Lvov Oblast, which occupy 20,000 hectares. Meanwhile, these training grounds are located in a unique natural zone of the Ukrainian Roztochchya, where the main European watershed passes and runoff to the basins of the Black and Baltic Seas is generated. Considerable harm is done to valuable natural complexes at the "Free Port" training grounds of the Black Sea Fleet aviation, which is located in the center of the Black Sea Biospheric Preserve. In general, it is hard to find a military unit or garrison that is not violating legislation on environmental protection in one way or another. In general, both our ministries carry their proportion of responsibility for the national security of Ukraine. Therefore, we should work hand in hand. Efforts to create a system of national security for Ukraine are under way. The ecological aspect of this problem that is the most significant for our young state should be properly codified by legislation. Only by taking an extensive set of ecological security measures will Ukraine be able to overcome the critical condition of the environment and become one of the economically developed and prosperous countries of Europe.
