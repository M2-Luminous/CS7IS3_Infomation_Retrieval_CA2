Preliminary designs for the expansion had been completed and approved, the sources said. Other preparations are either finished or under way. The present airport of the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province started operating in 1979. As the number of tourists has risen drastically, the sources said, it could no longer meet all the needs, and the opening of new routes has had to be delayed. The airport lounges are to be enlarged to 60,000 sq.m. [square meters]. The plans also include building 155,000 sq.m. of parking lots, a new air traffic control center and support facilities. The remodelled airport will be able to handle 6.6 million tourists a year by the year 2005. Destinations will be increased from 38 to 53 cities, including 11 cities in Canada, the United States, Japan, the Republic of korea, Russia and Hong Kong. The 1.1-billion-yuan expansion work will be jointly financed by the central and local governments. Major expansion work will be completed by February 1996, when the Asian Winter Games will be staged, the sources said.
