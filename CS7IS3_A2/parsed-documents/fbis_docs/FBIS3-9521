Martic warned that six months after the withdrawal of Croatian forces, the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] was still in control of the area around the villages of Citluk, Divoselo, and Pocitelj, prohibiting the local population from returning and banning access to the Krajina militia and authorities. [passage omitted] "You have seen that this was one of the most difficult problems in the negotiations at your embassy in Zagreb, and that the planned cease-fire agreement was most probably not signed because of it," Martic underlined, adding that the reference point in this case should be the line of separation between the Serb and Croat ethnic communities established by the decision of the Geneva conference of 23 November 1991. The RSK president believes that UNPROFOR should not be allowed to replace the Croatian Army in keeping territories under occupation -- as is the case with the Medak pocket. "The Medak pocket must be returned to Krajina and excluded as an issue in the negotiations between the Serb and Croat sides," Martic said, concluding that, if not, it will not make sense to continue the talks in Zagreb next Tuesday.
