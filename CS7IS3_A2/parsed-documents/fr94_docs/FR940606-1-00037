FR940606-1-00037 FR940606-1-00008 HAP emissions from wastewater result from the evaporation of volatile components in the water. Evaporation may occur in open trenches, storage tanks, and treatment operations. 9. Handling and Storage of Waste Waste is produced primarily from cleaning, coating, and depainting operations. Cleaning operations produce solvent laden cloth and paper and spent solvent which can emit organic HAP from the evaporation of the solvents. Coating operations produce waste paint and waste solvent thinner that also emit organic HAP through evaporation. Depainting operations can produce either a liquid or solid waste stream depending on the type of process used. Chemical depainting processes produce a liquid sludge that consists of the stripper solution and paint residue. Emissions occur from the evaporation of the solvent from the stripper solution. Blast depainting processes produce a solid waste stream that consists of paint chips and spent blasting media. Emissions do not directly occur from this waste stream, although particulate emissions are generated during the blasting process. 10. Storage of Hand-Wipe Cleaning Solvents Many large aerospace facilities use storage tanks for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. According to data obtained through responses to EPA questionnaires under section 114 of the Act (section 114 questionnaires), these tanks are primarily above ground, fixed-roof type ranging in size from 350 to 6800 gallons in size. Emissions from these tanks occur from evaporation of the cleaning solvents, as well as breathing and working losses. B. Control Techniques The principal techniques used by the aerospace industry to control organic HAP emissions are preventative measures and control devices. For the control of inorganic emissions, control devices such as filters and waterwash are used. Preventative measures are any action, product modification, process modification, or equipment change designed to eliminate or reduce the generation of emissions. Control devices do not prevent the generation of emissions, but rather capture or destroy the emissions generated by a source. Preventative measures are usually the most desirable method to reduce emissions since they eliminate or reduce the actual generation of pollutants. Typically, the emission reduction is obtained using less energy and producing less waste than using a control device to achieve the same emission reductions. Preventative measures used by the industry are: (1) Product reformulations that replace products containing high levels of HAP and VOC with products containing less HAP and VOC or that eliminate the HAP or VOC content completely, such as chemical strippers that contain no organic HAP for depainting; (2) product reformulations, such as higher solids content coatings, that reduce the amount of the HAP- and VOC-containing product used; (3) equipment changes that result in emission reductions, such as replacing conventional spray guns with HVLP spray guns; and (4) work practice standards, such as housekeeping. Control devices are typically used where product reformulation is not feasible or where the concentration of the exhaust stream is sufficiently high to warrant their use. Control devices may destroy the HAP and VOC, as with an incinerator, or capture the HAP and VOC, as with a carbon adsorber. Often, the compounds captured by a control device can be recovered for reuse. Control devices in predominant use by the industry for the reduction of organic HAP emissions are: (1) Carbon adsorbers, (2) incinerators, and (3) ultraviolet oxidation. Activated carbon fiber adsorbents to concentrate VOC emissions are frequently used in conjunction with incinerators. For inorganic HAP particulate emissions, reduction is achieved predominantly through the use of filtration devices. 1. Preventative Measures a. Product reformulation . HAP and VOC emissions may be controlled by replacing products containing high concentrations of HAP and VOC with ones that have reduced or eliminated HAP and VOC entirely. Each individual facility must evaluate the ability of the new product to maintain standards of quality and performance. In addition, the potential overall environmental benefit of the reformulated products must be carefully evaluated. (1) Product reformulation_coatings . Product reformulations for coatings can be generally classified as waterborne, higher solids, powder, and self-priming topcoats. Each category is discussed below.
