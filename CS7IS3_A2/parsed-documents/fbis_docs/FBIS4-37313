[Al-'Anani] Thank you. [Al-Aswad] Let us begin with His Majesty King Husayn's visit to Washington. What will be the main topics of his discussions with the American officials? [Al-'Anani] His Majesty King Husayn came to the United States for the medical checkup he undergoes every six months. Thank God, the results of the checkup were excellent. It is customary for his majesty to meet with senior U.S. officials during these medical visits. The current visit comes after reaching an agreement with the Israelis on border demarcation and fair water sharing. In light of these recent developments on the Jordanian-Israeli negotiating track, the visit acquires particular importance. [Al-Aswad] There have recently been intensive Jordanian-Israeli contacts in Washington. As you said, the talks resulted in the signing of an economic agreement involving several projects. How far have you gone in the subject of border demarcation? [Al-'Anani] The agreement reached two weeks ago provided for the formation of specialized technical subcommittees within a higher committee of technicians that will work in the field to demarcate the border, divide the water, and work out security measures. This will begin in July. [Al-Aswad] So, the news about an agreement on the demarcation of the Jordanian-Israeli border is true. Is this a departure from the known Jordanian principles concerning the peace process? [Al-'Anani] Not at all. We are still committed to the joint agenda signed on 14 September 1993. We have never departed from that agenda. Moreover, we have not reached a final agreement. We have agreed to start border demarcation and water sharing. This does not mean the issue is over. We have only started actual field work, and we still have some way to go to reach an agreement on border demarcation. Technical field work must be done before we can say that we have reached an agreement. [Al-Aswad] Dr. Jawad, how do you view the future of the peace process on the Jordanian-Israeli track and on the other negotiating tracks? [Al-'Anani] Our position is clear. We want coordination with all the Arab sides and we would like to see progress on all tracks. His majesty will stress the need for progress on all tracks because we believe that partial peace is unstable peace; it is not lasting, comprehensive, or just. This is the point we are going to stress here in the United States. [Al-Aswad] But is the border demarcation agreement progress that leaves the Syrian-Israeli track behind? [Al-'Anani] No. As you remember, in all the meetings of the Arab cordon states in Beirut, Amman, Cairo, and Damascus it was stressed that it is possible for one track to move faster that the others, but there should be coordination and all sides must agree to the final results. In fact, as you know, all tracks are mobile; no track is fully dormant, neither the Palestinian nor the Syrian. But the results depend on the subjects being discussed. If progress is made on any of the tracks, especially the Jordanian track, we believe it will positively affect progress on other tracks. This is especially true since the Jordanians obtained an Israeli recognition that the cease-fire border is not the permanent one. The exchange of land for peace is the deal sought by all the Arab parties, especially since they all proceed from Security Council Resolution 242, which calls for the return of the land in exchange for peace. [Al-Aswad] Can we say that an agreement on a peace treaty with Israel is now imminent or expected in the foreseeable future? [Al-'Anani] I do not think so. I believe that we made a step toward that development, but we still have a long way to go before achieving it, especially if we read the items on the joint Jordanian-Israeli agenda. The discussions of some subjects have not started yet. [Al-Aswad] What are these subjects, Dr. Jawad? [Al-'Anani] For example, the refugees and the achievement of comprehensive agreements on all tracks. [Al-Aswad] Thank you, Dr. Jawad. [Al-'Anani] You are welcome.
