The Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court rejected Xi Yang's appeal, upholding the sentence of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court of 12 years' imprisonment, depriving him of political rights for two years. Xi's abettor, Tian Ye, was sentenced by the original trial to 15 years' imprisonment and deprived of political rights for three years. Tian, who was formerly deputy chief of the General Office of the Bureau of Overseas Affairs of the People's Bank of China (PBC), did not appeal. Assigned by the MING PAO newspaper, Xi Yang stayed in Beijing during the period from June to July, 1993, under the pretext of covering the Sino-British talks and the establishment of the Preliminary Working Committee for the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. However, he did not send his applications for interviews to departments concerned as the state regulations demand, but incited Tian Ye to steal and spy out government financial and economic secrets. Tian provided Xi with many top secrets including samples of Chinese bank notes, information about the PBC's selling gold in the international market, the PBC's plan about readjusting the exchange rates between Chinese renminbi and foreign currencies, and the PBC's decision about raising again the interest rates of the deposits as of July in the year. Besides, Tian stole and illegally provided Xi Yang with a confidential document entitled "illustration on the provisional rules about overseas-funded financial institutions' engaging in business of renminbi." After receiving the secrets, Xi immediately wrote stories about them and sent the stories to the headquarters of the MING PAO newspaper for publication, thus causing the state to suffer heavy economical losses. On December 14, 1993, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate instituted proceedings against Xi Yang and Tian Ye according to the law. Since the case involved state secrets, the Beijing Municipal People's Court held closed hearings on the case, according to the 111th provision of "the Law of Criminal Procedures of the People's Republic of China." During the hearings, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court found that some of the evidence in the case should be further verified, thus sending back on January 27 this year the case to the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate for further investigation. On Feburary 15, the case was sent again by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate to the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court for trial. Both the defendants Xi Yang and Tian Ye said before the trials began that they would defend themselves and did not invite any lawyer to act for them. During the trial, both of them admitted their guilt, showed repentance and asked the court to be lenient. The Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court held that Xi Yang had ignored China's laws, gathered and spied out state financial and economic secrets, and published them in a newspaper overseas, thus committing the crime of stealing and spying state secrets, an exceptionally serious case. The court held that as a staff member of a government body, Tian Ye had violated the state regulations on maintaining confidentiality and stolen, spied and illegally supplied state secrets, thus committing the crime of stealing, spying and illegally supplying state secrets, also an exceptionally serious case. The criminal facts of Xi Yang and Tian Ye are clear and the evidences are conclusive and full, according to the court. "The supplementary regulations on crime of leaking state secrets" adopted by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress stipulated that those whose case of stealing, spying, buying or illegally supplying state secrets for overseas institutions, organizations or persons is serious should be sentenced to penal servitude for a definite period longer than 10 years, penal servitude for life, or sentenced to death and should be deprived of political rights for some time. Since Xi Yang and Tian Ye admitted their guilt and showed repentance, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court decided to punish them leniently and on March 28, 1994, sentenced Xi Yang to 12 years' imprisonment, with the term starting from September 27, 1993, and depriving him of political rights for two years, and sentenced Tian Ye to 15 years' imprisonment with the term starting from September 24, 1993, and depriving him of political rights for three years. Xi Yang appealed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court against the sentence. After its appeal hearing, the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court rejected Xi Yang's appeal and upheld the original ruling of the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court.
