FR940208-0-00034 FR940208-0-00019 Iowa, at IAC 27&hyph;40.3(207), proposes to revise its rules by deleting 30 CFR 700.12, dealing with petitions to initiate rulemakings, from its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR Part 700. OSM, in its May 10, 1993, issue letter (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;381) to Iowa, expressed concern that, by deleting the incorporation of 30 CFR 700.12, Iowa would be left without any rule to provide procedural requirements pertaining to such petitions. In a letter dated July 8, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IA&hyph;383), Iowa supported its decision to delete 30 CFR 700.12 by explaining that the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship promulgated rules to provide procedural requirements for petitions to initiate rulemaking at IAC 21&hyph;3. The Iowa rules at IAC 21&hyph;3, in turn, adopt the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, Chapter X, that set forth procedures for handling petitions for rulemaking. Iowa submitted both the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, Chapter X, and IAC 21&hyph;10 for OSM's review. Iowa further explained in its July 8, 1993, letter that rule IAC 21&hyph;3.5(17A) addresses petitions received for related entities and that ``[w]hile the Division has its own rulemaking authority separate from the Secretary of Agriculture, the Division is an entity of the Iowa Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship *␣*␣*␣. Any petitions received relative to the coal regulatory program will be so forwarded.'' OSM understands Iowa's explanation to mean that any petitions received by the Secretary of Agriculture relative to the coal regulatory program will be forwarded to the Division for processing in accordance with IAC 21&hyph;3 and the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, Chaper X. Upon review of IAC 21&hyph;3 and the Iowa Uniform Rules on Agency Procedure, the Director finds them to be no less effective than the Federal counterpart regulation at 30 CFR 700.12 and is approving them. With regard to Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.3(207), to delete the incorporation of 30 CFR 700.12 of the Federal regulations, the Director finds this deletion acceptable so long as Iowa amends this rule to clearly identify IAC 21&hyph;3 as governing procedures regarding petitions for initiating rulemaking. Thus, the Director is requiring Iowa to further amend its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.3 by clearly identifying IAC 21&hyph;3 as governing procedures regarding petitions for initiating rulemaking. 9. IAC 27&hyph;40.4(9), Definition for ``Previously Mined Area'' Iowa proposes to revise its rules at IAC 27&hyph;40.4(9) by deleting the Federal definition for ``previously mined area'' at 30 CFR 701.5 and inserting in lieu thereof the following: ``Previously mined area'' means land previously mined on which there were no surface coal mining operations subject to the standard of the Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Act of 1977 (Public Law 95&hyph;87, as amended); all highwalls created after August 3, 1977, and all fully reclaimed sites are excluded from this definition. Iowa's proposal is in response to a required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) (November 6, 1991 (56 FR 56578, 56594)), that required the State to provide a definition for ``previously mined area'' that excludes all highwalls created after August 3, 1977, and all fully reclaimed sites. The Director finds that Iowa's proposal satisfies the required amendment at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1) and the Director is, therefore, approving the proposed definition. Since the required amendment was promulgated at 30 CFR 915.16(a)(1), however, on January 8, 1993 (58 FR 3466), OSM issued a new definition for ``previously mined area.'' The new definition provides as follows: `` Previously mined area means land affected by surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977, that has not been reclaimed to the standards of 30 CFR chapter VII.'' This definition limits the applicability of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106 to those areas mined prior to August 3, 1977, that are either unreclaimed or reclaimed to lesser standards than those prescribed by SMCRA, while also ensuring that areas mined prior to that date that have been fully and satisfactorily reclaimed pursuant to SMCRA's standards will not be redisturbed and then reclaimed under the less stringent requirements of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106. According to the preamble discussion for the definition of ``previously mined area,'' under the definition, unreclaimed or partially reclaimed areas mined prior to August 3, 1977, would continue to qualify for the partial highwall elimination exemption of 30 CFR 816.106 and 817.106, but would be otherwise held to full compliance with the reclamation standards of 30 CFR chapter VII. In such instances, the operator would be required to eliminate the highwall to the maximum extent technically practical, and to demonstrate the stability of the remaining highwall remnant. As stated above, Iowa's proposed definition explicitly excludes all highwalls created after August 3, 1977, and all fully reclaimed sites. It is not explicitly clear, however, that the proposed Iowa definition is consistent in all respects with the newly-promulgated Federal definition. For example, under the Federal definition, in order for land to qualify as a ``previously mined area,'' the land must both: (1) have been affected by surface coal mining operations prior to August 3, 1977; and (2) not have been reclaimed to the standards of 30 CFR chapter VII.
