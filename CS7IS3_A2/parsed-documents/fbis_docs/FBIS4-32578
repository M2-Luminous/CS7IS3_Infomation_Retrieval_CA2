Peto believes that his party's convention will accept the agreement made with the Socialists, and an expert government will be set up in the wake of this. [Dano] At the parliamentary group's meeting held during the coalition talks, the deputies advocated a bigger participation in economic issues. Has the SZDSZ acquired adequate guarantees and positions to implement its economic program? [Peto] Many people had the misconception that the ministerial positions count. However, it is the guarantee system that ensures the implementation of our program. [Dano] The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] has granted a number of spectacular concessions (the right of coordination, the role of counties in the local governments). Does this carry the danger that the SZDSZ would have the greater responsibility for the coalition's operational problems or possible dissolution? [Peto] Joint governing carries joint responsibility. This cannot only have consequences for one of the parties. [Dano] You had to yield with regard to the secret services, the Justice Ministry, and the position of chairman of parliament, although you had professional people for these positions. Does this cause personal conflicts within the party? [Peto] I am sure that some people will feel that they should have been given a bigger role but we have to start from the position that the results of parliamentary elections have to be taken into consideration even at the coalition talks. We cannot ensure the desired position for all SZDSZ politicians who are actually suitable to fill these positions, even if we believe that they would be the best people suited to the given tasks. [Dano] According to the program, many dozens of laws would have to be amended or new ones would have to be drawn up immediately (the laws in connection with the local government elections, agrarian law). What kind of parliamentary session do you propose for the summer? [Peto] An approximately one-month long extraordinary session should be held. [Dano] You have only just agreed on the most important issues. Legislative preparations will only begin after this. How will this result in draft laws in a few weeks? [Peto] It would not be fortunate for the caretaker government to submit the draft laws. This is a technical problem and we have not yet decided how to overcome it. [Dano] In the new government, we can again meet the second and third line of the Nemeth government, and we also have a former secretary of the National Council of Trade Unions, and a former member of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee and Political Committee. What are your views on this situation? [Peto] I am not familiar with the new government list. However, it was not our goal to restore the former Nemeth government. On this basis, we could also say that if someone was not good enough for the Nemeth government then how can he now be part of the Horn government? I do not think that this is a fortunate approach. [Dano] In your view, are we going to have an expert government as was previously promised? [Peto] Certainly. Although the cabinet might receive criticisms, in my view, the government will be of good quality. [Dano] Have you selected the SZDSZ's state secretaries? [Peto] We have selected some of them. I cannot yet speak about this. [Dano] What kind of convention are you expecting? [Peto] I am expecting an unbiased convention, similar to the one we had two weeks ago. The deputies will realistically assess the results and will accept the agreement. [Dano] When can we expect the first party meeting that will assess the government's work? [Peto] We will have an ordinary convention in the autumn.
