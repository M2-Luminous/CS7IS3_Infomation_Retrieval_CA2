The organization is requesting that the project be postponed until its main investor has supplied some missing information, Sedlacek added. Hnuti Duha has notified the Czech Economics Ministry that the containers in which the nuclear waste is to be temporarily stored have not been licensed in Germany where they were produced. According to the Duha organization, which is one of the participants in the process, the exact means of waste disposal in the project should be demonstrated now during the selection of an investor, rather than after he has been chosen. Hnuti Duha also disagrees with the exclusion of Dukovany district representatives in participating in the project's selection process. The construction permit was granted by the regional office in Trebic, south Moravia, on 1 March. Other participants in the selection process have until the end of this week to issue their own appeals. After a period of administrative negotiation the Czech Economics Ministry will rule on the appeals.
