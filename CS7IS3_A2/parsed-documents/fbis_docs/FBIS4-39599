Great Deal of Space Given to Army Topics"] [Text] Our readers want to know what draft laws relating to defense and army life parliamentarians will be examining in June. Before naming some of them, announced in the June schedule, I have to say that the mention of a particular draft law (even when a specific date is given for the discussion) does not necessarily mean that the deputies will actually get round to it. For instance, the draft State Duma decree "On Amendments to the 19 May 1993 Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Decree `On Some Measures Connected With the Implementation of the Russian Federation Law "On the Military Service Obligation and Military Service"'" is scheduled for discussion on 10 June. Let us remember that this decree was about reducing or suspending the effect of the preferential articles giving entitlement to deferment of conscription for military service. The conscription situation today is such that adjustments in the direction of further reducing the list of "privileged persons" are simply inevitable. An examination of the draft federal law "On Amendments to the Russian Federation Law `On Defense'" is planned for 17 June. A whole range of amendments is envisaged, connected with the military doctrine that has been adopted and the further reform of the Russian Federation Armed Forces. On 22 June the deputies may adopt on second reading the draft law "On the Procedure for Providing Russian Federation Military and Civilian Personnel for Participation in Operations to Maintain or Restore International Peace and Security and Other Types of Peacemaking Activity." The first reading was on 16 March and the second was planned for the end of April. We are now in June. And our peacemakers are already moving up into position in Abkhazia... The draft law "On Amendments and Additions to the Russian Federation Law `On the Russian Federation State Border'" is slated for its first reading on 22 June (how symbolic!). The draft law "On the Defense Order," which has been a long time in gestation, will be submitted for the supreme assembly's perusal on 24 June. The State Duma Council is to discuss in June draft laws "On Alternative Service," "On Military Courts," "On Russian Federation Counterintelligence Organs," "On Social Services for the Elderly and Infirm," and "On Veterans." The latter draft law, strangely enough, since it concerns our old people, is a contender for the "longest playing" title. This law has been gestating for an amazingly long time, considering that it had its first reading back last fall in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet.
