FR940314-2-00051 FR940314-2-00028 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [Project No. 2486&hyph;002 Wisconsin] Wisconsin Electric Power Co.; Availability of Draft Environmental Assessment March 8, 1994. In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new license for the existing Pine Hydroelectric Project, located on the Pine River in Florence County, Wisconsin, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NW., Washington, DC 20426. Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. For further information, contact Tom Camp at (202) 219&hyph;2832. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;5813 Filed 3&hyph;11&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
