FR940713-1-00023 FR940713-1-00001 (v) Hangback racks designed to hold 10 carcasses shall be provided for and positioned within easy reach of persons at the station. 3. Section 381.67 would be revised to read as follows: §381.67 Maximum post-mortem inspection rates. (a) The maximum post-mortem inspection rates for the classes of poultry are specified in the following table. Establishments that operate under an approved partial quality control (PQC) program, as prescribed in §381.76(i), may operate at higher production rates when optimum conditions are met. These maximum rates shall not be exceeded. Maximum Production Rates 1Class of poultry 1Birds per minute 2With PQC 2Without PQC Young chickens 91 70 Young turkeys: ␣ l i0J-type opening cut l i03-point suspension Less than 16 pounds 51 20 More than 16 pounds 41 16 ␣ l i0Bar-type opening cut l i03-point suspension Less than 16 pounds 45 20 More than 16 pounds 35 16 (b) The inspector in charge or his or her designee shall be responsible for reducing production rates where, in the inspector's judgment, the post-mortem inspection procedure cannot be adequately performed with the time available because of either of the following conditions: (1) The official establishment cannot present the birds in such a manner that the carcasses including both internal and external surfaces and all organs, are readily accessible for inspection, or (2) The establishment cannot properly remove diseased birds or properly identify contaminated birds and birds for off-line trimming or knife salvage. 4. Section 381.68 would be removed and reserved. 5. Subpart I would be amended by adding a new §381.69 to read as follows: §381.69 Treating carcasses to reduce bacterial contamination. (a) General. Raw, unchilled poultry carcasses shall be treated at any point during the slaughter and dressing operation to reduce levels of bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces. (b) Treatment methods. Official establishments shall use any of the following treatment methods to reduce bacterial contamination, provided that the equipment used to apply the treatment has been approved under §381.53, the operation of the method results in full compliance with the Act and this part, and that the method permits effective and efficient monitoring by program employees. (1) Any chlorine compound approved by the Administrator and administered to raw, unchilled whole poultry carcasses or major carcass portions at 20 to 50 parts per million (ppm) in the intake water at the final wash. The Administrator will prepare a list containing compounds approved for use in official establishments. A copy of the list may be obtained from the Compounds and Packaging Division, Regulatory Programs, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700. (i) The establishment must conduct three tests per 8-hour shift on the intake water of each final washer using a starch-iodide titration test kit, or any other chlorine analysis method acceptable to the IIC, to assure that chlorine intake levels are within the range prescribed above. An initial test must be conducted at the start of the shift before the first carcass enters the final washer. The two other tests must be conducted at randomly selected times during the shift. Records of chlorine test results that specify the time of the test, chlorine concentration levels, and the name and position of the person administering the test shall be on file in the establishment and shall be made available to program employees, upon request. (ii) If the chlorine level is above or below the range of 20 to 50 ppm available chlorine in the final wash water, the establishment shall adjust the chlorine level to an acceptable level within 15 minutes. If adjustments are not made within 15 minutes, the establishment shall suspend the treatment and shall not permit any carcasses to enter the final washer until the chlorine level is within the prescribed range. (2) Any antimicrobial compound listed in the table in §381.147(f)(4) permitted for use on poultry products may be used under the conditions specified therein. (3) Any compound previously approved for use in poultry or poultry products as a food additive or processing aid by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and listed in title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 73, 74, 81, 172, 173, 182, or 184 may be used, provided the owner or operator has received approval for such use from the Administrator in accordance with section 381.147(f)(1). The owner or operator shall submit to the Administrator information and data indicating the site of application and that the substance is effective in reducing bacterial contamination on carcass surfaces, and its use is in compliance with applicable FDA requirements and will not render the carcass adulterated or misbranded or otherwise not in compliance with the requirements of the Act. (4) Any countercurrent scalder, designed such that potable water enters at or near the point where carcasses exit the scalder, overflow outlets are located at or near the point where carcasses enter the scalder, and exiting carcasses do not come in contact with overflow water, that is used concurrently with a post-scald rinse may be used, provided the equipment is evaluated and found acceptable by the Administrator. The Administrator will prepare a list containing each model approved for use in official establishments. A copy of the list may be obtained from the Facilities, Equipment, and Sanitation Division, Science and Technology, Food Safety and Inspection Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC 20250&hyph;3700.
