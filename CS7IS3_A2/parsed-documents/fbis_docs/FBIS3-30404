At a roundtable -- "A TANJUG guest" -- Karadzic expressed doubt that the negotiations on Bosnia, due to take place in Geneva on 10 February, can produce any result due to a lack of political will to influence the Muslims to accept a peaceful solution. According to him, Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic will, as he has done so far, act "as his sponsors say." "It is therefore to be expected that the Muslim parliament, at a session due to take place in Sarajevo on 7 February, will adopt a platform unacceptable to both the Serbs and the Croats, or at least to the Serbs, in order to make sure that the war continues," Karadzic said. He explained that the Muslim ambition to achieve domination in Bosnia and their obligation to secure the whole of Bosnia for Islamic interests in Europe caused the war and is the reason for its continuation. He added that "the United States has said that the Muslims have the right to try to achieve their objectives by military means" and that this is the first time they said they will recognize the results of the armed struggle. "We, the Serbs, have nothing against this, provided the same standard is applied to us," Karadzic said. He recalled that the Serbs have made huge concessions in exchange for an urgent peace and lifting of sanctions and added that, if the concessions do not result in peace and a solution, they will be withdrawn. Karadzic underlined that the Serb side will continue to make any future agreement on Bosnia conditional on the lifting of sanctions against Yugoslavia.
