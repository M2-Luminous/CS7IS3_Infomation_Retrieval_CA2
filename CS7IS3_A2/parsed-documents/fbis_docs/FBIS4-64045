Volodymyr Lephykhov believes that the decree by the president of Ukraine "On the Main Directorate of the Security Service of Ukraine in Crimea," signed on 18 May, violates the law of Ukraine "On the Security Service." The Supreme Council of Ukraine did not consider the changes connected with the decree by Leonid Kravchuk, and there is no resolution by the Supreme Council of Ukraine that would legally fix the changes in the law. In the opinion of Volodymyr Lephykhov, all this gives grounds to believe that the decree by the president of Ukraine of 18 May "is illegal and illegitimate in all respects." "In the present-day complicated situation such actions raise strong doubts about the assurances by the official circles of Ukraine that they wish to ensure durable civil peace and accord, the rights and freedoms of every citizen in Crimea," says the statement by the Crimean Security Service chairman.
