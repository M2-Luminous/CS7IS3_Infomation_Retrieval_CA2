FR940725-2-00103 FR940725-2-00063 E. Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication on notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . Amendment No. 1 reduces the proposed position limits with respect to Nikkei 300 Index options from 50,000 contracts on the same side of the market to 25,000 contracts (provided that no more than 15,000 contracts, as opposed to 30,000 contracts as originally proposed, are in series in the nearest expiration month). By reducing the position limits, this amendment will serve to protect investors and the public interest, and further minimize the potential for manipulation. Further, the proposal containing the higher position limits was published for the full 21-day comment period, and no comments were received. Therefore, the Commission finds that no new regulatory issues are raised by Amendment No. 1. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is consistent with Sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Exchange's proposal on an accelerated basis. IV. Solicitation of Comments Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the foregoing that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the foregoing between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. ยง552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. Copies of such filings also will be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;14, and should be submitted by August 15, 1994. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 30 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;14), as amended, is approved. 30 15 U.S.C. ยง78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 31 31 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
