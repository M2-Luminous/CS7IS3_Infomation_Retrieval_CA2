"All sorts of plots are presently being hatched against us, the special services are onto us, and so we must strengthen our unity. At the fifth congress of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, which is to be held in Moscow on 2 April, I shall raise the issue of strengthening the single chain of command in the party," Zhirinovskiy said. Touching on the state of affairs in the economy, he used his usual vocabulary to describe the profound crisis, and reiterated the lack of talent amongst the country's leaders. Only the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, once in power, can in his view offer Russian Federation citizens a better life.
