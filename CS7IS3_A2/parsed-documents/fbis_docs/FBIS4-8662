On the basis of these reactions, correspondent Arben Karapici prepared the following report: [Karapici] The unprecedented act of official terrorism that Greece was finally able to exert against the national sovereignty of our country and the victims caused by the Hellenistic adventure of Sunday [10 April] do not seem to pass so easy in the international arena. In a UN Security Council meeting on 12 April, President Colin Keating briefed the permanent council members on the letter from Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi. Reports from the UN Security Council Presidency state that none of the members had any objections, which has encouraged the observers to think that the Albanian protest will be the object of serious analysis. The meeting decided to follow the normal procedure, according to which the president gathers information from all sides, reports it to the council, and the latter decides on the president's report. The representatives of the European Union troika, Germany and Belgium, energetically condemned the armed attack by the Greek military unit by fully supporting the protests by the Albanian Government and state to the international security organizations. The representatives of Germany and Belgium particularly warned of the danger that the event on the Albanian-Greek border presents, which, according to them, infringes not only upon Albania's stability but also that of the Balkans. That is why Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock reacted toward the Hellenistic adventure with serious consequences for Albania and the Albanians. Mock harshly condemned the terrorist act by the Greek unit. The chief of Austrian diplomacy expressed Vienna's readiness to seriously consider the Greek armed attack. On the other hand, the British Government pronounced that it strongly condemns all terrorist acts of this kind and other similar actions that, according to London, lead to the destabilization of the situation in the Balkans. The Major government commits itself to support all efforts by the Albanian Government's to continue to preserve stability and security in the Balkans. The British Government considers Albania's stance toward the Greek act of terror to be fair. Meanwhile, the harsh protests of the Albanian Government and state were the subject of special consideration in the U.S. National Security Council and the Department of State in Washington. They informed our ambassador that the U.S. Government denounces this act, while Washington suggests dialogue between both sides so that the situation does not escalate any further. Meanwhile, representatives of the French Foreign Ministry expressed their deep regret over Sunday's event and the victims. Paris considered as fully legitimate the Albanian Government's demand to the Greek Government that Athens find those responsible for the terrorist attack as soon as possible and convict them. The French Foreign Ministry considers the finding and conviction of the culprits as an important condition in normalizing Greek-Albanian relations. Finally, it should be said that the official reactions of the chancelleries in Europe against the armed attack have been accompanied by comments and articles in the most powerful European newspapers. You will be acquainted with these comments in our future broadcasts.
