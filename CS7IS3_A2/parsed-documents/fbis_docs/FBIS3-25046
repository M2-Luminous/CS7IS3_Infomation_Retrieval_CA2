Reacting Sunday to Mr Mandela's warning in the [Orange] Free State on Saturday [5 February] that the right wing's threatened "limited violence" would be met with unlimited violence from the African National Congress, Mr Kriel said this was just terrorism in another form. "Mr Mandela's proposed cure of further unlimited violence will...be far worse than the illness itself and could incite random attacks on innocent people and unleash a new cycle of violence." The only way to combat the attacks -- including several bombings of ANC offices -- apparently being carried out by the right wing was to infiltrate their terrorist cells. This was a time-consuming process but was the only way, said Mr Kriel.
