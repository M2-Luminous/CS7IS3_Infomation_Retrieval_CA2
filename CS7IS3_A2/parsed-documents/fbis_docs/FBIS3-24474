Noble metals (i.e., platinum, palladium, ruthenium, rhodium, etc.) may serve as catalysts in selective reduction processes; however, their high cost and scarcity have spawned the search for cheaper alternatives. Noble metal oxides on different carriers and variable-valence metal oxides may be used as catalysts in nonselective reduction processes. In view of these facts, a study was undertaken to find effective non-noble metal-containing catalysts that could be used to reduce nitrogen oxides with natural gas. The experiments were performed in a continuous reactor unit with a stationary catalyst layer at temperatures of 250-590�C with a space velocity of 3,000/h and CH[.sup]4[/]:NO[.sub]x[/] ratio of 10:1. The content of nitrogen oxides in the gas mixture at the reactor entrance and exit was determined by the calorimetric method and by gas-liquid chromatography. Eight catalysts were tested: STK, GIAP-8, NTK-10-1, NTK-10, nickel-chromium, palladized carbon, GIAP-16, and carbon-modified STK. With the exception of GIAP-8, all of the catalysts tested manifested a high catalytic activity during the nitrogen oxide recovery process. The main products of the reduction reaction were nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide. A side reaction of methane and oxygen also occurred. The study established that most metal oxide-based commercial catalysts (i.e., with the exception of GIAP-8) may be used to virtually totally remove nitrogen oxides from gas mixtures at 290-590�C provided that the said gas mixture does not contain more than 3 weight percent oxygen. When greater amounts of oxygen are present, it is necessary to first remove the oxygen from the gas mixture by, for example, using a two-stage reactor. Tables 3; references 4 (Russian).
