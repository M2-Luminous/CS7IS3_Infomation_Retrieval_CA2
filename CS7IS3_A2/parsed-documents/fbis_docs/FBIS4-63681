In its Monday statement the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry says that Lithuania recognized the Ukrainian territorial integrity in February 1994 in accordance with the major international principles. The statement comes on the heel of a decision by the Crimean parliament on 20th May to conduct its foreign policy independently from the Ukraine and to have its own armed forces. The law on the revival of the Crimean constitution was denounced as unlawful by Ukraine. The Crimean authorities in their turn responded by suspending the decision [as heard] of the Ukrainian parliament on the peninsula. The Lithuanian Foreign Office called upon the parties to solve all disagreements by applying sensible and commonly acceptable measures. Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas has also urged all political forces and officials involved in the Crimea dispute to approach the issue with responsibility and moderacy [as heard]. In his Monday statement the president said that international organizations should concentrate on producing a quick and peaceful solution to the Crimean issue, preventing the peninsula from turning into a source of instability that could threaten security in the region and on the continent.
