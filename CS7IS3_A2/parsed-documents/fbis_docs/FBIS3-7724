What is the United States waiting for, why do they allow the destruction of the Yalta system, others wondered, marveling at messages totally different from what they hoped for, primarily from Baker, Zimmermann, Eagleberger, and other officials of the Bush administration. A third group thought that the United States only needed time to wake up and that it would intervene in favor of the just cause sooner or later. Much water has passed under the bridge since then, as it was three years ago, but those who claimed the United States needed time to realize, or better yet, find its interest in the matter seem to have been right. Our country did not get help from the 6th Fleet, but something else -- with far-reaching consequences for Croatia -- has begun to happen, both regarding the involvement of the United States in solving the Balkan crisis, understanding the real situation, and making moves that could produce results. Mr. Charles Redman, President Clinton's special envoy, who has visited Zagreb twice in the last week, has made it clear that the Clinton administration is very seriously involved in trying to find the solution for reaching an agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and has pointed out that "the present involvement could lay the foundations for the future of both Bosnia and Croatia, a future in which the two countries would be closely connected with the mainstream of Europe." What is Redman trying to say? What does the United States want from Croatia and what is it offering in return, pointing out that Croatia could play a pivotal role in helping (the United States) to reach a peaceful solution in Bosnia? First of all, they want Croatia to cooperate and attempt to find a peaceful solution, and they want the Bosnian Croats to do the same, in addition to being prepared to make compromises. The United States is simply insisting on the immediate cessation of hostilities between the Croats and the Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina and on a new alliance of the two former allies, currently bitter enemies; they want a clear situation so as to be able to put more pressure on the Serbs. What are they trying to accomplish by that? Their primary concern is to give a positive reply to the pressure coming from the Islamic countries, which want the United States to protect the Bosnian Muslims. Moreover, by insisting on connecting the Croatian and Muslim parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and resting that against the Republic of Croatia, they want to enable that state creation to survive and have firm ties with Europe. Therefore, Redman promised Croatia, and also a Bosnia-Herzegovina connected to Croatia, integration with the West, the European Union, and the United States. The Frankfurt rapprochement of Granic's and Silajdzic's negotiating positions is an important indicator of the success and efficiency of the new U.S. approach. And so is the unilateral cease-fire of the Croatian Defense Council, and the clear promise of the West to protect besieged Croatian areas. The world wants to use the favorable climate created by the NATO ultimatum and the withdrawal of the Serbs -- and the United States has now taken the leading role -- to begin the process of normalization on the territory of former Yugoslavia. If the Muslims relinquish their maximalist goals, they will be offered survival and a state fit for existence; the Bosnian Croats are being offered and guaranteed equality in Bosnia-Herzegovina as well as safety in the currently besieged enclaves, and Croatia, apart from having the silent economic embargo lifted, is offered inclusion in European and other international integration processes. Furthermore, the United States has made it clear to Croatia that, in addition to solving the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina, it will take determined action to establish full sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia within its internationally recognized borders. Post-ultimatum peace initiatives should be taken as seriously as the Serbs are serious in their response to the ultimatum; especially if those initiatives are taken and backed by the United States, which is also pointing out that it is acting in full concordance with the European Union. This initiative -- realistically speaking -- could finally bring peace to southeastern Europe, even without the direct involvement of the 6th Fleet, although one must never forget that it is close at hand.
