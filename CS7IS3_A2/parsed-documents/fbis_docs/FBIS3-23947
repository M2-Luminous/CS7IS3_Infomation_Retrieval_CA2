Stabilization of the ruble and the budget, and ruble convertibility. The result: 25-30 percent inflation, a real budget deficit amounting to 20 percent of GNP, and the ruble exchange rate in relation to the dollar has fallen from 100 to 1,600 rubles [R]. Privatization: In the current year the decline in production constitutes around 50 percent of 1989's [production]; investment in industry in 1993 was close to zero, while the outflow of hard currency to the West amounted to $15 billion. Improving management: The ranks of staff employed by the central executive authority have swelled by a factor of five to six. Crime, corruption... Perhaps it is time to thank the reformers and, without emotion, answer the question of how to proceed with reforms from now on so that at least at some time in the future we will get different results. The content of the book "Lessons of Economic Reform" is not a correction to the course of reform, not an exhortation for "more therapy and less shock" as is currently promoted by some people in the government and opposition politicians. It is a principally different transition period strategy. Its meaning is not in the self-withdrawal of the government but, on the contrary, in active actions by it in the area of demonopolization, the creation of a competitive environment, and privatization, with a serious accent on protection of property and development of national industry, as well as the creation of a financial system supporting savings, capital investment, and growth, which is the only road to true financial stabilization. The book "Lessons of Economic Reform," which presents a new understanding of reforms in the most complete and structured form, is now being readied for a second edition. 1. Failure--of the Free Market or the Government? Let us summarize a few things. Standard economic recipes were applied to the institutional, market, financial, and political structures of Russia as they have been formed over 75 years in the environment of a planned socialist system; they consisted of deregulation, liberalization, and financial stabilization. As a result, the perception of a closed vicious circle has emerged in the economy; effectiveness dropped dramatically, and prospects disappeared over the horizon. Blood was spilled in the country. In this chaos it is very difficult to distinguish what constitutes a change for the better (contains in it the seeds of future development of a normal free market economy), and what is an obvious weed that may overcome and destroy all the good plants if nothing is done. There is absolutely no doubt, however, that the outcome has very little in common with what the official reformers and Western well-wishers had hoped to obtain. I am frequently asked what I think is wrong in the reformers' economic policy in the postsocialist countries of the former Soviet Union and what, in my opinion, should be corrected. Actually, I do not know the best answer. Imagine that you are an artist and you are shown a painting created by someone whose main problem is that the idea is not coming through. And then you are asked to correct, improve, this work. In all probability you will refuse and say that the only thing that can be done is to take a blank sheet and try to draw everything from scratch. Economic reform in a big country is not a case where you can throw away everything that has been done so far and start with a blank sheet. The misfortune of Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union is that the "picture" of reforms until now was being painted and is still being painted by absolutely different people. When the government is in a state such as it had been in the former Soviet Union and Russia over the past few years, it is very difficult to decide what is worse: trust the authorities or take the risk of going into the still "unknown country" of the failure of the Russian market. This truly is a Hamletian question, because in the Russian economy today problems are being created both by the market and by the government. The market is failing because technological monopolies are keeping prices and distortions in the area of wealth at a level that sometimes even exceeds the old distortions of the planned economy. The market is failing because property relations are not defined clearly; because market agents do not think strategically; and because there are no institutions that would ensure free and fair access to information resources, as well as competition in most markets. The government is failing because it has not been able to give up regulation. It still interferes in the economy, and by arbitrary and ineffective methods at that. The system that rationalized this interference in a planned economy and the entire rationale for this interference have disappeared, but the fragments of the old system may still be found here and there, except that now the primary role they play is that of a life support, providing "quite a nice life" first and foremost for corrupt bureaucrats. The government is failing because it cannot control the budget and money; cannot get things in order; cannot force economic agents to play by established rules and, moreover, cannot itself refrain from changing the rules from day to day. So, will we not perhaps improve the situation by choosing free market instead of government interference? After all, the free market has self-correction mechanisms, and many failures of the system would be alleviated, provided the government had the will to truly remove itself from the scene. For instance, getting rid of arbitrary licensing, regulation, subsidies, and investment could put an end to a considerable part of corruption. This is the last bastion that needs to be conquered (from the position of those who insist on total liberalism). My answer to this may be divided into two parts. First, even if it were desirable, this is impossible, because Russia is not the United States of Thomas Jefferson. One of the legacies of communism is a very complex, extremely unreliable industrial-technological potential (not to mention the stockpile of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons), which produced Chernobyl and may produce many others if the government does indeed decide to "resign" completely. It is also impossible because the time frame and costs of a reform based solely of market self-regulation will be so immense that they may exceed even the Russian people's famous capacity for patience. I am literally very distraught over concerns about the "Weimarization" of the situation in East Europe--for instance, in Hungary--which serious politicians and scholars voice increasingly often. The socioeconomic situation in Russia is several times worse, and, correspondingly, the threat to its new institutions of political freedom and democracy is several times greater. But if political freedom and democracy fail in Russia, the entire world will feel the consequences. Therefore we must be very responsible in our professional assessment of the situation and in our actions. And the most important lesson we must draw from the experience of the past two to three years is that the state still should play a substantial role during the transition period. Second, in the current political conditions in Russia, no matter who is the head of the government, it is practically impossible for them to do anything constructive. I respect and have high regard for some members of the Russian government. Nevertheless, I feel that on the whole we should not expect anything good from the current Russian government because of the bottomlessness of the political crisis. When Prime Minister B. Chernomyrdin was asked a question about the well-remembered July exchange of banknotes, he answered with the remarkable candor that I like so much in many current Russian politicians. "We wanted to do what is best," he said, "but the result was as usual." This was echoed by the statement of a prominent Russian businessman: "We really can depend on our government: If it can do anything to worsen the economic situation, it will." This second point does not necessarily mean desperation. On the contrary, for me at least it means only one thing--political conditions must be changed, and a new government that will be able to work effectively must come to power. How to achieve this is a separate topic. Therefore, permit me at this point to bypass this problem and go on to describe what kind of purposeful transformation is still possible in the current conditions. Our challenge to most economists' perceptions regarding the general concept of transforming the postsocialist economy will consist of the following: 1) It is impossible to achieve macroeconomic stabilization before a sizable and real private sector emerges in the economy and structural and institutional restructuring takes place. Macroeconomic stabilization as a goal placed ahead of everything else was a fallacious strategy from the very beginning (see DIAGNOSIS, EPIcenter, May 1992). A planned economy is an economy specially set up to function without money in its true sense. Therefore it does not react to a tighter macroeconomic policy the way it is described in textbooks. In reality, for all practical purposes it does not react positively to macroeconomic regulation altogether, and if there is any reaction at all, it is very distorted, superficial, and very often--as in the case of foreign currency exchange rates--artificial. This may seem an exaggeration on our side, but it is a fact. And although certain market elements have emerged in the economy, the bulk of it remains untransformed, and therefore we are currently unable to do anything serious about either the budget deficit or inflation. 2) It is impossible to correct disproportions in relative prices, create the correct motivation for producers, and reduce the loss of public wealth by merely removing controls and freeing prices. In order for Adam Smith's "invisible hand" to bring the desired results, we, again, need institutional and structural changes, including a resolution of the main issue--property; real implementation of land reform; demonopolization of the economy--first and foremost, liquidation of technological monopolies--and at least the first signs of competition; freeing enterprises from the burden of financing the social sphere; and many other measures. Otherwise the disproportions that existed before will remain. Moreover, new disproportions are added to existing ones, forming a market economy of a very specific type. The outcome can hardly be called a more effective economic system, not to mention one providing greater fairness as compared to the old one. 3) It is impossible to achieve either macroeconomic stabilization or correct market behavior without creating conditions for economic growth, and on top of that on a basis completely different from the one that existed in the planned economy. The success of the stabilization program in Japan in 1949--one of the most outstanding successes of standard macroeconomic policy in modern history--was predetermined by the restructuring of production, as well as of demand and supply, that had taken place during the years preceding the stabilization program--from 1946 to 1949. All this had been taking place in an environment of considerable, sometimes even galloping, inflation. Also, we should not forget that the Korean War, which broke out soon after implementation of this program had begun, practically removed the overheating of the economy by opening up greatly needed opportunities on the side of external demand. Moreover, for two more decades after the success of this program, state interference at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic level remained quite considerable. 4) A model intended for small open economies is unsuitable for the Russian economy. Until now the IMF [International Monetary Fund] and other advisers mainly had to deal with exactly this--small countries, including in East Europe. This is their first attempt to help a country that is so large, and it is quite natural that a different approach is needed here. For instance, the Russian economy cannot be based on only one export sector (for instance, fuel and power engineering), leaving all other industrial sectors to the mercy of fate. And external demand will never be able to make up for the collapse of domestic demand; in other words, a "Keynesian" type of decline represents a much more serious problem here than in a small country. 5) We cannot disregard political and geopolitical factors. Russia is part of the former Union. Fourteen republics of this former Union have declared their independence, but most of them will never be able to achieve real economic independence, at least in the foreseeable future. On the other hand, Russia cannot remain indifferent to this aspect--if for no other reason than because 25 million Russians live in the CIS republics. In addition, Russia itself is a grandiose conglomerate of heterogeneous regions, including many that used to consist of ethnic minorities [sentence as published]. No economic reform can be successful unless it takes this reality into account. The topic of the correct political design for further transformations requires time and space exceeding what we are allotted for this article. Therefore we will outline only briefly what, in our opinion, can be done in order to channel the process underway in the right direction; how to give a boost to those transformations that promise an effective market economy in the future and at the same time erect high defensive barriers against those trends that carry the inherent danger of leading the economy astray. 2. The Effective Proprietor The main argument of supporters of self-development in privatization may be summarized this way: All state property must be transferred into private hands as quickly as possible. It is unimportant who gets this property initially; all that is needed is to enable free trading of newly acquired property rights, and in the end more effective proprietors will gain possession of this property. Needless to say, there is an enormous distance between this theoretical construction and real market conditions, since the market is always replete with all sorts of imperfections. However, the Russian Government's faith in this liberalistic dogma was so great that a whole system of so-called voucher privatization was specially constructed to accommodate this concept. We have already commented on the results of the privatization scheme. As to the vouchers, the only thing we could add here is that capital asset prices have multiplied tens of times over during the past few years even at the level of book value, let alone market prices. At the same time, the voucher's market price has just reached twice its face value (R20,000). We have to remember, however, that the face value of the voucher should have been correlated with the total value of capital assets measured in the prices of the 1970's-1980's. Thus, the total value of vouchers distributed to the population, a considerable part of which still had not been invested in anything, currently corresponds to only several percent of the total wealth they were supposed to represent. Of course, the price of a voucher, like that of any other capital, is never determined by its real or perceived share in some wealth, since the price of any capital is nothing other than a discounted sum of the future income flow expected from this capital. Income flow is controlled by directors of post-state enterprises, for whom the vouchers are nothing but a headache, since they do not help to attract additional capital but require that dividends be paid on them. In this sense the entire idea of "people's privatization" is false from beginning to end. The concept of privatization in the environment of purposeful transformation must be completely different. A democratic government must for the last time truly act as a proprietor of state enterprises and resources. And in this role it must do everything possible to transfer this property into reliable (to the extent possible) private hands. There were 23,766 enterprises in Russian industry in 1992, of which 20,757 were the property of the state or of local bodies of authority. Many have already been converted into joint-stock companies in 1993, but this is actually collective property with a great share of stock still in the hands of federal authorities. It is not that easy to make the directors of all state and post-state enterprises submit to government short- and medium-term plans for enterprise reconstruction so that the state, having studied these plans, could decide whether to leave these directors where they are or replace them. It is not easy, but it has to be done. If the Russian Government currently does not have enough resources to carry it out, then it may be just the area where technical aid on the part of developed countries could be best applied. In the process of putting together and studying these plans, the most important task is to prepare an outline for the break-up of a score of technological monopolies. But even more importantly, from the standpoint of the "proprietor--director" problem, it is necessary to ensure an atmosphere in which directors are answerable to proprietors. First to the reformist government; then, as privatization progresses, to the stockholders that will come with it. Naturally, directors themselves may become these new owners-stockholders, if the government is satisfied with their activities in managing the enterprise reconstruction after a certain period of time, during which they will be monitored. Keeping in mind the confusion in the privatization situation, we have attempted to present our proposals in the form of consecutive steps (this scheme was proposed by my EPIcenter [Center for Economic and Political Research] colleague S.I. Ivanenko): 1. It is, of course, necessary to fulfill the obligations already undertaken--complete the exchange of privatization checks for stock. After that, announce no future use of vouchers for purposes of further privatization. 2. On a mandatory basis, sign contracts with managers of state enterprises. The contract should envisage only two points: the manager's obligation not to allow the enterprise to go bankrupt and the obligation to submit and implement a plan of enterprise reconstruction and its preparation for real privatization. 3. Provide incentives in the form of tax and other preferences to transfer the controlling share of stock from enterprise employees to large institutional investors. 4. Revise the entire legislation, including administrative acts, in the direction of establishing the priority of private law. Draft and adopt the laws (the Civil and Trade Codes, etc.) that are absent and repeal those that are obsolete. Laws should be primarily of the direct action kind, with a clear mechanism of implementation and concrete sanctions in the event of violation. 5. Conduct privatization of state property only through auctions (the factor mentioned in the past was lack of money; now there is money and it is sitting in Western banks). Expand the privatization front: Rights of limited availability, which the state grants to commercial companies, must be sold, and only at open auctions and only publicly. For instance, the rights to lease land in the central part of major cities, export licenses, etc. 6. Organize a system of antitrust bodies' control over the activities of local authorities. It is necessary, through the use administrative methods, to protect and develop competition in the market of goods, capital, and labor: the allocation of facilities and control over wholesale and retail markets; increasing the number of stores; the sale of housing and allocation of land; squeezing out the mafia; and so on. 7. Dramatically cut state procurement in the agro-industrial and fuel and power generation sectors (sectors that receive the largest subsidies): accelerated denationalization, phased reduction of subsidies (time frame should be officially announced), organization of a market in agricultural commodities futures, and privatization of the main elements of distribution systems. 8. Set up a system of voluntary reorganization of enterprises ("voluntary bankruptcy") with state support: investment, credits, preferences, managerial cadres. To encourage the voluntary bankruptcy of chronically insolvent enterprises (50-100 enterprises over three years), develop individual packages for voluntary bankrupts, which will include clear points of reference: --reorganization of production and management; --assessment of the enterprise's financial and economic prospects; --appraisal of the enterprise's (property) market value; --search for investors; --placement of stock in the securities market. Another urgent task in the area of privatization is the development of a secondary market of privatized assets. The dual system of prices for most capital assets must be liquidated as quickly as possible. In those instances when for certain reasons it is not desirable to sell capital assets and capital to those who offer the highest price (keeping in mind the already developed very uneven distribution of financial resources, caused to a considerable extent by the ineffectiveness of the 1992-1993 policy and "mafia-ization"), public auctions should be held, with clearly defined and widely publicized decisionmaking criteria and mechanisms. 3. Industrial Policy and State Investment The "government of reform" was not only the first post-Soviet government but also the first government that was knowledgeable in economics, at least in theory. To employ a chess analogy, we had for the first time a government that knew how to move the pieces on a chess board. But in order to win the game it is not enough to know how to move the pieces. The chess player must have a strategy. At the time the government said that the situation was so urgent that at least some kind of game had to be started immediately, and then the necessary moves would pop up on their own as the situation developed. But even a chess genius is unlikely to win a game by merely responding to his opponent's moves, without understanding the game design as a whole. In this particular case, events themselves handed down judgment on the quality of the players. The net result of the reform plan (if there was one at all) implemented in Russia in 1992 was a further exacerbation of distortions in relative prices and preservation of the inefficient structure of industry. The share of sectors producing intermediate products in the GDP, already high in the Russian economy, has grown even more over the past two years since wholesale prices increased most in the primary sectors (in the fuel and power generation sector, including due to high external demand); followed to a lesser extent by intermediate sectors (such as metallurgy, chemical and petrochemical production); even less in machine building; and least of all in light industry, with the exception of the food processing industry where they increased somewhat more. At the same time, the rate of retail price increases continuously lagged behind that in wholesale prices, and the difference between these two indices since 1990 has exceeded 3,000 percent. The post-price liberalization cause-and-effect chain that has produced this paradoxical situation may be described as follows. The persisting sellers market and technological monopolies resulted in price rises for primary resources and intermediate products. At the stage of final demand the government attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, to introduce strict budget restrictions, constraining monetary income and cutting back on state procurement of armaments. In this area a buyers market began to emerge, but only for the final product. This began to exert downward pressure on retail prices and wholesale prices in those sectors that are positioned closest to the final consumer. The latter could not sustain their costs and sharply cut back on the level of production. At this stage the government and local bodies of authority had to interfere. Especially local bodies of authority, which now have the responsibility for subsidizing retail prices, and which implemented their own system of subsidies, which lead, among other things, to sharp regional price differentiation. For instance, in June 1993 a kilogram of bread cost R56 in Nizhniy Novgorod, R32 in Samara, and R18.67 in Ulyanovsk. These three cities are in the same geographic region and their populations' income level is approximately the same. The central government had to compensate for the losses of suppliers producing for the final consumer. The system of subsidies, which in the past was more or less evenly distributed throughout the economy, is currently skewed toward production and sales of foodstuffs, light industry, and the defense sector. The government also was forced to considerably subsidize imports of consumer goods. The share of subsidies in the GDP is at the level of about 30 percent, while preferential credits that went mostly to the state-controlled agrarian sector and the fuel and power generation complex topped 12 percent of GDP in 1992. This is a serious failure of the economic program, which basically was envisaged as one founded on a liberalistic approach. Instead of these self-destructive measures, which do not lead to real structural technological restructuring of relative prices, we propose a different approach, the cornerstone of which is a carefully thought-through industrial policy. A task of enormous importance is to get rid of technological monopolies. However, in most cases this is constrained by the fact that giant state (post-state) enterprises, whose labor force in some instances numbers in the hundreds of thousands, maintain the entire life support system of large cities: housing, medical services, child care facilities, recreation facilities, and even education are dependent to a considerable degree on state enterprises, whose directors frequently behave like feudal lords in their fiefdoms. However, by now this system already represents an unsustainable burden for post-state enterprises. The results of our research in Nizhniy Novgorod have revealed the following picture. A considerable number of state and post-state enterprises directed up to 80 percent of their profits to support of social infrastructure. Therefore, the first step on the road of structural restructuring, conversion in the military-industrial complex, and breaking up monopolies should consist of separating social infrastructures from state and post-state enterprises. Many things, including breaking up industrial giants into several parts, simply cannot be carried out without it (see "Nizhniy Novgorod Prologue," Moscow, 1993). The next task of industrial policy is to create a mechanism for the redistribution of resources between sectors. This mechanism currently practically does not exist. The structure of production is rapidly changing in current prices. But profits and losses in different sectors of the economy practically do not lead to a situation whereby new companies open in some sectors and old ones close in others. And the reason is that there is no true market in any of the three production factors: labor, land, and capital. Therefore redistribution of resources will be possible only when these markets are created and organized, and also when they have financial resources available. The state should play a most active role in carrying out this task. The formation of the labor market will be partly achieved when social infrastructure, including housing, is separated from enterprises. Other steps in this direction should include state support for part-time training while continuing work, and creating a support system for small and medium-size businesses, especially in agriculture, the service sector, etc. A market in land cannot be created with land reform. Although some progress has been achieved in the area of limiting state kolkhozes' monopoly on agricultural land, nevertheless the legal situation in this respect remains very confusing, and land reform remains an item on the agenda. A market in urban and industrial land also should be developing under appropriate political guidance on the part of the government. As to fixed assets and other capital goods, the privatization scheme described above should create the conditions for this market. As soon as these funds find their new owners vested with all rights--whether they are the current managers of post-state enterprises or someone else--their true capital value based on the expected future income flow can be determined. This will root out the current dual price system, in which one is laughably low, while the other also is in many instances inadequate since it includes the elements of a purely speculative market. And, finally, the government should play an active role in determining priority sectors in industry and forming the future industrial structure. The solution to this task must first and foremost include laying a foundation for a substantial economic growth built on these priorities, which represents in the final analysis the main condition for achieving macroeconomic stabilization. An approach from the position of vulgar liberalism currently leads to hypertrophied growth in the primary sector and a gradual washout of the processing industry. We are convinced that this trend should be halted. Russia, with its resources and human potential, can and should be a modern industrial country. But vulgar liberalism will not lead us there even in the most distant future. Instead of simply relying on market forces, the government should create a serious program for development of the processing industry on a new basis, and one of the priorities on the part of the government should be in the sphere of basic infrastructure--construction of auto and rail roads, means of communications, and housing. One may consider this utopian given the current crisis in the budget sphere, but we will try to show that this not the case. There are currently many plants or, for instance, mines that are so obsolete in terms of technology and equipment that it is cheaper to close them than modernize them. They are still being artificially kept afloat by direct or indirect government subsidies. It would be possible, for instance, to use labor resources engaged at such enterprises in, for instance, public housing construction, where an incentive for workers themselves would be a share in the ownership of the newly constructed housing. This can be done without increasing the budget deficit. This logic is even more universal. It is true that by manipulating the figures the government has been able to reduce the federal budget's statistical deficit to 7-8 percent of GDP, but the all-inclusive deficit as calculated by the IMF still amounts to 20-25 percent, and the difference mainly consists of subsidies that do not go through the budget, and preferential credits. What is really bad in all this is that the greater part of the deficit is used almost fully for consumption and issuance of credits to settle current accounts between enterprises. The banks use the money in enterprises' accounts for short-term lending, earning enormous profits. Thus, the current system of combating the budget deficit has practically replaced long-term government state investment by short-term credits for current operations, to which on top of that the banks in practice add their own "tax." If the government returns to long-term investment in the development of basic production infrastructure and support of modernization of priority sectors in industry, while simultaneously reducing the availability of current capital (which only serves to perpetuate economic inefficiency), it will not increase the correctly calculated budget deficit as such, and at the same time at least will provide a ray of hope that this deficit will bear some fruit in the future rather than leading to ruin. The next important priority should be conversion of the military-industrial complex [VPK]. Much has already been said about this, but little has been achieved. Freeing state-owned VPK enterprises from their social infrastructure is one step; another should consist of a state investment program, in this instance based on attracting credits. Finally, as to selection of other priority sectors in industry, politicians may use the following dual criterion used by Japanese politicians in 1950's-1960's, namely, the sectors selected should have, first, the highest potential for labor productivity increase, and second, the highest income-related demand elasticity. It is interesting to note that the primary sector is excluded by both criteria even without any special research. Taking into account also a Keynesian-type depression, we can currently add another criterion--that of a high multiplicative effect. Of course, an acute need for foreign currency will force the government to pay attention to oil production and other resource sectors. Nevertheless, the role of these sectors in the government's strategic industrial policy (we are not talking here about the realities of the current Russian economy as a whole) must be limited to simply ensuring sufficient export earnings to cover the most acute state needs. If the government succeeds in implementing such an industrial strategy, in the final analysis it will also be able to achieve a change in a real market situation, that is, the processing industry will displace the primary sector in its role as Russia's main export potential. [15 Feb p 4] [Text] 4. The Banking System, Money, and Savings We have already noted several times that economic growth is needed in order to stabilize the national financial system and its currency. But there is also a very important reverse influence of financial system on growth. It will be impossible to achieve growth and structural restructuring, especially in the current Russian conditions, unless the policy in the sphere of the real economy outlined above is supplemented by adequate measures in the financial sphere. We are not talking here about a standard stabilization program. It has already failed, and I think it is now clear to everybody why. In what follows I want to use the logic presented for the first time by Schumpeter in his famous "Theory of Economic Development." His concept of economic growth was based of the notion of "innovator," one who is capable of utilizing some new combination of resources in order to produce more efficiently than the current technology of general equilibrium permits. In utilizing these new combinations, innovators earn profit, which is then offset because scores of emulators emerge, but it is offset only to finish its cycle as higher payment for "primary production factors," that is, in increased net economic wealth. However, in order to utilize these new combinations, entrepreneurs need liquid resources in order to initially offer "production factors" higher prices and lure them away from less efficient producers. The general logic of monetarist theory usually looks at the process of money creation and the functioning of the banking system at the macroeconomic, that is, aggregated level. For Schumpeter, on the other hand, the role of banks consisted mainly in their enabling a fast transfer of resources between sectors and making liquid resources available to potential innovators. In other words, banks do not merely make money. In making money, they at the same time accomplish the needed redistribution of resources in the economy. This point of view is practically completely lost in the current general logic of macroeconomic analysis, which still (following Irving Fisher) believes that "monetary inflation cannot increase the production of farms and factories, cannot speed up the movement of trains or vessels. The flow of business depends on natural resources and technical conditions, not on the amount of money" (I. Fisher. "The Purchasing Capacity of Money," 1912. p 155). There is a case, however, where this contention does not stand: When "monetary inflation" is accompanied by redistribution of money from some users to others, especially in conditions of enormous potential, in order to improve economic efficiency. This is precisely the situation that is characteristic of the Russian economy today. Commercial banks, of which there are currently about 2,000 in Russia, lend money only short-term. One cannot expect anything else of them in an economy where the annual inflation rate is measured in four-digit figures. Real interest rates rose substantially in 1993 but remain negative. At the same time, the banking system maintains high profitability, which is achieved in the following three ways: --first, many loans are issued for an extremely short term--between one and three months--and a considerably higher interest rate is applied in this type of lending; --second, interest rates on deposits are naturally lower than interest rates on loans, while the banking system has a legal monopoly of clearing transactions between enterprises. Therefore, it is quite enough to simply issue loans with a mark-up on the interest rate paid on enterprises' clearing accounts (perhaps the widespread intercompany credit--the nonpayments problem--may be partially explained by enterprises' desire to avoid this de facto taxation by the banks); --third, many major banks effectively combine ruble and dollar loans, thus raising the effective interest rate. There are known instances where enterprises in need of rubles received bank loans in which 50 percent were made up of dollars. For instance, during the second half of 1993, when the ruble exchange rate to the dollar was stable, and the interest rate on loans in rubles stood at 200 percent, this meant that the 200-percent interest rate was also applied to loans in dollars. All these means serve any goal except the one, the main one, that the banking system should serve in the current Russian economy. Therefore, the government must absolutely urgently create a system of state and private banks that will provide long-term financing. Long-term loans currently are provided by the Central Bank and are distributed mainly through the group of banks that are in fact former government banks commercialized in 1991, which makes them very political in nature and does not guarantee efficient research and monitoring. This system must be replaced by a system of state and private long-term financial institutions that would operate with government support and coordinate their activities with the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction, and other international financial institutions that wish to help Russia finance its long-term economic restructuring. Again, the know-how of the Japanese financial system in this respect could be very helpful. Western financial aid to long-term development and conversion could be channeled through these long-term loan institutions, with the compulsory participation of experts from the donor countries in the selection of projects and monitoring of their realization. Another task, which is very important if we want to have these long-term projects financed in the final analysis not by a budget deficit but from private sources, is to increase personal savings. The Savings Bank traditionally held and to a considerable extent continues to hold a monopoly in the accumulation of small personal, "individual" capital. However, the interest rate on deposits is low. If we direct the money accumulated through the Savings Bank into long-term investment loans, it will not be possible to increase these interest rates. Social savings deposits, with repayment in kind (for instance, in the form of automobiles), were tried during the last years of the Soviet Union, but what amounted to a default on the part of the state on its obligation sharply decreased confidence in them. Nevertheless, perhaps a new government should try to introduce them again, this time providing complete state guarantees against deception. The experience of Russia itself in the 1920's can perhaps be used as a means of stabilizing the currency and stimulation of savings. This experience consisted of introducing a new parallel currency completely backed up by liquid reserves, precious metals, and hard currencies. We have already mentioned that the need for a stable monetary unit is very broadly felt in the emerging market economy in Russia today. This vacuum is partially filled today by the American dollar and German mark, but it would be much more sensible to have a national currency that would be stable in international terms and fully convertible. The right to issue such currency should not be granted to any of the currently existing central banks of the former USSR, including the Bank of Russia--it should be vested with a specially created bank managed by a group of absolutely politically independent professionals. The new money should be introduced into the economy very carefully and gradually in order the preserve a fixed exchange rate between it and an individual hard currency or basket of currencies. Initial means may be drawn from the ruble stabilization fund, which is so widely discussed but is doomed to remain no more than a phantom in an environment where the ruble is used practically without limit to simply cover the current state budget deficit and Central Bank credits to provide working capital. This new money, because of its stability, will gradually but surely displace all soft currencies, probably including the current Russian ruble itself, while simultaneously easing repatriation of money from abroad. This effect was achieved in the 1920's in less than two years. 5. The Russian Federation and the CIS In conclusion we would like to dwell on the problems of the Russian Federation and the CIS. The task is to replace the chaotic and destructive disintegration of organized decentralized authority, supplemented by coordinated regulation in the spheres that must be regulated. It is clear that true systemic and structural changes must mainly and first and foremost develop from below. But the role of political leadership is to organize these changes and give them a certain direction. This includes not only economic problems but also first and foremost problems of the political organization of the state. What is currently happening in this sphere by general admission constitutes one of the main obstacles to the path of economic reform, although, as our economic analysis shows, the importance of this sphere is indeed being somewhat exaggerated. The first Soviet reformist regime of President Mikhail Gorbachev began a deep-reaching political transformation but had to leave the scene because it had never really began true economic reform. The new reformist regime of President Boris Yeltsin fell victim to another extreme. His government has not taken a single step in two years to continue the process of political transformation. As a result, the reform process has again rolled into a dead end, the attempt to get out of which resulted in bloodshed in October 1993. I have already on occasion compared the process of transforming postsocialist societies with riding a bicycle. The left pedal is political reform, the right pedal--economic. If you stop pushing, that is, apply the brake to one of the pedals, the bicycle immediately overturns. The topic of political reform is on the whole outside the scope of this article, but some political initiatives are absolutely necessary in order for the transformation process described in the preceding subsections to begin to take place. First, a much more effective decision must be made on the form of the Federation. This includes not merely separation of authority but, more important, the distribution of authority between the center and the regions. It is meaningless to resist decentralization--it is needed both politically and economically. The fact that with respect to many aspects of privatization, pricing policy, and social programs power has been delegated to local authorities is a step in the right direction, but the paradox of the current legal situation is in that too many important matters are under "joint jurisdiction." In our view, the central government should retain enough authority and levers with respect to heterogeneous Russian regions to enable it to effectively block chaotic disintegration, which in the final count will be dangerous for all the regions comprising the Russian Federation--without exception. Of course, for a certain time period the south, rich in grain, or Siberia, rich in oil, will be able to ignore the industrial centers in the Volgo-Vyatka region or the North Urals, but disarray in Arzamas-16 or Chelyabinsk-5, situated in precisely these regions, may destroy the entire country and a considerable part of Europe. The realities of Russian industry and infrastructure are such that they, much like the Russian military machine, will continue to call for a strong coordinating and controlling role of the state for many years to come. As to purely economic aspects of the transformation process, our opinion is that coordination must be carried on not only in Russia but in the entire CIS. The economies of all the newly independent states are still so much intertwined that, especially bearing in mind industry's low capacity for charge, it is much cheaper to gradually phase out the existing system of division of labor than to destroy it overnight. This simple truth is currently gaining understanding all over the territory of the former Soviet Union. Border control between former Soviet republics is practically nonexistent, and therefore it is important not to get carried away by attempts to set up customs controls at borders but instead to set up a Customs Union, using the borders of the former Soviet Union that are well-equipped for that purpose. Economic ties between enterprises situated in different newly independent states should not be subjected to any regulation or restrictions; the same goes for movement of goods, labor, and capital. A common currency area is in the interests of all the republics, including Russia. How to form this area, however, is a delicate problem. The economic potential of the Russian Federation is so overwhelmingly great that it will still de facto play a leading role in any multilateral agreement, but if other newly independent states begin to suspect foul play or encounter direct diktat on the part of the Russian Government, as occurred in some recent proposals regarding the ruble zone, the problems of the common currency will be sharply politicized and will become practically unresolvable. In addition, it is completely unclear, no matter from which angle we look at it, why it is that the Russian Government and its Central Bank--which allowed inflation to reach 2,600 percent the year before last and 1,000 percent last year--should be entrusted with the task of maintaining the value of the common currency. In this respect our proposals for the introduction of a new convertible currency controlled by an Independent Reserve Bank and a Banking Union, for instance, may offer one way to avoid these difficulties. A special bank for mutual clearing between CIS countries also may be set up on the basis of Western credits convertible into this new currency. Simplifying clearing procedures between CIS countries could become an important step on the path to economic revival. In 1991 we proposed and prepared the Economic Union Treaty, which was signed in October by the heads of 10 republics-newly independent states. At the beginning of December 1991 the leaders of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus met in Minsk and decided to take another road. They were so overcome by enthusiasm on the subject of the new agreement they had just happened to think of that they even without hesitation renounced their signatures on the previous agreement. Actually, this was only one of this kind of action in a chain of endless reneging on previous promises and political statements. Unfortunately, all this did not start then and did not end there. The very course of history over the past two years has proven that we were right to insist on an economic union. Now those same politicians are beginning to speak differently. It is becoming obvious even to them that it is impossible to implement an effective reform policy in countries without borders and customs, without a currency and financial system, without law and order, with ties disrupted both internally and between sectors; on top of this now dozens of self-proclaimed regional sovereignties, presidents of small regions, and ethnic and civil conflicts in many parts of what was recently one country and remains to a considerable extent a whole entity as a territory of habitation. An economic treaty between the republics of the former USSR was signed in September 1993 for the second time, two years later. It is clear that without it, reforms cannot succeed. Will the current politicians want it to work? I do not know; I am not sure. * * * Both we and our opponents of substance support liberalization. But there are two different kinds of liberalization. Vulgar liberalization has set free supermonopolistic monsters and let go of traditions, relations, systems, and the ties of the command economy. What we want is for society to be free of such an economy. How the history of our country will look in the 21st century depends to a great extent on whether we give a free hand to the mafiosi monster of the totalitarian economy or whether we are able to overpower it this time. This is the angle from which we view the processes currently underway and the criterion by which we measure our political decisions.
