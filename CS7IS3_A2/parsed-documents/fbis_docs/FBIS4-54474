The paper says that U.S. President Bill Clinton was informed about that by the CIA branch in Frankfurt in mid-April. The CIA, the FBI and the German Military Intelligence have launched a thorough investigation into the matter after it was established that a container with 4,158 bags of blood plasma suspected of being infected with the AIDS virus had been sent to Bosnian Moslem fighters. The red alert was given when the wounded Moslem soldiers from central Bosnia, 243 of whom were later found to have been contaminated with the HIV virus, started arriving to a military hospital in Bad Told 80 km from Munich. Germany, which has so far whole-heartedly supported Bosnian Moslems, now insists that the United States immediately remove from its territory "the deadly cargo." The Turks, who had been helping their Moslem brethren in Bosnia in both troops and weapons, say it is out of the question that some of those who have tested positive for HIV be treated in Turkish hospitals. Iran, which has so far vowed to send mujaheddin to kill all Serbs "in the name of Allah," has also flatly rejected to help. Although all German papers are bound to know about the deadly U.S. airdrops to Bosnian Moslems, they are keeping their mouths shut probably because no matter how much they would like it they cannot blame the Serbs for the terrible mistake of others, says POLITIKA EKSPRES in conclusion.
