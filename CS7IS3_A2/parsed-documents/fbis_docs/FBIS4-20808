Opposition members in the Rajya Sabha today vociferously opposed the Government's proposal to sign the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) and urged it to be cautious of the U.S. designs to intimidate through Super 301 developing countries like India for their refusal to toe the American line. Raising the issue during zero hour, Mr. Gurudas Das Gupta (CPI) (Communist Party of India) referred to reports of U.S. arm twisting with Japan to set right its huge trade imbalance and wondered if Japan could be meted out such treatment, would a country like India be spared. Accusing the Government of maintaining a studied silence on such a serious issue, Mr. Gupta urged it to give a statement on the present position. Be Alert, Government Urged The issue was widely supported by all Opposition members who wanted the Union Government to be alert against any move by America to invoke the Super 301 Trade Act. Mr. Gupta wanted to know the sanctity of the Dunkel draft if the U.S. was allowed to indulge in armtwisting and asked why India was rushing to sign the GATT. Mr. Das Gupta said Japan was one of the U.S.'s biggest trade partners and the U.S. could take retaliatory action after identifying what constituted unfair trade practice, although it could not impose any trade sanctions under the provisions of Super 301. Debate Sought Mr. I.K. Gujral (JD) (Janata Dal) demanded the scrapping of Super 301 and said the U.S. stand was nothing short of "economic bullying." He pleaded for an exhaustive debate on the GATT proposals before India became a signatory to the Treaty. Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi (BJP) (Bharatiya Janata Party) deplored the U.S. attitude of imposing economic sanctions against Japan. "If India is not careful, the U.S. will corner us on Kashmir or force us to sign the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) and even dictate our missile technology programme," he said. Dr. Ashok Mitra (CPM) (Communist Party of India-Marxist) and Mr. Kamal Morarka (SJP) demanded an explanation from the Commerce Minister as a response to the concern of the House and demanded that India should not compromise its sovereignty. Using Super 301 as Weapon Mr. Jagesh Desai (Cong-I) said that because of India's firm position on issues like Kashmir, the U.S. could be tempted to use Super 301 as a weapon and India should be on the guard. He maintained that the U.S. could be using Super 301 against Japan inview of the huge trade deficit. In response to persistent demand from members for a statement on the issue, the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs, Dr. Abrar Ahmed, told the House that a special discussion on GATT was scheduled on March 9 and 10.
