According to the sources, Tokyo has arrived at a conclusion about the need to give up implementing the earlier announced humanitarian aid programmes, worth a total of 500 million U.S. dollars, considering the internal political situation in Russia. Tokyo believes that the implementation of humanitarian aid programmes now may only be detrimental to the administration of President Boris Yeltsin, because, in the light of mounting nationalist and great-power sentiments in Russia, the Russian Government has been increasingly criticised for accepting foreign humanitarian aid. Still, Tokyo intends to carry out all the other programmes for assistance to Russia in keeping with its commitments but will also monitor the effectiveness of their realisation. Japanese Foreign Ministry sources emphasise that it is planned to attach paramount importance, first of all, to those programmes which actually promote radical economic reforms and help moscow take measures necessary to build a market economy. Tokyo came to a conclusion about the need for such an approach in view of the formation of a new Russian Government which plans to introduce changes to the previously pursued economic policy, and with due regard for the results of the December elections to Russia's new parliament. The Japanese Government intends to call on other western countries to reconsider their programme for assistance to Moscow so that they would stimulate Russia's headway along the road of reforms to a greater extent.
