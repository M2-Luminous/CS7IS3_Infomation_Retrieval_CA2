FBIS4-11910 "drnes064_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-064 Daily Report 1 Apr 1994 SYRIA Al-Shar' on Arab Boycott, Disarmament, Arab Situation Al-Shar' on Arab Boycott, Disarmament, Arab Situation NC0104204494 Cairo ESC Television in Arabic 1620 GMT 1 Apr 94 NC0104204494 Cairo ESC Television Arabic BFN [Interview with Foreign Minister Faruq al-Shar' by Safa' Hijazi in Cairo; date not given; from the "Arabs' Home" program--recorded] [Text] [Hijazi] Mr. Faruq al-Shar', Syrian foreign minister, the Arab League Council's 101st session had the topic of amending the Arab League Charter on its agenda. Some say that the Arab situation does not allow this amendment now. When will the Arab situation allow it? [Al-Shar'] We in Syria adhere to and insist on rectifying the Arab situation. We always say, and I said it in front of the Arab ministers, that the Arab situation is not in its best shape, with Arab countries facing serious problems--Iraq, Algeria, Somalia, southern Sudan. Even Yemeni unity is threatened with collapse, God forbid, and there is the possibility of a civil war in Yemen if the unity falters. All this prompts us to work seriously and earnestly to rectify the Arab situation and create the right atmosphere for better Arab relations. This is our objective, anyway, and we must continue to work to realize it. The Gulf war made things difficult, but we in Syria believe that we should not consider the Gulf crisis the end of the world. True, we must study all the negative consequences of the Gulf war and address them in a positive and constructive spirit with a view toward remedying the Arab situation and serving common Arab interests. [Hijazi] Do you think there is an international collusion to disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's arsenal? What about the elimination of the mass destruction weapons from the Middle East? This was also a topic on the session's agenda. [Al-Shar'] There are international inclinations, with Israel behind them, to disarm the Arabs and retain Israel's formidable arsenal of conventional and nonconventional weapons. You know that Israel possesses and manufactures all kinds of mass destruction weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological. It has so far refused to subject its nuclear weapons to international supervision and to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and the safeguards agreement. Therefore, we believe that 1995 will see a review of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and this gives the Arabs a chance to adopt a unified position regarding the renewal of the treaty on the condition that Israel join it. The Arabs must take a position regarding the renewal of the treaty if Israel refuses to join it. [Hijazi] The Arab boycott of Israel was also on the agenda. What happened? [Al-Shar'] We held contacts with many Arab foreign ministers and sensed a unified and firm Arab position; namely, that the boycott should continue until its causes--the state of war between the Arabs and Israel and Israel's occupation of Arab territory--are removed. As long as these causes remain, the boycott must be maintained. This is a peaceful act and a legitimate right of self defense against aggression and occupation. It is strange that we, the Arabs, are asked and pressured to lift the boycott, which is a legitimate act of self defense, when no pressure is applied on Israel to end its illegitimate occupation of the Arab lands. This is not a topic for discussion; it was not discussed in the meetings. But there was an item on the agenda concerning a report from the main Arab Boycott Bureau in Damascus; this is an annual report on the activity of the bureau and how to strengthen the boycott by closing the gaps that may appear from time to time. The aim was not to discuss lifting the boycott. So far, this item has not been on the agenda with the purpose of lifting the boycott. There was virtual Arab unanimity not to discuss the subject and to maintain the boycott.
