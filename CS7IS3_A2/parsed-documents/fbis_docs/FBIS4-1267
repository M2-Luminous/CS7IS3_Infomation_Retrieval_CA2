FBIS4-1267 "drafr080_e_94004" FBIS-AFR-94-080 Daily Report 22 Apr 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia ULIMO Leader Disputes Selection of Cabinet Members ULIMO Leader Disputes Selection of Cabinet Members AB2204201194 London BBC World Service in English 1705 GMT 22 Apr 94 AB2204201194 London BBC World Service English BFN [From the "Focus on Africa" program] [Text] Alhaji Koromah is not only unhappy with the fighting going on around the Po River bridge, he has also thrown a spanner in the works of the transitional government, after euphoria greeted Wednesday's [20 April] announcement that a cabinet had been agreed. First, Charles Taylor quibbled, but then backtracked. Now, Alhaji Koromah says he does not go along with the selection of ministers. Robin White asked Alhaji Koromah what his problem was: [Begin recording] [Koromah] According to the Cotonou Agreement, it is the three signatories to the Cotonou Agreement -- NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia], ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia], and the erstwhile IGNU [Interim Government of National Unity] who are to decide on the allocation of ministries. And the last time in Cotonou, the ministries were divided. ULIMO got Defense Ministry and Finance Ministry. Now, we hear on the air that Defense Ministry has been given to the interim government. This is not only unacceptable, it is also totally illegal. So, as far as ULIMO is concerned, that particular act is null and void and it will never be accepted. Defense Ministry goes to ULIMO. [White] So, what are you going to do about it? [Koromah] We have several options. We are just making it clear. Council of State has not any power to distribute any ministries. So, if it is going to live by its creator, which is the Cotonou Accord, it will not do anything that is illegal. So, we have a number of actions that are both drastic and nondrastic. So, we want to start off by bringing it to their attention that that action there is no action and it will not be accepted. [White] Couldn't somebody have agreed to this on your behalf? [Koromah] No, I communicated last night and this morning with everybody: the acting chairman, General Isaac Quawah; the members of the executive council, I talked by radio to top members, the field commander, General (Dumbuyah); and the battalion commander talked to me, (Jango Jaba); and nobody seems to be aware of this. [White] Now, there seems to be trouble again within your organization with forces supporting Roosevelt Johnson fighting around the Po River bridge again. Now, you met Roosevelt Johnson in Sierra Leone and it had been reported that you had sorted out your problems, so what is going on? [Koromah] Well, I don't think it is Roosevelt Johnson's forces because Johnson kissed the Bible in front of Captain Strasser and his deputy chairman, Bio, and took an oath and he signed a document so the group of people who attack our positions around the Po River are just rebels and we will treat them as rebels. As a matter of fact, according to my Zebra Battalion commander, (Jango Jaba), that particular group attacked our positions and positions of ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group]. As you know, ECOMOG is deployed in our territory and they killed at least two ECOMOG soldiers. Our forces killed about 47 of their men, and about 50 of those rebels were arrested by ECOMOG. They are presently being interrogated at ECOMOG base and the rest of them ran off. [White] Where is Roosevelt Johnson now? [Koromah] Roosevelt Johnson is... [pauses] he should be in Monrovia, and the last time I was in Monrovia, I had invited him and we had set up a committee that was discussing across the line and trying to get our pieces together and sort things out. So, it was completely shocking for me to have heard that another group of attackers had come, but I don't want to believe it is Johnson because I don't believe he is a pagan to go and kiss the Bible and get involved in rebel activity... [White, interrupting] It sounds to me that you need to go back to Liberia yourself and sort out these problems. [Koroma] Yes, I am on my way. For security reasons I am not going to tell you the date. [White] Why? Who might kill you? [Koromah] It is not a question of who might want to kill me. I mean all kinds of people want to kill me. [end recording]
