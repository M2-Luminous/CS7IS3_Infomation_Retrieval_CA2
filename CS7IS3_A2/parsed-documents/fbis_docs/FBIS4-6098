Visits by Egyptian President Muhammad Mubarak and Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai have either been canceled or postponed, while discussions by the political authorities on how to deal with the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development remain suspended. The government has also been unable to make important decisions on improving relations with the United States, particularly on the Japan-U.S. framework talks. The Foreign Ministry is beginning to be irritated. The Ministry is most distressed with the inadequacy of the crisis management system concerning the DPRK nuclear issue. While the Ministry has been holding regular working-level liaison meetings with the Defense Agency, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and other ministries and agencies concerned to gather information and to analyze the situation, ministerial level discussions, which would be necessary to deal with an emergency, remain insufficient due to the prolonged political turmoil. The Foreign Ministry has done a simulation of probable developments in terms of: 1) rescue of Japanese abroad; 2) refugee relief; 3) restriction in personnel exchanges, remittances and trade; and 4) assistance to the United States, in the event the UN Security Council decides to impose economic sanctions on the DPRK. However, a senior Foreign Ministry official says, "No matter how much we discuss these issues, if the range of policy measures a political decision would allow remains unclear, what we can do is limited." The Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned that a conflict may surface among the ruling parties in terms of the maintenance of secrecy, and assistance to the United States in the event of an emergency due to the presence of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the coalition. A top ministry official says, "In the event of the misfortune of a war breaking out, how far can Japan deal with the situation on its own? If we behave like we did during the Gulf war, Japan-U.S. relations will further deteriorate." While the ruling coalition parties basically agreed on 16 April on the policy of "abiding by the United Nations's decision," some Foreign Ministry officials point out that this is still "ambiguous because if, for instance, the Security Council fails to pass a resolution because of a Chinese veto, and a decision to impose sanctions in the form of multinational forces is made, our response remains unclear," (according to a senior Foreign Ministry official). The cancellation of several visits by foreign VIP's also undermines Japan's image abroad. President Mubarak's visit (18 to 21 April) is supposed to be an important diplomatic event in that it will demonstrate Japan's vital role in the reconstruction of the occupied territories after the historical reconciliation between Israel and the PLO. On the other hand, although Prime Minister Chuan's visit (22 to 27 April) has been postponed purportedly under a request from Thailand, this will create a bad precedent in diplomatic protocol because he has been invited as an official guest. There has also been issues in official development assistance (ODA) that require a political decision. The United States has complained that yen loan to Iran, which was resumed in 1993, "may constitute official recognition of a nation exporting terrorism." Aid to Iran was resumed in May 1993, after an interval of 17 years, and a loan of 38 billion yen as the first phase of an aid program has already been agreed upon. Now, the second installment of the financial aid is being questioned. This problem has to do with a high-level political decision on the position of the Middle East, particularly Iran, in Japan's overall diplomatic strategy. The political vacuum has also had its adverse effects on this issue.
