The session was chaired by the speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase. The presidium included Deputy Prime minister of the Yugoslav Federal Government Nikola Sainovic, Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan Ljubijankic, Croatia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo Sanader, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, Russian Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mitiukov [name as received], and Romania's Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who all presented their countries' points of view on the situation in former Yugoslavia. They pointed out at the impact the Bosnian conflict is having on the Balkans and at some of the ways that could help settle the crisis. The Yugoslav Federation's viewpoint was that the policy of pressure, ultimatum, sanctions and punishment for Serbia and Montenegro was not only inefficient and inhuman, but even counterproductive, with negative effects both on the Balkans and on Europe. "There is no alternative to achieve peace, outside negotiations, compromise and equal treatment for all the conflicting parties." Nikola Saimovic said, and demanded the immediate cease of hostilities on the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as the only chance to reach a compromise for peace. Bosnia's representative said his country wanted peace, but would never accept the dictate. He requested Europe to wake up and commit itself more firmly in the crisis so as to protect Bosnia against "the imperial ambitions of great Serbia." Recalling the recent signing in Washington of a document for the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim confederation, Croatia's representatives said that this enabled the settlement of a stable peace between Bosnia and Croatia, and expressed his country's readiness to normalize relations with the Yugoslav side. Ivo Sanader pleaded for a new concept in the Balkans: "Scandinavisation", as symbol of stability. Albania's foreign minister demanded that reprisals against Albanians in the Kosovo region be stopped and the province placed under international guarantees "to avoid having a new Bosnia-Herzegovina." Russian Federation envoy Mitiukov reiterated his country's option for a negotiated settlement of the Yugoslav issue, and proposed an international conference be called for the purpose. Concluding the debates, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu stressed Romania's major interest that the Yugoslav conflict were solved peacefully, and demonstrated the baleful consequences the embargo against Yugoslavia has had on the Romanian economy, which reports losses of some seven billion dollars.
