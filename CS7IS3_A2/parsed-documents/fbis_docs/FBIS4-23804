Earlier, we spoke to the mineral and energy affairs minister, Pik Botha, who assured us that the government has done everything in its power to avoid the inevitable. [Begin recording] [Botha] Actually, the increase should have been 14 cents per liter, but because of the government's sensitivity for the consumer and the problem this will cause, we for weeks worked with the National Economic Forum and the Liquid Industry Fuels Task Force to achieve this. I am very sorry this is the case, but it's like the weather--you have no control over it. I trust that our public will understand this. [Dawes] Some of the biggest fuel users or petrol users are the taxi operators. Is government promoting the use of diesel motor power by taxi operators to minimize fuel usage? [Botha] Well, this matter, together with a lot of the fundamental issues surrounding the fuel industry in this country, will now be thoroughly investigated and examined by the government in conjunction with and with the assistance of the National Economic Forum and the Liquid Fuels Industry Task Force, and I trust that within weeks we will come up, hopefully, with a new mechanism for determining the petrol price. Secondly, to look at precisely, aspects like the one you mentioned. I am not this morning in a position offhand to say whether that is feasible, but certainly we are sympathetic--more than sympathetic to the problems of the taxi industry. They are carrying almost half, if not more than half, of all passengers in this country. They are the single largest user and consumer of petrol, and anything that can alleviate their position we will support. [Dawes] Mr. Botha, the Automobile Association is in favor of deregulation of the whole system. How do you feel about this? [Botha] I am open-minded. I am open-minded, and I am prepared to recommend any system that will...that will make petrol less expensive for our people, for our consumers, but then it must be thoroughly investigated so that it is not a temporary...not a temporary, interim reduction that is brought about, but that, in the long term, the interest of all the parties involved are served. There are 28,000 pump attendants spread out through this country. I want to know: Will they lose their jobs? If there is what they call, you know, vertical integration. I want to know: What about the small operator, far away from the major urban areas? Will he survive? We need small businesses. Small businesses are the entities that employ people and resolve your employment problem, unemployment problems, so it is a complicated issue but of course we are sympathetic to any suggestion that takes into account a balance of interest.
