The sources said Japan will likely resume such aid by the end of March, while continuing its suspension of new official loans to Myanmar in light of the continued house detention of opposition leader Aung Sang Suu Kyi. One source said Japan's grant assistance would not go to the Myanmar Government, but for projects being implemented at the grass- roots level by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The sources said the Japanese Government has already notified the United States of its intentions. Washington has strongly criticized the Myanmar junta over alleged human rights violations. A number of requests have already been received from NGOs operating in Myanmar for project funding, the sources said. Each project approved will likely be supported to the tune of several millions of yen, they said. Japan considered a possible resumption of official loans in January, when Myanmar's national convention to debate a new constitution was resumed, the sources said. The idea was dropped, however, when it became clear there remained no sign that Aung San Suu Kyi would be released, they said.
