For example, Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said, "The United States intends to force Japan to make compromises at the framework talks by hinting at the possibility that Japan may become a target of sanctions under the Super 301 provision." Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives [Keizai Doyukai], said, "Since it has six months to specify its trade partners who will be the targets of the sanctions, the United States is expecting some progress to be made at the bilateral framework talks during this period." Both leaders believe it is less than likely that the Super 301 provision will actually be applied against Japan. However, Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Associations [Nikkeiren], said, "We should make all possible efforts to avoid the worst-case scenario." As for intensifying trade frictions between Japan and the United States, Nagano is particularly concerned about the possibility that these might have a negative impact on "the Japanese economy, which has showed some signs of a recovery."
