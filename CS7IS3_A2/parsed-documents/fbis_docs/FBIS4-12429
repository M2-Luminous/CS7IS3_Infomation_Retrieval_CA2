The meeting was attended by a number of ministers. Following the meeting, the government's official spokesman held a news conference in which he explained the issues on the agenda of today's meeting. Here now follows the details of this news conference: [Begin unidentified official spokesman recording] In the name of God, the compassionate, and the merciful. The Council of Ministers held a meeting today under the chairmanship of Mr. Liamine Zeroual, head of state. [passage omitted] On the national economy level, the head of state submitted a report on the content of the letter of intent to the IMF that the council adopted. It will be sent to the IMF director general today. To this effect, the national economy minister submitted a report on the situation of the national economy, especially the issue of the management of foreign debts. Following this report, it became clear that the method that has been adopted to manage the foreign debt up until now was not suitable, because it did not help the country break the vicious circle that our national development was suffering from despite all the debt repayments operations undertaken by us in an organized way. In addition to this, the current reduction of oil prices and the international oil markets situation forced us into a situation that gave the impression that we did not repay our debts; this is because the income from our exports during the year 1994 will not exceed more than $8 billion, whereas the debt repayments will reach $9.3 billion. In conclusion, the possibility of our country securing new loans from the international market has become difficult because our traditional creditors insist on linking link their financial cooperation with us with the conclusion of an agreement between our country and the IMF. We have been working for the preparation of such an agreement with the IMF. Additionally, we have begun preparing for negotiations that we will have with Paris Club. In these negotiations we have adopted two fundamental principles: To protect, as far as possible, the scope of movement regarding the economic policy of our country; to work, in particular, toward the preservation of the maximum abilities to manage the social repercussions caused by the reforms of the structural program, and make it acceptable to our workers. To this end, the Council of Ministers adopted a number of projects during today's meeting. During his interventions at the council's meeting, the head of state stressed the following directives: To work toward the consolidation of the Maghreban march, which for Algeria represents a strategic choice. To implement the resolutions of the Algerian-Tunisian summit and to promote and bolster relations between the two countries. At the economic level, he stressed the need to use seriousness and determination to manage and implement the program of restructuring and bolstering the national economy. To work for a fair distribution of the burden caused by the economic restructuring operation among all social strata. The head of state also underlined the priority enjoyed by the following sectors: The hydrocarbons sector which should not suffer from any delay regarding investment and prospecting operations; the housing sector that represents a pressing social priority and warrants fundamental reforms and great attention. The farming sector: To better use fertile land, and to embark on reforming new land. The sector of small and medium enterprises: As it represent the main source for investments and the creation of new jobs opportunities. In the field of external trade and distribution, the head of state stressed the need to cleanse this sector and to find an immediate solution to the phenomenon of the shortage of basic commodities in the markets, and to put a decisive end to the smuggling operations via our borders that harm the resources of the national economy. In parallel with this program, and in order to achieve its results, the head of state stressed the need to continue and boost the structural reforms of the national economy and to work for the liberation of all national initiatives. I thank you. [end recording]
