Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China in 1975, Thailand has recognized only the Beijing government, has adhered to the joint statement signed during the establishment of diplomatic relations, and has upheld the one-China policy. He said that Thai-Chinese relations date back to time immemorial. The long-standing relations are based on similar traditions and religions. Relations between the two countries will develop naturally despite the absence of any motivating force. The peoples of the two countries will benefit under the principle of mutual reliance and mutual assistance. Sawanit, who will leave for Beijing on 17 February to assume his post, said that he will continue to push for the development of bilateral relations during his tenure. In particular, he will follow Prime Minister Chuan Likphai's policy of stressing bilateral trade and investment. Although Sawanit was the first secretary of the Thai Embassy in Beijing from 1978 to 1981 and understands some Mandarin and has knowledge about China to a certain extent, he considers his duty a challenge because of the changes there. Businessmen and investors from all countries are paying attention to the huge Chinese market of 1.2 billion people. They want to do business and invest there, and Thailand must make efforts in this regard. He also wants to see the realization of the quadrangle economic development plan among Thailand, China, Laos, and Burma. Thailand has been working hard for this plan. It will soon hold a meeting for businessmen from the four countries to discuss details of the plan and to make friendly contacts. [passage omitted] Sawanit said that he wants to promote exchanges of visits between the leaders of Thailand and China because the two countries maintain good relations. Prime Minister Chuan has visited China, and Thailand is ready to welcome Chinese leaders to the country. He said that Thailand and Taiwan maintain only labor relations. There is no development of relations in other fields. Thailand now has about 100,000 laborers in Taiwan whose presence also benefits that country. Sawanit also told reporters that Thailand will set up a consulate general in Kunming, China's southwestern Province of Yunnan, this fiscal year. He stressed that there are no current problems in Thai-Chinese relations, which are proceeding in all fields.
