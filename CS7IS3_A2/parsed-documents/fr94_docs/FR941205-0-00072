FR941205-0-00072 FR941205-0-00021 II. Analysis of State Submittal On November 12, 1993, as supplemented on January 14, 1994, the Commonwealth of Virginia submitted an operating permits program to satisfy the requirements of the CAA and 40 CFR part 70. EPA reviewed the program against the criteria for approval and disapproval in section 502 of the CAA and the part 70 regulations. EPA determined, as fully described in the notice of proposed disapproval of Virginia's program (see 59 FR 31183 (June 17, 1994)) and the Technical Support Document for this action, that the Commonwealth's operating permits program does not substantially meet the requirements of the CAA or part 70. In summary, the deficiencies of the Commonwealth's program which require disapproval are: 1. Inadequate provisions, pursuant to section 502(b)(6) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x) and 70.7(h), for public participation in the permit process and the opportunity for judicial review in State court. Specifically, the Commonwealth lacks statutory authority for judicial review of final permit decisions that meets the CAA's minimum threshold for judicial standing. 2. Lack of authority, pursuant to section 505(b)(3) of the CAA and 40 CFR 70.8(e), to prevent the default issuance of permits by Commonwealth. 3. The regulations to implement the program expired on June 28, 1994 and have not been re-promulgated. 4. The Commonwealth's operating permits program does not require issuance of permits to the proper universe of sources required by 40 CFR part 70. 5. The program does not contain regulations meeting the requirements of 40 CFR part 70 to ensure issuance of permits that contain all applicable Federal requirements and to correctly delineate provisions only enforceable by the Commonwealth. Pursuant to section 502(d)(1) of the CAA, the Commonwealth of Virginia must correct these deficiencies, as well as those defined in the Technical Support Document by June 7, 1995, in order to receive approval of its operating permits program from EPA. III. Response to Public Comments EPA received 32 letters of comment in response to the proposed disapproval of Virginia's operating permits program submittal. As mentioned in the June 17, 1994 notice of proposed disapproval, EPA received a petition from the Environmental Defense Fund, dated December 23, 1993, to disapprove Virginia's operating permits program. That petition is considered in this action. EPA received a total of 26 comment letters supporting the notice of proposed disapproval of Virginia's program. EPA received adverse comment letters from the Virginia Manufacturers Association, Virginia Aggregates Association, Northeast Maryland Waste Disposal Authority, AES, Ogden Martin Systems of Montgomery, Inc., Ogden Martin Systems of Fairfax, Inc., Ogden Martin Systems of Lancaster, Inc., and Ogden Martin Systems of Alexandria/Arlington, Inc. The Attorney General of Virginia submitted specific comments on the judicial standing issue. Additionally, the Commonwealth of Virginia Department of Environmental Quality submitted a separate letter which describes how it intends to address the deficiencies as outlined in the notice of proposed disapproval and the accompanying Technical Support Document, with the notable exception of the judicial standing issues. Finally, one letter of comment was received recommending specific changes to Virginia's operating permits program. The following is in response to comments which do not directly support EPA's disapproval action. Comment: The Commonwealth of Virginia's judicial review statute is legally sufficient to satisfy the requirements of title V and 40 CFR part 70. EPA Response: EPA proposed disapproval of Virginia's program because it, in part, fails to meet the minimum requirements for standing for judicial review as required by section 502(b)(6) of the Act and 40 CFR 70.4(b)(3)(x). Section 502(b)(6) states that every permit program must provide the applicant and ``any person who participated in the public comment process'' with the opportunity for judicial review of the final permit action in State court. The same opportunity must also be afforded to any other person who could obtain judicial review of the action under any applicable State law. The Commonwealth and the other contesting commenters assert that a reading of the language of section 502(b)(6) and the legislative history indicates that Congress intended that States be given discretion to determine who should be allowed to obtain judicial review of actions under a State's title V program. EPA does not agree with this interpretation of section 502's judicial review provision. EPA believes that for a State title V operating permits program to be approved by EPA, that program must provide access to judicial review to any party who participated in the public comment process and who at a minimum meets the threshold standing requirements of Article III of the U.S. Constitution. This interpretation is consistent with the language, structure, and legislative history of the Act which provides affected members of the public an opportunity for judicial review of permit actions to ensure an adequate and meaningful opportunity for public participation in the permit process. The Senate managers of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 stated that:
