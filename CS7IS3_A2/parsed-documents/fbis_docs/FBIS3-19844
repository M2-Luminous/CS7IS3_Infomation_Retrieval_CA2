Granic was in Stockholm for one-day talks with his Swedish counterpart, Margaretha af Ugglas. "Right now the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and Russia are working for peace in the former Yugoslavia. Neither the place nor the time are decided upon yet, but in two weeks we will know how our negotiations with Serbia will begin," Granic said. The situation in Bosnia is improving, the foreign minister underlined. Bosnian Moslems and Croats are beginning to overcome their differences, and aid convoys are being allowed to pass without hindrance, he pointed out. "It is not in our interests for Bosnian Croats to flee to Sweden any more. Instead, they ought to stay home. That is the opinion of the Croat and Bosnian Croat leaders," Granic said. On Monday, talks between Croatia and the Serb separatists in Croatian Krajina began at the Russian Embassy in Zagreb. "When it comes to an agreement, Croatia is willing to guarantee Serbs that they will be able to run their own schools, radio and so on," Granic said.
