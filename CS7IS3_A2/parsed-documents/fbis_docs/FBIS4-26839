[sentence as received] The report by the central bank revealed that there were several reasons to affect the price level for this year. [sentence as received] First, the exchange rate for the renminbi was unified effective on January 1 in the restructuring of the foreign exchange system. As the gap between the market exchange rate and the official exchange rate was rather great in the course of the financial reform, prices for imported commodities rose to some extent resulting from a rising comprehensive exchange price on average following the unification of the exchange rate for the renminbi. Second, during the taxation reform, the general tax revenue increased to a certain extent following the curbing of an unauthorized practice in which localities made their own decision to carry out tax reduction and exemption. As the taxation restructuring was not fully understood by basic units which resulted in inevitable mistakes, some price setting entities capitalized the value added tax to raise commodity price which directly led to a price hike. [paragraph as received] Third, measures including a proposed price rise in crude oil will be adopted within the year. A large-scale price fluctuation for some corresponding commodities will appear around the time when such measures are about to be implemented. Fourth, rising prices for grains resulted in a climb of prices for non-staple food, processed food products and poultry eggs. The central government has recently made clear that it was determined to stabilize the economy and to lower the inflation rate. The report said that such practice by the central authorities was very important because it had influence on views held by enterprises, local governments and individuals on the economic development as well as on the inflation rate for this year. [sentence as received] The report also elaborated on the upholding of high interest rate, strict restrictions on issuance of currency and the supply of credit by the central bank for the first half of this year. [sentence as received] Effects from such macro-economic regulation will appear gradually which will in turn make the inflation rate go downwards during the year. The report, which will be issued late this month, therefore expected that the inflation rate tended to go lower generally during the year but there would be apparent fluctuation to some extent which might see a comprehensive relatively high inflation rate on average for the entire year.
