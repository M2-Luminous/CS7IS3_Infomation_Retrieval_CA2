Borisov; place and date not given: "One Must Be Pragmatic"] [Excerpts] Fate and, to be more exact, a short line in his life record -- 22 (!) years ago Juris Bojars worked in the KGB -- have willed that this well-known Latvian lawyer was deprived of the possibility to stand for the Saeima [parliament] elections. Finding himself outside the parliament, however, Bojars did not remain outside big politics. My interlocutor is not only chairman of the Latvian Democratic Labor Party [LDDP], but also director of the Latvian Institute of International Relations. [passage omitted] [Borisov] I address my next question to you as a specialist in international relations. It is common knowledge that recently the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution on the violations of human rights in Latvia.... [Bojars] The resolution does not mention human rights violations. It deals with the problems of these rights. There is not a single state that would not have similar problems. [Borisov]One of the reasons why Latvia did not join the European Council was the delay in adopting the law on citizenship. Is the approval of this law in a national referendum a correct move? [Bojars] Such a decision has not yet been adopted. Only [Prime Minister] V. Birkavs has expressed some considerations about this issue. I think that this option does not run counter to the principles of democracy. However, my personal opinion is that in such a case we must submit the entire package rather than just one draft law for public approval. People must have a chance to choose. Russia's experience has demonstrated that if they have one draft constitution they may either accept or reject it. The people think: How can we live without a constitution? They approve of it as a result, without either discussing or reading it. The same will happen in our country because the majority of the population does not have the possibility or the desire to read this document. [Borisov]As there is a dilemma in foreign policy whether to lean toward the East or the West, what would you advise? [Bojars] To be pragmatic and do what is necessary. Regarding current tendencies.... Yeltsin is also accused of his love for the West. This is in fashion now. Since we were so firmly tied to the East, there is nothing surprising in our current yearning for the West. [Borisov] Speaking of security, is there any sense in hurrying to be under NATO's wing? [Bojars] Under the current circumstances, it is very difficult for Latvia to defend itself on its own. One can understand our officials who have found the only option for action -- to search for protection in NATO, although Russia does not like such a course of events. In such a case, Russia could behave in a natural and wise manner -- not to disseminate threats about turning Latvia into its province, but to conclude an agreement with us on mutual security and to provide guarantees. Certainly, anyone may tell you that before the war Latvia and the USSR had about seven such agreements, all of which were violated. So, where are the guarantees that someone like Zhirinovskiy will not do the same after assuming power? Given NATO's strength, relations with this bloc may be one of the possible replies. [Borisov]You were very critical of Godmanis' government once. Have you preserved the same attitude toward Birkavs' cabinet? [Bojars] My answer is as follows. The current circle of authorities does not differ greatly from the former one. I must admit, however, that the policies of the current government are less chaotic, while Godmanis was a very messy person. Birkavs is much more reserved. Moreover, he is a lawyer and he is more accustomed to some order and a system, which is also positive. Godmanis was like someone from the Popular Front, although he did not found this organization. I would say frankly that he simply stuck to the Popular Front. He took advantage of this situation and resorted to populist ideas that are not exploited by the current cabinet. The latter is a truly right-wing organization devoted to conservative ideals. The government moves concerning pensioners do not indicate any social trend in the current cabinet of ministers or "Latvia's Way." Therefore, my attitude toward this government is critical and reserved. [Borisov]The LDDP lost the elections. Why? [Bojars] Not only we but all left-wing parties suffered a defeat. This is quite natural. The Socialist International has established a certain regularity -- in postcommunist societies the leftist parties usually lose the first elections, while in the second elections the picture changes considerably. The same is typical of Russia. True, there are no strong noncommunist leftist parties there. Thus, we have to deal with a historical regularity. Thorough reforms are in store for our party in the beginning of next year. We are bringing them in line with the best traditions of European social democracy. [Borisov]Thank you for the interview.
