The much publicised initiative to seek international censure of human rights abuses in the Indian held Kashmir has been for the second time in quick succession held back at the eleventh hour. First it was the Indian offer of talks on Kashmir, and now the intervention of 16 countries, including our close allies Iran and China that has apparently deterred Islamabad from going whole hog in pursuit of its number one agenda in foreign relations. Ironically, the prime minister had only a few days ago asserted in categorical terms that come what may, Pakistan will go ahead with its campaign for international recognition of the Kashmir cause, and the 'game of numbers' will not stand in its way. Whether it was an outright foreign policy debacle, as the Opposition would insist or a tactical retreat dictated by the compulsion of circumstances, as is likely to be offered as an alibi by the Foreign Office, Islamabad, to say the least, has been guilty of gross miscalculation in Geneva. And the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be made accountable for misleading the government and the people about the success of our campaign to win international support. No matter what diplomatic jargon has been used to describe our unceremonious retreat, we have, for all practical purposes, withdrawn our resolution from the Human Rights Commission. And whether we like it or not New Delhi has scored a major propaganda victory. Foreign Minister Asif Ahmad Ali's contention that the objective to highlight Kashmir has been achieved and 'it has been a great victory for Pakistan since the resolution remains alive' simply does not hold and is certainly not good enough to explain away the failure of our initiatives on Kashmir. Perhaps it is time to review the entire gamut of our Kashmir strategy and withhold any fresh moves until we have undertaken a thorough stocktaking of our track record. It is of utmost importance that we should have the insight to discern where we had gone wrong in our understanding of world politics, and whether it was our lack of comprehension, or misplaced optimism on the righteousness of our cause. Is accent on human rights abuses a viable strategy to draw world attention to the Kashmir cause? If the Americans have chosen to project themselves as the custodians of human rights, it does not mean that they are no longer selective in their concern for human rights abuses, and are ready for an even-handed approach to deal with all victims of repression. So is the case with their European allies who couldn't care less for rape, torture and mass killings let loose on Bosnian Muslims. We have to sooner than later clearly identify our `constituency' in the international arena and design our moves to cater for their sensibilities. The third world countries do not in any case have an enviable human rights record, whether it is China or Iran or the vast majority of OIC countries. Human rights is not the kind of issue on which Pakistan can hope to muster support for the Kashmir cause, particularly when the US is trying to browbeat them on this score. In the wake of the embarrassment we have suffered and the despondency it may cause among the Kashmiri freedom-fighters, it would be in the fitness of things to weigh our gains and losses in foreign policy. Had we gone through with the vote would we be closer to our goal today? Would the world have rallied to our call of liberation of Kashmir, or would it have turned its back on us, as it seems to have done now?
