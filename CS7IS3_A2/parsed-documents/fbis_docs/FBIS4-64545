Addressing the TGNA session held under Vefa Tanir, Foreign Minister Hikmet Cetin said that Turkey will never support a solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. He recalled that the Turkish Cypriot side accepted the first confidence-building measures [CBM's] package in principle, but that the package was later changed to suit the demands of the Greek Cypriots. Cetin explained that the talks were suspended because the changes involved political elements. He said: The duty of the United Nations now is to restore the balance in the CBM's, because their balance has been upset. [Begin Cetin recording] The Greek Cypriot side and Greece did not accept the CBM's and did not support them. That is the source of the problem. The tactics and policies pursued by the Greek Cypriot side with a view to advancing its application to join the European Union will only serve to exacerbate the confidence crisis in Cyprus. [end recording] The foreign minister charged that in principle, the Greek Cypriots want a solution that will bring back the pre-1974 situation. Turkey cannot allow the reestablishment of the Greek Cypriot Republic, which was eliminated in 1963, he said, adding that a post-1974 solution must be sought in light of the present realities. Cetin said that there is no need for pressure in Cyprus, because there has not been any bloodshed on the island since 1974. The foreign minister pointed out that to solve the Cyprus problem, the political equality of the two communities, which have different languages, religion, and cultures, must be accepted. He stressed that Turkey's guarantees are also a condition for the solution. Cetin added that Turkey will continue to defend and support the just cause of the Turkish Cypriot people. [Begin Cetin recording] Turkey will not support a solution unacceptable to the Turkish Cypriot people. If we must choose between an unviable and unrealistic solution and the reaction of certain circles, we will be ready and determined to face this unfair reaction. [end recording] After Cetin's speech, ANAP leader Mesut Yilmaz expressed the views of his party. Yilmaz charged that the Assembly is not being briefed on the foreign contacts being held regarding the Cyprus problem. We are trying to follow the developments through bits of information leaked to certain newspaper columnists, he said, adding that these rumors are causing concern. He called on the prime minister to reveal the historic opportunity she says must not be missed. I am concerned for the future of the Turkish Cypriot people, Yilmaz said. [Begin Yilmaz recording] I want to say to the prime minister the following: You are the prime minister of the Turkish Republican State. On behalf of my deputies and, if they allow me, on behalf of all the deputies, I promise you: If you assume your responsibilities with the faith the nation expects of you; if you fulfill your duties; if you, with sincere determination, protect our rights and interests regarding the Cyprus problem, which is not only the national issue of the Turkish Cypriot people but of Turkey as well; if you stop making the grave mistake of believing and of trying to make the Turkish public believe that the traps and the salami tactics are good opportunities, then we will support you as a nation, even if the entire world challenges you. [end recording] Yilmaz concluded by saying that a general debate will be beneficial because the truths will be revealed. [passage omitted] After the speeches, the TGNA voted against the motion to hold a general debate on the Cyprus issue.
