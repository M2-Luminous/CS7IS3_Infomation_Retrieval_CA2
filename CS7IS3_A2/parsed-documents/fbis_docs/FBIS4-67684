During the same period, 46 were admitted as AIDS patients and 14 died. Thus far, the number of HIV cases in Vietnam has reached 1,321, among them 1,242 Vietnamese in 29 provinces and municipalities. Professor Le Dien Hong said, however, that the number of HIV infected persons in Vietnam is dramatically higher than the number made public. This is because we have not conducted surveys on certain groups of people such as prostitutes and drug addicts who are vulnerable to HIV.
