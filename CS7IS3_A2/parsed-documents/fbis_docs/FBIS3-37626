During the conversation the issue of the Geneva talks on a peaceful settlement of the situation in Abkhazia, which are to be held under the aegis of the United Nations, was discussed. Also discussed was the forthcoming meeting between the Georgian head of state and the UN secretary general at UN Headquarters. The Georgian head of state was informed about the results of the activities of the mission during the past one and a half years. It was emphasized that at the end of last year the UN mission repeated its appeal for aid for Georgia. Various countries have already responded to the appeal. New aid programs are being drawn up. The UN mission has planned certain measures aimed at improving the situation in the spheres of shipping goods by railway, sea, and air. This will ensure goods are shipped without losses and safely. Specifically, the UN mission has purchased 10 diesel locomotives that will make it easy to move goods in the situation of severe fuel shortages not only in Georgia but also in Armenia and Azerbaijan. It was also indicated that UNICEF [UN Children's Fund] has drafted a long-term program for shipping baby food, shipping medicines for children, assisting children's hospitals, and immunization. At the end of the meeting, Eduard Shevardnadze thanked the UN mission and its head for what has been done. He requested that to eliminate delays or losses of goods, private firms should be excluded from humanitarian activities and only state structures should be relied on. Shevardnadze emphasized that diesel locomotives purchased for the Georgian railways would eliminate problems not only from our country, but also from Armenia and Azerbaijan. A letter was sent to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali requesting speedier UN participation in the settlement of the Abkhazian conflict.
