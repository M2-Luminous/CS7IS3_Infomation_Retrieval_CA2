Tom Hubbard, deputy assistant secretary of State for Asian and Pacific Affairs, said Monday that North Korea will also have to fully implement International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections of its nuclear facilities in order to realize the third round of talks. Hubbard, who has represented the United States at working-level contacts with North Korea in New York, clarified the U.S. position at a regular weekly briefing on Monday. "The undertakings of Team Spirit '94 and a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks are based on the premise that the IAEA inspections will be fully implemented and that the South-North nuclear dialogue will resume through the exchange of special envoys," Hubbard said. Hubbard's comment came as a team of seven IAEA inspectors, which arrived in Beijing Monday night, is expected to leave for Pyongyang aboard a North Korean plane at 3 P.M. Tuesday. "They (IAEA inspectors) will complete their inspections and...there will be a number of tests based on the inspections that take place," Hubbard said. He said if the IAEA inspectors find that continuity in nuclear safeguards has been broken, then the United States will have to reconsider whether dialogue is the appropriate way of dealing with this issue. Hubbard said the IAEA team will not inspect two suspected nuclear sites this time. "Our basic position remains that we're seeking a full resolution of the nuclear issue," Hubbard said. "(and) full resolution of this issue entails full North Korean membership in the NPT (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty), full North Korean acceptance of their safeguards obligations with the IAEA." Finally, North Korea will have to implement the South-North Korean denuclarization declaration, which provides for inspections in a regime between North and South, Hubbard said. Asked whether the North Koreans accepted more than one inspection of their seven declared sites or only one inspection, Hubbard said that the number of inspections have never really been an issue. "North Korean representatives (to the working-level contacts) have acknowledged the need for periodic inspections," he said. "They have simply challenged the scope of those inspections." "Obviously, continuity of safeguards is an ongoing concept," he said. Hubbard was asked if the United States has made any agreement as to what is going to be the objective for the March 21 high-level talks between North Korea and the United States. "We haven't worked out any specific agenda," Hubbard said. "As I have said earlier, our principal objective is a resolution of the nuclear issue." "We will adopt a thorough and broad approach to the problems," he added. Hubbard said the third round of U.S.-North Korean talks will be held between Robert Gallucci, assistant secretary of State for political and military affairs, and his North Korean counterpart Kang Sok-chu.
