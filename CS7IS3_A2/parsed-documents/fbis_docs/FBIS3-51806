Upon arrival in Havana, Robaina gave this newscast an exclusive interview. [Begin Robaina recording] I think that a meeting with -- as we said several times during the tour -- that Africa which is ours because of that part of us that is also in Africa [con esa Africa nuestra por lo que de nuestro tambien hay en Africa], has, indisputably it seems to me, given them confidence, made them feel secure. And of course it has also given us much confidence, and made us feel very secure, to find that people are so interested in Cuba, despite so many campaigns and so much disinformation. And what great satisfaction is produced by being able to know what (?it always) costs. [end recording] Robaina's tour through Africa, the first since he was appointed foreign minister, included Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Namibia. During his tour, the foreign minister was received by chiefs of state and high-ranking government officials in those countries, whom he told about the current situation the island is going through. At the same time, he himself learned about the current realities of the said nations, which are also part of our history and traditions. [Begin Robaina recording] (?The fact that) it is a meeting with the continent that most contributes a presence of supporting votes in whatever international battle Cuba wages, I think also gives it special significance. I would say that it does not have as much significance -- regarding economic and trade possibilities -- as a tour of the area in which we live might have, (?because of the great) geographical distance that separates us; but I think that the interests that we have in common with Africa have never been tainted by purely commercial aspects, aspects of profitability and business. Rather, all the contrary. I would say that it is a tour that, above all, has a great deal to do with values and traditions; and, of course, possibilities for exchanges are not lacking, possibilities for compensated collaboration, a type of exchange which already exists in several of those countries.[end recording] This tour is part of a diplomatic offensive for the purpose of explaining Cuba's situation and its plans for overcoming the current difficulties. This is Rey Rodriguez, for the television newscast.
