As the 3d Corps, which is responsible for the Somalia units, stated in Koblenz on Monday [28 February], the last FRG soldier left the East African city. There is no more material from the German Armed Forces in the desert city and the tent city has been completely dismantled. The Bundeswehr mission started last May. In August, 1,700 German soldiers were operational. The main task for the Germans, to provide logistical supply for an Indian brigade, could never be fulfilled because the Indians were not stationed in the Beledweyne area. Hence, the Bundeswehr contingent concentrated on humanitarian aid for the population of Beledweyne and the neighborhood. The troops built schools and dams and dug wells. A spokesman for the 3d Corps added that the last convoy is on its way to the Somali capital Mogadishu, some 370 km from Beledweyne. There have been no incidents. In Mogadishu, the soldiers are accommodated in a provisional camp. From there they are shipped by German Navy ships to the Kenyan city of Mombasa. Some of them will return to Germany from Mombasa as early as this Tuesday. The return of the last 250 Bundeswehr soldiers is scheduled for 23 March.
