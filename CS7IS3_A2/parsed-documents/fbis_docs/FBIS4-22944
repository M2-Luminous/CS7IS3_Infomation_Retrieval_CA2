Levin: ``Eastern Project Begins''] [Text] An underwater optical fiber communication line will link Russia, Japan and Korea by early 1995. Agreement was reached on this in Moscow by 17 international communications operators who signed a special agreement in June to begin construction of this telecommunications route. The new optical fiber communication line will be laid across the bottom of the Sea of Japan between the cities of Nakhodka (Russia), Naoetsu (Japan) and Pusan (Korea). The length of the line will be 1,211 km in the section between Russia and Japan, 1,026 km between Russia and Korea, and 1,196 km between Japan and Korea. Over 22,000 channels will be organized with modern digital transmission apparatus designed to work at a speed of 560 Mbits/sec; 15,000 of these channels will begin carrying international telephone traffic between the Far East, Siberia and countries of the Asia-Pacific region. Russia's Intertelekom, Denmark's GNTC and Telecom Denmark, which are already known for creation of the Denmark-Russia optical fiber line, and Japan's KDD and Korea's Korea Telecomm were the initiators of the project and its principal investors. The outlays to erect the ``Eastern'' optical fiber communication line are estimated at $80 million U.S., with not a single kopeck being spent out of the state budget. Nonetheless, the part of the complex located on our territory and the section of underwater cable to its branch point will be Russian property. An international consortium of three Japanese firms--KDD, Fujitsu and NEC--will lay the cable, install the underwater branching equipment and built the coastal stations. These firms obtained this large contract after winning a competition held not long ago. And Germany's Siemens will help the project's participants in building the 930-kilometer cable section from Nakhodka to Khabarovsk and to the international exchange in this city. Interest in the new optical fiber communication line is great. Seventeen international operators, including Interetelekom (Russia), AT&T and MCI (USA), ITJ and KDD (Japan), DACOM and KT (Korea), TELEGLOBE (Canada), Telstra (Australia) and others, have acquired space in the future optical route, as was reported to journalists at a press conference held during a June meeting in Moscow. The Eastern project will have great significance not only to our country but also to the entire world community. As we know, it will become possible to close the ``global communication ring'' around the world only after Russia is covered by a modern telecommunications network. The appearance of the Far Eastern optical fiber communication line will become an important stage on this path.
