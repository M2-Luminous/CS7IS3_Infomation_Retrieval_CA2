Thus the PRC once again demonstrated that the West will not succeed in forcing Pyongyang to open up its nuclear installations for inspection without its consent. What is more, the New York debate enabled Beijing to display the consistency of its policy. It has after all from the very start of the crisis claimed that methods of pressure and diktat are unacceptable. But whereas Chinese diplomacy can enter a point in its favor, military strategists hardly have cause to be delighted. As long as the nature of the DPRK's nuclear program remains a secret and as long as Pyongyang continues to violate its nonproliferation treaty pledges there is still a threat to the security of all Korea's neighbors, including China. Why then are they doggedly opposing attempts to include even a reference to sanctions in the UN ruling? Are they afraid of an unpredictable response from Kim Il-song and his offspring if things reach the point of an economic blockade against North Korea? That is unlikely. This state's leaders are not crazy, and they will not risk their own annihilation by unleashing another war on the peninsula. Some foreign observers in Beijing are saying that the Chinese leadership is not united on the North Korean problem. Army representatives are alarmed not just by the nuclear ambitions of China's former ally in the socialist camp, they are afraid that Tokyo may follow Pyongyang with nuclear rearmament. However, the army establishment is opposed by party ideologists, who are convinced that economic sanctions must not be allowed. They would after all ultimately bring about the collapse of another communist regime, which would be bound to affect Chinese Communists' morale. Moreover, the success of sanctions against the DPRK would create a bad international precedent. We would remind you that the United States is threatening economic repression against China itself in an effort to secure concessions from it in the human rights field. There is also another viewpoint: Chinese intelligence is fairly well informed on the progress of nuclear research in the DPRK and believes that this country is incapable of manufacturing a bomb on its own. That is why Beijing is not inclined to overdramatize the conflict.
