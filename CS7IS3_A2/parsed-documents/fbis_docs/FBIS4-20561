Social Awareness The number of motor vehicles in Japan as of March 1993, excluding two-wheeled vehicles, was about 62 million (39 million passenger cars). That figure is approximately 21 million vehicles more than it was 10 years ago (passenger cars accounting for 13 million of that increase). The Ministry of Construction, meanwhile, is planning to spend about Â¥76 trillion on road maintenance and improvements in the 11th in a series of five-year plans on road maintenance that starts this year. Also, in April of this year, an additional 6,000 kilometers of roads were promoted to the status of national highways, and next year, 10,000 additional kilometers of roads are scheduled to be promoted to primary regional highways. The road extensions currently include 6,000 kilometers for high-speed expressways such as the Meishin (Nagoya Kobe) and Tomei (Tokyo Nagoya), and 130,000 kilometers for metropolitan and prefectural roads. Including all other roads, the total number of road extensions will come to 1.1 million kilometers. Sometime this fiscal year, a portion of the Tokushima Highway will be open to traffic in Tokushima Prefecture. This will mean that all prefectures and metropolitan areas throughout Japan will be connected by high-speed expressways. Adding on new roads like this, however, results in increased demand on the roads including more things shipped by motor vehicle, more economic activities including private business, and more leisure activities that traditionally were not done by means other than motor vehicle. When we add on to that the lack of geographical knowledge, it only adds that much more time to get to one's destination. That being the case, if there were an appropriate support system, that is, if a traffic information system were available that included a car navigation system, drivers would then be able to select the most convenient and lightest traveled routes to get to their destination. If there were a substantial number of cars using such a system, it would help ease traffic congestion, help conserve energy by cutting down on traveling times, and cut down the number of traffic accidents. 2. Automobiles in the Electronics and Information Age It is becoming more and more common now to see basic functions of the automobile such as "driving," "turning," and "stopping" being controlled electronically by on-board computers. This includes electronic control of the engine, automatic transmission, suspension, and brakes. All these, moreover, are becoming part of one integrated system. It is also common now to have comfort features such as air-conditioning and stereo systems in the car be controlled by microcomputers, so when we talk about electronics in automobiles, there is a mile of difference between the automobiles of 30 years ago that used diodes in the AC generators and transistors in the AM radios. Generally speaking, people want the inside of their homes and the inside of their cars to have similar environments. The CD (compact disk) made its debut in 1981, and later, in 1984, the CD player found its way into the automobile. It is not unusual now to see automobiles equipped with auto-changing CD players. In the section below, we will discuss the role of the CD player in the implementation of a car navigation system. This system not only pertains to audio but to video as well. The idea of putting televisions in cars has been around for quite some time, but what is truly remarkable is to see a million small liquid crystal televisions being sold each year, and most of them are said to be used in automobiles. Besides TV broadcasts, these miniature televisions are also being used as monitors that reproduce images taken by no more than a video camera. The liquid crystal display is also one of the key elements used in displaying the electronic maps (digital maps) in car navigation systems. Traffic information is at the head of the list as far as information needed by a car driver. Most drivers have been getting traffic information either from AM or FM radio stations, or from display boards and roadside broadcasts on 1620 kHz as they pass through different areas. These ways of acquiring traffic information, however, are unsatisfactory in terms of timing and relevancy of the information given. If a car is equipped with a car phone or portable cellular phone, it is possible to get traffic information via a telephone service provided by the Japan Traffic Information Center, but it will take more time before ordinary drivers have access to mobile telephones in their cars. Starting in April of next year, a system is scheduled to be instituted for selling mobile telephones (these are now leased from telephone companies), so this along with a new rate structure should make it a lot easier for people to use mobile telephones in the future. 3. Navigation System As far as traffic information is concerned, the ideal situation is for drivers to be able to obtain the information they need at the time they need it, but the complex network of roads in Japan makes it necessary for cars to have road maps or driver guides in the door pockets. In recent years, we are seeing more and more road signs being put up as the new road construction continues, but it is very rare, indeed, for the driver of a car to be able to find the sign they want at the time they need it. Moreover, to turn the pages of a map while driving at night just to confirm one's location is dangerous and very hard to do. At times such as this, there is nothing more convenient than to have your location displayed on a map automatically, and be able to make decisions immediately based on the direction you are heading and the surrounding geographical conditions. With ships and airplanes, needless to say, navigation is taken care of by electronic navigation methods, but car navigation is a rather recent phenomenon which only got started in the 1970s and was put into service in 1987. A compact disk is the best form of media when it comes to storing digital maps containing digitalized road map information, so not only have CD players been commercialized but are suddenly finding altogether new uses. Initially, CRTs were used for the color display units that display the maps, but most now are liquid crystal displays. At the present time, car navigation systems are broadly divided into two types of electronic navigation methods, namely, self-contained navigation (dead-reckoning navigation) and GPS (global positioning system) navigation. In the self-contained navigation system, the position of the car has to be input before the car is started, but in the electronic navigation system, data on the absolute position of the car can be obtained continuously. The systems that car manufacturers are installing in their cars tend to combine both the self-contained system and the global positioning system. Also, the after-market systems that can be purchased at any car supply store and be installed by hand are generally based on the GPS method (cf. Table 1). Table 1. Car Navigation System I would now like to introduce some of the main features of car navigation systems now on the market. (1) Can set destination and routing freely and always display the direction in which you are heading. Has an audio feature that lets you know when you are turning left or right. (2) Can file coordinates while driving which can then be used again on the return trip or future trips. (3) Can easily access maps from reference lists when looking up maps of destinations (3,000 cities, towns, and villages; 9,000 train stations, golf courses, and expressway ICs, SAs, and PAs). (4) System also provides service information about hotels, restaurants, art galleries, museums, and sports facilities by means of still pictures, graphics, and audio. (5) Besides general road maps, there are city maps available that feature lots of local information, and also CDs that contain special resort guide information. (6) In addition to maps, there is also a full lineup of CDs including games and "karaoke" singing that people can enjoy once they reach their destination. 4. Digital Maps A database of digital maps was started in 1984 as the result of a project undertaken by the Ministry of Construction and private companies entitled "A Road/Vehicle Information System," which came out of an immediate need for data on national roads and highways. In 1988, the Japan Digital Road Map Association was formed. It is made up of members from automotive, electrical, surveying, and map-related companies, and has been at work preparing, updating, and making the database available. This database has basically digitalized many of the 1:25,000 topographical maps produced by the Ministry of Construction's Geographical Survey Institute (4,400 maps to cover all Japan). The most recent database contained a total number of 2,200 digitalized 1:25,000 topographical maps, or 50 percent of the total number of maps, and covering 80 percent of the population distribution. The remaining areas are maintained by 1:50,000 topographical maps. The contents of the database consists of a network of roads that is formed by digitalizing the linear latitude and longitude changes in the road, and by linking these numbered nodes together with links connecting the nodes. The areas maintained by 1:25,000 topographical maps include all roads classified as more than 3 meters wide, and the areas maintained by 1:50,000 topographical maps include all roads classified as being more than 5 meters wide. Needless to say, the data includes rivers, shoreline routes, and railway lines. Furthermore, these roads being living entities, are rebuilt and changed almost every year, so hundreds of revisions have to made in the topographical maps themselves, and the database must accurately reflect these new changes and revisions. A database such as the one described above is, simply speaking, only an output map made up of lines, so is incomplete in terms of being a navigational tool. Therefore, the map must be set up in such a way that the person driving the car is able to confirm his/her location easily with the display. The work in this area cannot be done without the cooperation of map makers, so we at Pioneer have been working together with the Hokkaido Chizu in the manufacture of navigational maps. Out of that work has come a CD-ROM disk which contains a complete record of map data, but we are also marketing a navigation system that uses IC cards as recording media. 5. Position Sensors and Global Positioning System In Section 3, we touched on the different car navigation systems, but as Table 1 shows, we are unable to obtain data on absolute position with the self-contained navigation system. The position of a car in a self-contained system is calculated by geomagnetic sensors that calculate the azimuth, speed sensors that calculate the distance the car has traveled, and gyros that detect turning angles. There are instances also in which the wheel velocity and steering are used as aids in calculating the turning angle. A map-matching technology is also used for restoring the car's position based on road data and pattern verification when there are errors produced, such as the car leaving the road. Next, we outline the Global Positioning System which has recently been attracting a good deal of attention. This is an excellent system that lets you know in real time your latitude and longitude coordinates at any point on the earth. More specifically, it is a global positioning system using artificial satellites that the Department of Defense of the U.S. Government has been working on for the past 20 years or so, and is formally called NAVSTAR/GPS (Navigation System with Time and Ranging/Global Positioning System). The system consists of 24 satellites each equipped with atomic clocks (orbiting the earth about every 12 hours in 6 orbital tracks at altitudes of 20,000 km), five monitoring stations, and a control station. There are L1 radio signals for standard positioning and L2 signals for high-precision positioning, but the L2 is exclusively from military use (Figures 1 and 2 [figures not reproduced]). The positioning system works by calculating the distance between a moving vehicle and the satellite in real time based on the propagation time of signals received from three to four satellites, and establishing the real position of the moving vehicle. (1) When three satellites are used, two-dimensional positioning (latitude, longitude) is possible. (2) When four satellites are used, three-dimensional positioning (latitude, longitude, and altitude) is possible. From the data received, we can also determine traveling direction, speed, and time. There are a total of 24 satellites in operation at present including the first experimental satellites, so it is possible to have 24-hour tracking (Table 2). ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Table 2.

The operation is not scheduled to be completed until all 24 Block II satellites are in place. An advanced positioning system such as this should be useful in a wide range of activities including, tracking moving vehicles, surveying, and supporting disaster prevention work (predicting earthquakes and volcanic eruptions). In 1990, Mazda and Pioneer jointly became the first in the world to come out with a car navigation system. This is a system that the U.S. Government developed and is controlled and operated by the United States, so it is important in terms of the user that the use of the system be appropriate and that care be taken not to cause any new trade frictions. For that reason, GPS makers and users in Japan are planning to form the Satellite Positioning System Association whose job it will be to begin conducting international exchanges, researching appropriate uses of the system, and providing accurate information. 6. Future Car Navigation and Road Traffic Information Systems Making cars more intelligent and informed contributes to road safety and smoother traffic flow, so that is why there is so much research being done in this area. One of the things that current navigation systems have been able to provide is information on surrounding geographical conditions and the distance and direction to one's destination. As explained in Section 2, dynamic traffic information is presently being provided by audio systems from radio broadcasts or telephone services, or by display boards along the roads, but to enable more effective use of the information collected, and to provide drivers with a system that they can use anytime and anyplace, a new organization called the VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication Systems) Promotion Council was formed in 1991 with the cooperation of the National Police Agency, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and the Ministry of Construction. This will be a system that uses radio beacons, light beacons, and FM multipliers (a new broadcasting method in which characters, graphics, and additional information is multiplexed and sent out on FM radio broadcasts) installed along roads and highways to be used to send information to drivers on traffic jams, time requirements, traffic regulations and warnings. We have been studying different modes of display from simple ones that display only written characters to more complex ones that involve navigational maps. A public demonstration of the system is being planned for November of this year, but when this system is in place, we expect it will dramatically improve the decision-making ability of drivers. 7. Conclusion As we have explained in the foregoing, this car navigation system was developed for commercial use by concentrating a diverse range of technologies. At the present time, there are about 300,000 systems in use. We believe that the market for this product will continue to expand, and that we will see further technical innovation. If there are more cars on the road equipped with car navigation systems and data terminals, it will likely lead to smoother traffic, therefore, we are trying to make the system as easy and as simple to use as possible. Meanwhile, we continue to see more and more mobile-type management systems, which are applications of car navigation technology, being used in business (trailer trucks, taxis, police cars, etc.). For example, positional information on the location of a vehicle is sent by radio from a GPS transceiver in the moving vehicle to an operational control center. The center uses that information to ascertain the position and operating status of a number of moving vehicles, so is able to immediately send appropriate instructions and messages. This area should see an enormous amount of growth in the future. (Yushiyuki Kosaka)
