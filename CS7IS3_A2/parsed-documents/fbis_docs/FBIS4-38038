How do you respond? [Buwayz] The Lebanese media characteristically jump the gun on political events. To date, we have not received any invitation to restart the negotiations -- neither from the United States nor from any other country. Reports about separate deals, thus, do not add up. I think there will be a kind of dynamism which the United States will deploy both in regard to the Lebanese and Syrian files. This initiative has yet to take shape. We don't know yet whether it will it take the shape of Christopher's upcoming visit to the region or an invitation to restart the negotiations? [Nasrallah] There has been a major development recently in the the Jordanian-Israeli track. How do you think this will impact the overall negotiations, particularly regarding Lebanon, and more especially given that southern Lebanon is on the threshold of a major Israeli military escalation. Lebanon is said to have been issued with what you might call an ultimatum through the U.S. channel. [Buwayz] Israeli threats are nothing new as far as Lebanon is concerned. We have lived with them for many years. I can tell you for certain, however, that such ultimatums will not affect Lebanon's agenda. Lebanon has incurred a heavy price in terms of its sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity. We are not quitting half way down the road. The point I want to make is that southern Lebanon will remain in a state of tension as long as the Israeli occupation of the area remains and its people are living under coercion. Any attempts to put an end to practices [of resistance] in the south will not succeed as long as the occupation remains in place. The only way out is for Israel to start departing the south and reassuring the Lebanese that it does not covet their land or resources. Resistance in southern Lebanon is not a hobby pursued for its own sake. No one wants to die for the sake of it. Those who die are giving their souls for the sake of a cause which the they believe to be a worthy one. National resistance is the outcome rather than the cause of occupation. [Nasrallah] Would you say that the developments in the Jordanian-Israeli track has put an end to the cordon states formula? [Buwayz] We must see what happened on the Joran-Israel front in perspective. Let's not blow it out of all proportion. Naturally we would have liked Jordan to stay with us and committed to the Madrid formula that gave birth to the bilateral talks that took place in Washington. From our point of view, the failure of the talks to make substantive progress, especially on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks, does not warrant the relocation of the negotiations from Washington to the region. The movement of the negotiations from Washington takes them away from the spotlight of world public opinion. At the same time, the move reduces the American involvement and keeps the United States from playing its role in full. Both in form and content the Washington talks meet the requirements of the peace process. We would have liked Jordan to remain committed along with us to the mechanism agreed to in Washington. As to the contention that Jordan has gone its own way and signed, I have yet to hear that Jordan has signed a peace treaty in the strict sense. The two sides have agreed for the talks to be moved from Washington to the Middle East, specifically to Jordan and Israel. Such a step, in our assessment, could have waited. Again, to our knowledge, Jordan has not signed a peace treaty. [passage omitted]
