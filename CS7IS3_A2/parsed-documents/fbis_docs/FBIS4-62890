The election campaign is in full swing, and election battles are under way across the territory of Belorussia [Belarus]. Sensitive to the electrified political atmosphere in the republic and the candidates' overflowing game spirit, the Internal Affairs Ministry and the Defense Ministry have decided to join the election struggle. To avoid a repetition of mistakes and so as not "to step on a rake," Minsk decided to find out in good time whose side "the man with the gun" is on so as to be able to revise his position if necessary. According to the RID news agency, a special analytical group including nine officers has been set up in the Defense Ministry's Education Directorate. The first poll it conducted showed an incontestable lead by Premier Vyacheslav Kebich (56 percent of the military vote). His main rival Aleksandr Lukashenko has earned the trust of only 15 percent of the military, and Stanislav Shushkevich was hard put to get even four percent. In all likelihood, this four percent have not as yet heard rumors about the ex-speaker's recent May Day speech in Baranovichi. This, in spite of the fact that Belorussia's security bodies have already compiled a circumstantial report on this trip. According to a state security official, who "accidentally" was present at the meeting, Shushkevich was rather sharp "about Belorussia's military problems." In particular he said that "compensation to the military must be lower than to Internal Affairs Ministry employees because they do not risk their lives every single minute." (In addition, according to the same source, Shushkevich also maintained that military pensions must be paid by Russia, also complaining, "Where is the hard currency for the continued presence of Russian military bases on Belorussia's territory?") Now the ex-speaker justifies himself by saying that the report by the special services contains "distorted facts which nonetheless look very much like the truth although there is only five percent of the truth in it." Two more questions are left open: On whose desks have copies of the report been laid, and by what right are special services spying on a candidate? According to RID, the special services have already produced no fewer than 10 reports on statements by presidential candidates which were submitted to the premier. Yet in spite of the seeming vigor of the election campaign, Shushkevich "is bringing up the column's rear." In the "presidential race" lead car is Vyacheslav Kebich. But even he has to look over his shoulder all the time because Aleksandr Lukashenko can overtake him any moment. True, Belorussia's "implacable mafia fighter" can be let down not only by the brakes but also the engine: The Slavic White Russia Union [Sobor], driving him towards the presidency, is going to revise its policy of promoting three candidates simultaneously, confining itself to just one. The reason for this decision was the disagreements that emerged within the Union: Four Minsk district groups raising signatures in support of Lukashenko refused to collaborate with him attributing this to the "inconsistent conduct of Aleksandr Grigorievich's entourage." Thus, the "Belorussian Commissar Cattagnio's" support group has reduced by 400 people." And this at a time when a mere 20,000 signatures were needed to meet the required 100,000. In a bid to curb disagreements White Russia stated that on 4 June it will announce one of the three candidates: Lukhashenko, Kebich, or Novikov. And then the people will have to make their choice....
