Salinas said that although inflation reached only 8 percent last year, "this year we are working toward reducing it even more." During the 26th Ordinary General Assembly of the Confederation of National Chambers of Commerce (Concanaco), the president called on the country's businessmen to look for new markets to compensate for the government's liberalization efforts. "Our OECD membership can make us part of the most developed countries. It is not a way of saying that there are no longer shortages in our fatherland; on the contrary, it will help us acquire the tools to face the inequities and insufficiencies that our country still endures." We have paved the way to compete at home and abroad, and you have shown that together we will do it successfully. After a two-day working tour, the president said that what has been accomplished so far is the result of efforts by all Mexicans. "We are going to take advantage of the conditions that all Mexicans have created with so much hard work. We will keep inflation low to increase the likelihood of development and boost real salaries and the purchasing power of those who have the least. We will continue deregulation as an incentive for commercial and productive activities. We will curb bureaucratization and excessive red tape." He added: "We will seek an opening that provides cheaper and more competitive raw materials and supplies for our production plants; an increased domestic market that favors consumers; diversified trade that, with effort, is converting Mexico into an exporting and competitive country; and a pluralistic nation that lives with tolerance, dialogue, and cooperation." President Salinas de Gortari previously told the country's organized businessmen that their participation in the Stability, Competitiveness, and Employment Pact (PECE), together with the remaining social sectors and the government, "allowed inflation to reach only 8 percent last year. This year we will reduce it even more. We are confronting the inflation phenomena, which affected us the most and whose elimination was demanded the most, after having endured it for so many years." The president said before Concanaco leaders and Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche: "The essential element in consolidating the fight against inflation has been cleaning up public finances." He said this clean-up has allowed the country to eliminate the fiscal deficit and to use the savings realized from servicing a smaller debt to boost salaries and lower "certain" taxes. "Remember that a few years ago the main burden was the country's excessive debt, and the only topic of discussion was how to eliminate it and overcome excessive inflation. Today, thanks to everyone's efforts, we have had truly encouraging results with both." Salinas pointed out that Mexico's internal debt is only 10 percent of GNP. "We have accomplished this with everyone's work, and it has also helped to eliminate excessive inflation, which so affected the workers' real wages." President Salinas later said there are still problems, but there has also been progress which enables us to face new challenges and set higher goals. "This has been the result of our work, everyone's work. It is important to remember this, and it is also useful to take full advantage of it to benefit future generations." President Salines said Mexicans needed economic stability to encourage investment and to reactivate the country's production. He said: Without price stability, it will be impossible to propose sustainable growth or to permanently direct our efforts toward justice. "That is why we have been making changes that have allowed us to make our economy more productive and have established the conditions to create more jobs, which are the essential solution to the poverty problem and the possibility of becoming more competitive at the international level." To conclude, he reasserted: "We confirmed the Mexican people's democratic will this year under complex circumstances. It is a determination to live in peace and create job opportunities. It is the principle of harmonious coexistence for everyone based on diversity and respect for all. It is a Mexico organized according to a civic spirit and love for the homeland."
