"That office could be opened in the spring," Bela Csepe, leader of the parliamentary faction of the Christian Democratic People's Party (CDPP), told a CNA reporter in Budapest. Csepe and a CDPP Vice President Miklos Hasznos will travel to Taiwan Monday [10 January] for a week-long visit to promote the trade office. During their stay, the two will also meet with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Huang Hsiu- jih and Vice President of the China External Trade Development Council K.H. Wu. "Our main goal is to promote the opening of the hungarian trade office in Taipei," Csepe said, adding that further delay in opening the Taipei office will hold back development of bilateral economic cooperation. Taipei opened a trade representative office in Budapest in 1990, marking a new era of cooperation between the two countries which maintain no diplomatic relations. In a recent interview with UJ MAGYARORSZAG, a daily with close ties to the government, Gabriella Farkas, vice president of the Hungarian Democratic Forum (HDF), said she realizes that a Hungarian trade office in Taipei would help Hungary sell foodstuffs and beverages to Taiwan. The HDF is the leading force of a three-party coalition government in Hungary, which also includes the CDPP. Budapest has, however, been very cautious about the opening of the Taipei office. Farkas, who recently visited Taiwan, agreed that the office would give an impetus to the development of bilateral economic ties but stressed that it should not jeopardize national foreign policy. She said diplomatic links with Taiwan are not likely at the moment as Budapest recognizes Beijing as the sole legitimate Government of China, and Taiwan is considered a Chinese province.
