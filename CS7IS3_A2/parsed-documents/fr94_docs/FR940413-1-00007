FR940413-1-00007 FR940413-1-00003 7 CFR Part 1126 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;10] Milk in the Texas Milk Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend the ``dairy farmer for other markets'' provisions of the Texas milk marketing order. The proposal would suspend a portion of the producer definition until such time as this and other pooling provisions of the order can be reviewed at a public hearing. The action was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc., a cooperative that represents dairy farmers whose milk is pooled under the order. Proponent contends that these provisions prevent the cooperative from marketing its milk supplies efficently. DATES: Comments are due no later than April 20, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Clifford M. Carman, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 720&hyph;9368. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension of the following provisions (or sections) of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Texas marketing area is being considered until this and other pooling provisions of the Texas order are reviewed at a public hearing: In ยง1126.12, paragraph (b)(5) in its entirety. All persons who want to submit written data, views or arguments about the proposed suspension should send two copies of their views to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, by the 7th day after publication of this notice in the Federal Register . The period for filing comments is limited to 7 days because this action needs to be completed at the earliest practicable date.
