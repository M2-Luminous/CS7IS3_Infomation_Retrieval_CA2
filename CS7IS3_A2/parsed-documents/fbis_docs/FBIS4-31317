After his visit to Denmark, he is now in Norway. His high-level reception and the understanding shown for the Albanians' demands are encouraging signs for the Albanian political movement in Kosova. On the first day of his visits president Rugova met the speaker of the Norwegian parliament, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the parliamentary groups, and representatives of charities, who gave their full support to the peaceful policies of the Albanians and promised Norway's full commitment to helping to settle the question of Kosova in accordance with the Albanians' demands. With these comments, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, member of the presidium of the Kosova Democratic Alliance [LDK], opened yesterday's news conference in Prishtina. Voices That Initially Discounted the Elections Rexhep Gjergji went on to stress that the recent meeting of President Berisha and Gligorov in Poeradec was conducted as part of a commuted Albanian policy to settle through democratic means all the outstanding problems of the region, especially those of the Albanians in Macedonia. Gjergji then hailed the start of the daily publication of the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT and the initiative to increase the amount of Albanian-language broadcasting on Macedonia Radio-Television, to expand the secondary school system, and to open a teacher-training college. Achieving state-forming status for the Albanians in Maoedonia means full equality with other citizens of this republic. Only in this way will Macedonia be stable and a factor of peace in the region. Talking about the elections of 24 May 1992, Rexhep Gjergji said that in these first multiparty elections the electorate gave their votes for their own deputies and president. These elections were and will remain historic for the nation, for democracy, and for the Republic of Kosova. Serbian military and police forces have impeded the Constitution and operation of the parliament. Nevertheless, the elections have lost nothing of their importance. They gave legitimacy to the representatives of Kosova and of the Albanians and showed who has the right to decide and to speak on behalf of the people of Kosova. We consider the demands for the parliament to be constituted for the most part reasonable, as demands to further the formation of our institutions. However, there are also occasional voices that discount the elections. The parliament of the Republic of Kosova will be constituted at the most favorable opportunity and will operate freely, and nobody can decide anything about Kosova before this is done. Weapons Campaign During last week too, the weapons campaign was widespread in the communes of Prishtina, Podujeve, Vushtrri [Vucitrn], Skendera, [Srbica], Han i Elezit [Djeneral Jankovic], Gllogovo, Malisheve, Suhareke [Suva Reka], Ferizaj [Urosevac], Lipjan, Viti, Kline, etc. There were acts of barbarism on the part of the Serbian police, citizens were brutally beaten, and there were acts of destruction and vandalism. The Serbian police also entered the Kosova Chamber of Commerce and arrested everyone who was present, including its chairman Ismail Kastrati and secretary Sulejman Ahmeta. The chairman and secretory are still being held under arrest. There were also police interventions in schools, while the most provocative incident was the blockade of Prishtina market on the eve of Kurban sajram [Muslim festival, on whose eve believers buy sacrificial lambs]. Thus the Serbian regime demonstrated its vicious restrictions on religious freedoms. The weapons collection campaign and the forced recruitments of young Albanian men in the Serbian Army have been accompanied by the plunder of large sums of money from Albanians. There is plenty of evidence that can be published about these incidents. Rexhep Gjergji and Fatmir Sejdiu, members of the LDK Presidium, went on to reply to journalists' questions. Asked what would be the keynote of Dr. Rugova's speech to the UN General Assembly, Fatmir Sejdiu said that Rugova's positions are familiar, and they will be placed before this important assembly. He will set forth his own standpoints, which are at the same time those of the people. Vacillations of the International Community In reply to a question, Rexhep Gjergji said that FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT had made an important contribution toward affirming the demands of the Albanians, especially in raising their status to a constituent element in the state. Meanwhile, commenting on President Clinton's statement about "tightening the measures against Serbia and Montenegro," he said that this was in accordance with our stand that the easing or removal of the sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro must be conditional on quenching the hotbeds of crisis in the former Yugoslavia, of course including the problem of Kosova. The demands of the congressmen too, Rexhep Gjergji went on, approximate to our stands, and it is probable that an ever-increasing number of congressmen will support our cause. Rexhep Gjergji added that the main factor causing these crises and horrors in Europe is Milosevic and his gunmen. However, the international community has vacillated in its attitude toward him, and some of its measures have even emboldened him.
