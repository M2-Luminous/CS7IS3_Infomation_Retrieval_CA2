[Dikun] For the time being the Political Declaration of Partnership and Cooperation Between Russia and the European Union is not an agreement but merely a protocol of intent. Why did you not succeed in Brussels in signing right away the treaty that has been worked on for more than a year now? [Shokhin] It was clear that only the declaration would be signed in Brussels even before the visit began. The point is that the agreement itself is huge, consisting of more than 100 pages, and time is needed in order to bring about its signing in a purely technical sense. Individual issues were resolved during the negotiations--this is about trade in the products of the nuclear fuel cycle, the establishment and operation of companies, including banking companies, in the territories of Russia and the countries of the European Community. Experts will now have to work on these aspects, and then it will be possible to sign the agreement. The Brussels Declaration has removed all obstacles on the path toward it. [Dikun] What specifically does this declaration accomplish for Russia? [Shokhin] Russia is no longer considered a country with a centralized planned economy which is capable of setting prices and conditions for trade at its discretion, without reference to market arrangements. All measures are possible with regard to such a state in order to restrict its exports. As is laid down in the declaration, Russia has now been recognized as a country with an economy of a transitional type. That is to say that antidumping measures cannot be used against it for purely political motives; we will now be treated in keeping with canons and yardsticks commonly accepted in the world. If the issue of introducing a restrictive measure with regard to Russia arises, it should be consulted first as to whether the country is indeed deliberately engaging in some dumping practices, or whether there is another reason. Besides, it is officially codified in the declaration that the European Community and Russia are partners from now on and will strive for further economic rapprochement. Moreover, in the immediate future negotiations should begin on establishing a free zone and trade between the European Union and Russia. Simultaneously, the Council for Cooperation between the European Union and Russia is being established within the framework of which it is planned to hold summits twice a year, that is, meetings between the president of Russia, on one side, and the chairman of the Council of the European Union, the chairman of the European Commission, on the other side. It is also laid down in the declaration that intensive contacts will be organized at the parliamentary level. In a word, a continuous dialogue, a system of regular consultations will be established between the European Union and Russia. It is important that the parties stated this officially: They will build mutual economic relations on the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to which an overwhelming majority of the countries of the world adhere. [Dikun] Can the real economic effect of this agreement be assessed? [Shokhin] It is impossible to quantify. In the greater scheme of things, establishing broad-scale political and economic cooperation with the European Union is primarily in Russia's interest. This will simplify and facilitate market transformations for us, and will relieve social difficulties in the course of reforms. One way or the other, this will give a great impetus to the participation of European companies in the operation of Russian institutions and companies. This will influence the progress of privatization favorably, ensuring in the process not only an influx of capital that we badly need but also the advent of new technologies and management expertise which we need so much. This is very important: The European space market is being opened up to us. Everybody knows well to what degree the Western market for space launches and space services as a whole is closed, how difficult it is to break into, and what obstacles are being thrown in our path in this case. The number of commercial launches we will be able to carry out before the end of this century has now been determined. Subsequently, our quota in the space sphere is expected to be increased in keeping with our own potential, as well as so that prices for these services will gradually pull closer to world prices. This is completely in our interest because our prices for such services are somewhat below those in the world. Our entry onto the space market is also valuable to us in that it will promote the development of domestic industry and science, quite a number of sectors associated with rocket building and support for space launches. [Dikun] As is known, U.S. Vice President Albert Gore also came here with a program for extensive joint participation by Russia and America in space projects. Therefore, Russia has now got an opportunity to choose. Will the emerging rapprochement between our country and the European Union prompt the United States to cooperate with Russia more closely? [Shokhin] Undoubtedly, negotiations with the European Union concerning space which had been underway for more than a year urged the Americans on in this area. In turn, similar contacts between Russia and the United States caused more activity among the Europeans. That such a breakthrough has been accomplished in the European sector cannot fail to influence the American side now. The United States is developing cooperation with us in the space area gradually, but further and further; from just space launches, it is proceeding toward cooperation in the creation and construction of orbiting stations. As recently as half a year ago the Americans had very serious doubts about the latter project because this meant automatically that a proportion of the market and a proportion of the orders would be transferred to Russia. This meant that American producers of the requisite equipment would fail to receive the same share. However, by all signs the issue has been resolved in our favor. [Dikun] Which problems did you fail to resolve in Brussels? [Shokhin] First of all, regarding aluminum exports. Restrictions on imports from Russia to the countries of the European Union are still in force. In this case, the interests of primarily France, the main producer of aluminum in the European Union, were affected. Incidentally, coordination on space proceeded in a quite complicated manner because of France once again. Let us say it straightforwardly: On quite a number of issues France hindered the reaching of agreements which could be satisfactory to the Russian Federation. It is common knowledge that at one time the French came out as opponents of the agreement on partnership and cooperation with Russia, saying that it is not all that necessary for the European Union at this stage. However, this extreme point of view did not prevail. [Dikun] To what degree did the edict of President Yeltsin concerning access to Russia for Western banks hinder the signing of the declaration? [Shokhin] This edict changed our negotiating position. It was very necessary for us and extremely inconvenient for them. However, we understand full well that if one of the parties gets a greater advantage than the other, the latter will be left dissatisfied and will possibly try to modify the agreement, which, naturally, no one needs. Therefore it was very important to strike a balance on all issues during the negotiations, including those concerning banks. I will not dwell on the details of how the Russian Federation intends to restrict the operations of European financiers on the Russian market during the period of transition; I will only say that the restrictions we are introducing are not an insurmountable barrier to banks from the European Union countries coming to the Russian market. Although there is no complete agreement as of this moment, let us hope that one will be reached within a few weeks. [Dikun] Did the release of a report on relations between Russia and NATO by the chief of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Yevgeniy Primakov, affect the progress of negotiations? [Shokhin] Actually, Primakov's report aroused the interest of the Russian public to these problems. What had previously proceeded within the confines of big-time politics became available to the general public. In Brussels the position of Russia was clearly affirmed to the effect that it is not prepared to see NATO as an organization expanded into Central and Eastern Europe but without the participation of Russia. Moreover, the idea was voiced that the parallel admission of Russia and these countries to NATO preserves the balance of forces in Europe. Apparently this issue will be discussed in January during the summit of the North Atlantic Union. [Dikun] Do you project the emergence of domestic policy obstacles which may frustrate the signing of an agreement between Russia and the European Union, for example, in conjunction with the election of a new parliament? [Shokhin] I believe that not only the firm position of the Russian delegation but also the events that occurred in September and October were some of the main reasons for the acceleration of the treaty process in Brussels. European Community countries understand that it is unwise to wait until reforms in Russia are crowned with complete success and to begin cranking up the cooperation mechanism only after that. The situation here is quite fluid all the time, and for this reason everything should be done in order to speed up the reforms. In particular, the issue is to give Russia an opportunity to make money by way of its exports rather than count on external financial infusions. I believe that very shortly G-7 and other international organizations should take certain steps in this direction. Therefore, I do not think that the situation will somehow deteriorate because of our domestic events. [Dikun] However, is it ruled out that another Cabinet of Ministers will complete this endeavor on the side of Russia? [Shokhin] The reassignment of cadres in the government could have occurred without the election; the issue is how this government will work with this parliament. There are two possible scenarios. The first is to form a government which has a parliamentary majority. However, given this array, this may be Zhirinovskiy's government. This is why a second scenario is not ruled out--to take advantage of the transitional provisions of the Constitution whereby the current government will continue to discharge its responsibilities without relinquishing its powers before the newly elected Duma or raising the issue of a vote of confidence in itself. Although I personally advocated the latter before, I thought at that time that democratic blocs would be in a majority in the parliament. Of course, some adjustments in the government are possible--not on the principle proposed by Zhirinovskiy, who demands that four, five, or 10 key figures be replaced, but proceeding rather from the need to win over for our side people from politically adjacent parties and movements. Their representatives will have to be included in the government to this end.
