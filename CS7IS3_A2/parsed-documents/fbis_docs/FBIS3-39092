He said such a clause could be applied only when "the European markets have been turned upside-down." French fishermen have staged a series of violent demonstrations and protests against imports of cheap foreign fish, which they say prevent them from earning an adequate living. The safeguard clause authorizes EC authorities to limit or halt imports of goods for limited periods if they are considered to destabilize EC markets to an excessive extent. Delors commented that, "The safeguard clause is used when all the European markets are upside-down, unfair practices are used, and so on. For the time being, we've done everything that is legally possible. Rules are rules, and I can't violate them." He said the EC had adopted minimum prices for some fish imports, "which was not simple because the fishing crisis, for the time being, is concentrated on the Atlantic coast. It is not like the last one, during which several countries were affected." French authorities had said last week that they wanted "safeguard measures" on behalf of French fishermen, such as import quotas or suspensions, import license, and/or other steps. On a more positive note, Delors said, "I am now going to propose to the European Commission that we adopt a program of Community initiative aimed particularly at letting the French fishing industry modernize and adapt to the conditions of the world economy. This program will allow aid to restructuring and in controlling markets.... We hope to enable all French fishermen to adapt to today's conditions."
