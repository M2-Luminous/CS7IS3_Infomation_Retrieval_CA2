Al-Qadhdhafi's envoys suggested that the Kursk power engineers carry out research on the core -- the center -- of a working reactor. But they received a firm refusal. However, the AES press center reported that a protocol of intent to conduct certain joint experiments and to implement a number of projects was nonetheless signed with the Libyan nuclear power workers. The Kursk AES management flatly refused to reveal the sum being received for cooperation with the Libyan Jamahiriyah. It is a commercial secret. But it has been learned from certain sources that it is many times more than $100,000. Al-Qadhdhafi's envoys were able to convince both "Atomenergoeksport" and the Kursk AES management that they have no intention of using nuclear power for anything other than peaceful purposes.
