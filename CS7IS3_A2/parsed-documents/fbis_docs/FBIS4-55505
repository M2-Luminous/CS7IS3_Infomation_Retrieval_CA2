Yesterday, during a session of the Second Congress of Territorial Self-Government, Kulesza publicly informed about his resignation. He was appointed to this post by the previous Council of Ministers, the one chaired by Hanna Suchocka, in the fall of 1992. RZECZPOSPOLITA asked him to explain the reasons for his decision. [Wrobel] Many people expected you to submit your resignation soon after last year's parliamentary elections. [Kulesza] I often heard opinions at that time that the fate of the reform was a foregone conclusion. I faced the following dilemma: Should I look upon myself as a politician of the previous government's people, who were cleaning their desks and leaving, or the other way around--stay with the hope that the issues I dealt with would be continued. [Wrobel] What did you base these hopes on? The new government avoided any declarations on the issue of this reform. What is more, it began its activities by stopping the pilot program in towns and cities. [Kulesza] I believed at the time, and I still do, that the reform is inevitable and that it takes not really bad will but state abnegation to curb it. I did not think there is such a great thirst for power within the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. Of course, if someone has emerged from political nonbeing for the first time in a couple of decades and has passed from a level of village administration to a level of governing the country, certain processes are unavoidable. However, I thought that, after a certain period, things would begin to die down. Reform is a great strategic maneuver that requires time. Those who in December wanted the government to know whether it wants the reform were wrong. The prime minister must not be pinned to the wall: "Unless you reform the state within two weeks, you are stupid." [Wrobel] How is what you called "thirst for power" detrimental to the reform of the administration? [Kulesza] For example, in changing the cadres in the nomenklatura-like style. In the corridors of the Office of the Council of Ministers [URM], one can hear people whispering that this or that guy is coming back to earn additional money to add to his retirement pension. In voivodships, the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is taking part in the division of loot rather modestly, whereas the PSL is filling posts in an extremely brutal manner. I can understand that a voivode may not satisfy the prime minister for some reasons. However, there must be reasons other than pressure of local party elites. The PSL is not changing people because they are the wrong people in those places but, rather, because it has to satisfy the demand for power within the party. First they wanted to change only voivodes, then deputy voivodes, directors of departments, and so on. If one manages to snare such a post, he is followed by a large group of others. Along with people, old ways of governing that we thought we had buried a long time ago are coming back. We are witnessing the process of making the administration political to a gigantic degree. Minister Strak within just a few months recreated a nomenklatura-like model of administration, similar to the one we had in the Polish People's Republic. In doing so, he undid the four-year efforts aimed at making the civil service cadres independent of politics. The thirst for power is also reflected in conceptual thinking. The PSL achieved its greatest success in Poland after 1989. In some configuration, it will rule for the next 15 or 20 years, and, even if it finds itself in the opposition, it will be a very strong opposition. In this situation, it is behaving narrow-mindedly. It realizes that, when powiat [small administrative unit] elections are held, it will take its share, but it will require some efforts. Why get tired, then, its activists seem to be saying, if we are doing very well anyway? [Wrobel] You were not the PSL plenipotentiary; you were the plenipotentiary of the government. The government coalition also includes the SLD, which, as it is known, has a different view of the reform of the administration. [Kulesza] The PSL is employing effective, even though utterly uncivilized, methods in its policy: It is omitting substantive aspects of discussions; it is avoiding any kind of political "scheming" such as: yes, a reform, but in a slightly different manner. The SLD, which seems to be favorably disposed toward the reform, is letting it go at that, just as it is doing on many other issues. It cannot or does not want to get through with its ideas. [Wrobel] Do you not think that curbing the reform may be at least partially caused by the hope that, after the forthcoming elections to gmina [smallest administrative units] councils, more of "our" people will come, and it will be possible to adjust possible changes to them? [Kulesza] I do not acknowledge such reasoning at all. If the belief that "our people are better" were to be a fragment of the state doctrine, it would mean that I have been here a half-year too long. [Wrobel] Why did you decide to resign now? [Kulesza] Recently, the real intentions of the government have become clear. A deputies' initiative was submitted in the Sejm concerning the law on powiats. The Sejm speaker requested the government to take a stand. This was at the beginning of March. On 24 March, I forwarded a positive opinion to the URM head, the prime minister, and the members of the Council of Ministers. I did it of my own accord because, as usual, I was omitted. Today is the middle of May and there is still no answer; the government has not made any decision, nothing has come to the Sejm. What does it mean? [Wrobel] It means, perhaps, that the government has more important issues to deal with now. [Kulesza] One can say so, although one must have a lot of goodwill. Another issue: Early in April, bills concerning the government administration and the state civil service appeared. I did not work on them, either. I prepared a negative opinion because these bills are embarrassing: They are not in line with what is happening in modern democracies; they make the administration political and reduce the state civil service almost to an empty name. No one was interested in this. This is what I had been waiting for. The government's attitude to the powiats, to the reform of the center, and to the state civil service became clear. I dare say that the name of Michal Strak will go down in the history of Poland's administrative system as the person who caused the reforms to collapse. [Wrobel] Do you think Prime Minister Pawlak is "without fault" here? [Kulesza] To me it is understandable that the prime minister is not dealing with everything himself because he has his ministers. Michal Strak is his chief adviser in administrative issues he is in charge of. I dare say that he is fulfilling this function in a manner that is dramatically destructive. [Wrobel] What was your position in the present government? [Kulesza] It was absolutely marginal. For half a year I was not invited by Minister Strak for substantive talks on the functioning of the administration and the reforms. My office was gradually denied the possibilities of acting. I saw an utter lack of interest in the work that had been done thus far. I was often passed up when bills concerning my duties were being prepared. The bills that were drafted somewhere else either reached me or did not. No one cared about my opinions. As far as I know, Minister Strak has organized his own experts' teams, which are not conducting a social discussion. I performed a lot of work that I liked and considered useful. I felt that the minister wanted to take advantage of me as one of his URM civil servants. However, I went there not to be a civil servant but to prepare a basic reform. If the government does not want that, my presence is entirely superfluous. At the meeting before the elections of the self-government people, who are the people of the reforms, I decided to tell them that my mission had been exhausted. I cannot look passively at the program of reforms, which Poland needs, being broken to pieces.
