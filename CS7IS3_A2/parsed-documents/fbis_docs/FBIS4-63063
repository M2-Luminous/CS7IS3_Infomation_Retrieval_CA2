However, Popov expressed his regret that the agreement on the basis of inter-governmental relations between Moldavia and Russia, which was concluded three years ago, has still not been ratified by the Russian parliament. "At the present time, the parliamentary foreign affairs commission is searching for ways out of this dead end together with colleagues in the Russian parliament." The foreign minister confirmed that his country's official stance regarding the 14th Russian Army, stationed in Moldova, has not changed. "We are for the unconditional, complete, and immediate withdrawal of that Army from the Republic's territory." The next round of the Moldovan-Russian talks on the withdrawal of the 14th Army is scheduled to be held at the end of May or the beginning of June, ITAR-TASS was told by the Moldovan Foreign Ministry. The membership of the Moldovan delegation has been significantly altered. The former delegation head, Moldavian Ambassador to Russia Anatoliy Tsaran, resigned his post, and so will probably be replaced by Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolay Osmokescu. ITAR-TASS learned from reliable sources that government and other departmental representatives will also be replaced. This may have a significant effect on the negotiations, which have not witnessed any progress for the past several months, the sources noted. The Russian delegation has tied the withdrawal of the 14th Army with the resolution of the Dniester armed conflict and the granting of special legal status to the Tiraspol-based rebellious region. Reliable sources in the Russian delegation told ITAR-TASS that the previous Moldavian delegation did not have a particularly constructive attitude and was callous towards the Dniester representatives, who were present at the talks as observers.
