Under the bill, parties would own land, buildings and installations, houses, equipment and tools, printing houses, TV and radio stations, money and other property. The party's funds would be made up of entry and membership fees, state subsidies, voluntary donations and proceeds of publishing, educational and other activities.

The political party would be able to pursue electoral campaigns independently or in blocs with other parties. For the duration of the campaign the blocs would have the rights and duties of a political party. Should a party violate the Constitution and legislation, it would be told by the prosecutor's office to stop the illegal activities. A party failing to comply would be suspended for a maximum of six months by a court decision. The parliamentary group in any legislative body made of deputies of a political party that has ceased its activities would be regarded as dissolved.
