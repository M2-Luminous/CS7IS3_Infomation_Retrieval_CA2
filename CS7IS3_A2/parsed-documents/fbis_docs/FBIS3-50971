In the past three years we have worked to overcome the harsh reality I found on 25 February 1990, represented by a destroyed and defeated Nicaragua; with dead people who should never have died in war; with mutilated victims who should never have suffered their misfortune; and with a bombed, sabotaged, and simply abandoned infrastructure with an economy greatly weakened by hyperinflation. We are ending a three-year period which had a very difficult starting point, very different from what I, as president, would have liked to find. It was a reality I could never have imagined, but I decided to face it with a deep sense of historic and patriotic responsibility to save my people from greater suffering. We believed that only with peace and hard work would we be able to overcome whole decades of deterioration. We are ending three years dedicated to putting the house in order, to clean, and to prepare the land that was full of resentment and hatred and damage caused by physical destruction and economic distortions. They have been three years dedicated to sowing the seeds of reconciliation, dialogue, and concerted efforts. We have been sowing the seeds of a healthy economy, free of deceit and illusions. We have been sowing the seeds of public freedoms and political pluralism. We have spent three years taking care of the seedling, preventing it from being destroyed by the numerous enemies who are afraid of anything that smells like life itself and the future. We are ending a tough period which in the past year brought us serious difficulties with a poor harvest adversely affected by a severe rainy season and disadvantageous price conditions for our coffee. We also had to deal with rearmed groups from both sides which resisted joining civilian life and who attacked us with kidnappings in the countryside and the city. We had to face attacks in important cities that left death, pain, and losses. Nicaraguans who love peace and freedom do not share these actions. That is why I think 1993 tested our democratic commitment and our determination to build a new Nicaragua. Despite great difficulties, we promoted the country's reactivation of solidarity, which I initiated last 10 January, when with great confidence and trust I invited you -- honorable representatives, your political parties, associations, labor unions, churches, and everyone -- to promote economic growth in favor of the poor. In 1993, we sowed the country's reactivation. This will allow us to harvest an economic growth of approximately 4 percent in 1994, based on an encouraging growth of 20 percent in agriculture activities and 10 percent in fishing activities. Although it is true that there is a lot to be done, we should be happy to have attained the best rice, bean, corn, soybean, and peanut harvests in the history of our country. We also had a coffee harvest that surpassed 1 million quintals which is the basis to guarantee that the reactivation of coffee in Nicaragua has no way back. In 1993, we sowed solidarity with new social programs to support the unemployed in the rural and urban sectors. More children attended school and more youths went to training centers. In 1994, this will allow for the harvesting of greater stability and greater community participation in the solution of the grave problems we still have to face. In 1993, we also promoted the dialogue like in no other year of my government. It was basically promoted among the political parties. We made substantial progress in the solution of property problems by issuing land titles and making compensation payments. We hope that these specific steps will allow us to harvest greater tolerance, greater consensus, and greater commitment from all with democracy and the de jure system in 1994. In addition to working for reactivation, solidarity, and dialogue in 1993, we also worked to end, once and for all, the political opportunities and moral pretexts of the armed groups that insisted on their mistaken attitude. We reached our goal based on a just combination of forgiveness and amnesty with the firmness of the Public Force. Thus, 1993 has been representative of the first half of my presidential mandate: a period of sowing, working, sacrifice, and struggling so that in the second half -- without ever thinking that we can rest -- we can begin reaping the fruits of the patient sowing season, a time of heroic sacrifices. Today, we begin the next three years of my government convinced that we will devote our time to reaping the fruits of the great effort we have been making. It is an effort that was shared by all, an effort that will continue in the future because we are certain that we sowed peace, democracy, and development. No one can prevent us from legitimately enjoying our daily work. In 1994, we will increase economic growth by sowing the land to guarantee a GNP for 1995. We will increase economic growth by using better our resources from the sea and promoting the fishing industry to increase its production. We will increase economic growth by reactivating the construction, mining, and tourism sectors to create more jobs and promote economic activity, as well as to create greater confidence in our common future. In 1994, we will increase credit volumes for production by 31 percent. More importantly, we will guarantee that this financing will reach the hands of 25,000 new clients to increase the number of beneficiaries by 47 percent compared to the 1993 figure. To do this, we will have special credits for coffee renewal, cattle breeding and development, tourism, and industrial reconversion, as well as unconventional credit programs for small producers in the rural and urban sectors. This will be done through an expansion in the Program To Support the Micro-Enterprise, PANIC [Progama de Apoyo a la Micro-Empresa]. With this program, we will create and strengthen managerial and technical programs for unconventional credit institutions to promote good policies to channel financial resources and guarantee the democratization of credit, thus allowing small rural and urban businessmen to gain access to it. With PANIC, we will also promote the implementation of specific projects and programs to support the microenterprise in an effort to increase their productivity and competitiveness. Thus, we will also increase the revenues of small producers in rural and urban areas. Along with the loans, we will promote public investment, which is a product of the fiscal adjustment efforts we have been carrying out since I took office. Thanks to international cooperation, we are now able to provide the public investment plan with more funds, which will mean a 40 percent increase over last year; this will allow us to create more jobs for the unemployed. As part of this program and as a result of the reactivation of the Housing Bank, we are beginning an ambitious program to build housing throughout the country. This program will begin to yield results this year by meeting the housing needs of large sectors of our society. In 1994 we hope to build some 7,000 homes in 26 cities throughout the country. A large number of private construction companies will participate in this project, which will in turn generate many new jobs in all 26 cities. In 1994 we will also continue working to resolve the land ownership problem. We will issue property deeds for 203,000 manzanas that will benefit 9,000 household, who already have their plots but are waiting for the legal papers. These 203,000 manzanas added to the 140,000 manzanas whose deeds my government has already issued draw us closer to the set goal. Through the next three years we should conclude issuing deeds for 1 million manzanas, which will benefit our farmers. In addition to issuing deeds for agricultural plots, we will continue working in the urban sector by issuing approximately 25,000 new OOT [Office for the Territorial Organization] solutions to the legal owners of urban lots acknowledged by Law No. 86. These 25,000 solutions, added to the 26,000 [word indistinct] already issued, will draw us closer to the 90,000 requests received. I expect to meet this goal by 1995. Next year we will begin issuing the land deeds for these lots; the families that will benefit deserve this. We will also make progress this year with the review of 4,200 homes that were acquired through Law No. 85. This year we want to solve the 10,200 [property ownership] cases pending. Of these cases, 6,000 have been reviewed and 4,300 requests have been approved -- in principle -- in favor of the legitimate beneficiaries. [figures as heard] Parallel to the issuance of agrarian titles and solvencies to new land and house owners, my government will step up the compensation process by issuing bonds to all those whose properties were unfairly confiscated in the last decade and who were not able to get their properties back -- for any of the reasons stipulated in the government program. The bond compensation system has been in effect 10 months and it has proved that, aside from receiving the international community's recognition, it is an efficient means to restore patrimonial losses. Bonds amounting to 630 million cordobas have been issued and accepted as settlement to numerous applications for compensation and more than 150 million cordobas in transactions have been carried out. This represents 24 percent of the issued bonds. These bonds have been used to purchase assets owned by the state -- including enterprises, farms, shares, commercial modules, land, and industrial and farm equipment and spare parts. We will continue to issue bonds in 1994. These bonds will continue to receive strong and solid support with the offer of state-owned assets and real estate that may be purchased with bonds. Bonds may also be used to pay debts owed to state banks and to purchase 40 percent of the telephone company's shares. This sale will allow us to gather at an earlier date -- through weekly public auctions -- certificates whose owners wish to voluntarily negotiate them in exchange for cash. I wish to reassert today that my government is firmly determined to guarantee an offer of assets, as well as mechanisms to use the bonds, in 1994. This will allow the reinstatement of their true financial value. We will manage to repair -- in a better way -- the patrimonial damage sustained by people whose properties have been confiscated in the measure that they manage to wait for the best opportunity to convert their bonds. Credits will be used to support production activities, public investment programs, and solutions to the land ownership problem. Two more contributions will be made for training programs and the transfer of agricultural technology to small producers of basic grains, and to repair the first 180 km of roads in production areas, within the REMACAR [expansion unknown] Program. The former will be handled by the new Institute of Agrarian and Livestock Technology [Insta], which begins its work in January with more than 600 technicians and workers; and the latter, the roads, will be handled by the Ministry of Construction and Transportation, which shall repair a total of 700 km during the second phase of my term, within this same program. Credit and production, public investment and employment, issuance of land titles and compensation, training and road repairs -- all these are factors that should allow us to strengthen peace, democracy, and development in 1994. We have the [words indistinct] confirm the existence of a new geothermal source in our country -- in the Malpaisillo zone. This brings us great hope for the nation's geothermal development and the beginning of a major tourism activity in Montelimar and certain zones of Granada, Masaya, Carazo, Rivas, and Rio San Juan. This will offer numerous opportunities to the Nicaraguan economy. Nonetheless, my commitment does not end with the (?gold) of recovery. It is in solidarity with the poorest, the unemployed, and those affected by natural phenomena. In 1993 the implementation of a community participation (?structure) yielded 97 development committees in an equal number of municipalities so that these groups could present the social needs of their communities to the presidency of the Republic in an orderly fashion. In this manner, I complied with what I spoke about one year ago in this same hall when I said that participation with solidarity would be one of the most important social policy bases. In 1994 we are going to strengthen the participation of the citizens even more, particularly in the rural areas, so that those who receive the benefits are the ones who will exercise their social [word indistinct] and will watch over the development and maintenance of the social works that this government has launched. With regard to employment, it is important to mention that in 1994 we will use the established bases for working jointly with the municipal mayoralties in a series of programs that, in addition to increasing employment, will allow the continuity of specific works for the benefit of community development. Mayors throughout the country with various political ideas can attest to the (?initial) answers my government gave in 1993 to the unemployment situations in their towns. We did not solve all of them, but we have prepared the basis for a methodology that in 1994 will duplicate the results for the benefit of more unemployed people, providing temporary employment to some 24,000 persons each month throughout the nation through the Social Action Ministry. In addition, the Basic Grains Bank will be expanded and improved in 1994, and it will become more efficient so that the farmers who do not have access to formal credit will receive benefits in this alternate system that supports production. We will also continue with the Emergency Fund for Social Investments, FISE -- strengthened with new donations and financing -- which will redouble its work for rehabilitating social infrastructures and provide employment in the 1,000 projects we will implement this year in the 143 municipalities of the country. As president, I am convinced that the most important thing now is to increase production and ensure that the private sector becomes the motor for our country's development. Nonetheless, I want to point out that -- as a member of private enterprise -- I also understand the small coffee producers of La Dahlia, the small corn producers of Matiguas, and the man who owns a small workshop or produces our beautiful national crafts. For me, all of them are members of private enterprise. In 1994 we will emphasize support for the small producer so that he will play a more dynamic role in the economic development of the country, in the same manner as large producers. We will provide support to the small producer through the financing that has been approved for this human network of organizations, cooperatives, nongovernmental organizations, [word indistinct] circles, poles of development, and other forms of associations that we have managed to organize in the last two years. The foundations have already been established. The year 1994 will be the year we will begin to enjoy the results of this initiative. During the past few months I had the opportunity to meet and talk with numerous owners of small farms, cooperative members, mothers' associations [asociaciones de madres], development committees, doctors, nurses, teachers, and other professionals. We inaugurated numerous projects, especially schools and health centers. All these contacts gave me an opportunity to learn what the Nicaraguan people really want. They genuinely want [word indistinct] and work. Before, they wanted peace and reconciliation. From as distant a place as Isla de Ometepe to Rio Blanco, from the community of Cardenas to [word indistinct], from the city of Juigalpa to Jinotega, from Brooklyn to Chinandega the message was always the same: Mrs. Chamorro, we are now at peace, now we need to produce. In listening to these simple words from a population that does not have access to the media, cannot voice its concern in the newspapers, and whose faces do not appear on television newscasts, I have given instructions for 1994 to be a year of cooperation for production. In this respect we will jointly be able to cut the level of unemployment and advance in a parallel direction along with the economic take-off toward progress with less poverty. As to education, we plan to continue increasing the number of schools twice as fast as the growth rate in the student population. During 1994, the student population is expected to increase by 3 percent, but we expect to increase the number of schools by 6 percent. This means that the 1,000,070 students registered during 1993 will increase by 63,000 students. The student population is expected to total 1.123 million during 1994. Nevertheless, we are not satisfied with merely increasing student registration, we are also seeking to cut the drop-out rate. That is why we will continue to pay special attention to the primary grades and give them preferential attention as well as maintain the glass of milk program. We also plan to implement teacher improvement programs. In addition, we will continue to promote education decentralization in order to ensure that the state will efficiently continue its role of regulating national education, and for the communities, parents, and teachers to directly participate in the performance and management of their respective educational centers. Through this we expect to encourage full participative democracy and honor Article 118 of the current political Constitution which calls for wide-ranging community participation in the education process. In the health sector, I must say that following the [words indistinct] the government program, an improvement in medical attention to those insured. Today, I can say to all Nicaraguan workers that the health and medical program which they have been expecting for the past 15 years has finally become a reality. The new social security model went into effect at the end of the past year through duly authorized provisional medical centers already operating in Granada, Masaya, and Managua. We expect to extend this type of medical facility throughout the country. This new form of medical attention for workers, which the state and the private sector initiative are jointly operating, is the formula we have developed which allows us to work and solve the just and simple needs of a population that contributes and makes payments to the Nicaraguan social security system. In order for it to improve, be objective, and grow with [words indistinct], it must be combined with environmental protection programs, as well as the defense of our national patrimony. From the beginning of my administration, I placed special emphasis on conserving and managing the environment like no other president had ever attempted in the history of our country. In spite of the difficult social and economic challenges we face, we have been analyzing and approving plans aimed at strengthening viable development and rational utilization of natural resources and at protecting the environment. I have been backed by the municipal governments, peasants, producers, environmental protection organizations, ecologists, and the people, and during the past three years of democratic work we have created environmental awareness at an unprecedented level in Nicaragua. Many friendly governments have contributed to this effort and specialized international agencies have unselfishly given us technical assistance and financial support to promote many ecological development proejcts. The same is true for the United Nations. We attended the Earth Summit in Brazil to reaffirm our vocation for peace between man and nature. We are in favor of conciliating production needs and environmental protection. Now, as a specific manifestation of my political will to back suitable efforts in favor of the environment, we are transforming the Environment and Natural Resources Institute, which this year will celebrate its 15th anniversary, into the Environment and Natural Resources Ministry. I trust that with the cooperation of all Nicaraguans we will be able to responsibly set in motion, with our eyes on the future, a strategy capable of transforming Nicaragua into an ecologically ordered, environmentally clean, and economically prosperous country. I hope that what we are starting now will help the entire nation and last forever. All the plans in favor of production, social solidarity, and environmental protection are not enough. Justice and strength must go hand in hand with these plans. Corruption, smuggling, tax evasion, jewelry thieves, armed bands, and criminals must be persecuted. The work of the police and the Army has been very important in recent times to guarantee the citizens' security, especially in the countryside. Security has been threatened by armed bands that unfortunately still exist. Our authorities will always vigorously fight these bands, which are engaged in pillaging, attacks, kidnappings, and interrupting harvests. Many policemen and Army officers and soldiers have died in this struggle to return peace and security to the people who live in the Nicaraguan countryside. Today I want to posthumously acknowledge those who have died in defense of the law and the Constitution and to fully back the police and the Army in their pacification endeavor. This year we will strengthen the Army with a new organic law that should bolster its professionalization process, depoliticize the process for electing its officials, and offer guarantees to the men and women who, with an exalted sense of fatherland, dedicate their lives to serving the nation. Force must remain under the influence of justice and this is why we are going to work as much as we can for a new Supreme Court of Justice that should begin functioning this year and increase the level of respect for the law throughout the national territory. The appointment of new officials at the Attorney General's Office, as well as the fact that this week we will send a list of distinguished professionals to the National Assembly from which a new comptroller general of the Republic will be chosen, should be seen as a renewed effort by my government to guarantee stability, bolster the establishment of a state of law, and consolidate the full enjoyment of public liberties in our country -- ideals that have motivated my actions as president since 1990. During these years, my government has tirelessly sought to achieve national stability and harmony between the different political and social forces so that together we can work for the common well-being, the strengthening of democracy, the termination of the last remains of the war, and the best solutions to overcome the economic crisis. I have always been aware of the fact that without stability there is no prospect for economic growth. It is not easy to govern a country that is still dominated by the sequels of war and political confrontation. However, agreements have been reached thanks to good will. Today, before you, I wish to praise the patriotic efforts that have produced recent agreements to grant stability to the operation of this National Assembly and bring stability to Nicaragua as well. I wish to offer my personal recognition to all the honorable representatives of the National Assembly who are here today, and to those who have already stated their willingness to undertake their parliamentary tasks later, in order to responsibly assume the popular mandate they received on 25 February 1990. I am not referring to the voices of those who continue to insist on confrontation from outside this National Assembly, but to those who, like you, have made an effort to end the irrational polarization. Today we will introduce changes to the composition of the Board of Directors [of the National Assembly], as I have been told, and this fills me with joy because this deed conveys a clear will for understanding. I salute this will and applaud it along with the people of Nicaragua. Therefore, I must give special recognition to Dr. Gustavo Tablada Zelaya for his meritorious work as president of the Legislative corps and for his detached and patriotic contribution to the normalization of the National Assembly. I also recognize the members of the four blocs that broke the political inertia and were able to reach these agreements for the well-being of Nicaragua. The people will know how to recognize these patriotic contributions to the national stability. My wish is that all the representatives to this National Assembly may fully integrate themselves with the tasks of the legislature that begins today and to give Nicaragua good laws, which is what Nicaragua needs. To remain outside has no sense or justification. I also applaud the initiative aimed at introducing partial reforms to the Constitution. I will closely follow the discussion process, and my government, in line with mutual respect for the state governments' independence, will try to contribute with its own criteria to enrich the contents of the reforms. My aspiration is that the constitutional reforms will be for the good of strengthening national stability and institutions, not to weaken or divide them, and so that democracy will move on a better course and so that democratic continuity will be guaranteed through honest and fair electoral processes. I want to state here that my government supports the changes in the Constitution through partial reforms. Since the nation's main political forces have been debating diverse positions and mechanisms to reform or change the Constitution, I, as president of the Republic, must express my position on this issue in order to inform the Legislative Assembly and the community. The program that my government is obliged to fulfill has the following main objectives, among others: first, the establishment of a state of law, exercising full democracy and social justice; second, the reaching of a national consensus [words indistinct] to strengthen reconciliation among Nicaraguans and overcome the nation's overall crisis; third, the creation of a government that is essentially civilian, republican, democratic, and representative, based on the nation's unity. Within those principles and within the framework of the political, economic, and social reality Nicaragua is experiencing, the government must unquestionably support all the corresponding Constitutional reforms and [words indistinct] in keeping with those objectives and these realities. These reforms should be conceived with patriotic goals in mind for the community and the nation's well-being, without taking into account party interests. These reforms should seek to create a wise and lasting Constitution that reflects the Nicaraguan people's true values, ideals, and feelings; it should not just respond to mere passing situations. We should seek a Constitution that is the result of a national consensus in which the people are given the opportunity to express their points of view as a significant contribution in a participant democracy. Therefore, these constitutional reforms should be serious, [word indistinct], and responsible. We cannot ignore the historical opportunity we are offered to draw up a frank and open Constitution through public dialogue. In my opinion, the call to hold elections for a constituent assembly is not ideal or timely. To dissolve this Legislative Assembly as some wish means the interruption of the people's will at a high economic cost that the nation is not in a position to assume. Some also say that a constituent assembly must not only totally change the Constitution, it must also end, ahead of time, the presidential term. This type of criteria does not represent a willingness for peace but a willingness for confrontation. The presidential term ends on 10 January 1997. It is my intention to hand over my office to whomever is freely elected in the presidential elections to be held in November 1996. Respect for the presidential term [words indistinct] presidential mandate as a result of free elections, is one of the great contributions that [word indistinct] must make for Nicaragua's democratization. We start this year by promising it will be better than last year; there are good signs of an improving economy. To attempt to launch the people in a political campaign now is to take away their right to a break and improvement. The holding of elections for a constituent assembly would polarize the community once again, and it would open wounds that still have not been totally closed. It would hold back economic reactivation so longed for in these past three years that has had very high costs and meant big sacrifices. I propose to these parties or political groups still bent on this idea to give the people a political truce. Let us respect their right to a breather and to an opportunity to unite efforts for progress. Instead of talking about elections, confrontations, and political struggles, let us talk about working; let us talk about production and order; let us talk about fighting unemployment and reconciling ourselves; let us talk about unity so that we can overcome the problems we are confronting. The Nicaraguan people are entitled to have their wishes respected, to be in a better situation. Violence, as well as the calls for violence, must cease once and for all. I invite the Nicaraguan people -- men and women -- to work together for peace and stability, harmony, democracy, and progress in our families. We all have a place in this joint effort to build a new Nicaragua with our faith in God and with a spirit filled with reconciliation. Thank you, dear friends of the Legislative Assembly. [applause]
