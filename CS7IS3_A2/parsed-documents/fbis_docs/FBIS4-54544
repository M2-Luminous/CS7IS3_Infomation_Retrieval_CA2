If You Do, When Will This Issue Be Timely, and Which Forum Should Decide on Entering It?"] [Text] Gyula Thurmer, Workers' Party: The Workers' Party does not approve of Hungary's membership in NATO; in fact, it opposes it in any form. In Parliament, we will propose that Hungary leave the Partnership for Peace program and send home the AWACS planes and all foreign soldiers who are stationed in Hungary. The NATO issue will have to be taken to a referendum immediately after the May elections. Zsolt Rajkai, United Smallholders Party: We approve of Hungary's intention of gaining NATO membership. Our NATO membership is a timely issue already now. Hungary's sovereignty has two possibilities, either neutrality or membership in a military bloc. Obviously, it is not enough for a country to declare its neutrality; worldwide guarantees are also needed for this. However, this is not a well-founded hope. Therefore, it is our vital interest to belong to a military bloc. At the same time, we would consider a pan- European military cooperation agreement ideal. In addition to NATO membership, our efforts are directed toward this. Istvan Szent-Ivanyi, Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]: For the SZDSZ, Hungary's NATO membership is a strategic goal. It is our vital interest to integrate ourselves organically in the European and Euro-Atlantic organizations. NATO is not exclusively a defense organization, it is also a forum for security policy and foreign policy coordination. Our membership is also important for the reason that, in addition to the European member states, it also ensures links with the United States and Canada. A period of preparations is needed for full membership and the Partnership for Peace program is a good opportunity for this. We would like to achieve full membership in a few years' time. We do not think a referendum on our membership is vitally important; however, we will not reject it if there is a broad demand for this in society. Lajos Horvath, Hungarian Justice and Life Party [MIEP]: Yes, the MIEP approves of Hungary's request for NATO membership. This would bring significant political, economic, and military advantages for Hungary. It would mean a much quicker access to the various orgnizations of the world, and the extension of the NATO umbrella over Hungary. Due to Hungary's economic and military political situation, all these are clearly needed. At the same time, we have to recognize the fact that NATO membership would have all kinds of consequences, and meeting the various requirements would entail much sacrifice from the people. For this reason, only a referendum can decide this issue. The time: as soon as possible. However, full membership is only a desirable goal at the moment, and before this can be achieved, we have to concentrate on building a strong economy and a combat-worthy army. Ferenc Inotay, Christian Democratic People's Party: 1. I approve of and agree with Hungary's membership in NATO. Effectively, Hungary's security is not guaranteed by anything other than a promise to help, on the level of sympathy. Our NATO membership will document the 1,000-year-old fact that Hungary is part of the Western Christian world. For the peoples of the Carpathian basin, NATO membership will result in reducing tensions (that have been simmering underground since the end of World War I), and in creating peace in the minds of people of various native languages and nationalities. NATO membership will also ensure technical development for Hungary both in the military and in the civilian production spheres. 2. To the timeliness, my answer is that it would have already been good yesterday, but today is not too late, either. NATO membership is not attractive for the remaining domestic leadership or that in the neighboring countries which was brought up on Soviet world-dominating ideas; therefore, these leaders do all they can to delay it as much as possible or cancel it altogether. It is also urgent to achieve NATO membership to nullify this influence and make it impossible. The revival of the imperial and power attitude in Russia, which endangers us as well as NATO, can speed up the approval of our NATO membership and can make it cheaper. Due to our geopolitical situation, our membership will also be in the interest of NATO. If we cannot bear the financial burdens of an early NATO membership, NATO might take on these financial burdens in the form of aid, and turn it into the financing of a NATO interest, which will make this more likely. 3. Hungary's NATO membership is a decision of great importance and a commitment that will determine our future for a long time; therefore, it can only be decided in a general referendum. Szabolcs Baross, Republic Party: At the moment, all European and transatlantic organizations and institutions are in a state of flux. For us, there is no alternative to the European Community as an economic integration. However, in the view of the Republic Party, out of the security policy organizations -- NATO and the Western European Union -- it would be too soon to institutionalize our contacts with either of them. Rather, we should concentrate on establishing our ability as soon as possible to link to the already existing organizations and the possibly emerging new cooperations. In our view, membership in the big integrations is a major issue that requires a referendum. Zoltan Kiraly, Social Democratic Party of Hungary: For the country's security, the most important task is to improve and deepen the economic, political, and cultural links with the neighboring countries and the states of the Central-Eastern European region in a broader sense, and where this is not possible, continuously to handle the conflict. In our view, relations with NATO are an important element of Hungarian security policy, but we reject all such attempts that would suggest the shifting of responsibility to somewhere else, in other words, attempts that "seek protection from others" instead of trying to solve the undoubtedly complicated problems. It is timely to establish political and professional contacts with NATO, but not membership. A referendum will have to decide on membership.
