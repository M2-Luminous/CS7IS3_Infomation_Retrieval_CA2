Zagreb--Brcko was occupied on 30 April 1992. At dawn, at 0445, the Serbian army blew up the highway and railroad bridge across the Sava, and blocked all approaches to the city. The Croatian and Muslim population was expelled en masse, and the forces of the HVO [Croatian Defense Forces] and what was then the Bosnia-Herzegovina Territorial Defense consolidated lines of defense in the suburbs of Kozara, Rijeka, Brod, and others. In the face of a strong Serbian offensive, however, they withdrew further south to a line at the level of Dizdarusa, and in the spring of 1993 were driven even further south, to the present lines of defense. The HVO, assisted by units of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army, penetrated in September 1992 into the western part of the municipality, liberating the villages of Markovic Polje, Gorica, and part of Krepsic west of Brcko. Two days later, in the face of a strong Serbian offensive, they had to withdraw to their original positions. Not even a second attempt to liberate those areas, near the end of October 1992, was successful. In a violent counterattack, the Serbian forces compelled the HVO units to withdraw several kilometers further south (Poljaci-Ulovic), where they are located today. Military analysts' assessments published in the press about the current balance of power differ, from those saying that the Serbs have deployed three reinforced army corps (about 30,000 soldiers) in that area, to information about 70,000 or more Serbian soldiers. Along with others, the Serbs allegedly have more than 25 infantry brigades there and powerful equipment: 50 tanks, 100 armored personnel carriers, 200 heavy cannons, about 30 heavy-caliber multiple rocket launchers, and surface-to-surface missiles. What Is the Corridor? According to those assessments, the Bosnia-Herzegovina forces have a numerical advantage in personnel, but are considerably behind technically. The so-called Serbian corridor, a narrow zone of about 20 kilometers that links Serbia and the occupied areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina in the east with the occupied parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia in the west, is narrowest in parts of the Orasje and Brcko municipalities. The city of Brcko is somewhat more than four kilometers away from the northern limits of the free territory, while the width of the corridor's Orasje-Brcko section is about eight kilometers. At that point the main road approaches the line of defense by less than one kilometer, and traffic can even be threatened by infantry weapons. In that case the Serbs use nearby roads. On the southern side of the corridor, there are mostly Bosnia-Herzegovina Army (the Tuzla Corps) units and one HVO brigade, whose zone of responsibility was the most attacked area during the last Serbian offensive. Also, to the north of Orasje there are several HVO brigades that withdrew from the occupied cities of Bosanska Posavina. The Serbs conducted the strongest offensive since the conquest of the corridor from 11 to 24 April 1994. Against Boderiste alone, a village on the south side of the corridor within the zone of responsibility of the 108th HVO Infantry Brigade, they fired about 20,000 heavy artillery rounds, and carried out about 20 violent infantry attacks against that defense point. Prior to that, the free area of Brcko had been fairly strongly attacked in July 1993. Brcko and Orasje According to the last census, more than 87,000 residents lived in Brcko, of whom 25.4 percent were Croats, 44.4 percent were Muslims, 20.8 percent were Serbs, and 9.5 percent were others. Of the 51 municipal settlements, 26 had a Croatian majority, and of the total of almost 500 square kilometers of municipal land, the Croats were the registered owners of 44.4 percent. The Serbian corridor passes through 10 Brcko Croatian settlements, while 16 of the rest of them are free. In the occupied part of the Brcko municipality there are only three settlements that had a Serbian majority before the war (Potocari, Brezik Donji, and Grbavica). According to the 1991 census, there were more than 28,000 residents in the Orasje municipality, of whom 75.3 percent were Croats, 15 percent were Serbs, 6.7 percent were Muslims, and 3 percent were others. Almost all the settlements with a Croatian majority were defended. In the area of the eight Posavina municipalities (Bosanski Brod, Bosanski Samac, Brcko, Derventa, Gradacac, Modrica, Odzak, Orasje, and the northern parts of the Doboj municipality), not one is completely free, however. The total area of the eight municipalities is more than 2,400 square kilometers, with 361,000 inhabitants (128,700 Croats, 104,800 Muslims, and 100,300 Serbs). In any case, according to the territorial proposal of the Vance-Owen plan, the Croatian province of Bosanska Posavina would encompass 2,103 square kilometers, in which there would live 142,400 Croats (56 percent), 47,300 Muslims (18 percent), 41,000 Serbs (16 percent), and 23,500 others (9 percent). In that unit, as data from the HVO Office in Orasje show, 83 percent of the land would be registered to Croats and Muslims. During the Serbian attacks and occupation, Posavina suffered enormous damage: According to the HVO data published a year ago, during the occupation of Posavina 2,446 defenders and more than 1,500 civilians died, and there were 2,600 orphans left. Also, 8,000 people were wounded, 500 of whom remained invalids. According to the same source, about 120,000 inhabitants were driven out of Posavina. Data from the Vrhbosanska Diocese indicate that of the 46 Catholic parishes in the area of northern Bosnia with 160,010 believers, only seven parishes have not been (completely) occupied. Previously 44,104 believers lived in them, who, however, have mostly left their homes because of the "constant firing." Several dozen villages and several cities have been completely destroyed, 25 churches have been ruined or damaged, about 50 factories have been destroyed, four bridges have been ruined, and a rich livestock inventory has been destroyed. There are also two oil refineries in Bosanska Posavina, in Modrica and Bosanski Brod, both in occupied territory.
