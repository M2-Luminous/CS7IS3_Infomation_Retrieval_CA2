Restricted current-account transactions will be reduced from the current 109 categories of 61, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. The planned reduction of categories on the "negative list," from the current 109 to 61, will enhance the liberalization of current-account transactions to the level of members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a grouping of advanced nations, the ministry said. Of the 34 categories of current-account transactions requiring approval from the Bank of Korea, the ministry said, the central bank will entrust commercial banks with the authority to validate 25 categories. The central bank will continue to retain the authority to approve nine categories of current-account transactions for fear that they may be exploited as channels of illegal foreign exchange out-flow, the ministry said. Categories of current-account transactions requiring the approval of the Bank of Korea is rarely, if ever, permitted by the central bank, said an official from the ministry. They include payments for overseas travel in excess of $5,000 and remittances in excess of $5,000 as gifts, the ministry said. Categories that will remain on the negative list include current-account transactions relating to gambling and drug trafficking, the ministry said. The liberalization of capital movements, which will add 15 new categories of capital movements to the "positive list" of 103 categories of capital movements that can be conducted without the approval of the Bank of Korea, will ease restrictions on borrowing money abroad, the ministry said. Domestic businesses will be allowed to borrow money abroad to finance their overseas advertisements, the ministry said. Last year, domestic businesses spent $200 million in overseas advertisements, all of which was brought from their headquarters in the nation because of the regulations on capital movements, the ministry said. The government will also permit domestic businesses to borrow money abroad to explore oil and other resources in foreign countries, the ministry said. To borrow money abroad for such overseas projects, it said, domestic businesses are required to have those projects validated by their designated domestic banks. Overseas branches and locally incorporated subsidiaries of domestic corporations will be allowed to borrow money abroad to make commissions or advance payments for their trades in overseas futures markets, the ministry said. But the government will strengthen its supervision on overseas financing to prevent funds raised abroad from being brought into the nation, the ministry said. Among the new 15 categories of capital movements that will no longer require approval from the central bank are debt-payment guarantees by domestic exporters to foreign importers seeking to borrow money from domestic banks, and loans provided in Korean won by a resident to a resident and payable in foreign currencies. The central bank will entrust commercial banks with the authority to approve 13 of the 26 categories of capital movements that currently require approval from the central bank, the ministry said. They include transactions conducted between residents and involving the movement of $100,000 or less, including the trade of bonds payable in foreign currencies, the ministry said. The government will ease restrictions on the settlement of exports and imports, the ministry said. Domestic exporters will be allowed to receive advance payments for their exports beyond the set limits on condition that excess advance payments are deposited with overseas branches of domestic foreign exchange banks, the ministry said. Currently, the government restricts such advance payments to 10 percent of the value of exports in the previous year for small- and medium-sized companies and 3 percent for large corporations. The government is restricting advance payments on the grounds that they are no different from bank loans from abroad, the ministry said. In view of growing bilateral trade and exchanges between Korea and China, the ministry said, the Korean government will add the Chinese currency to the list of "designated foreign currencies" for freer conversion into and from the Korean currency. The government will no longer distinguish 589 Class A foreign exchange banks, permitted to engage in all types of foreign exchange business, from 2,009 Class B foreign exchange banks which are restricted to domestic foreign exchange business, the ministry said. Banks will be allowed to choose foreign exchange business areas for their branches on their own discretion, the ministry said. The government will allow resident individuals to buy foreign currencies within the limit of their foreign currency sales during the previous three months, the ministry said. But the daily limit to foreign currency purchases by the same person will be $50,000, the ministry said, adding that individuals will be allowed to hold an unlimited amount of foreign currencies on condition that they report foreign currency holdings in excess of $450,000 to their foreign exchange bank.
