Lysenko views the signing of the treaty by Russia's political elite as an important step toward civic accord and a breakthrough in public conscience. Lysenko hopes there will be no more revolutions in Russia. Society embarks of a period of evolutional development. He believes the treaty may offer an opportunity of political stability in a country for at least two years. Political competition will be manifested in parliamentary and presidential elections, not through violent non-parliamentary actions. Lysenko apparently decided to give the news conference because of the situation that formed as a result of the Republican Party's joining the treaty while leaders of the group Yabloko in which the party is included refused to do so. It should be noted that representatives of the Republican Party were elected to the state duma on the ticket of Yabloko bloc.
