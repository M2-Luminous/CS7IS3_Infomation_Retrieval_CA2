Nuclear nonproliferation and human rights have been at the top of his agenda. There has been no headway in promoting either. While Warren Christopher met his Waterloo in Beijing as far as human rights are concerned, his chief found North Korea a tough customer on nonproliferation. From the U.S. point of view, therefore, the need to embark on a bout of aggressive diplomacy in South Asia is all the greater. This is the backdrop of the visit of Strobe Talbott to New Delhi as Clinton's troubleshooter. If at least there was even a hint of progress in the many rounds of Indo-U.S. talks that have already taken place in recent months, Talbott could be expected to try and improve matters with significant overtures. But that is assuredly not the case, with Robin Raphel's endeavours having yielded invisible results. Talbott, in other words, is faced with the onerous task of convincing New Delhi of the inherent virtues of the Clinton administration's approach to the Indo-Pakistani conflict. But the worst way of making any headway is to offer saccharin-coated lollipops to India. Strobe Talbott, apart from being a high-ranking State Department official, is also a scholar and a former journalist. He should know better than career diplomats that devising formulae that may look attractive on paper will make no dent whatsoever in India's security concerns. These concerns have been influenced as much by India's history and geography as by the bitter experience of having to deal with a neighbour which has waged three wars to annex Kashmir, and which it could do entirely because of its colossal military arsenal supplied by successive regimes in Washington. Total American unconcern for New Delhi's apprehensions born, first, of the circumstances of Pakistan's birth and, later, of U.S. help in nurturing a virtual counterweight to India, persist. Otherwise, it is hard to see how the policy-makers in Washington could even imagine that India would have evinced the slightest interest in the package that has been purposefully leaked to THE WASHINGTON POST. According to the paper, the package provides for verified Pakistani capping of its production of weapons-grade nuclear material, U.S. lifting of the Pressler Amendment to clear the sale of F-16s to Pakistan, and an Indian agreement to give up its Prithvi and Agni missiles in response to Islamabad's restraint on nukes. To ask India to accept this package is to ask it to sign its own death warrant. If, indeed, Talbott plans to present this package to South Block, it only means that even a man of his experience and knowledge is, in effect, a stranger to this country. He is being wilfully naive in believing that Benazir Bhutto's support for the package qualifies it automatically for Indian endorsement. All together, it seems a clear case of diplomatic bankruptcy.
