FR940613-0-00126 FR940613-0-00016 In newly designated §552.24, introductory text is amended to further clarify when four-point restraints may be used. In paragraph (a), ``vinyl'' is substituted for ``leather.'' Additional editorial amendments to this section make no change in the intent of the regulation. Newly designated §552.25 is amended for editorial purposes. There is no change in the intent of the regulation. Newly designated §552.26 is revised to specify the role of medical staff in calculated use of force situations. Paragraph (a) is also amended to include provisions specifically applicable to pregnant inmates. Newly designated §552.27 is reworded, although its intent is unchanged. The Bureau believes that the changes to the interim rule discussed above do not impose additional restrictions on inmates and are necessary in order to provide for the continued protection of inmates, staff, and property. The Bureau therefore finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of further proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date for these additional changes. The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866; this rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to E.O. 12866. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 552 Prisoners. Kathleen M. Hawk, Director, Bureau of Prisons.
