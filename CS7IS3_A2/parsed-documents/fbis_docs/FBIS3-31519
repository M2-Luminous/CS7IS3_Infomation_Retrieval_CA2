The document expresses high appreciation for the efforts of the United Nations, NATO, the United States, and Russia, which although somewhat belated have demonstrated that acceptable solutions to alleviate the conflict can be achieved on the basis of coordinated efforts. As a country closely situated near the area of the conflict and bearing a heavy share of the burden imposed by the international sanctions, the Republic of Bulgaria has a vital interest in promptly finding a just and lasting solution of the conflict, the declaration further reads. The declaration points out that in confirming its resolve of not interfering in the armed conflict, the Republic of Bulgaria once again expresses its readiness to support all international efforts aimed at a peaceful and just solution of the conflict on the territory of former Yugoslavia.
