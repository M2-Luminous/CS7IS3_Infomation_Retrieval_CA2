The current situation makes it almost impossible to preserve key capacities for defense technology and to deepen armament cooperation in the European Union [EU]. Speaking to the participants in the annual meeting of the Defense Technology Association, Schoenbohm said that Bonn is striving for an agreement with France, Italy, and England about which countries are to be excluded from supplies with armament goods and in which countries armament goods may be delivered. Unfortunately, the positions are still far apart, both because of economic interests as well as because of ideological differences. Germany cannot uncouple itself by pointing to its "special" moralism, its past, or the Constitution when Europe's security is involved. "Do we want to found a new German special way of moralism by pointing to this past?" Schoenbohm asked. It is necessary to remain a reliable partner of the international community. Specific security policy action is oriented toward interests. Schoenbohm pointed out that the German defense budget went down by 18 percent from 1989-93 if the inflation rate is taken into consideration. In 1995, the decline will probably grow to 25 percent. Since cutbacks of personnel and operations are hardly possible, saving was affected all the more in financial means for investments and research. From 1989-93, these means went down by 43 percent and will have declined by 55 percent by 1995. By 1995, the means available for procurement will even be 60 percent lower than those in 1989. The decline in orders by the Bundeswehr caused German armament industry to lose half of the 280,000 jobs by the end of last year. This year and next year, industry expects the loss of another 40,000 to 60,000 jobs. Schoenbohm also thinks that this development is dangerous because the imminent loss of armament technology skills in key branches creates undesirable dependence on other states and destroys the preconditions for having Germany participate in cooperation projects in the field of armament. After all, an efficient German armament industry is also an essential element for Germany's ability to function in the Alliance. The state secretary said that the future of German armament industry lies in systems technology and high technology, command and weapons operations systems, sensors, and electronics. Together with the industry, the Defense Ministry is trying to work out the minimum capacities in defense technology, predict their utilization during the planning period, and determine fields of equipment that must be taken care of at all costs. In the future, aspects of armament technology and armament economics will be taken into account in Bundeswehr planning to a greater extent than so far, the state secretary said.
