As is known, the last indexation of the minimum wage amount (minimum wage) was carried out on 1 December 1993, at which time it amounted to 14,620 rubles. We are coming to the end of the sixth month and everything is just as in the past. It is as though the cost of living is not rising. Officials of Minfin [Ministry of Finance] officially stated, in behalf of the government, that the minimum will best be reviewed during the third quarter, when it will reach the level of the present minimum pension. Thus, just as in the past, the authorities will solve the budget problems by means of hired workers. In this regard, it is worth citing several state statistical figures. The average monthly wage during the first quarter of 1994 was 146,000 rubles and compared to the same period for last year this represented an increase by a factor of 7.5, with prices increasing by more than a factor of eight. In December, the difference between the minimum wage and the average national economic wage amounted to a factor of 9.5 and in March -- 11. And the lag in the minimum wage compared to the minimum living wage, during the same period, was 3.3 in December and 4.8 in March respectively. It is regrettable that low income workers are the group most affected by the freezing of the minimum wage. In this regard, FITUR was recently forced to turn to Premier V. Chernomyrdin a third time, since the previous appeals (in March and April) on indexation of the minimum wage were declined by the Ministry of Finance. The arguments put forth by the Russian Federation Ministry of Finance regarding reindexation were in our opinion invalid: the proportion of the minimum wage in the minimum living wage of an able-bodied citizen declined in December 1993, compared to January of the same year, from 34.8 percent to 30.3, and continues to decline. FITUR views the existing situation as a direct violation of the Russian Federation law entitled "Minimum Wage Amount" and also as non-fulfillment of the general agreement between the all-Russian associations of trade unions, the all-Russian associations of employers and the government of the Russian Federation for 1994, in the section dealing with the "maximum possible approach of the minimum wage amount to the actual value for the minimum living wage." This increases social tension in society and lowers the level of confidence in the government. In behalf of member organizations, FITUR has proposed that the government declare its readiness to monitor the signed agreement regarding social accord and the general agreement for 1994 and to resolve the question regarding the establishment, commencing 1 May 1994, of a minimum wage in the amount of 40,000 rubles and a wage rate of the first category ETS [Unified Wage Rate] in the amount of 42,000 rubles.
