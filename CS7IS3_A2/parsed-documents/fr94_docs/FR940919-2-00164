FR940919-2-00164 FR940919-2-00069 [Release No. 34&hyph;34655; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;28] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment No. 1 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Real Estate Investment Trusts Market Index Target-Term Securities September 12, 1994. I. Introduction On July 15, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''), 3 the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities (``REIT Portfolio'') of U.S. real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on August 11, 1994. 4 The Exchange filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change on August 25, 1994. 5 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the proposal, as amended. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 ``MITTS'' is a registered service mark and ``Market Index Target-Term Securities'' is a service mark of Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (``Merrill Lynch''). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34492 (August 5, 1994), 59 FR 60227 (August 11, 1994). 5 In Amendment No. 1, the Exchange proposes to: (1) Provide that dividends paid on a component security will be included in calculating both the daily values of the REIT Portfolio and the Total Return Portfolio Value (as defined herein), regardless of any subsequent corporate event (such as insolvency) that would effect the value of the common stock of that component REIT; and (2) amend the formula for determining the weightings of the portfolio components in the Original Portfolio Value (as defined herein) to provide that no component may represent more than 10 percent of the Original Portfolio Value. See Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated August 25, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). II. Description of the Proposal Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, and warrants. 6 The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the REIT Portfolio (``REIT Portfolio MITTS''). 7 6 See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29229 (May 23, 1991), 56 FR 24852 (May 31, 1991); and 28217 (July 18, 1990), 55 FR 30056 (July 24, 1990'') (``Hybrid Approval Orders''). 7 The Commission has previously approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of a MITTS based upon a global portfolio of securities representing telecommunications companies and one based on a portfolio of securities representing European companies. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9, 1993), and 33368 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993)) (collectively, ``MITTS Approval Orders''). As with other MITTS products, the REIT Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 703.19 of the Manual, which provides that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million securities; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million; and (5) otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria. 8 In addition, the Exchange will monitor the REIT Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the Exchange's continued listing criteria. 9 MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity, and will bear no periodic payments of interest. At maturity, holders of REIT Portfolio MITTS will be entitled to receive an amount in cash based upon the ``Total Return Portfolio Value;'' provided, however, that the amount payable at maturity will not be less than $9 for each $10 principal amount of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The ``Total Return Portfolio Value'' will be an amount based upon the change in the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity, plus the aggregate dollar amount of dividends paid on the components of the REIT Portfolio during the term of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' will equal $10, i.e., the value of the REIT Portfolio on the date the REIT Portfolio MITTS are priced by the issuer for initial offering to the public. The value of the REIT Portfolio at maturity will be based on the average of the closing prices of the components of the REIT Portfolio for a specified number of days immediately prior to the maturity date of the REIT Portfolio MITTS. 10 REIT Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based, in part, on the aggregate portfolio value of the REIT Portfolio securities. 8 The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01 and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically, the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000 holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares; (2) a public float of 1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible assets of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes of $2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for the last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required to be profitable). 9 The Continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) the number of holders of 100 shares or more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3) the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million. See Section 802 of the Manual. 10 In particular, the Total Return Portfolio Value will be based on the average closing prices of the REIT Portfolio component securities for the first 45 NYSE trading days of the ``Calculation Period.'' The Calculation Period is defined as the period from and including the 90th scheduled NYSE trading day prior to the maturity date to and including the fourth scheduled NYSE trading date prior to the maturity date.
