The COPIT has already made interesting contributions to providing information on national space activities, such as the two conferences that were organized in January and April this year. It was precisely the crisis of the ASI, culminating with the formation of the commission in August, that led the COPIT to start a general deliberation on Italian space policy, and for this reason it set up an ad hoc study group, made up of Francesco Mazzucca (coordinator), Aldo D'Alessio, Michele Nones, and Walter Pecorella. After a special meeting that brought together the opinions of authoritative exponents of the scientific community and the industrial world connected to space, this group collaborated with other experts and consultants to work out the proposal that is presented in the document: "The Relaunching of Space Activity in Italy". The document starts with a brief description of the origins of Italian space activities and the criteria on which the ASI was founded, underlining the critical institutional and functional aspects that favored, or determined, the crisis. In consideration of this, it points out that "a change that will permit the formulation of a new approach is needed" so that the agency can transform itself "into an efficient management body" that is able to face the changed conditions both of the international scene and of national finances. A complete section of the document, the final section, has been dedicated to the organizational structure that the ASI should take on. This is preceded by a section that examines the institutional set-up. This section is divided into two chapters, one of which is dedicated to the relationships between the ASI and the ministry (MURST (Ministry of Universities and Scientific and Technological Research)] watching over the ASI and the other to the organs of the ASI. A complete section of the document (seven chapters) has been dedicated to the national space plan. When, in the near future, the period of management by the commission comes to an end, the summit of the ASI should be nominated, and its first act should be the preparation of a new national space plan that will be the supporting axle for the relaunching of Italian space activities. The fundamental criteria that the COPIT document suggests for its formulation include coordination with the public consumers of space services (a long list of whom are presented), seeking in particular "a profound harmonization with the lines along which defense is developing," and the definition, in agreement with the ministries of finance and the budget, of a suitable funding policy, specifying the level of resources that is actually available and "the most suitable policy of interventions to provide for the characteristics of space activities." For the New National Space Plan The weight that this sector of industry has also developed in Italy means that a space policy can no longer simply be considered to be a research policy, but that it must also be considered to be an industrial policy. This having been said, one of the primary roles of the agency must be to give the national industry the necessary competitiveness on foreign markets "effecting a close analysis of the costs (industrial audit), and facilitating and directing the companies toward the natural economies of scale and dimension that are critical to be able to play a role not only on protected and captive markets." It is suggested that the ASI should participate in industrial activities during the risk stage (also through its own presence as a minority in ad hoc consortiums) to help the industrial projects that they have singled out as potentially more promising as far as commercialization and industrial spin-offs are concerned, to take off, and then to sell them back when they have become consolidated. As far as basic research is concerned, whilst the ASI must develop its own program in coordination with the activities of other aerospace research bodies, the main effort would be turned toward the development of some authentic centers of excellence. This, in the medium term could lead to the creation of two centers: one centered around the Turin-Milan area and the other, into which the CIRA [Italian Aerospace Research Center] would be integrated, centered in the Rome-Naples area. "It is no longer possible to have the concept of funding showering down on projects. Instead it is necessary to concentrate on activities that are aimed at, and are an organic part of, the creation of centers of excellence, formative university processes, or the industrial policy of the ASI." Preference should be given to research in collaboration with foreign partners on projects that are funded by several international bodies, and the programs should be centered on loads that can be launched using small carriers, to take account both "of the limited economic undertakings that are sustainable and the necessity of obtaining concrete results quickly" and "of the development of a small national launcher." With respect to this, the document affirms that "the necessity to autonomously put one's own satellites into orbit with acceptable costs is obviously the element on which any space policy hinges" and that in this sector Italy must "construct its own strategy by taking the experiences of its own role in European space activities into account." The brief analysis of the situation and the initiatives that are under way concludes by upholding that the auspicious national launcher, that has been improved with respect to the Scout, should be developed using technologies that have already been tested in flight, a careful look being given to recurrent costs, and that as far as the launching stage is concerned "a range should be chosen that offers stable political conditions, and that has possibly already been used for commercial launches, and that is reasonably accessible not only for the operators but also for the consumers." As far as the major launching systems are concerned, it is suggested that Italy's current participation in the European carrier, Ariane 5, should be confirmed for the successive stage, for the development stage, and also for its future evolution. As far as the sectors involved in space activities are concerned, telecommunications is still the most important market according to the COPIT document, that dedicates a chapter to it alone in the part dedicated to a detailed analysis of the spin-offs of space activities. The part of the document that is dedicated to the national space plan examines its different aspects, taking account of the recent technological evolution and the new services and, in Europe, the situation regarding norms (deregulation within the EEC), the organization of industry (European industry is converging to form large consortiums), and the inadequate resources for research (unequal competition with respect to the capacities of American and Japanese industry). Meanwhile the sector dealing with Earth observation is taking on an ever greater importance, thanks also to the programming priority given to it by the ESA; also in Italy there is "a considerable demand for remote sensing from the public administration" and this, amongst other things, enhances the prospective success of small satellites that will exploit the capacity of the future national launcher. This provides the opportunity to integrate these different requirements in a national R&D program for remote sensing from space "that allows for better qualification of the Italian effort in space monitoring, concretizing the effort by producing an application that has a high value for the future of the environment and for safety; calibrating on one hand the financial obligation and on the other enhancing existing San Marco Scout activities to a maximum; enhancing and making the best use of the resources of numerous aerospace industries in such a difficult economic moment." The most controversial field in Europe at the moment is that of man in space and space transport. It is also the most susceptible to surprises as far as international collaboration is concerned at a planetary level. Some key programs for Italy have come under discussion again, whether this is public knowledge or not. The COPIT document has taken this fluid situation into account, suggesting that, as a serious alternative to Columbus, if this should be at risk, Italy could think of carrying out studies for the so-called exploration program (including the permanent station on the moon and a mission toward Mars) that should consolidate in concrete obligations for development in the years after 2000. The Spin-offs of Space Activities The part that is dedicated to this subject starts with an analysis of the aspects that are relevant to technological innovation within the European Community according to the three foreseeable "scenarios" of evolution. A first return of the policies of consolidation and the development of space activities in Italy is considered in connection with the role that they can play in basic and applied research and in training, with reference to these scenarios. The main goals of EC policy for the technologically advanced sectors, including the various types of services via satellite, are then summarized. As far as the instruments that EC directives leave to the national authorities for the safeguarding and development of the sectors that they consider "sensitive" and/or strategic are concerned, according to the COPIT document: "Research activities and services to industry should replace direct help and incentives. In particular it is necessary to favor forms of coordination between companies and organizations that are working in the area of technological research and innovation to encourage possible synergies between public and private bodies." The document observes that the importance of the high technology sectors to the economic and social development of the country was recognized considerably later than it was by the main partners both within and outside the Community, and that delays have also characterized the levels of diffusion and the functional standards at an infrastructural level, and the institutional, normative and organizational aspects. A chapter is dedicated to the role of space activities in the national economy, in which, amongst other things, it is revealed that in Italy levels of spending of around 1 trillion lire a year are compatible with our participation in the European space programs. "If the ASI is transformed into an efficient management body, which is also able to coordinate the efforts of the numerous aerospace companies, with activities and funding aimed at the realization of programs in well-defined fields such as telecommunications and Earth observation, it could help bring us closer to the general goal of restructuring public spending so that the efficiency and effectiveness of resources can counterbalance the mean constraints within which it can be foreseen that fiscalization will move in the coming years." Therefore, "whilst an additional funding effort is desirable, reorganization of the ASI programs is necessary anyway, in order to obtain an appreciable return on the contributions to the ESA, forcing a commercial type of fall-out" whilst "the convergence of civilian and military interest on remote sensing technologies imposes greater reflection on the subject of the requalification of military expenditure, given also the changes of goals following the breakdown of the East Bloc." Finally, the document analyses the size of the market for activities that only concern space for the European aerospace industry, and provides interesting tables that show its development over the last seven years making comparisons between the various nations, as well as providing the possibility for comparisons to be made on a world scale for commercial sectors (satellites and antennae for users on the ground) and showing the relative trends of evolution. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |State Budget for Operational Expenses in Billions of Lire | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |Year |ASI Expenditure |ESA Direct Transf-| | | | |ers for Investmen-| | | | |ts | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1985 |- |173 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1986 |- |215 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1987 |- |280 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1988 |147 |245 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1989 |742 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1990 |822 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1991 |700 |- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | |1992 |800 |40 | -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
