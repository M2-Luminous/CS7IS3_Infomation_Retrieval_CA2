The cache included 2,500 rounds for an M79 grenade-launcher and 20,080 rounds for an M60 medium machine gun. The seizure happened at about 1 p.m. when 10 policemen were patrolling near Ban Mae Suya. They spotted a convoy of 30 pack-horses being guarded by a group of armed men heading for Burmese territory. Because they were outnumbered, police decided to follow the gang towards the border until they accidently found a gunny bag believed to have fallen from a pack-horse that contained 2,580 rounds of M79 and M60 ammunition. Police decided to call in more reinforcements and fired into the air to stop the convoy but they sped away. Police yesterday morning combed the area and found nine horses including a dead one, abandoned in the jungle. Each of them was found carrying over 2,000 rounds of ammunition.
