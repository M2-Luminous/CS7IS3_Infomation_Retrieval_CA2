Israel, Fadlallah pointed out, polished its public image and got many doors open in the Arab World. Dazzled by the agreement, some Arabs are opening their doors to Israel and hastening to normalize relations with it even before the latter makes any overture. Fadlallah added: The Arab world is under a spell. Israel is not offering the Arabs much. The enemy's prime minister told a Qatari newspaper: We want to be stronger than the Arabs so that the latter may understand that they cannot get anything from us except through negotiations. This, Fadlallah said, means that America helped Israel militarily so as to force the Arabs to make concessions. America wanted to deprive the Arabs of any clout they may use against Israel. Therefore, this agreement has no legitimacy. We believe that the nation should hold firm to its principles, because once we start making concessions we will never stop. We might even lose more land. France once saw Algeria as French territory. America may come to see the Gulf as U.S. territory. We recently read that a U.S. official visited Yemen and no sooner was he gone than the war broke out there. We in Lebanon are used to such visits by U.S. officials, who are adept at playing a double game. This double game, long known to us in Lebanon, has just started in Yemen.
