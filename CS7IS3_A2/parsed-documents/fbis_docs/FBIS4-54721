Ivana Plechata from the Government Office told CTK that Klaus and Petersen also agreed that the developments in the former Yugoslavia had to be viewed rationally, not emotionally. They noted that the conflict had to be treated seriously, but that it was not possible to make far-reaching political conclusions. In a meeting with President Vaclav Havel Petersen, who arrived for an official visit today, said he comprehended certain impatience of people in the Czech Republic in relation to the country's admission to the European Union (EU). He stressed his government was ready to support small European countries in their effort at integration into the EU. Czech Industry and Trade Minister Vladimir Dlouhy said in his talks with Petersen that the Czech Republic was satisfied with the development of trade with Denmark. Exports to Denmark rose by $37.1 million in the years 1992-93. Denmark's surplus decreased from $30 million in 1992 to a mere $3 million last year, Dlouhy said. Petersen also met today with Parliament Chairman Milan Uhde and other leading parliamentary representatives.
