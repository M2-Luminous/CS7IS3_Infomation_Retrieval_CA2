While Hasan Nasrallah is preparing lists of names of new officials to lead a corrective movement under his command, and also preparing to send the names to Tehran to get its blessings, Subhi al-Tufayli, backed by the radical Iranian wing, is exerting efforts to carry out a coup. What is Nasrallah's plan for the "new Hizballah" and how is al-Tufayli working to prevent the current secretary general from renewing his term and from joining the peace process at the expense of the resistance? "The battle will be crucial and decisive. We should begin to prepare for it from now." With this, a senior Hizballah official commented on the questions posed by some Hizballah leaders on the reasons of opening the file of the "organizational conference" more than seven months before the date of convening the conference, something which prtends the dangers of a real "bone-breaking" battle from which the party itself, in its current shape, might not emerge safe. Observers believe that a crucial battle has begun to rage behind the scenes in Hizballah, heralding a true war, that will be witnessed by the organizational conference scheduled to be held early next year, on the identity and personality of the new secretary general and the members of the Shura Council and the Political Bureau. The current secretary general, Mr. Hasan Nasrallah, has already begun his battle and is preparing to wage it with all his strength. However, signs indicate that Nasrallah's future battle will not be easy and will witness a very fierce conflict that has been surfacing for sometime, namely, an inter-Lebanese conflict and another inter-Iranian conflict that plays a decisive role in determining the future of Hizballah. Several months before the date of convening that "historic conference," the Lebanese part of Hizballah seems to be captive to three leaderships: A current led by Hasan Nasrallah; A current led by former Secretary General Shaykh Subhi al- Tufayli, who counts on the support of Political Bureau member Shaykh Khadr Tulays; A current led by Deputy Shaykh Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid. So far, Nasrallah's current seems to be the strongest. It is enjoying the Iranian regime's support, particularly the "pigeons" current in Tehran, led by President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. He is also the brother of Hajj Mahmud and the Shura Council speaker. In return, al-Tufayli enjoys the support of the radical current in Iran, which is led by former Interior Minister Ayatollah Mohtashemi who also counts on the support of Mehdi Karrubi and Ahmed Khomeyni. The final decision will be made by leader 'Ali Khamene'i if he decides to settle the situation in favor of the extremists. Shaykh Ibrahim al-Sayyid, who is leading a "liberal" current, seems to be the weakest, especially since this is a strange approach to Hizballah. Despite this, Mr. Nasrallah was shocked and surprised when someone told him that Deputy Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyid wants to nominate himself for the secretary general post, especially since the star of al-Sayyid began to overshadow that of Nasrallah. This is why Nasrallah's reaction was very swift. He began to launch a campaign against al-Sayyid and to accuse him of opening channels with the Lebanese Government and of cooperating with Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri, and later, al-Sayyid pretended to be attacking and criticizing al-Hariri's government, according to Nasrallah's accusations. Information emphasizes that Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli began his preparations early for this confrontation. For several months, al-Tufayli has been holding meetings with the Hizballah members and officials in charge of areas who have the right to vote at the conference, and, thus, the right to elect a secretary general. These meetings were meant to draw support and "expose the schemes" Hasan Nasrallah is trying to peddle in Hizballah's cellars. In his private meetings, al-Tufayli asserted to those close to him that Nasrallah has returned to the game of trickery and promises in an attempt to deflate the party's internal opposition. In this regard, it was noted that he once again tried to appease deputy al- Hajj Muhammad Yaghi and Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik, members of the party's Shura Council, and other Political Bureau members. Shaykh al-Tufayli recently began to set up special institutions such as media and security offices, and appointed advisers and assistants. He also held meetings with Arab fundamentalist personalities, including groups belonging to the "Egyptian Jihad" organization in the Harat Hurayk neighborhood of Beirut with the aim of expanding his alliances by appeasing the Arab fundamentalist groups in Lebanon, particularly in the al-Biqa' area. However, those close to the current secretary general assert that he will remain in his post and will run for a new term in the coming conference. These people indicate that Nasrallah is now focusing his efforts on consolidating his position, working out basic points, and preparing the next program in order to successfully join the conference, particularly on the level of the party's new political rhetoric and defining its positions on urgent regional and international issues such as the "Gaza-Jericho" agreement and what is taking place in Yemen. In the prior preparations for his new, yet old, position, Nasrallah even formed both a new party Shura commission and a Political Bureau body. AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI has learned that the first draft of Hizballah's next Shura Council contains known names, including deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Hunaysh, deputy al-Hajj Muhammad Yaghi, al-Hajj Khalil Harb, Fu'ad Shakar, Shaykh Muhammad Yazbik, Shaykh Nabil Qaduq, and Hashim Safiyy-al-Din in addition to a group of Hizballah officials. The draft of the Political Bureau's body was prepared to be a qualitative stride which Nasrallah would make. It has been learned that he would try to appoint al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Halim 'Atwi as official in charge of the Political Bureau, while keeping 'Ammar al-Musawi as deputy head, with Abu-Sa'id al-Khansa', Nawwaf al-Musawi, Shaykh Tawfiq al-Miqdad, Shaykh Zuhayr Kinj, deputy Khadr Tulays (if he agrees), al-Hajj Mustafa Qamar, Shaykh Husayn Kurani, Shaykh Hatim Abu-Diyah, and others, as members. Nasrallah began to put the final touches on the two drafts before sending two copies of them to the Iranian leadership for the final opinion, remarks, and blessing. Nasrallah believes that, in the next phase, priority should be given to consolidating the party's status and internal structure, especially in view of the current regional and international arrangements, so that the party will be able to confront these conditions--particularly the disarming of the resistance--that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher has set in his shuttle tours. In fact, Hizballah is now gravely concerned on various levels over passing safely through the phase of [Middle East] peace. There is a consensus that the party would pay a price for any breakthrough in the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, and that the party is convinced that destroying its military machine, as a minimum, is the most prominent U.S.-Israeli condition. Nasrallah is also well aware that there will be no role for resistance, and, thus, his military role after the achievement of peace. This will definitely weaken the party, diminish its luster, and perhaps terminate it if it does not begin to reconsider its calculations and adapt to the developments. In this regard, knowledgeable sources say that Nasrallah has for a while been assessing the situation, and that he is currently focusing his effort on moving the party into a new phase which would enable it to remain on political map in Lebanon within a democratic framework. Nasrallah is planning to take advantage of the expected developments to enable Hizballah to remain strong in the Lebanese political arena, being in possession of huge financial resources supplied by its investments and the institutions and companies that it has established. Evidently, the power struggle within Hizballah today revolves around these expected developments and ways of dealing with the next phase. In this regard, it has been noted that Nasrallah's opponents are taking advantage of Nasrallah's move toward a "corrective movement" to launch a fierce campaign against him. Thus, they take every chance to charge the present secretary general of leading the party to the peace settlement, and that all his efforts and moves are part of an attempt to enter the "stage of Israeli peace even at the expense of the resistance." They indicate that Nasrallah's course is in agreement with the line of Iranian President Rafsajani, who has been attempting to establish--and may have already established--secret relations and contacts with the Americans and their allies in the region. Those opponents go so far as to accuse the secretary general of working to change the party's bylaws and amend certain posts to modify the Hizballah bylaws following the fashion of leftist Western parties. Nasrallah's opponents say that his cards and intentions were exposed during the previous organizational congress through the game of deception he played against a number of the Shura Council following his false promises. The question is: Will Hizballah escape the dangers of an internal split, or will it become like the other parties divided into several wings? Those who have access to what is taking place inside the party have noticed that Shaykh Subhi al-Tufayli's moves and trends are supported on the regional level and that he has become strong in this phase. He has money and men and he was able to exploit the resentment created against the Lebanese regime during the airport bridge incident. He also exploited the issue of Hizballah's handing over of a number of those wanted by the Lebanese state for carrying arms during the al-Quds Day demonstration on the last Friday of Ramadan. Hasan Nasrallah or Subhi al-Tufayli? The battle has not been decided yet because the future of Hizballah will be decided in Tehran, the source of financial support and the higher political tutelage. And whether the decision will be in favor of Nasrallah's corrective movement or al-Tufayli's coup is linked with deciding the matter between the moderate current and the radical extremist current in Iran, with deciding the new Iranian policy on the Middle East, and with the final stand vis-a-vis the peace process. New surprises will appear before next year. Until then, the battle will continue within the Lebanese Hizballah Party. It seems so through the meetings and preparations carried out by every party. It also appears that the situation will escalate in the coming months.
