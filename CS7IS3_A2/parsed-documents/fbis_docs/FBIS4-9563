On Sunday, 10 April, in the afternoon hours, telegrams and messages from the field with dramatic reports of the aggressor's tanks rumbling into a southern suburb of Gorazde, just one kilometer away from the hospital, kept coming in. At the same time messages from foreign leaders and from all over the world were coming in, expressing great concern over the fate of Gorazde. Immediately after 1600 the prime minister was informed that NATO planes had set off for Gorazde. At the moment when the prospects for air strikes were still indefinite, we started our interview with the question: To what extent is the international community responsible for the tragedy of the people in eastern Bosnia? [Silajdzic] The fact is that we are witnessing such a situation in Gorazde because the international community has intervened so far by benefiting the aggressor. They have forbidden us to defend ourselves. Therefore I think that the international community is responsible for the death of 200,000 people, for the hardships of refugees, orphans, for the backsliding of Bosnia into a stone age. The world owes Bosnia a lot, and everything it does, repays just a small part of the debt. [OSLOBODJENJE] In what way did the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina help the defense of eastern Bosnia? [Silajdzic] The defense of eastern Bosnia last year was obstructed because the warlords in Herzegovina blocked the convoys carrying weapons. It first happened in Metkovic, and then in Grude. Just a small amount of the weapons passed. If we had procured those weapons, the situation in eastern Bosnia would have been different. [OSLOBODJENJE] When speaking about procurement of arms, these days, for the first time, your role in that is being mentioned, but also denied. Can you explain that? [Silajdzic] Following my initiative, donors to the cause of Bosnia-Herzegovina were urged, so they started carrying out a plan for supplying the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina with arms. This project, being, of course, not the only one, forwarded arms worth $36 million to air and sea ports in a neighboring country, given that one ship (worth $7 million) was halted. The $20-million shipment of arms from that ship is still waiting in a port for the arms embargo to be lifted. There are documents on that case, while the entire consignment, short of the aforementioned ship about which LJILJAN has also written, reached the planned destination. What happened thereafter is something else. All I know is that the 2,000-ton consignment was halved on its way through Herzegovina. In any case, a considerable amount of arms did reach central Bosnia in time, at the very beginning of clashes with the Croatian extremists. "Strijele" missiles from that contingent helped the defenders to halt the aggressor's tanks in Sarajevo, Olovo, Gradacac, and so forth. Unfortunately, these matters, and the people who took part in such projects, cannot be discussed publicly, which is being misused in the power struggle. That is wrong. It is not a right time for bargaining over merits. Now I have to acknowledge, without any feigned modesty, that it was an excellently done job, and I do not intend to account for my conduct to anybody. [OSLOBODJENJE] You are the head of the first government with a Bosnian platform. How do you assess the first five months of its work? [Silajdzic] Just remember what the moment was like when we started. We were confronted with three or four months of winter, and the main task was to survive. We had to ensure at least minimal quantities of gas, power, food.... And all that had to be done by negotiations with the aggressor, or in any other way. I think that we passed the test, and also thanks to the fact that the winter was mild. As for the government itself, we accomplished the task thanks to the enthusiasm and devotion of the people who took up the job. I believe that I am to be given least credit for that. Of course, certain things could have been done much better. After all, the assembly has paid tribute to the new government, which is a great honor for us, because normally, on such occasions, it is negative things that are focused on. Of course, a great help was that the citizens of this country have shown unbelievable patience, willpower, and readiness to live on a minimum. I do not consider myself to be a good organizer, nor am I a good administrator, although those properties are very important for a prime minister. It seems that all of us were going beyond our own limits in the past months, and somehow managed to survive the winter. Now we are at a turning point. Which is a different story, though. [OSLOBODJENJE] Are you referring to the Bosniak-Croatian federation? [Silajdzic] I think that by the agreement on the federation a strategically very important step has been made toward establishing Bosnia-Herzegovina that we are fighting and endeavoring for. That is to say, for an integral, undivided, and democratic state without national territories. Bosnia may be carved up only by blood, and that is what extreme fascists on both sides tried to accomplish, but despite enormous numbers of casualties and unprecedented violence they have eventually failed. Of course, they failed in the first place thanks to the people who thwarted the forming of the Croatian national territories aimed at seceding from Bosnia-Herzegovina. We are struggling to make the territories with a Serbian national majority somehow integrate into a unified state, in the least painful way possible. That struggle will be lengthy and difficult. The war is not over yet, and the aggressor still aspires to add a great part of Bosnia-Herzegovina to greater Serbia. We are resisting such aspirations by fighting against the aggressor, by activities on the international stage, and by telling the truth. It was necessary to incite the international public opinion, and in the first place to explain where Bosnia-Herzegovina is at all, and what is happening in it. It was necessary to represent Bosnia, to open doors, make friends, develop a diplomatic framework, and all that without a single pause, starting with zero and broken communication. In short, we were supposed to behave like a state, because the world does not change because of Bosnia. The fact is that Bosnia-Herzegovina is a recognized country today, that doors are open to it almost everywhere, it is a member of almost all the international organizations, and it is very respected abroad. [OSLOBODJENJE] What are the risks of the turning point that you mentioned? [Silajdzic] The turning point is in our attempts, and I think we are on the best possible way, to remedy the consequences of the aggression in a way that ensures a civilized and democratic future. The federation, whose constitution has already been adopted, is the best possible move, because it makes possible a reorganization in one part of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the one that is not occupied, enabling us to improve the current situation, and also to establish foundations for the future. The central government is strong enough to guarantee the functioning of the state, as well as enough cantonal autonomy that will ensure unobstructed regional development, which is a European trend. As early as now we are being invited to continue the talks, which started before the war, with the representatives of the Italian region of Marca. Such a state system ensures enough freedom in economics, religion, and culture, so that every citizen may express himself or herself in the way he or she wants. On the other hand, the multiethnic dimension, or rather polyvalence of Bosnia, has been preserved, and, as one of my friends put it, that polyvalence stretches from the East to the West, which is a comparative advantage that other countries do not have. Of course, if we are wise enough to make good use of it. [OSLOBODJENJE] The Washington agreement is a confirmation of the international support to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Ostensibly, everything has come about quite unexpectedly. What was its preface? [Silajdzic] The agreement did not come about overnight. There were many negotiations. Unfortunately, many things, when speaking of diplomacy and logistics, are not supposed to be publicly explained. At a last year's meeting -- Alija Izetbegovic, Franjo Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic, Miomir Zuzul, Ivo Komsic, and myself were present -- a possible agreement of that kind was discussed. But, to be honest, the U.S. role was decisive. True, many people were surprised at the agreement. In the field, the people could hardly wait for something like that to happen, and that is the most important thing. Right now, a great task is awaiting us -- how to implement the agreement, since almost a half of the country is occupied. [OSLOBODJENJE] The United States supports Bosnia. What does the United States expect from Bosnia in return? [Silajdzic] There is no doubt: The United States expects a democratic system in Bosnia. Just as Madeleine Albright stressed here, the Americans are impressed by our consistency in maintaining a civilized attitude toward different cultures, and particularly in the field, they are impressed by our tolerance. Why is the United States so important? I have always considered it to be important. Europe is always exclusive, and the leading powers always deal with such issues by applying colonial methods, or in the way they had dealt with the things in the two world wars. In that respect the United States has a much fresher approach, and better understands the relations in Bosnia. When somebody asks why we need the United States, I reply: Whenever we are in the situation to mend the injustice done to us by the imposition of the arms embargo against Bosnia, like, for example, in the case of Mt Igman, or in Gorazde, we turn to the United States. We know that Russians are involved on the side of Serbia. Only a political ignorant would not seek a balance in the United States. If we want Bosnia to be a global issue, we must aspire to having the global factor number on our side. To accomplish that one needs time, effort, and knowledge. [OSLOBODJENJE] You said that the United States expects Bosnia to establish a democratic system. To what extent do you think we meet those criteria, and are the conditions being created for the development of a modern democracy? [Silajdzic] I have noticed that in recent times people are afraid of speaking out. Some of them do not even want to talk. Says a deputy: "I do not need leather jackets, even if they were mine." [as published] I think that fear has to do with several overambitious people, who fuel such an atmosphere. The Muslims care about the freedom within a compass that does not hinder the freedom of other people. In terms of the Bosniak people, the condensed history and experiences created a healthy attitude toward life and the world. Those are traits that cannot be hidden. Our virtues, being our fortune, must come into prominence. Our negative characteristics are to be found in a not very great sense for organization. One should create such a climate in which issues can be freely discussed, just like in any other democratic state, and even when dealing with weaknesses. Undoubtedly, there are many talented people, being an elementary civilizational advantage. Krleza [Miroslav, famous Croatian author] used to say that people in Bosnia were familiar with books when in other provinces nobody knew what a book is. That source of talents still exists, and we have to make good use of it. The real meaning of merhamet [charity] is that of a civilizational achievement. That is the awareness of the necessity to cooperate with others. Therefore we have to revitalize advantages that were being acquired over many generations. We need to remain good Bosniaks, but never again naive Bosniaks. That kind of balance ought to be accomplished. [OSLOBODJENJE] The impression is, however, that in Bosnia one rules more by charisma rather than by developing a system of democratic institutions and relations. Is there any danger of one-party rule? [Silajdzic] We were not allowed to develop either institutions or relations. We had to survive. We have created preconditions for that, yet a one-party system is still living in us. It is very difficult to get rid of it. The future generations will not be burdened by the past. We still are. The only way of getting rid of that is to strengthen pluralism -- market competition, competition of thoughts and ideas. The more we disregard different opinions, the less use we shall have of our potentials. I have heard that the Bosnian refugee children abroad are the most successful pupils in schools. You see, that potential exists, and we have to do everything possible to develop it. We must not be afraid of success and competition. Do you know what our basis is? Western analyses show that thanks to humanitarian resources in the first place we shall overcome the crisis. For that reason pluralism and democracy must be developed. [OSLOBODJENJE] Is there any difference between your and Izetbegovic's view of Bosnia? [Silajdzic] No, there is not. The efforts made by some people to stage disagreements, and to generate conflict artificially between me and the president, are quite obvious. That is being done by inventing diverse stories, creating lobbies. Only the people who have a surplus of time can afford such activities. I do not have time for such things. Intriguing, lobbying, making factions, supporting different factions, cannot last long, and building the state on such premises has no future. [OSLOBODJENJE] Do recent shifts of personnel at the state-run television have anything to do with the aforementioned activities? [Silajdzic] I have been informed about those shifts. I am not familiar with the causes. In any case, arbitrary elimination of people without legal-based judgments would simply be a recurrence of something that has already been seen before, something to which the people said a big "No!" in the first free elections. As for myself, I need to express my personal gratitude to all the people who have managed to perform their jobs over the past two years in the interest of the country -- starting with a nurse who goes every day from Alipasino Polje, where she lives, to work in the hospital, to the people working at the television, or those working in local community centers. Not all citizens are fit for fighting on the front lines, but still they have been doing whatever they can to help, with more or less success. [OSLOBODJENJE] After the NATO ultimatum, and the Washington agreement, the atmosphere has been as if the war is over, and as if just a small step divides us from peace. What do you think? [Silajdzic] The war is not over, but there are people who behave as though it is. I am afraid that there is ever less struggling for Bosnia, while ever more struggling for power. Though it is more about individual cases, that is still enough to poison the atmosphere, to weaken our unity, and instill distrust. At this moment there is no better gift we can give to our enemy. Which is to say, it is about people who think that the only way for them to come to prominence is through conflicting situations. When there is no outside enemy, then such people look for an inside enemy, just as the doctrine of the Yugoslav People's Army nicely taught me. I have to illustrate this with one example. Several days ago some people lined up the personnel of the Bosnian embassy in Zagreb and made a complete chaos, although the embassy staff worked in impossible conditions, and took care of the things they are not even supposed to take care of. Their office hours were until morning. I witnessed that myself. Those people even carried the wounded that had been literally unloaded at wee hours in front of the embassy. Those people are now disappointed and furious. Nobody is allowed any more to line up people and yell at them. Nobody is supposed to put up with somebody's frustrations caused by unrealized ambitions. Some people behave as if there has been too little fear, shelling, poverty, and suffering so far. Also, the work performed by the government cannot be depreciated any more, which is, unfortunately, done here, as well as abroad, nor is it necessary to prompt journalists to criticize the government, because they are capable of doing that themselves. Such an understanding of freedom, human dignity, politics, will not pass. Some damage may be done by such activities, but I repeat, all that is short-lived. Simply, people cannot and should not put up with that any longer. [OSLOBODJENJE] Is the distribution of official posts a stumbling bloc for the further implementation of the Bosniak-Croatian agreement? [Silajdzic] Whether the first president will be Bosniak or Croat was not agreed upon in Washington. The attitude of the Party of Democratic Action is well-known. If you want to know my personal attitude, then I have to tell you that, if there is a man who has really deserved that post, then it is President Izetbegovic. I think that by following that line a political agreement can be reached. There is a plenty of work to be done for anybody. However, a very difficult question is awaiting us in the future -- how to make it possible for the refugees to return to their homes. In solving that issue we shall need the help of the international community and the UNHCR. We shall also need aid of building materials, in order to develop any sort of housing program. That will be a greater problem than food supplies. We have to start any sort of production. [OSLOBODJENJE] Both in wartime and in peacetime the public is interested in privileges that go along with power. What kind of apartment does the Bosnian prime minister live in? Did you use the priority right for being supplied with power? [Silajdzic] Unfortunately, merits are already being rewarded, so that villas in Switzerland and apartments in Vienna are being dealt out. My 48 square meter apartment was not given to me either by the former or by the present administration. I earned it during my 10 years of working abroad, in order not to be driven to beg somebody for an apartment. That apartment is unfit for living for the time being, so I have been living at my sister's. I did not use the priority right for power. Until recently the neighborhood that I am living in was not supplied even with gas. We survived on firewood, just like our neighbors. If there is anything positive about this war, then I would say it is neighborly relations. Such relations have to be maintained. [OSLOBODJENJE] While we were talking, the news on air strikes against Serb positions around Gorazde came in. There was no need to ask Silajdzic to comment on it, so this is his first reaction to the news: [Silajdzic] Neither the air strikes in Gorazde nor the ultimatum to Serbs around Sarajevo came about as the result of a phone call. The people reached for their weapons and made possible for us to prove ourselves as a military factor in the first place, and thereafter as a political factor. It is the people who made possible for us to build our position on the vision of a free and democratic country. That is the way we made friends, as many as it is possible to make in politics. By following that way and sticking to our principles we shall maintain the positions that we have. To tell you the truth, I feel really amazed at the sight of a man in a trench filled with water up to his knees, who has only four bullets left to remain with on the front line. We have to care for such men, their families, and particularly for the families of the fallen, shehits [a Turkish word, denoting a man who fell for his country]. We, as the government, have done all we could. If it happens that the care for those people remains just a proclamation of the current, or any other government, I am sure that those who were able enough to stand up and defend their country will be able enough to speak up and demand their rights.
