We asked him for an interview before his return home yesterday. [Rusko] Mr. Minister, before the conference, it was expected that Russia would announce at it when it will join the Partnership for Peace (PFP). Why was this expectation not fulfilled? [Kukan] According to Andrey Kozyrev, not all of the issues involved have been clarified. He did not specify which ones; he declared, however, that, although he was born in Brussels and is always glad to return there, he does not want to go "step by step," but only when everything has been prepared. [Rusko] Did this not have an influence on the atmosphere of the meeting? [Kukan] A characteristic feature of the conference was its working atmosphere. All of the participants accepted the Russian representative's explanation with understanding. They realize that Russia would like to have the kind of relations with NATO that would correspond to its military and political status and geographical position. At the same time, however, the NACC members emphasized that there can be no privileges for anyone within the PFP framework. Another episode, however, also testifies to the atmosphere of the meeting. A group of experts drafting the final document was working in parallel with the plenary session. It turned out that this was the kind of demanding task that could only be dealt with by people with ministerial authority. Therefore, the talks were transferred to the plenum. However, they took two hours longer there than envisaged. This was virtually a dialogue between Russia and the other participants. An agreement was reached in the end. It was said more than once at the meeting that it would be a mistake if the other states were to decide on a course of action that would place Russia in isolation. Because Minister Kozyrev did not concretize in detail his views on relations with NATO, it was not possible to give a detailed response to his stance. [Rusko] Does this mean that there were no contentious issues? [Kukan] The meeting was oriented not toward specifying them but toward expressing a joint point of view on such fundamental issues as relations between the states joining the PFP and the North Atlantic Alliance, the question of resolving the regional conflicts between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Tajikistan and Afghanistan, and on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, and the observance of international agreements. [Rusko] NATO officials and ministers from some of the member countries implied at the news conferences that Russia is interested in modifying the treaty on conventional weapons in Europe. Was this topic also discussed? [Kukan] Russian representatives are of the opinion that the Vienna treaty should be adapted to the new conditions that have arisen with the collapse of the Soviet Union, one of the signatories to the treaty. During the discussion, the heads of the individual delegations pointed out that, in implementing a document, a certain flexibility in complying with it cannot be ruled out. This must be agreed upon in advance, however, and everyone must agree with it. This accommodates the Russian demands to a certain extent, while the binding nature of the international treaties remains in force. The meeting emphasized that it is also necessary to improve the mechanism for supervising fulfillment of the treaty on nuclear nonproliferation, whose validity expires next year. It would be appropriate to make it valid permanently, and, if the NACC's efforts proceed in this direction, we will support them. [Rusko] Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev set out more than two weeks ago how Russia envisages interlinking the NACC and the CSCE. What conclusion did the NACC conference reach on this? [Kukan] Everyone, including the Russian delegation in Istanbul, emphasized their interest in further strengthening the role of the CSCE, especially in the peacekeeping operations and preventive diplomacy spheres. According to almost all of the participants, however, the NACC remains an important consultative body for coordinating politico-security issues. The subject of military cooperation should be dealt with within the PFP framework.
