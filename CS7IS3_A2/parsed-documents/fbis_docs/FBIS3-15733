Nazdratenko, head of the Maritime Kray Administration, by correspondent B. Makarychev; place, date not given -- recorded; from the "Dalniy Vostok" program] [Text] [Nazdratenko] This winter we were busy just surviving. At a meeting with the prime minister, when you meet the other heads of administrations, one hears: Vologda, 0 degrees [Celsius] to 2 degrees above zero, or 0 degrees to minus 1 degree. Of course, they do not understand our problems. Naturally, they have their own problems. I think that Moscow, which we all support so unanimously -- well, the streets are lit there, the houses are warm, they have money with which to buy fuel and food. It is obvious that this is the capital and should be treated with respect, but after the adoption of the new Constitution we are all equal as members of the Federation. However, we are far from equal financially. [Makarychev] Your business trip to Moscow had to do with the work of the Federation Council. Nevertheless, I understand that you will again carry a proposal on a package of talks with the government. If it is not a secret, could you tell us about the main points of the package? What would you like to solve in Moscow? [Nazdratenko] There are two kind of documents. The first kind is one which burns, bets, and screams about a current issue. The second package of documents concerns the strategic development of the Maritime Kray. [Makarychev] Tell me, do you have any hopes that one day you might go to Moscow without carrying any documents asking for help? [Nazdratenko] No. No. [Makarychev] So, you have no such hopes for the near future? We will continue to beg? [Nazdratenko] Yes. Because what we have here is a vicious circle. They tell us: support the institute of agriculture from your own budget, support all organizations from your own budget, support the handicapped, the pensioners, and the needy out of your own budget. At the same time, our own budget is funded by taxes on working industry, which is broken and on the verge of extinction. [Makarychev] Are you not afraid that you will be accused, behind your back, of going to Moscow to blackmail the government, that you make us all go down on our knees and do not see any other methods? [Nazdratenko] Tell me, was not Decree 1001 a promising one? Was it not a good thing which got destroyed later? The presidential representative sent coded messages to the effect that I was blackmailing the country and Moscow. Yet Moscow, by not sending funds to Arsenyev, Bolshoy Kamen and the defense factories, is it not thus blackmailing the residents of Maritime Kray? What is this? Therefore, this is no blackmail. If a person has worked, he must be paid for it. So pay this money to those who have worked. Of course, they can blame me, but I do not consider this to be blackmail. I think that this is the position of the Maritime Kray leadership in defending the interests of the Maritime Kray.
