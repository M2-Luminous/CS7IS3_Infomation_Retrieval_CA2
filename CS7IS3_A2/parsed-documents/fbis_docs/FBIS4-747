Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Solomon Dlamini told the House of Assembly last night that government has sent several protests to that country. The country was not named. However, it is assumed that the country referred to is the United States of America. Recently, a report on human rights in Swaziland, prepared by the United States Department attacked the Tinkhundla [traditional community councils] System, saying even last year's elections were not democratic. Mr Dlamini was replying to a question from Kwaluseni MP, William Msibi who asked the minister what was government doing to discourage the country from continuing to make defamatory remarks about Swaziland. Further, Mr Msibi said the continued derogative statements made by this country about Swaziland did not show any respect for this country. In reply, Mr Dlamini said government has protested several times to the government of this country. He said some of the replies that they got from the government of that country is that, it is one of their responsibilities to monitor the political system of the particular country they are accredited to. Mr Dlamini also said government has also protested to the government of that country about its envoy, whom he said, used to meddle in the affairs of this country. Motshane MP, Robert Anthony Mabuza asked the minister to inform the House if it was true that there was a diplomatic blunder in the appointment of the Swazi envoys, announced by Prime Minister, Prince Mbilini in February. In reply, Mr Dlamini said it is true that the diplomatic procedure was not followed in appointing the new Swazi envoys, adding that there were pressing isf+?s, resulting in the diplomat?c blunder. He said it is true that the count?ies were informed after the announcement was made, which is not supposed to be the case. Mr Mabuza also wanted to know what will happen, should any of the Swazi Ambassadors and High Commissioners be rejected by the countries they have been accredited to. Mr Dlamini said although it has not happened before, another country can be asked to accredit him. However, he told the MPs that there is no policy covering such unforeseen circumstances. Khubuta MP, Phillip Vonya Dlamini asked the minister to inform the House on the period expected to be stayed by an envoy abroad. He also wanted to know if the husband of the woman appointed is consulted first. Mr Dlamini said he was asking this to avoid a situation whereby, the husband, who may not be qualified may be called upon to go and stay with his wife abroad. Mtfongwaneni MP, Roy Nicholas Fanourakis asked the minister to inform the House on the criteria used in appointing High Commissioners and Ambassadors. In reply, the minister said the appointments are done by the King. He said it is therefore, difficult for his ministry to know if the husband is consulted before his wife is appointed. However, the minister said his office does consult when officers are seconded to the missions abroad. The debate and replies on this ministry took less than 40 minutes. In most ministries which have so far been debated, they sometimes take two days each.
