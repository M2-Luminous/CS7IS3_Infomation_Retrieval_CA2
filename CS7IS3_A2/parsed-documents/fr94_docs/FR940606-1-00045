FR940606-1-00045 FR940606-1-00008 To evaluate the regulatory alternatives, model plants were developed based on market segment (commercial or military), work type (OEM or rework), and size (small, medium, or large). These characteristics were examined to determine whether any technological justification existed to differentiate the proposed standards by market segment, work type, or size. Based on this examination, the EPA has determined that, other than one exception under the depainting standards, there is no justification for differentiating between these characteristics. For example, rework facilities are required to conform to OEM specifications, which dictate the processes and coatings that can be used. Consequently, rework facilities do not typically incorporate technology that is not used by the OEM's. Also, no compelling reasons were identified as to why a facility of one size could not incorporate the technology used by a facility of another size. 1. Cleaning Operation According to data obtained from the Bureau of the Census, approximately 25 percent of facilities with aerospace manufacturing SIC codes are located in California. Based on information provided by four California districts_SCAQMD, Imperial County Air Pollution Control District (APCD), Ventura County APCD, and San Diego APCD_virtually all of the California facilities are located in these districts, and more than half are located in the SCAQMD alone. Based on this information, more than 12 percent of the total number of sources are, then, subject to the rules in these four districts. Consequently, the regulations in these four districts (i.e., SCAQMD Rule 1124, Imperial County APCD Rule 425, Ventura County APCD Rule 74.13, and San Diego APCD Rule 67.9) were examined to determine the emission limitations in these districts. These regulations specify vapor pressure limits and housekeeping measures for hand-wipe cleaning solvents. The EPA then investigated to determine if the regulations resulted in California facilities emitting less HAP from this process than facilities outside of California. Based on the section 114 questionnaire responses, California facilities emitted approximately 48 percent less HAP than non-California facilities in ozone nonattainment areas for hand-wipe cleaning operations. These emissions were calculated on a pounds of HAP emitted per employee basis, using the total number of employees at the facilities (the number of employees for hand-wipe cleaning only was not available). The conclusion made from these data was that the California regulations are an effective means of producing permanent and quantifiable emission reductions, and that the sources subject to these regulations are the best-performing sources in this source category. Since these sources also comprise more than 12 percent of the sources in the category, the MACT floor was based on their control levels. It was impossible to distinguish the separate effects of housekeeping and vapor pressure limits on the emission rates from hand-wipe cleaning operations. Consequently, both were assumed to be necessary to achieve the calculated emission reductions. While one cannot ``average'' housekeeping measures, based on common aspects among the four rules, housekeeping measures of maintaining closed containers for the storage of fresh solvent, spent solvent, and solvent-soaked cloth and paper were established as one part of the MACT floor. The second part of the MACT floor for hand-wipe cleaning is a vapor pressure limitation on the solvents being used. The SCAQMD, the San Diego AQMD, and the Imperial County APCD specify a maximum vapor pressure of 45 mm Hg at 20 ○C. Ventura County APCD specifies 25 mm Hg at 20 ○C. However, the EPA believes that it is inappropriate to give equal weight to the Ventura rule in determining the MACT floor because this district contains only three aerospace facilities compared to the hundreds located in the South Coast and San Diego districts. Furthermore, industry comments suggested that these three facilities are not representative of the industry and do not constitute a similar source as required by the Act. The EPA did, however, consider a weighted average vapor pressure limitation, but the vapor pressure value obtained did not correspond to any demonstrated technology. Since more than half, and possibly as much as 90 percent, of the aerospace facilities in California are located in the South Coast district, the EPA has determined that the 45 mm Hg vapor pressure is more representative of the ``average'' limitation on cleaning solvents among the best performing facilities and represents the MACT floor for both new and existing sources. More stringent levels (e.g., a weighted average vapor pressure value) were not considered to be achievable by all sources. Therefore, the EPA has selected the 45 mm Hg at 20 ○C (24.1 in. H 2 O at 68 ○F) as the basis for the standards for hand-wipe cleaning solvents.
