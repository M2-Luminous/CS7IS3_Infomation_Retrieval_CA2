This is good news for another process which has democratic intentions: [Correspondent Fernando Pereira] The first pluralist election in Guinea-Bissau's history will probably take place toward the end of June or the beginning of July. The date has already been postponed three times, but everything leads us to believe that this time is for real, since the electoral roll is complete, which is the most important task. The CNE -- the National Electoral Commission, the top electoral body -- announced today the definite outcome of the process. A total of 404,000 people have been enrolled, 97,000 people alone in the capital. Attention is now focused on the head of state, Joao Bernardo Vieira, the only person who can set the date of the election by decree. According to law, that will only be done following the official release of the final figures of the electoral roll, which may happen within the next few days.
