The joint meeting held on April 11 proposed to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organisations and individual figures and overseas Koreans to hold a national conference in Pyongyang or Seoul on the occasion of August 15. So Man-sol, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of Chongnyon, in his report at the meeting said the proposal is fair and feasible one acceptable to anyone either in view of the time or in view of its content. The proposal of the joint meeting for convening a national conference enables all Koreans who want national reunification to unite as one nation, transcending the difference in idea, ideology and system, no matter where they live and what they do, and enables not only the authorities but also the compatriots of all walks of life in the North and South and overseas to take full responsibility for the reunification of the country, he said. He strongly demanded that the South Korean authorities renounce confrontation and nuclear war exercises and actively respond to creating a favorable atmosphere for convening a national conference from the stand of great unity of the nation. He called for waging as an all-compatriotic movement the struggle to bring to a success the convocation of a national conference proposed at the joint meeting. A statement supporting the convocation of a national conference was adopted at the meeting.
