Esteemed Mr. President, you have just returned from an official visit to the United States. But there is no official information as to your meeting on Sunday night in New York with the management of the J.P. Morgan Group; for example there is not a word on that in this press release. The group's spokespersons did not confirm the report that you were there as a private person. I would like to ask you, in this connection, whether you could give official information as to specifically who you spoke to, what the subject and the results of the meeting were, and how it will help the state you have the honor to be head of. [Kravchuk] I already said that I held many meetings with corporations, there was a meeting at the OPIC [Overseas Private Investment Corporation], a meeting with a group of businessmen led and organized by the Fund for Assistance to Ukraine's Independence, and a meeting with the United States' largest corporations, such as Johnson and Johnson, Pepsico, and other very large companies. And all the discussions that concerned our meetings were conducted along the lines of encouraging investment in Ukraine. As reported in the U.S. and other press by such people as the president of OPIC, they gave figures that these corporations could invest considerable funds in Ukraine that amount to billions of dollars, and that OPIC takes upon itself the task of insuring these [investments] and other things. That is to say that there were no secrets during the meetings. As regards the fact that something might not have been reported in greater detail, the president does not have private meetings. This is obvious. There were no secrets because as a rule correspondents were present at all of these meetings and they were reported. Perhaps we did not receive something. This is another matter. We reached an agreement with this body that specific instructions would be issued after the meeting with our Foreign Economic Relations Ministry and other corresponding structures that would elaborate official documents with regard to this large company participating in investment in Ukraine. This was the main task. [Unidentified correspondent] Esteemed Leonid Makarovych. You often speak about the political consequences and bilateral relations. You have just mentioned that the official visit to the United States also had an influence on multilateral relations with regard to our state. Please comment on Russia's reaction to the success of your visit. [Kravchuk] I would like you to take into account a minor matter. There is the reaction from Russia and there is the reaction from Russia's mass media. Russia's reaction is the reaction of the president, the prime minister, and corresponding structures. Regarding the reaction of the mass media, then this is not a Russian reaction. As they say in Odessa, these are two different things. It seemed to me that the Russian mass media still regard themselves as the central newspapers, as it used to be under the USSR when they were divided according to rank: central, republican, and local newspapers. They have not yet become accustomed to the fact that they are Russian [newspapers]. They consider themselves to be central. If they are central then this gives them the right to be scathing about anybody, in particular within the framework of the CIS. Regarding how they do this and what terminology and methods they use, then this is not my misfortune but the misfortune of those who write about it and is evidence of their culture and diplomatic status. This is what I think. I think it is improper for me to comment on articles in the mass media. This is a matter for you. [Correspondent Lelytska] Lelytska, press service of the Congress of National Democratic Forces of Ukraine. Esteemed Mr. President. Could the change in U.S. policy toward Ukraine be interpreted as though Ukraine is already emerging from Russia's sphere of influence; and the second question, Yuriy Meshkov, the newly-appointed president of Crimea, is dismissing Ukrainian journalists, and is also reducing Ukrainian TV and radio. Will there be an official reaction from Kiev? Thank you. [Kravchuk] I would like to stress something that I have often spoken about and stressed. Ukraine's relations with Russia have a special status. We never -- in any case I, as president, and the government -- spoken about reducing or lowering the status or in some way reviewing our conceptual relations with Russia. They could be friendly and based on partnership, and I am convinced that will be the case, irrespective of the fact of how events will develop. History leaves us with no other option. We may only talk about how official Moscow and official Kiev are considering these relations. We consider them to be equal, friendly and based on partnership. I think that is how official Moscow considers them to be and indeed how it should consider them to be. Regarding unofficial structures that exist in Russia, and incidentally they also exist in Ukraine, they may interpret them as they please. But this interpretation should only be accepted as a basis for further discussion and analysis. But this is not the official position of Kiev nor of Moscow. There should be an appropriate rank and status for these assessments and interpretations. For this reason we are not setting a task that Ukraine now...[pauses] You said that it is under the influence of Russia. I would like this to be a mutual influence: Russian influence on democratic process in Ukraine and Ukrainian influence on democratic processes in Russia. If that is how the issue were to be put, and if we all understood it to be the case then it would be to Russia's and Ukraine's benefit. I am deeply convinced of this. There is no other alternative for us. Russia is a great state, this is a real historic fact and it has its own long-term interests, including in Europe and in Ukraine. And for it to suddenly lose its...[pauses] It is simply impossible for me, as the president of Ukraine, to interfere with Russia's long-term interests. I can only hope that these Russian interests and influences in Ukraine are positive, that this influences democratic reform, market reform, stability, partnership, and friendship. If this is the kind of policy then it has a sense and good results, but if it is otherwise then it is dangerous. That is why our relations with the United States are not a counterbalance to relations with Russia. I would like this to be understood by everyone. Many people simply do not want to think about this. I read the Russian mass media and it is somewhat painful to read this when they do not understand simple matters. We never said that we wanted to cooperate normally with somebody to harm Russia. The contrary is true. I have become convinced that the United States is most interested in peace and accord between Russia and Ukraine. The United States is most interested in this. But their interest depends on our policies and on how we understand this in Ukraine, Kiev and Moscow. If we understand that we are partners, that we are historically doomed to be partners in friendship, then this corresponds to the long-term strategic interests of both Europe and the world. Unfortunately, I cannot say today that everybody understands it in this way. Well, I hope this is a formative period for the new authorities in Crimea and its new power institutions. We know from the first experience of establishing, for example, presidential structures that paved their way for the first time in our land and in the lands of the former Soviet Union, that these are painful processes. Sometimes, people pursuing this policy do not reckon with the real situation. I would not like this kind of start, and we will protect the interests of not only the media in Crimea, but the interests of all the people in Crimea, their rights and freedoms. This accords with our Constitution and our strategic political [word indistinct]. [Correspondent Heorhiy Chornomorskyy, in Russian] [Word indistinct] Heorhiy Chornomorskyy. You were saying, Leonid Makarovych, that the United States is granting us additional financial aid. But Deputy Prime Minister Valentyn Landyk said yesterday that we would have to pay this year's gas debts in dollars. Will this aid suffice to settle our accounts by the time the new bill arrives in April? [Kravchuk] I understand. Nobody has ever given anybody a loan to pay fuel debts. This is not envisaged by the legislation of, in this case, the United States. Critical import loans are a special kind of loans, there are critical import loans, fuel import loans, loans on preferential terms, and nonreturnable loans. These groups of loans were not discussed. We discussed economic aid and aid toward nuclear arms elimination. But I can tell you this, whatever loans we may take, if our Ukrainian economy does not start working for real, does not start earning money, be it dollars or marks, no aid will help us. That is why we are aiming for start-up loans, in order to give a starting boost to the movement toward the market, privatization, stabilization of the finance-and-credit system, thus to make the economy self-sufficient. What do we have now? Ukraine, for its economy, its resources and products is not a poor country. And yet we cannot earn hard currency. Why? I will tell you why. We could sell our products on the Russian market, that is not we, but our enterprises. However, every enterprise must sell not just on the market, but to another enterprise that they have a contract or a long-term agreement with, an agreement they signed previously. But Russian enterprises are out of rubles. You know this. Therefore, we cannot sell out products and earn these rubles to pay for fuel. There is another way. We could sell traditional Ukrainian products to Europe. What is traditional? I also call them sensitive commodities. These are metal, metal goods, coal, chemical products, textiles, etc, that is goods that were traditionally sold to Europe. But we need quotas, which we do not have. Thus, we are in this complex situation. We have products, a labor force, a colossal potential, but we are unable to make money. In Russia, there is no money, and here [in Europe] there are no quotas. There is another thing. After Ukraine and other states declared their independence, the strategic long-term economic policy in Russia was such that ministries were instructed to duplicate the products previously imported from Ukraine. Thus, many of those products are now manufactured in Russia itself. Hence, the stance of those who say we need to restore the old ties looks completely ill-considered. They are impossible to restore. In order to restore the old ties we need to break the ones we have now. We need new ties that would accord with the interests of Ukraine and Russia, we must deepen them on the basis of market reform and democratic change. Calls to restore the old ties today is simply beyond reality. Many people, by the way, fail to realize this, the fact that a new situation has come to pass, both in Russia and Ukraine. Now we need, on the basis of the interests and needs of the Ukrainian and Russian economies and the population, to forge contacts between enterprises, and those enterprises who had already realized this made contact with one another without our help, and are not demanding any help from the presidents. They have found each other, and they are working, the only complication being the payment situation. So, do not take this aid to us as aid toward our payment for fuel. We must pay for fuel with the help of our own economy. Yes, we need aid, but as a start-up loan, or as critical import credits. [Correspondent Kucherenko] Tamara Kucherenko, Radio Ukraine World Service. Esteemed Mr. President. During your U.S. visit, you met official representatives of the IMF and World Bank. How successful were these meetings? Did you talk about any specific programs in support of economic reforms in Ukraine? What specific financial resources can we count on, and are there any financial agreements to this effect? Did you discuss a stabilization fund for our national currency, if yes, what did you manage to achieve? [Kravchuk] Even before the visit, back in January, our economic delegation led by Economy Minister Roman Shpek visited the United States and conducted extensive work with the IMF and its experts, and the World Bank. The World Bank and the IMF experts also worked in Ukraine. We are greatly helped in this matter by Mr. Kaufman, a World Bank representative who is working in Ukraine. One week before the visit, our delegation made up of the same people visited the United States and again worked with international financial organizations. And we managed to work out all the sections of a government and IMF program. There are about five of them. At issue now is putting all these sections into a single program. This program should be completed in the near future. As I gathered from conversations with the representatives, the director, and the president of the World Bank and the IMF, there are grounds for saying this agreement is a positive one. As soon as the program is agreed, we can count both on credits and on a stabilization fund. Thus, at the end of March we should be able to say that this program has been completed and agreed on both sides, the government of Ukraine and these international organizations. [Correspondent Kudryn] Mykhaylo Kudryn, EKSPRESS-KHRONIKA, Moscow, and RESPUBLIKA agency, Kiev. Pardon me, this is about our Ukrainian affairs. Recently, you have been saying in interviews for numerous media, particularly the SPIEGEL magazine and a group of freelance journalists led by Ihor Storozhuk, as well as in the United States, that if the election fails to take place on 27 March we are in store for a power vacuum. But the Supreme Council statement of 25 February says there will be no power vacuum, since the present Supreme Council will preserve its constitutional powers and will be active until March next year. Let me ask, who are we to believe, you, the popularly elected president of Ukraine, or our dear Supreme Council also popularly elected, or do we believe nobody at all? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, first of all, whenever I speak about this issue I never say that it is precisely how it will be. I say, there could be a power vacuum. You accurately laid stress on this. I will give you an example, there is a constitution standard and this is how it really is. Until a new Supreme Council is elected, the old Supreme Council carries out its functions. But I ask myself, and in order not to offend anybody, let us take Mykola Khomenko, secretary of the president's administration, who is a deputy in Konotop electoral district, and on 27 March they elect Sydorenko instead of Fomenko [word indistinct]. One was elected under the Soviet regime when Ukraine was part of the USSR under that electoral law, and this one will be elected on 27 March, and he will be given authority by the Electoral Commission that there were no violations and that he was elected in accordance with the law. Which deputy do I consider to be more important? Do you understand? [passage omitted] After this, the situation could worsen considerably, because [assume] there is no new Supreme Council, and new deputies have already been elected in place of the old ones. Assume they also come to Kiev and they ask: What are we to do? This is what I am talking about. How long will these elections go on for? Will they be finished immediately on 27 March or will they continue for two weeks or even longer. This period could be significantly complex. I am simply making a prognosis. I would like people to realize what this means. When I call on them to vote, I am doing it willingly because firstly, I know that it is an important stage and secondly, because no democratic country can consider itself really democratic if parliament and the freedom of political parties are absent from it. This is not a democratic state. I understand the difficulties, economic problems, etc. but voters must understand that they must elect a new Supreme Council. I do not want to predict now what type of parliament it will be, or how many democrats or partocrats will be there. I do not want to analyze this situation now. I want to say only one thing: We need a new parliament that would represent Ukraine on the basis of a new electoral law and freedom etc., as a democratic state. Regarding the elections that follow, this is another problem. I have already told you about them. Let us say, what kind of president will be elected? One that is set out in the Constitution, as the present one who is head of state and of the executive power with his powers, or another kind of president? There is no law. Next point. What sort of powers will the elected head of the council at town, village, rayon, and oblast level have? What sort of relations will he have with the center, the president, and the government? Which law governs his powers and functions? There is no law. There is, therefore, a danger that somebody could be elected tomorrow over whom the voters have no real influence. It will depend, therefore, on the individual who may or may not understand the situation. Since individuals vary one cannot count on understanding. It is necessary to clearly indicate this in law. Because I am saying this, it does not mean that I am defending my interests. I am describing the real situation so that the people and the mass media understand it, so they do not look for pitfalls, but see the real situation and the dangers for Ukraine if we really feel for Ukraine, not in words but in deeds. [Correspondent Lemin] Olha Lemin, VYBIR information agency. The presidential elections are taking place at the same time as local elections. What do you mean that the presidential elections and local elections should be slightly delayed? If you did not mean this, then who will make the decision for the local elections to be held separately from the presidential elections? [Kravchuk] I said both together. I do not separate the presidential [elections] and the local power bodies. The way I see it, is that the parliament adopts the appropriate laws with regard to the president and the local power bodies, clearly delimits their powers and functions, their rights, obligations and relations in detail, and sets this out in the constitution because this is the power. We have an example of two laws being adopted about the presidential representative and the local organs of power, and if these provisions had not been written in the Constitution...[pauses] You are aware that during every session somebody says: This is unconstitutional. This is reality. Power should be written into the Constitution. It is obligatory. This is why I am saying that two laws should be adopted, first one and then the other. They should both be elected. When? When the law is adopted. We cannot first elect them then pass a law. [passage omitted] I am not dividing them. I want them to be elected at the same time but only after laws are passed. This is an obligatory norm. [Unidentified correspondent] Japanese TV and Radio corporation [word indistinct]. Could you tell us, Mr. President, whether Ukraine plans to dismantle all of its nuclear weapons, and what the prospects are for getting real security guarantees after their elimination. [Kravchuk] According to the trilateral agreement, Ukraine will dismantle all of its nuclear arms. Incidentally, START I, which the Supreme Council has ratified, and Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol reservations on which have been lifted, imply precisely that -- elimination of all nuclear arms. According to the bilateral agreements, in particular those with Russia, Ukraine will abide by its commitments provided other states do the same and abide by their commitments, without creating complications during the period of eliminating nuclear arms. We must find ways to solve the most complex issues without putting brakes on this extremely important process for the entire world and all the people. As for security guarantees, the United States, Russia, and other states have given their consent for such guarantees, and this is no longer any problem. Our ministry is currently working on a relevant mechanism to determine whether it will be a statement or an agreement, who will sign it and what its content will be. But we also realize that both Russia and the United States tie the provision of security guarantees in a documented form with the ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty [NPT], although, by lifting the reservations as to the Lisbon Protocol, Ukraine has committed itself to joining the NPT as a non-nuclear state. It is a commitment and not mere words, but the NPT has to be ratified. Relevant documents have been submitted to the Supreme Council, and we will work persistently together with the ministry and the Cabinet of Ministers in order to gradually push it through and work this problem out. I am convinced that Ukraine will, in accordance with its obligations and the conceptual principles it declared, act consistently in this sensitive global area. This is a long-term and fundamental policy for our state. [Correspondent Zavytskyy] Myroslav Zavytskyy, NASHE SLOVO and ZA VILNU UKRAYINU newspapers. Esteemed Mr. President. The world views Ukraine with great hope as a factor of stability in (?this) part of Europe. But will the polls, which (Parnishkov) and his colleagues from Donetsk and Lugansk intend to conduct, not have negative consequences for this stability and for the preservation of Ukraine's unity? The second question, essentially a domestic one: How long will the attendants at the president's palace and other government structures address visitors in languages other than Ukrainian? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, one could reply to the second question formally thus: that in our law on languages of the Ukrainian SSR, as you remember, five years were given for people to be addressed thus. The five years are not up yet. But in this case I am against these five years. I believe that individuals in Ukraine can communicate in any language. That is their right. But as far as officials are concerned, and on official premises, then this should be in Ukrainian. This is the norm of any state. Well, whoever does not do this, perhaps he didn't have enough time or intelligence or the talent to master the Ukrainian language. Or perhaps he has simply forgotten about this law. We will remind them of it. But if you tell me the names, I could remind them more precisely. Now, with regard to the first question about the poll that is being conducted. Well, I knew that this issue is an acute one, and so I have already brought something here. I knew that this question would be asked without fail, especially as edicts have already been signed by Crimea's president. That is, at issue there is a poll of three questions in President Meshkov's edict. The first one: Are you in favor of renewing the clause in the Republic of Crimea's constitution, which was there back in May 1992, regulating relations between Crimea and Ukraine on the basis of treaties and agreements? That is the first question. The second: do you favor the Republic of Crimea's citizens having the right to dual citizenship? And the third: are you in favor of edicts from the Republic of Crimea's president on issues unregulated by legislation having the force of law? Well, I will simply remind you that this was already in the Republic of Crimea's constitution in 1992. It was there. For example, if one takes the first issue, there was this formula of 6 May 1992 in these words: The Republic of Crimea is part of the state of Ukraine and determines its relations with it on the basis of treaties and agreements. But then on 25 September 1992, after Ukraine submitted a request to the Supreme Council to bring its Constitution in line with Ukraine's Constitution, it was noted thus: The Republic of Crimea is part of the composition of Ukraine and determines its relations with it on the basis of mutually agreed legislative acts and agreements. That is, these issues were in the constitution. Crimea's Supreme Council withdrew them and brought them into line with Ukraine's constitution. Now, by means of a referendum -- consultative referendums and referendums are envisaged there in the law on referendums of the republic of Crimea. Polls are not envisaged. But a poll is possible in a resolution by Crimea's Supreme Council. Well, clearly it has no legislative or legal force. We are currently studying this issue. Our group of lawyers is studying it. That is, in whatever aspect it appears, it has no legal force. This is, well, an important element. It seems to me that it would be better to wait until Ukraine's constitution is adopted and act so that the interests of all regions are taken account of most fully in the constitution, and not to push people toward, say, confrontation, to an exacerbation of the situation. This is not a noble matter, but nobility is a relative concept. And the law, which is adopted, has legal force, and we will be guided namely by the law in our actions, and not by moral norms, because they are not noted, for example, in the legislative regulation of these problems. I expect that we will find a resolution of this issue. If it creates conflict, say, our services study it and come to this conclusion, then we will try to find a mutually acceptable resolution. But one thing is clear, whatever the outcome, it will not have legal force. [Correspondent Tykhyy] Esteemed Mr. President. Serhiy Tykhyy, UNIAN agency. Esteemed Mr. President: It is well known that one of the fundamental conditions for investing in the economy of another state is political and economic stability. If one is to proceed from your statement about your refusal to stand in the June presidential elections, and also your arguments for this stance, and also that which has been said at this press conference today, it is too early at the moment to speak of stability in Ukraine. In this connection my question is this: What arguments and what guarantees did you use in your conversations with your U.S. interlocutors to persuade them to invest funds in Ukraine's economy? Thank you. [Kravchuk] Well, in general to speak of some kind of serious stability in the transitional period -- from one life to another, from one society to another, from one economic system to another, and the political system, and the spiritual belief system, and the spiritual view of those problems -- is probably not easy. But everyone sees that in spite of all this in this time we in Ukraine have won independence without conflicts, that we are working without some kind of confrontational encounters, where blood is shed, where people shoot and kill. That is, I can say absolutely that we have peace and calm in Ukraine. And this is the most important sign of stability. But such stability as is connected with forming bodies of power cannot be identified, for example, if there is a president, then there is stability; if there is no president, then straight away there is no stability; if there is a Supreme Council, there is stability; if there is no Supreme Council, there is no stability. At issue is a vacuum of power. This is what it is about. This is why I say: If a situation arises whereby this vacuum becomes a reality, then the president should be highly responsible, for he has been elected by the people, and he cannot run for election at this time. Well, what sort of a president is it who stands for election in these circumstances, tell me please. He would then have put himself on a par with the other contenders. Say, for example, the Supreme Council had not been formed. Accordingly the government, the new government with a new program, similarly to the Supreme Council, had not been formed -- and the president runs for election. Then all the bodies of power in the localities run for election. This is what is at issue. That is why I say that at this time I, if these steps have not been taken, if the Supreme Council has not been elected and if the government has not been formed, then the Supreme Council (?sets to work), it produces a program, it appoints a new government, together with the president naturally, at least in accordance with the current constitution. The government assumes power. One might even manage to adopt a law on the Cabinet of Ministers. Then there is a Supreme Council, there is a Cabinet of Ministers, its powers and relations have been determined. Then one can take the next step. This is what it is about. I do not want you to connect, well, some kind of exacerbation of instability namely with this. This will not be. After all there is a president. And he has responsibility. There are bodies of power in the localities. This is the most important thing. There are deputies of the current composition of parliament, who can still assemble before 27 March, and if the good will is there, as they say, resolve these questions too. Why not? If there are laws, they can be adopted. That is, one cannot say that we are now in a dead-end. There are realistic possibilities. They should be made use of. But I convinced, well, how did I convince my, say, partners? I related to them the true situation, which exists in Ukraine. Incidentally, they know about it very well. One cannot say now that the situation in Ukraine is worse than in other regions. I can say absolutely that it is not worse, and in many cases better even. I would only wish that all of us together understood it thus, all together. Because some understand that this Ukrainian, this political striptease, is the biggest victory for those who write or speak. I think otherwise. [Correspondent Skachko] Volodymyr Skachko, NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. Mr. President, when arguing your refusal to run in the election, you said that you were offended by deputies, by the press, which supposedly badgers the president, who has been elected by the people. So this is my question: on the scales of history whose outrage is worse, yours at the press and deputies, or that of the people, who are still waiting for economic reforms? That is, to put the question more specifically: to what extent has your "Five D's" program been implemented? This is the first thing. Second: I would simply like to draw attention to the fact that such a thing has never occurred in this hall before -- news conferences always were held live. People simply came and wrote their names down and conveyed information. This time Comrade Ivanyn (?simply) pushed to one side a whole lot of journalists and brought in those whom he believes are of his opinion. So I would simply like to tell both your press secretary and you that if he wanted to do something for your image in this way, it is simply not done in this way. [Kravchuk] I do not know what you mean on the second point. I understand this question as an observation to our press service that it should take account of your wishes for some kind of record, you understand, I cannot even imagine what you are talking about. What record? A record of what? I do not understand this. But if you have a question in the hall, then you can put any question you like. Raise your hand and I will ask you to raise it, and I do not think that this is a problem for our hall. We can debate for as long as you have the strength, and I will have sufficient strength. That is the first thing. The second thing: I did not say that I was offended. I always emphasize that in politics one should never take offense at anyone. One can only be offended by close people, by those with whom we have some kind of mutual relations. But in politics taking offense is out of place. I am talking about something else -- that Ukraine can become a phenomenon, first, in how our own home-grown lords are undressing their own Ukraine in public, and consider this to be an achievement. Second, I said that Ukraine could become a phenomenon of the consolidated boorishness in relation to the president elected by the people, namely boorishness. Because the Ukrainian language is very rich in words, in intonations, and in accents. Culture means that one can make use of this to express everything one needs to -- whether to the president or to anyone else. I said that I am not going to compete with anyone in boorishness because I know in advance that I am doomed to defeat. Because I know the capabilities of those, who are competing in this. I know their capabilities. Especially as I have never set myself the task, and will never set myself the task of shutting someone up. If he has a pen, and Ukraine has given him the freedom of speech, namely independent Ukraine, before speaking one should think about whom this benefits. I always say that before taking any political decision or writing -- if you have children, come home in the evening, sit them down opposite you and look into their eyes and listen to what is happening -- refugees, death, blood, -- and then write, then call on people to act. It is namely this that I was talking about. I am convinced that no nation, no people, in the person of its intelligentsia, in the person of its elite, to which incidentally journalists belong, and whom I sincerely respect, will not become famous by being boorish or disrespectful to persons who have been elected by the people. They can face elections again, they can be, say, if they are involved in crime or something, there are appropriate bodies to deal with this. But there is no need whatever to compete in this. I advise you not to make use of these methods, because history has its own ways. (?Everything) that is written is to be remembered and submitted to the archives. Each person will be answerable to history, and for culture and for everything which has been done, and for the five D's, and for the six Ds, and for the three Ps, and will be answerable for everything. [Correspondent Veresen] Mykola Veresen, BBC. I would like to ask two questions to clarify details. What will the president of Ukraine, that is, you, do in the event that the Russians do not compensate for the missiles, which have already gone to Ukraine. As far as we understand, as far as I understand, there was to be a simultaneous crossing of the border by missiles on the part of Ukraine, and fuel elements, or compensation, on the part of Russia. Second, what will you do if Crimea separates despite everything -- because there is going to be a poll on the 27th and they will have grounds to leave Ukraine. The mood there is that the majority of people do not want to belong to Ukraine. [Kravchuk] I will start from the second question. I have read the questions to you. There is nothing there about what you are saying with regard to separating. The issue is dual citizenship and in what sort of composition the Republic of Crimea finds itself in Ukraine. On the contrary. There is nothing about separating. So that is not at issue. I cannot say on the basis of these three questions, which I expressed for you -- here they are -- that the poll is about separating. That is not there. Therefore, we will not speak about this. I am talking about the legal and lawful force of this, say, edict, which in this case we are studying, in relation to Ukraine's constitution and in relation to the law on the delimitation of powers between Ukraine and the republic of Crimea. This is the only area in which I can comment. Well, we have concluded an agreement with Russia -- it has been signed -- on compensation for the weapons, which have been taken out of Ukraine -- missiles are not taken out, warheads are taken out -- on respective compensation for uranium, which is in the form of fuel elements and fuel assemblies for Ukrainian nuclear power stations. This will be implemented. However, if one side suddenly ceases to implement it, then the other side will cease to implement it as well. This is a normal phenomenon; this is how it will be, but I do not expect it to come to this. We should work at it because this is in the interests of everyone -- Ukraine and Russia and the whole world. One cannot stop this process, say, by some unwise decision. Whoever is the first to make this decision will bear all of the historial responsibility for this. [Makarovych] Leonid Makarovych, (?INTERFAX-Ukraine). Tell me, please, what your attitude is to the possibility of the Russian joint stock company Gazprom being given the controlling package of shares in the flotation of Ukrainian gas pipelines and gas repositories on Ukraine's territory? This proposal was made yesterday at the talks in Moscow. Thank you. [Kravchuk] I know that we have long been discussing this issue on the flotation of, for example, our enterprises in Ukraine, including oil processing enterprises, and on setting up an appropriate Ukrainian corporation, for example Ukrnaftohaz [Ukrainian oil and gas]. This issue is also being raised. Setting up such a corporation and setting up joint stock enterprises, which will be part of this corporation -- this issue is being analyzed and documents are being elaborated. The issue is that the Ukrainian side must have the controlling package of shares without fail. This is an indispensable norm. We will not agree to another. [Makarychenko] Leonid Makarychenko, Intelnews agency. Esteemed Leonid Makarovych, I would still like to get a more precise reply to the question of whether the movement of fuel for Ukraine's nuclear power stations in the reverse direction, from Russia, has begun. Second, will your accord with Russia and the United States, your dialogue, allow a market to open to Ukrainian enterprises for conventional armaments? Third, Ukraine's space program -- the carriers, which launch space ships, can also easily launch other loads. Will these limitations not concern space programs? [Kravchuk] Well, we have just taken out 60 warheads. So, this is not yet such a, say, large amount that one can talk about a reverse movement. We are to take out 200 warheads by May, the end of May. An appropriate scheme is being elaborated. I stress that the agreement, which has been concluded and signed by Ukraine and Russia, envisages this -- that is, whenever this may be, for example, in one week or in two, but it is envisaged. This does not mean that fuel assemblies meet nuclear warheads, greet each other, and go their separate ways. There should be a certain time, but this is envisaged in the agreement. That is, both in the trilateral statement and in the documents affixed to it this is envisaged. Noone, neither Russia nor Ukraine, have refused to do this. That is, this will be carried out. I have already stressed to you that we submitted a draft document to the United States on cooperation in the sphere of space technology. In our conversations, and also at the Pentagon, we found support for participation by the United States. Prior to this we also had appropriate consultations and relations with French managers about the possibility of cooperation in the sphere of space technology, taking into account that this is, well, highly developed here, as we say, both the construction of the rockets themselves and the systems for controlling the rockets. Approximately...[pauses] not approximately, but on 22 March a delegation from the United States will come to Ukraine. It is headed by [U.S. Defense Secretary] Minister [William] Perry, and these issues will be further elaborated. That is, we have put them on the agenda, and we will elaborate them. That is, this is not being taken off the agenda. We want our rocket technology, our experience, our, say, priorities here, to be made use of not only for the benefit of Ukraine, but for the possibilities of other states. The United States and other countries have an understanding attitude to this. What else did you ask? [Makarychenko's reply indistinct] We did not discuss this issue in the United States with anyone. [Krushko] Ihor Hrushko, HOLOS UKRAYINY. Leonid Makarovych, I have one question for you, which is important in my opinion, which my colleagues have not considered. As is well known, during the trilateral talks in Moscow the question of compensation to Ukraine for the tactical nuclear weapons, which were taken out of Ukraine, was also raised. The question was raised, but as far as I know, it has not been resolved yet. Please tell me, when you were in Washington, did you discuss this with the American President? [Kravchuk] We discussed this with the Russian side and in this agreement, which I mentioned has been initialled and is to be signed on the part of Russia and Ukraine by their respective governments, such compensation is envisaged, and it is envisaged as a whole. All of this is noted in this document. [Verchuk] Mr. President, tell me, did people go to the United States with you who are capable of creating competitive production or were they mainly intermediaries? For we can get out of the economic crisis only when we begin to produce competitive products. Stepan Verchuk. [Kravchuk] Well, products are produced by people. These are workers, engineers, designers. These people did not go with me, because there are 52 million such people in Ukraine in all. Ministers and advisors came with me. They do not produce products, but that Ukraine can produce competitive products is a real fact. [passage omitted] That is, there are colossal possibilities in Ukraine for going over to the best competitive products. However, you see the situation that has arisen. All of these products were produced on the basis of raw materials and energy-carriers, which came from other states, but now prices have gone up thousands of times. We have ended up in a difficult situation. [passage omitted] Everything has to be reformed. The structure has to be changed. We have to make what we have the possibilities for and find our niche on the world market, in Europe and America. Incidentally, our agreements envisage all of this, that goods will move and that there will not be, say, these various customs hindrances, or dual taxation. That is, all of this is envisaged. Time is needed. [passage omitted] We have to take on board experience; we have to work. The main thing is that all are convinced that only by working can the problem be shifted. There is no other way. Not a single country has yet resolved its problems without people beginning to work in an organized and qualified way, making use of their own possibilities. There is no other way. [Unidentified correspondent] POLITYKA I CHAS [POLITICS AND TIME]. Esteemed Mr. President, we have received information that part of the money that Washington will give us for economic assistance will be spent on purchasing grain or soya. Would it not be more expedient to buy progressive technology with this money? I understand that noone in the United States is going to sell us anything very good, because at the same time if they give us the opportunity to sell our natural resources, they will lose a market, the Russian market. But are work and searches under way in this direction, for example, among the Ukrainian diaspora in the United States, in that agricultural country Argentina, for example, where Ukrainians play a large role in agriculture, because this is a very topical issue? [passage omitted] [Kravchuk] Well, this money will not be spent on purchase of grain. This money includes 352 million for nuclear arms elimination and 350 million to solve our economic problems having to do with, first of all, know-how, structural reform, privatization, and other factors. The issue about granting us a credit to buy pesticides and [word indistinct] is dealt with separately but it does not concern grain. What is special about these credits is that they take account of everything: If we are allowed, say, 150 million this year for nuclear arms elimination, we must decide together where this money should be channelled to, whether more could be channelled toward fuel processing, the dismantling of a part of the infrastructure, the elimination of warheads, missiles, and other areas. We also, however, have a problem with conversion, a problem with housing for officers, a problem with social security. During our talks at the Pentagon and with the secretary of defense, we emphasized the need to use more money for these purposes, to ensure social stability. Thus, this money is for a specific purpose. [passage omitted] [Kurbas, in Russian] Oleksiy Kurbas, KOMMERSANT UKRAINY. The new credits will be granted to Ukraine on condition that market reforms continue. Meanwhile, our government has won a reputation of being against reforms. Can we expect, therefore, any changes in the cabinet in the near future? [Kravchuk] Well, this is not the case of a new government coming to power and making itself a reputation. Many of the present members worked under former Prime Ministers [Vitold] Fokin and [Leonid] Kuchma. Incidentally, this government inherited all the members of the previous one, formed by Leonid Danylovych [Kuchma] together with the Supreme Council, and I do not deny my own hand in this. However, one can say this: If you take the current reforms -- say, privatization -- and measure them then you will see that real privatization has only just begun, I mean real, not verbal, privatization. For example, recently the Kramatorsk heavy machine-building plant was privatized. I was asked today by representatives of the West, what are the criteria? What will be the next step? I will tell you: There are dozens of appeals in my daily mail coming from directors, who are often labelled red directors, saying that they want to have their enterprises privatized. Just a year ago nobody wrote this. On the contrary, they wrote: What are you doing? Where are you leading us? But now they write: Permit us to privatize. These are former leaders, Communists, labelled red and other labels. This is what they say now. Life itself leads an individual toward certain steps. If we are planning to privatize over 30,000 small, medium-sized, and large enterprises this year, and this has already begun to happen, this is real privatization, and these are real reforms. We are talking about a certain extent of stabilization in the finance-and-credit system and a drop in inflation. I am not about to talk of great successes. I am afraid to. However, in January inflation was already 19 percent, and in February, 20 percent. If you compare this to last year's, it is poles apart. I am not saying these are great successes, but you can see that something is breaking through and taking shape. Something new is being born, something old is dying, and something of the old is still holding on. Of course, I would like to see land reform gain pace. I would like other processes in the bank and credit system to gain pace. However, you cannot force them; otherwise you would have to use administrative methods, use force. People need to mature for this. Take land reform, for example. It is a very painful issue. I recently returned from Lithuania where I spoke to President Brazauskas. The most serious problem for them today is the problem of the countryside, because they declared reforms in the countryside, gave land to the people, and now the people say, take it back. To take the land, one needs to have an infrastructure, not only for production but to know to whom and when to sell it, how to pay, to have mini-technology, and to know where to buy pesticides and mineral fertilizers, in order to be on the market. If you do not have all this, you can only declare reforms. You will end up killing the countryside, because it is not that simple. I do not think we can look at it this way: If we declare reforms today, they will take off tomorrow, because, whatever criticism you may fire at the Supreme Council, it did pass a privatization program for 1994 the same way it approved anti-inflation measures. People change under the pressure of life, and reforms will take off. There is no alternative to that. We will not build socialism in one country, Ukraine. That is a fact, and everybody understands it. [passage omitted] [Rudenko] SVOBODA newspaper, Raisa Rudenko. Do you believe that the improvement in relations between Ukraine and America will affect Ukraine's nation-building? Do you see it posing any threat to Ukrainian sovereignty? [Kravchuk] How should one analyze this? If you analyze it from the point of purely Soviet Communist mentality, it would look like this: If a country is suddenly helping us, look deeper. If people interpreted the favorable attitude of the United States, its friendly attitude toward Ukraine, its willingness to help, like that, it would make one think. Because I remember the times when one was made to think that if any country is treating you well, you must look for some underlying reasons. However, I think those times are a thing of the past, and the majority of people understand that without the assistance of large countries, without their favorable attitude it is practically impossible to build an independent Ukraine. A very important factor to me is the fact that the U.S. President said without reservation that he respects Ukraine's sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, and that this is something to be reckoned with. This was also said in other documents and statements. This was said in the trilateral statement signed in Moscow. Thus, I would like to say, if those who think that holding onto nuclear weapons one cannot use is a guarantee of security, continue to think so, then I guess they cannot think otherwise, they are doomed. It is clear now that only with help, with support, with guarantees and good relations with the neighbors within the CIS and beyond we can build an independent Ukrainian state. If only we cna also come to terms among ourselves. [passage omitted] Therefore, I am convinced that these kinds of relations are the only guarantee, provided we work ourselves, take advantage of this situation, and use this assistance in the interests of the economy and the people, that Ukraine will move faster toward reforms and toward a better lifestyle. Wondering whether Ukraine is to be or not to be, as some put it, is something I will never stand for. Ukraine is here to stay, by all means. Nobody can reverse the course of history. One can [word indistinct] it, one can impudently tear at it, but one has to be mad to wonder whether it is to be or not to be. Forgive me for saying this, but one gentleman said to me: What do you think, will Ukraine survive or not? I replied in a not-so-tolerant way: I have no doubt that Ukraine will survive as I have no doubt that it will outlive you. [Boyko] Oksana Boyko, VECHIRNIY KIEV newspaper. Leonid Makarovych, I would like you to clarify two more aspects of your American visit. The Clinton administration is often accused of taking a personalized approach to relations with certain countries, particularly Russia, treating Russia as Yeltsin. It looks like the same personalization is taking place now in seeing Ukraine through Kravchuk. You were talking about the next presidential election. If there is an early election, and you indeed do not take part in it, do you think it will put a freeze on our thawing relations with America? Another thing: In January this year, American intelligence predicted that Ukraine may split into several separate nuclear states. Did you sense any reference to this prediction during your negotiations at the White House, or does the White House ignore the predictions of its intelligence? [Kravchuk] I will begin with the second question. Why read American intelligence reports? Read our own publications and you will find there that Ukraine will definitely split into three or four or as many as one feels like, parts. No need for intelligence, you can read what we say and write ourselves. This does not mean that we cannot think this way or make predictions, but I would not think there are any grounds for seeing any tragedy in this. The main thing is for us to understand that our cause is to unite around the highest task of building an independent, democratic, law-governed, friendly, and peaceful Ukraine, one that takes advantage of its wealth; its natural, human, scientific, and technical potential; joins all European and world structures; makes friends with neighbors and does not settle any scores with anyone. I think we will cope with this task because we have no alternative. Everybody must understand this. As for personalization, I talked about this in the United States when I was asked similar questions. By the way, nobody asked me this in the White House, but journalists did ask. I said: Ukraine is there, START-I has been ratified, and reservations have been lifted on Paragraph 5 of the Lisbon Protocol. Finally, there are programs set by the Supreme Council and the government. These are real facts. To turn away from this course, which has already begun to pave its way straight on the fields, at the factories, and in the mentality and souls of the people by consolidating this realization, would not be that simple. Every period is associated with a certain personality, but this does not mean that the people would allow themselves to elect a president who would pursue a different course, against independence or against statehood. I cannot imagine that. People will not stand for that. They would elect a person who would fight for the state, for a democratic, law-governed state. If something should suddenly happen, well, there are zig-zags in history, but it would be impossible today. That is what I think, and there is no tragedy in it. There are no eternal presidents. Everyone must do his job and let others do theirs. It is up to the people to decide who they should elect. Thank you for the meeting. I wish you all the best.
