President of the academy Mr. Hu Sheng revealed this news at a work meeting for 1994 held here today. He added that it was a necessity for such a system to be set up. Mr. Hu noted that the establishment of the academician system was considered an important measure for upgrading the prestige and status of the academy in international academic circles, enhancing the influence of the academy in these circles and helping realize the developmental strategy of the academy. At the annual meeting, the academy confirmed clearly its goal for further development which involves the building of the academy into a national research centre on philosophy and the social sciences of a high level and of great vigor with the eventual aim of serving reform and opening to the outside world as well as material and spiritual civilization. The academy has taken a number of measures for this end including the introduction of excellent scholars from outside the academy and from abroad for the undertaking of research. Mr. Hu said that this was aimed at attracting top-rate researchers in order to make the academy a real research centre for the social sciences and the humanities. The social science sector in China has given a strong positive response to the establishment of the system and see it as an urgent need. The creation of such a system, however, involves many social science personnel coming from local branches of the academy as well from other government organs, the military force, higher learning institutions and party schools at various levels. It poses certain difficulties in its setting up, but with the creation and improvement of a system of this kind in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, it is inevitable for the social sciences academy to follow suit.
