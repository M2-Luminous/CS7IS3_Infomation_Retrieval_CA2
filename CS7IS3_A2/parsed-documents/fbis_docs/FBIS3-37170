Eduard Amvrosiyevich [Shevardnadze] and myself have a good tradition of meeting each other as often as possible. We take every opportunity to maintain a constant working spirit. We took this opportunity in Ashgabat before meeting each other here. Naturally, we discussed practical problems relating to cargo deliveries, the progress of the implementation of trade and economic agreements, and we addressed regional problems, such as the settlement of the conflicts in Nagorno-Karabakh and Abkhazia. We concluded that there is no alternative to a peaceful solution of these conflicts. To solve these conflicts, we should use the good offices of international organizations -- the CSCE and the United Nations, as well as Russia's special initiative. We reaffirmed the intention expressed at the meeting between Eduard Amvrosiyevich with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin [on 3 February in Tbilisi] to organize a regional meeting that will bring together the leaders of Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. These, in fact, are all the problems that we discussed today, during our private meeting and during the meeting between the delegations. We reaffirmed our intention to organize a summit among Russia, Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. [Shevardnadze] I confirm that there are internal needs that prompt us to meet. The current situation in our countries prompts us to meet more often and promote relations between the two neighboring states, which have a centuries-old tradition of friendship, cooperation, and fraternity. I think that every such meeting is another step toward the strengthening of our contacts and cooperation. This is what has happened just now. It seems to me that on all problems which are of interest and concern to our countries, we managed to work out a common approach and common principles. The main thing is to achieve, as soon as possible, the completion of the conflict settlement process. Levon Akopovich and myself became convinced that, despite some individual peculiarities, there are common laws regarding conflict settlement. We are convinced that the leadership of Armenia, in particular, Levon Akopovich and his colleagues, can do something considerable to settle the conflict in Abkhazia. And, perhaps, we could also be useful regarding the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. An agreement in principle was reached today that we both deem useful the development of Caucasian dialogue, as we said. This problem was discussed at the meeting with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. I am aware of the opinion of President of Azerbaijan Geydar Aliyevich Aliyev. It seems that we, the leaders of the four states, consider very important and useful to hold such a dialogue on a regular basis. In the beginning, it will probably be held at the summit level. But later, these contacts will include ministries, and there will be meetings between the prime ministers and foreign ministers. You were surprised why the security [sentence as received]. The security and interior ministers will also meet. If we cooperate as neighbors, everything will be possible. All issues should be settled. Therefore, the main result of our meeting is perhaps the fact that we decided to work on this idea until it is implemented. [Correspondent] What is the position of the CIS member states leaders regarding the decision to launch air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Ter-Petrosyan] This is a difficult question. I think that now the world has to pay for its failure to react adequately in order to solve this problem. This is my point of view. It is an extreme measure, the most unwelcome one out of everything that could have been chosen. I am still hoping that things will not go that far. There is still time. Perhaps, the international community will use all its efforts to avoid an air strike. [Shevardnadze] I agree with what Levon Akopovich says. I will say that, in principle, I am in favor of the implementation of decisions adopted by international organizations. However painful and difficult they may be, I am in favor of decisive measures, because any indecisiveness and uncertainty leads to even more serious consequences. This happened to us in Abkhazia, as it did in other conflicts. Of course, there is some time, but not too much.
