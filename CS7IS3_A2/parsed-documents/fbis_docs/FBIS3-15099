Karimov Promises Not To Tolerate Discrimination"] [Text] "Uzbekistan has no future without Russia," Uzbekistan President I. Karimov stated while on an official visit to Moscow. Confirmation of this is the package of documents signed in the Kremlin by B. Yeltsin and I. Karimov. The key document among them is the Russian-Uzbek Declaration, noting the principles of friendly relations between the two countries and a mutual interest in developing bilateral links. The spectrum of these is broad, and it is elaborated in detail in the economic and military treaties. But this list lacks an extremely important document which is vital for guaranteeing the rights of the Russian-speaking population in Uzbekistan. It was learned that I. Karimov is not as yet prepared to sign the treaty on dual citizenship proposed by Russia. But he did give the Russian president assurances that he will not tolerate human rights infringements on ethnic grounds.
