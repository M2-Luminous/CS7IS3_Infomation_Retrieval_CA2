Good morning to you. [Pawlak] Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] Last night, you said on television that you had made a decision on Borowski's resignation. Have you already signed the document, or will you sign it in the future? In other words, is the decision final? [Pawlak] Of course, these procedural issues will take some time yet, but these decisions were made not so much because I wanted it so but because of declarations by the concerned persons themselves. I think that the way it is in politics is that sometimes one knows another politician very well on a personal level, and we are colleagues in that regard, but when it comes to the political arrangement, sometimes you have to take a different path than your colleague, and perhaps this is what happened in this case. I think this should not have a bearing on the future or on our mutual relationship, either on a personal level or on a political one. You simply must concentrate not just on procedural or personnel issues, but on specific problems. There are different positions from which one may approach solving these problems. [Woyciechowski] A decision on a deputy prime minister's resignation--is that the kind of decision the prime minister consults the president about? [Pawlak, hesitating] Of course, one could think of a number of different formal obstacles, but I do not think that is the case here. As far as constitutional provisions are concerned, the prime minister submits a motion to the president, who signs it. Naturally, he does not have to sign it; such cases have occurred under the previous cabinet, but I think it will not happen in this case. [Woyciechowski] And now let us talk for a while about Borowski's successor. This will be decided within the next few days. How will it happen? Will the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] or Kwasniewski suggest a candidate whom he will select himself and you will then approve automatically, or do you intend to select a candidate from among several options? In a word, who will select Borowski's successor--you or the SLD? [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I cannot say at this point what will happen, but I do not think the decision will be made by a single person or by just one side. We will talk about that together [with the SLD]. I just want to strongly emphasize that the post and the whole area of issues was reserved for the SLD under the coalition agreement we signed last year, and I think we will follow that provision. [Woyciechowski] Does that mean that you will approve of any candidate suggested by the SLD? [Pawlak] We will talk about that. I think both we and they are eager to see a candidate who is well prepared, who is an expert on financial issues and on economic policies. In that case, such a person has a big chance to be selected for the post. [Woyciechowski] Last night, the SLD leaders said they already have a good candidate, but they cannot reveal his name yet. Are you, Mr. Prime Minister, familiar with the name? [Pawlak] Well, I have not heard about that, either, so let us wait patiently for a while longer. [Woyciechowski] Borowski had two posts: deputy prime minister and finance minister. Will these continue to be performed by a single person, or will you separate the two posts? [Pawlak] I really think that to go into detail too much is a little premature right now. We will talk about th at issue within the coalition. and then I think we will make a final decision. [Woyciechowski] Will these talks take place tonight? [Pawlak] Yes, talks between the coalition partners are scheduled to take place tonight, and I think we will discuss specific issues then. I would like to turn your attention to the fact that this is not a procedural or personnel problem but one linked to divisions or different approaches to the reforms. These divisions or approaches exist within the two parties themselves. It used to be quite simple. All you had to do was speak out in favor of this or that kind of political regime, and this enabled you to become the guardian of the holy fire. But today, when everyone is in favor of democracy and the free market, it is no longer the case that you have just one party or one individual who guarantees that the reforms will not deviate from the right path. The direction of our reforms was approved by the entire society. The quality and rate of these changes--that remains an open issue. The first issue is the manner in which we reach the goal of a market economy, and these issues are discussed not only between the parties but also within the parties. That can be seen from what happened yesterday. This can be seen in both the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]. I think this is the main and fundamental problem we are facing now in the entire parliament. [Woyciechowski] So, if I understand correctly, the issue is not about personnel changes but more about changes in economic policies. Will Poland's economic policies be changed with Borowski's departure? [Pawlak] I would like to turn your attention to the fact that the fundamental elements--that is to say, the issue of financial discipline and the degree to which the budget is realistic--are equally....[Pawlak pauses] We all attach equal importance to these issues because they determine the degree to which our measures are realistic. But different aspects may receive different degrees of attention; the main investment directions may receive a different kind of attention. Apart from the strictly financial or budget-related issues, attention must also be paid to the budget's impact on both companies and big social groups. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Prime Minister, now the last of the rumors that have been appearing in the papers recently. A few of the dailies write about that today: Do you take into account the possibility of a resignation by Minister [and chief of the Office of the Council of Ministers] Strak? [Pawlak] Perhaps once he offers his resignation. So far he has not resigned. [Woyciechowski] So, in other words, it does not look like he is going anywhere. Now, a somewhat more serious question: Is there an alternative to the current coalition? [Pawlak] I think the election results and the current parliamentary configuration are responsible for the fact that we must first look for solutions within the current coalition. I can see that kind of will and readiness to act in both the PSL and the SLD. Of course, we cannot find solutions quickly and easily to all of the issues, but the essence of politics is about looking for compromise solutions; it is not a zero-balance game, where, if one wins, the other party must lose completely. The situation we have is such that, as long as we can come up with an acceptable compromise and an agreement, we gain much more in total than in situations where we would decide to butt our heads together. I think that, while looking for specific solutions, we will definitely move ahead much faster than by focusing on procedural issues only. These issues of procedure and organization-management are important, but they do not constitute a topic for public debate because they are the internal business of the various organizations and structures. [Woyciechowski] That was an extremely diplomatic response. What you really meant was: No, there is no alternative. But you began the sentence with the phrase "we must first look for solutions." When one talks about something being first, that means there is something second as well, that there is another some kind of.... [Pawlak, interrupting] You [addressing Woyciechowski] are always able to read my mind perfectly and then interpret what I want to say in your own way. I think I will not disturb the harmony you just introduced. [Woyciechowski] But the question is: Is there an alternative to the current coalition? I mean not as of today but perhaps in six months. Or perhaps there is no alternative arithmetically speaking, or in terms of party programs, and so the coalition must continue in its current shape? [Pawlak] I think for the coalition to continue is the most likely solution for right now, and I think one should focus on that, without looking for some kind of strange or exotic solutions. [Woyciechowski] When you say exotic solutions, you are certainly making an allusion to what the press has also been writing about for a few days now: he possibility of a coalition among the PSL, the Confederation for an Independent Poland [KPN], part of the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ], and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms [BBWR]. Is my understanding correct here? [Pawlak] Well, on that issue, unfortunately you [addressing Woyciechowski and laughing] are abusing your rights here by describing these issues according to your own criteria. By the same token, one could say that some offers made by the Democratic Union [UD] addressed to the SLD may seem surprising, in particular because there was a time when declarations were made [by UD] in no uncertain terms that there would be no agreement, period. But, as you can see, overcoming prejudices is possible even between the two parties, and I think it is the right thing to do since it is about time to put an end to historical divisions, and it is time to start talking about the problems. I think that, when one looks at the current situation, amidst all the emotions linked to all of the personnel issues, what struck me was that so little attention was paid to such an important event as the treaty of association with the EEC, which became effective on 1 February; the signing of the "Partnership for Peace" that took place on 2 February; or even the processes that are taking place here in Poland--I mean the issue of talks between the government and employers on one hand, and trade unions on the other. These talks are conducted by Deputy Prime Minister Cimoszewicz and [Labor] Minister Leszek Miller. During these talks, such issues are debated as the economic system's fundamental parameters and also the parameters of the program we will implement in the near future and in the following years. There was little talk, for instance, about yesterday's meeting between [Industry and Trade] Minister Pol and the miners trade unions. I think these--at least the last two cases I mentioned--are the kinds of events that determine our ability to conduct talks together and look for solutions. We talk in a peaceful manner and not through various kinds of protests or street demonstrations. These are also factors shaping our reality today. I think we should make a joint effort so that journalists not only focus on easily visible sensations but devote at least a little of their time to significant and serious problems. Perhaps these do not provide as many emotions as.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] As the case of [recently dismissed Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec or of Bank Slaski? [Pawlak] Or as some cases of ice skating and broken legs [not further identified]. But these problems are certainly important, and we must maintain the right proportions or else what we have then is the impression that, practically speaking, life at the top is just made up of nothing but sensations, and those processes that provide fewer emotions and occupy more time of the people concerned--these are almost completely ignored. That is also a comment against the background of debates or criticism concerning the Cabinet's information policies. I think that to talk about information policies is quite ridiculous to begin with. That is because I do not think the point is for the government to organize a press conference every now and then and to tell stories. If there are no stories to tell, then, even if the government holds a press conference every three hours, there will be no one to write or talk about it or to present it on television. Information policies are about creating such facts and about focusing attention on such processes, which are important from the standpoint of society and the state, and, in that case, I think that even if someone has bad faith, he simply cannot ignore such issues. [Woyciechowski] After such an introduction, I must ask you a very serious question. I will therefore ask you about the budget. The Council of Ministers will decide today on the final shape of the budget. Are Minister Kolodziejczyk and Minister Miller going to get more money? [Pawlak] Some corrections are envisioned in the budget. They are the result of the possibility of shifts among various budget items. They amount to a pretty considerable sum--approximately 5.5 trillion zlotys. However, there are also proposals and suggestions on the part of the committees that do not correspond to real revenues. Therefore, in this situation, these proposals are difficult to put into effect. The budget must be based on reality. One cannot plan expenditures as one wishes. I think that the government has gone to great lengths to maximize the revenues and to optimize the expenditures as much as possible. Now, this is an interesting paradox: On the one hand, we are criticized that this budget is stretched too tight, and, on the other, we are criticized that it has not used up all of the reserves and all of the possibilities. I think this really shows that we have managed to find a solution that may not be unique, but that is one of the solutions that can be implemented and that resolves the most fundamental problems. [Woyciechowski] This means that this budget will stay as it is? This means that there will be no major change in the budget? Will there be only cosmetic changes? [Pawlak] We are all responsible for the solutions that are in the budget. It is not that one person or one party is the guarantee of stability and responsibility. We all have this feeling of both responsibility and reality. Now, as I say, this budget is not the only... [Pawlak pauses] It definitely is not the best possible budget. However, it is one of the solutions that can really be implemented and that definitely resolves a few problems, such as the problem of lowest retirement and disability pensions. These solutions were decided on as early as December of last year. Also the issues related to mining. We can definitely say that the Ministry of Industry concentrated on resolving the problems of mining in such a way as to avoid group layoffs; it also does not want mines to be closed down en masse. The ministry sees to it that these processes are implemented smoothly and gently. If a mine is running out of its underground deposits and must be closed down, the people working there do not lose their jobs; they are moved to other mines. These are examples of very concrete solutions that can be achieved even with the small amount of financial resources we have at our disposal. They can be achieved if these resources are concentrated on the areas that must be dealt with most urgently. [Woyciechowski] For a few days now, Poland has been a partner of NATO. It has been a partner for peace. Also for a few days, NATO generals have been wondering whether the Serb positions in Sarajevo should be bombarded. Is Poland consulted about such a NATO decision? Has anyoe tried to consult you about this problem? Has anyone asked about your opinion on this matter? [Pawlak] There have been no such consultations with me yet. There have not been such consultations on a government level. If my evaluation of this situation is correct, I get the impression that these are independent decisions of NATO. However, if we take a look at the UN Security Council, differences of opinion are quite noticeable there, and it is not at all certain whether this particular solution will be put into effect. Yugoslavia is an example of a very painful and tragic situation, where the elements of hatred have led to a situation where probably hardly anyone remembers what exactly started this conflict, whereas this destructive war is going on. This war is not of a linear nature--that is, where there is a front line, on both sides of which there are the two parties. It is of an area nature: These communities have mixed with one another for a few dozen years, and now it is difficult to find a way to separate or reconciliate these fighting parties. First, they should try to find a solution themselves. Outside intervention in these processes will certainly not yield a peaceful solution. I believe that various ideas and solutions are possible here. I think this depends mainly on the inhabitants of Yugoslavia; it depends on whether they are able to speak to each other peacefully. [Woyciechowski] When is Poland going to negotiate the details of its partnership in NATO? When will we decide whether we should place a platoon, a company, or many divisions at the disposal of NATO? [Pawlak] We spoke about this when this document was being signed. I think that, generally speaking, we should focus on those activities that do not entail any great financial resources. Neither side has too many superfluous resources that could be earmarked for these processes. Therefore, most efforts will probably be concentrated on the elements that are crucial as far as the possibilities of cooperation are concerned, such as the systems of information exchange amd compatibility of managing these complex organisms. Then, regardless of equipment differences, it will be possible for us to act jointly and to cooperate.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] That means slowly and quietly? [Pawlak] I think that many things can be done in this area with the resources that we have right now at the disposal of the Ministry of National Defense [MON], on condition that they are spent on establishing such procedures and solutions that are compatible and that would let us cooperate with our NATO partners. [Woyciechowski] When will you sign the appointments of deputy ministers in the three presidential ministries? Will you sign them at all? Has the decision been made yet? [Pawlak] Well, you know, as far as the presidential ministries are concerned, I can say that I have signed a few appointments. These were not appointments that were not discussed and agreed to at the political summit. There were earlier agreements. As it turns out, they are not always satisfactory in this broad political dimension; however, it is a more remote issue, and I think we will be able to find a solution that is satisfactory to all of our partners. Nevertheless, this must be done in such a way as to focus on certain issues; therefore, we should seek people who would resolve very concrete and important problems; we should not focus on some symbolic ambitions--that this or that politician must for a while be in the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs because this would fit the political bouquet. Now, returning to issues related to the Partnership for Peace for a while, I would like to stress that, since the meeting in Prague, we have been very consistently proposing a slightly different concept: partnership for development. I must say that this proposal has been very favorably received in the West. I believe that it would be good if we worked on this concept in our country as well, in order to be able to use the opportunities that are emerging in all directions; we should also seek partners in those places where our offers are answered positively. Now, if we implement the partnership for development--that is, if we extend the areas of cooperation, especially the areas of economic cooperation, as well as cultural and political cooperation--this will provide a permanent basis for the Partnership for Peace and for enhancing our international security. [Woyciechowski] Let us revert to internal affairs for a while. You are meeting with SLD politicians, including Kwasniewski, this evening. Will everything be resolved tomorrow morning in the coalition? Do you think it will be easy to discuss all of the issues in a few hours? Do you think this will last long? What kind of attitude have you adopted before these talks--a very militant one or a slightly compromising one? [Pawlak] Well, I believe we all really want to find the right solutions and resolve concrete problems because only then can we be certain about our political peace and about the political future. The experience of recent years and the political configurations in general have shown that peace in cabinets is not as important as the resolution of the problems that are crucial from the viewpoint of the people. This is the best evidence of the efficiency of politicians. I think that at this coalition meeting we will certainly seek solutions in the individual, personnel dimension; however, we will first discuss the strategic activities related to the program of the functioning of the government and the coalition; we will also try to point to areas that we should particularly focus on right now and areas where these resources should be used so that the best results can be achieved. [Woyciechowski] What do such talks look like? How do you and Kwasniewski address each other? Are you very familiar with him, and do you call him by his first name? [Pawlak] I think that the recent weeks have had a great advantage: All of us in the entire parliament were able to get to know one another. As far as large parts of the Deputies' Clubs are concerned, we know one another quite well, and we do not address each other by any titles; we are very straightforward. This is something I value very highly because, no matter whether we are in the government camp or in the opposition, we can speak to one another. This goes not only for the SLD, but also for all of the other groupings, such as UD, the BBWR, the KPN, the Union of Labor.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But how do you address Kwasniewski--by his first name? [Pawlak] Yes, I do. It would be an exaggeration.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] You are said to be a hard and obstinate politician. Now, could you say a few words about Kwasniewski's character? What adjectives would you use? [Pawlak] Well, really, I can speak about myself. However, as for other people, I believe I should not do what is a journalist's job. [Woyciechowski] Today you are not wearing the necktie you received from Kwasniewski, are you? [Pawlak] Well, it so happens that it would not really go very well with this suit. [Woyciechowski] Are you going to wear it one day? [Pawlak] I suppose so. We will see what the tie is like. Perhaps it will be a lucky tie and a lucky solution. I think this also shows that politics can sometimes be taken not so seriously. However, in everyday life, probably hardly anyone realizes that the mental stress accompanying the decisions that have to be made is often enormous. It must also be remembered that such decisions require both great caution and the feeling of responsibility because they concern a lot of people. Here one simply cannot afford to make a mistake. As a rule, the decisions must be given a lot of thought; they must at once start positive processes. [Woyciechowski] In other words, you have given a lot of thought to the recent decisions. On the day you signed Kawalec's resignation, did you know what would happen next? Was this scenario easy to predict? Or did you not know it at that time? [Pawlak] It is certainly not possible to predict all of the consequences that a given decision may cause, and I do not think that... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But you did take such developments into account, did you not? [Pawlak] I must frankly admit that I did not think there was such a danger; I also thought that the decisions that followed were neither necessary nor desirable. I think this affair could have been resolved in another way. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Pawlak] Thank you.
