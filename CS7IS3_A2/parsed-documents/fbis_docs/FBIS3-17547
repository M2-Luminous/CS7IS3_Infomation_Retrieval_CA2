"This Russian-Polish agreement is just the first step towards creating an all-encompassing system to counter organized crime in Europe," the commander in chief of Russia's border guards and head of the Russian delegation, Andrey Nikolayev, told a news conference afterwards. "So far this has been done at regional level, but in the very near future we intend to conclude similar agreements with our counterparts from Lithuania and Belarus, and Poland is also willing to join them. After that, there should be an agreement at overall, pan-European level." It was stressed at the news conference that while becoming an obstacle to criminal gangs, the Russian-Polish border should remain as open as possible for economic and cultural cooperation between the two states.
