FR940826-1-00086 FR940826-1-00017 These actions are identical to those described in the Proposed Plan. III. 1994 Proposed Effluent Guidelines Plan In the Proposed Plan, EPA described its intent to continue development of nine ongoing rulemakings, develop eight additional rules between 1996 and 2003, and conduct preliminary studies. The Proposed Plan set forth EPA's rationale for the selection of particular industries as candidates for new or revised effluent guidelines. The Proposed Plan also described the relevant statutory framework, the components and process for development of an effluent guidelines regulation, and other background information. The principal elements of the Proposed Plan were designed to implement sec. 304(m) and a consent decree in Natural Resources Defense Council et al. v. Reilly (D.D.C. 89&hyph;2980, January 31, 1992) (the ``Consent Decree''). See 59 FR 25860&hyph;25865. IV. 1994 Effluent Guidelines Plan EPA's 1994 Effluent Guidelines Plan is set forth below. Today's Plan is substantively identical to the Proposed Plan. As noted above, the basis for selection of the industries identified in today's Plan is described in the Proposed Plan. A. Regulations 1. Ongoing Rulemakings The Agency is currently in the process of developing new or revised effluent guidelines for nine categories. (These categories were listed in the Proposed Plan.) The categories and actual or projected dates for proposal and final action are set forth in Table 1. Table 1._ Effluent Guidelines Currently Under Development 1Category 1Proposal 1Final action lPulp, paper and paperboard.1 12/17/93 9/95 Pesticide formulating, packaging, and repackaging 4/14/94 8/95 lMetal products and machinery, phase.1 11/94 5/96 Centralized waste treatment 212/94 29/96 Coastal oil and gas extraction 1/95 7/96 Pharmaceutical manufacturing 22/95 28/96 Industrial laundries 12/96 12/98 Transportation equipment cleaning 12/96 12/98 Landfills and incinerators 23/97 23/99 1The Pulp, Paper and Paperboard rulemaking is not covered by the NRDC consent decree. Deadlines are subject to a consent decree in EDF et al v. Thomas (D.D.C. No. 85&hyph;0973). 2These dates reflect pending unopposed motions to extend consent decree deadlines. EPA will include any updates to these schedules in the semi-annual Regulatory Agenda published in the Federal Register . 2. Future Regulations a. Metal Products and Machinery Phase 2. The 1992 consent decree requires that EPA begin rulemaking for the Metal Product and Machinery Phase 2 (MP&M 2) category in 1995. As announced in the 1992 Effluent Guidelines Plan (57 FR 41000, September 8, 1992), EPA intends to propose the MP&M 2 rule in 1997 and take final action in 1999. b. Two Additional Rulemaking Projects: 1996 Start. EPA will start work on two more rules in 1996. EPA has not yet selected the specific industrial categories for 1996. However, based on the discussion of data sources in the Proposed Plan (59 FR 25863), the Agency may choose the next categories from the following list: •Petroleum Refining •Metal Finishing •Textile Mills •Inorganic Chemicals •Steam Electric Power Generating •Iron and Steel Manufacturing •a portion of the Pulp, Paper and Paperboard category (proposed subcategories for which EPA did not propose toxic and nonconventional pollutant limits in the proposed rule published December 17, 1993: G. Mechanical Pulp; H. Non-Wood Chemical Pulp; I. Secondary Fiber Deink; J. Secondary Fiber Non-Deink; K. Fine and Lightweight Papers from Purchased Pulp; and L. Tissue, Filter, Non-Woven, and Paper from Purchased Pulp). EPA intends to announce its rulemaking selections in the Federal Register within the next year.
