Where are we heading? What does the future have in store for us? These are difficult questions, and there are no ready-made answers to them. It is worth recalling the forecasts made by the so-called reformatory camp during the election campaign. After the victory of the left, "a black night of chaos and incompetence" was supposed to ensue. The nation was supposed to "wail," and the shocked West would turn its back on us in revulsion. Poland was supposed to be isolated both politically and economically. Lines of people, rationing, and the proverbial vinegar on shop shelves were to return as symbols of the hardship of life and the condition of the economy. However, politicians and journalists had not made a greater mistake for a very long time. After the first quarter of this year, inflation was the lowest in seven years--it dropped to 4.5 percent. The 10-percent production growth is the highest in 15 years. Unemployment dropped by 20,000 people. It is obvious that these as well as other indicators are not so high as to be felt everywhere as favorable. They do, however, have something in common: They are all positive. As a result of the prospect of a stable government and economic growth, Western states are revalorizing their interests in Central Europe. They are beginning to perceive our country as an important factor of political peace and economic reforms. A long-term strategy of investment and trade involvement of the main economic powers is being shaped. The impossibilities that have so far been observed in the relations with neighbors are being broken. Prominent politicians from East and West are stressing that Poland is heading in the right direction. This is what the evaluation of the first six months of the coalition of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] is based on. It should be stressed, however, that former governments have contributed to it as well. Therefore, the election victory of the left is even more aggravating. "We could have prevented this" was how Bohdan Cywinski recently expressed his irritation in RZECZPOSPOLITA. How? "For example, by limiting the passive franchise of former communists. That it is undemocratic? Nonsense." The author answers his own question, and, at another point, he appeals to remove from memory this "hideous date of 19 September 1993" as soon as possible. This is how much has been left of the words about "respecting the will of the people" and the conviction that this will is the only pass to the political scene. The fears that the situation might not be as bad as it was supposed to be are obvious to not only the bickering leaders of the right. They can also be found in the evaluations of serious people, surrounded by the halo of independence, not meddling with minor skirmishes. This is no wonder because the problem is extremely important. Even a moderate success of a government including the left must mean the compromising of the myths on which Poles have been fed for years. It will turn out that a "postcommunist" formation not only does not pose any threat to the favorable future of Poland, but, on the contrary, is a chance for its development, strengthening the mechanisms of parliamentary democracy and the market economy. The center-left government does not only deter the West but it is a considerable and serious partner for Western democracies. In addition, it does not have to be legitimized by any authorities, and it does not need any intermediaries, which may be the most painful thing. It settles for the mandate of its voters. The reaction of some authority centers is quite significant. I would like to be wrong now, but it is becoming increasingly clear that the activities of Lech Walesa are, unfortunately, destructive. The persistent maintenance of the vacancy in the extremely important post of the economy's head and finance minister, threats for the democratically elected Sejm, embarrassing decisions concerning the National Council of Radio and Television, refusal to competently take part in the work of the Constitutional Committee of the National Assembly, veto of the wage-control law, the already announced refusal to sign the electoral law governing local elections--all this aims at the emerging chances of political stabilization and economic growth. In this light, the strategic goal of the president seems to be obvious: to prevent the four-year governing of the PSL-SLD coalition, to prove that the results of the 19 September elections was a mistake, to strengthen his own power, and to weaken his opponents and potential countercandidates. Is Lech Walesa all alone in his strivings? Certainly not in all of them. In the 18 March issue of TYGODNIK "SOLIDARNOSC," Andrzej Gelberg wrote, quoting Marian Krzaklewski, "Solidarity will not resign itself to the fact that power has been taken over by the communists and will fight against this configuration with all its might." Even though the author adds that it will do this by peaceful means, he writes later on with disarming frankness that the aim is to "change the present parliamentary configuration"; he does not explain by what peaceful means it is going to achieve this. It is an important sign, especially now that strikes and protests have been announced that "defend the employees' interests." Thus, the aim of the president's actions, regardless of whether they are agreed on or not, is clear. Is it possible to achieve this goal? No, it is not, if the rules of a democratic state are to be applied. Yes, it is, if the government of the center left is gradually discredited and if the social peace is disturbed. The price of such destruction would be enormous; however, it looks like it is neither appalling nor shameful. Against this backdrop, disquieting are the mistakes--sometimes seemingly minor--committed by the SLD. The left displays a lack of ability to think in advance. It cannot see obvious traps and poorly estimates its own limited or badly utilized capabilities. The circumstances of the recall of Marek Borowski are particularly instructive and painful here. We would not have to look for a new finance minister now if all of the consequences of this decision had been considered. It is also not good when the main platform of the disputes that the SLD gets involved in are cadre issues. Why speak about meetings that are not held because one does not have any influence on their organization? Why announce the names of deputy prime ministers who have not been nominated? What sense does it make to make retorts to the Belweder if there are serious doubts about the possibilities of making them? I am writing these words with sorrow; however, I am beginning to fear that there may arise the impression of defensiveness and decreasing efficiency. The SLD could have been wrong when it did not bear responsibility for the state. Today the risk and the cost of even an accidental mistake are enormous, and the limit of mistakes has already been reached. The subject that should be thought over are relations within the coalition. One can sometimes get the impression that the electorates of the PSL and the SLD are closer to one another than its leaders are. That is better than the other way around because, in this way, a strong foundation for lasting cooperation between the two groupings, independent of any temporary tendencies, is being created. The PSL-SLD coalition is not the exclusive property of politicians who can do anything they want with it. It is an indirect expression of the will of millions of voters, the property of the people who have elected such a parliament. One has to bear this in mind if one wants to respect the electorate and the social groups that sympathize with the coalition. Nevertheless, relations in the highest places between the PSL and the SLD are far from expectations. It started with the submission of a composition of the government that was different from the one that had been agreed on. Then came the statement that the SLD would really prefer an alliance with the Democratic Union, and then it really started.... Some of the misunderstandings definitely result from the lack of understanding of the partner's uniqueness, sometimes from the lack of sufficiently acceptable information channels, sometimes from the manipulation of the media unfavorably disposed toward the coalition. At any rate, a breakthrough is needed--something like a declaration of goals and intentions that would begin with the words "the two parties hereby decide to speak about each other favorably." Tensions within the coalition exert a destabilizing influence on the entire political configuration and fuel the activeness of the centers that aim to weaken or break it. If this really happened, we would all lose the possibility of winning the four-year period of Poland's stabilization, Poland would lose its credibility, and internal and external conditions of its socioeconomic development would be more acute. If the coalition fell apart, no new effective parliamentary majority would be formed. The instability of a minority government would lead to early parliamentary elections, which would weaken both the SLD and the PSL. Therefore, a minimum of programmatic order should be defined and observed; it might come down to the following goals: 1. Adopting and implementing a three-year socioeconomic program for the country's development. 2. Ensuring a full four-year term of parliament and the coalition government. 3. Approving the constitution before the presidential election. 4. Reaching a coalition agreement in the presidential election. 5. Holding the elections for local self-governments in the period defined by the Constitution. Aside from strategic points, the coalition's program of cooperation should also include practical and short-term goals concerning the aspirations and expectations of millions of Poles--that is, rapid implementing the program of the National Investment Funds; amending the Labor Code; adopting laws that constitute the Pact on Enterprise; implementing a mass housing construction program; improving the citizens' security; implementing large-scale economic projects, such as the construction of highways, and so on. Even though it is acting in complex circumstances, the coalition is not defenseless. It has at its disposal the capital of many election votes and sustained social support. The concord between the PSL and the SLD may curb the destructive activities of the coalition's opponents; lack of crevices and cracks makes it impossible to broaden them. The understandable dissatisfaction of many Polish families with their living standards does not have to be the fuel for "Solidarity." As social research proves, people do not believe that the activities of this union are a hope for an improvement of everyday life. We can also see the reorientation of the West, for which a stable Poland and a lasting, predictable government create the conditions for serious investments and for economic recovery in this part of Europe. On whom, then, does the further development of the situation depend? It depends on ourselves.
