The issue now is not whether to continue negotiating but primarily how to protect the Palestinians, adopt measures to prevent a recurrence of the crime, and stop the settlers and extremists from threatening and terrorizing the Palestinians. The Israeli Government has primary responsibility for this. Likewise the United Nations must begin effective action for the same purpose and must issue clear and firm resolutions, including the confiscation of weapons, to prevent a recurrence of irresponsible and illegal violent acts by the Israeli settlers and provide protection for the Palestinian civilians. The Israeli cabinet adopted some measures two days ago taking weapons away from some settlers and limiting their movements. The Palestinians found these decisions unsatisfactory because they tackle matters superficially and do not touch the basic issue, which is their protection. Egypt has consistently stressed this point and President Mubarak has always voiced grave concern about the threats to which the Palestinians are subjected. Egypt made the same demand in its statement to the UN Security Council, urging it to adopt a clear resolution that will guarantee Palestinian safety in the occupied territories. Egypt also emphasized that the security requirements, which Israel never stops advocating, are not limited to the Israelis. It announced that similar attention must be paid to the Palestinian people's security requirements, especially in the coming stage when Israel will need to make confidence-building moves and prove its sincere peace intentions. Since the bloody incident occurred, Egypt has conducted contacts with all parties to protect the Palestinians and prevent a recurrence of the incident which U.S. Secretary of State Christopher described as the occupation's bloodiest day. President Mubarak telephoned U.S. President Clinton, Palestinian leader 'Arafat, and Yitzhaq Rabin. The Egyptian diplomatic establishment undertook other positive actions in many directions, particularly in the Security Council, to ensure that a positive and effective resolution is adopted. In this connection, Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has asserted that the Security Council will lose its credibility unless it adopts a resolution condemning the incident and providing international protection for the Palestinians. News agencies have reported Israel's agreement, for the first time ever, to allow international observers in Gaza and Jericho and to disarm the Jewish settlers' weapons in Gaza and the areas surrounding Jericho, something described by some news agencies as an important concession. We say that, first of all, this is an auspicious step that came as a result of Egyptian and U.S. efforts. We note, however, that it does not represent an Israeli concession but is a necessary step to create a modicum of Arab trust and demonstrate a goodwill gesture and a constructive movement toward peace. The Arabs, all the Arabs, are seeking peace and are doing much for this purpose. The other side, the Israelis, must act in the same spirit until both sides meet on the road leading to this objective. The criminal assault on the Ibrahimi Mosque, causing so many casualties, has dealt a strong blow to the peace efforts. Objective Israeli measures that guarantee Palestinian rights can, however, end the crisis. This of course will need arduous efforts and time.
