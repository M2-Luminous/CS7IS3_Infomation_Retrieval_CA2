Certain successes scored by the Azerbaijani Army at the start of the winter campaign due to its multifold superiority in men and material were mostly localized and temporary, and they were soon neutralized by the Karabakh army units. The unprecedented losses suffered by the Azerbaijani Army also played a significant role in lessening the intensity of the military operations. According to data available to NKR Defense Army headquarters, the Azerbaijani side lost up to 5,000 soldiers and officers killed over the last one and half months. It also lost one military aircraft; 62 armored cars, including 36 tanks; 12 cannons and artillery pieces, three of them Grad launchers; and large amounts of other military equipment. In that same period, nearly 300 fighters were killed on the Karabakh side. Its losses in military hardware amounted to 24 military vehicles, which were completely recouped by the capture of tanks and armored personnel carriers from the Azerbaijanis. In that same one and half months, 26 Azerbaijanis servicemen surrendered voluntarily. Among them are also citizens of other countries. According to Seyran Hovanyan, no matter how much the Azerbaijani side tries to cover up its losses, its consequences cannot but effect the situation on the war front and the morale of the Azerbaijani Army.
