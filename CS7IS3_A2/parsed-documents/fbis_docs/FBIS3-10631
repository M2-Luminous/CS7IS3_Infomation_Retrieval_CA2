After several days of adroit maneuvering, the principal negotiators met yesterday, 14 January, on the subject that had delayed the approval of the project to modernize banks and to propose a new solution to the problem of the subordinated debt. Sebastian Pinera, Jaime Orpis, Andres Zaldivar, Jaime Gazmuri, Jaime Estevez, Jose Florencio Guzman (superintendent of banks and financial institutions), Patricio Arrau (advisor to the Ministry of Finance), Jorge Marshall (vice president of the Central Bank), Camilo Carrasco (director of financial policy at the Central Bank) and Minister Foxley took six hours to work out the final details of the accord. The document establishes a minimum term of 40 years and a schedule of payments on the subordinated debt ($3.8 billion) that 10 banks have pending with the Central Bank since the financial crisis of 1982. The institutions concerned must make their annual payments with the percentage of their surpluses which currently are due to the Central Bank and, if this is insufficient, they must make payment through increases in their capital or with bonds convertible into shares. The most controversial subject until yesterday had been the determination of the value of those bonds. While the government maintained that the value should be responsive to determination by the market, the opposition argued that the value should be a nominal figure. Foxley explained that the matter was resolved by establishing an average market price "plus a surcharge that would reflect their increased value anticipated at auction." Although this amount was not specified, it was estimated that it could vary between 10 and 15 percent, so that it would not represent a loss for the Central Bank. The text made clear that preferred stockholders would have the first option to subscribe to these bonds convertible into shares. Amid smiles that combined satisfaction with fatigue, the expectation for the vote on Tuesday, 18 January, is one of complete optimism, because the agreement rules out the awful possibility that the Concertation might vote against the idea of legislating, which would have meant the postponement of the matter for a year. A decision regarding treatment of portfolio bills of sale [letra por venta de cartera] is still pending. But among congressmen there was agreement in their disagreement. Although this may seem paradoxical, it means that they will make every effort to reach agreement by Tuesday. If no agreement is reached, the matter will be resolved in the legislative process. "This is not going to be an obstacle to the proposal's approval," was stated more than once. What remains to be done before Tuesday (which ceased to be "D-Day" to become a kind of confirmatory day) is the meeting that the protagonists will hold to ratify these agreements and formalize them in a document. [Box, p 16] The Four Points of the Agreement The agreement that emerged after six hours of discussion in Minister Foxley's office can be summarized in four points: 1. Establish a minimum term and a schedule of payments on the subordinated debt so that the debt will no longer have an indefinite term. 2. Banks with subordinated debt must make their annual payments with the percentage of their surpluses that currently are due to the Central Bank. If this is insufficient, they must make payment through increases in their capital or with bonds convertible into shares, according to the circumstances. 3. The value of these bonds will be determined by the average market price, plus a surcharge that reflects their increased value anticipated at auction. 4. Preferred stockholders will always have the first option to subscribe to these bonds convertible into shares. Pending * A decision regarding the treatment of portfolio bills of sale is still pending. If agreement is not reached, the matter will be resolved in the legislative process.
