FR940111-0-00011 FR940111-0-00004 The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of South Texas onions. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses. Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 for personnel, office, and compliance expenses were recommended in a mail vote completed August 4, 1993. The assessment rate and funding for the research and promotion projects were to be recommended at a later Committee meeting. The Committee administrative expenses of $80,000 were published in the Federal Register as an interim final rule September 28, 1993 (58 FR 50509). That interim final rule added ยง959.234, authorizing expenses for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments through October 28, 1993. No comments were filed. The Committee subsequently met on November 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended increases of $2,500 for personnel expenses and $125,000 for compliance activities in the recently approved 1993&hyph;94 budget. The compliance increase will provide for funds to operate road guard stations surrounding the production area. The Committee also unanimously recommended $210,000 in market development activities and $105,600 in production research. These expenditures represent increases over last year's budget of $65,000 for market development and $11,412 for production research. Under this amended budget, expense items for the 1993&hyph;94 fiscal period are as follows: $37,472 for personnel, $29,028 for office expenses, $141,000 for compliance activities, $210,000 for market development, and $105,600 for production research. The initial 1994 budget, published on September 28, 1993, did not establish an assessment rate. Therefore, the Committee also unanimously recommended an assessment rate of $0.10 per 50-pound container or equivalent of onions, $0.03 more than last year's assessment rate. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of approximately 5 million 50-pound containers or equivalents, will yield $500,000 in assessment income, which, along with $23,100 from the reserve, will be adequate to cover budgeted expenses. Funds in the reserve as of September 30, 1993, were $346,415, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of two fiscal periods' expenses. While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
