Business was as usual in the economic capital Lagos, where the National Democratic Campaign (NADECO) backing millionaire tycoon Moshood Abiola against the military junta had called for a week of peaceful protest from Monday. [passage omitted] Short demonstrations took place in the northern Palmgrove and Iyana Ipaja suburbs of Lagos, a city of some six million inhabitants, an AFP correspondent reported. Riot police rapidly intervened against tyre-burning protestors in one of the incidents. Abiola planned Monday to hold a "series of meeting with friends and political associates," one source close to the self-proclaimed president said. The source did disclose where the talks would be held and who would attend. If caught, Abiola faces treason charges. [passage omitted] A score of armed police and an armoured vehicle on Monday stood guard at one end of the Ibrahim Babangida bridge, linking parts of Lagos built on islands in the lagoon with the mainland. Reporting Abiola's formation of a parallel government more than 24 hours after the event, the daily THE NEWS in a special edition on Monday devoted its whole front page to a picture of the businessman brandishing his fist in triumph, with the title "President Abiola". Other newspapers, warned by the closure by police Saturday of Abiola's Concord group of publications, used foreign news agency dispatches reporting the event. [passage omitted]
