The Stalinist country's newspapers, radio stations and televisions are still engaged in the campaign to inculcate loyalty in the people toward Kim Chong-il, son and heir-apparent of the North's supreme leader Kim Il-song. It is reported, however, that various celebrations this year are being held mostly on a domestic basis and on a smaller scale. The small scale of the celebration has surprised many South Korean experts on North Korea affairs. After no clear step was taken for a power transfer from the aging leader Kim Il-song to Chong-il at the Workers' (Communist) Party central committee meeting and the Supreme People's Assembly held in December 1993, many analysts in Seoul said that Pyongyang was highly likely to announce a final power transfer schedule around Kim Chong-il's birthday this year. Their predictions were based on the North Korean news media's sudden spate of reports beginning late last year that the junior Kim had joined the party central committee in 1964 and was designation on his father's heir in early 1974. Churning out those reports, the North's media announced that the junior Kim would mark the 30th anniversary of his political debut as well as the 20th anniversary of his heir-designation on his 52nd birthday in February 1994. The gist of the so-called "February final power transfer schedule" is that an important turning point for the resolution of the North Korean nuclear issue will be issued in the name of Kim Chong-il and that concrete plans for Kim Il-song to hand over the presidency or party general secretaryship to his son will be made public on that day, according to North Korea observers here. Recently, however, the thorny North Korean nuclear problem seems to be dragging on with no signs of easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Also, there are no clear-cut indications that the junior Kim will consolidate his position around his birthday. Under these circumstances, some analysts even wonder if the junior Kim may be facing a crisis. In North Korea, the period from Feb. 16 to April 15, Kim Il-song's birthday, has been designated the "Loyalty Festival Period" since 1976, when the junior Kim's birthday joined his father's as a national holiday. During this period, all North Koreans are mobilized to participate in various congratulatory events across the country. Among major events held or now under way are the fourth 2.16 [February 16] Arts Award, the Athletic Championship for the Mt. Paektu Award, and the third National Exhibition on Youth Science and Technology. As a prelude to the celebrations, the 2.16 Arts Award opened Jan. 18 and its preliminary contests are under way. Korean musicians in the instrumental and vocal music fields from at home and abroad usually compete with one another. This year, however, overseas Koreans were barred from attending, thereby remarkably downsizing the congratulatory event. "Annual events are being held there as scheduled, but on a noticeably smaller scale," a high-ranking official at the National Unification Board (NUB) said early this week. He added, however, that he would not jump to the conclusion that the downscaling has some political implications related to Kim Chong-il's status. In 1993, with Pyongyang heavily bent on escalating the cult of the junior Kim, the streets of Pyongyang were bedecked with 2,160,000 flowers of various kinds to represent his birthday, Feb. 16. Radio Pyongyang reported at the time that the city authorities had been busy cultivating these flowers for the past several months. All gardeners in the country were mobilized to prepare for the birthday festivity. In sharp contrast, the Administration Council, the North's cabinet, simply ordered flower gardens to be trimmed and ditches to be cleared in downtown Pyongyang late last month. As of Monday morning,the northern side of the South-North Liaison Office at the truce village of Panmunjom had not informed its southern counterpart of any decision to close its operation for the Kim Chong-il birthday celebration. It has been customary for the North to inform the South liaison officials of a closure two days before the birthday, the NUB official said, adding that the lack of an announcement suggests this year's celebration of the junior Kim's birthday has been scaled down.
