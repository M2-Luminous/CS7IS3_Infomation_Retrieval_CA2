In a discussion meeting called by the provincial government yesterday, Vice Governor Wang Xiuzhi reported to comrades in charge of the SETC on current conditions of technical transformation exercise in Anhui, and strategies adopted by the provincial party committee and government for its success. Wang Xiuzhi said: In attaching great importance to enterprises' technical transformation, the provincial party committee and government have adopted the strategy of "one mainstay and two wings" -- taking infrastructure as the mainstay and town and village enterprises and technical transformation as the two wings -- with emphasis on strengthening the former and expanding the latter to ensure an economic takeoff in Anhui. It has been proposed in the Knowing Well Your Responsibility Certificates signed between the provincial government and departments and bureaus in charge that over 20 billion yuan will be invested in technical transformation projects within three years, during which about 200 high-tech, fast-running projects will be completed, so that output value of technical transformation will contribute not less than 30 percent to the total industrial output value. Wang Xiuzhi said: With a completed investment of 6.26 billion yuan in technical transformation projects in 1993, Anhui has succeeded in improving its enterprises' technical, equipment level and thus consolidating the strengthening of its economic strength. Speaking at the meeting, SETC Vice Minister Xu Penghang pointed out: Thanks to conscientious implementation of technical transformation projects, Anhui has entered a relatively high economic growth period. This strategy should be strengthened in the future by well preparing all technical transformation projects before their implementation and by laying emphasis on speed -- speed in examining and approving well identified projects, in commencing production, in entering the market, in making money, and in repaying debts. The state will lend its strong support to provinces excelling in helping enterprises with good performance. Xu Penghang and his party successively inspected some enterprises in Suzhou and Hefei City, as well as high and new technology industrial development zones. Provincial Governor Fu Xishou called on Xu Penghang and his party on the evening of 6 June. Persons in charge of relevant departments, including the provincial discipline inspection commission, the provincial economic and trade commission, the Commercial and Industrial Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank, and Customs, attended yesterday's discussion meeting.
