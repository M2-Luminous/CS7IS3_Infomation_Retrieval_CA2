An IDF source confirmed the report, adding that it was forced upon the army, and that some IDF officers in the field are furious with the agreement. At a meeting held two weeks ago, the two sides agreed the IDF would completely halt its pursuit of armed Fatah fugitives, including those known to have committed murder. According to the agreement, the IDF agreed there would be no active pursuit of these fugitives, but that if they happened to be caught, they would be arrested by the security forces. It was agreed brothers 'Umar and Rajih Abu-Sittah, believed to have murdered, among others, Shaya Deutsch of Kfar Yam in Qatif Bloc last March, would have to hide in one place and not walk the streets. The IDF agreed not to pursue them despite the fact that they are suspected murderers.
