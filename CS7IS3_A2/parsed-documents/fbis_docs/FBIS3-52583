Minister Shahal, addressing the Israeli Association for Industrial Security this morning, said the agreement between Israel and Jordan is finalized and there is absolutely no controversy between the two countries on any issue. Shahal expressed the opinion that King Husayn is waiting for the right time to announce the signing of a peace treaty with Israel, and this could happen after the Clinton-al-Asad meeting. Our correspondent Shim'on Vilna'i adds that Minister Shahal denounced the planting of the bombs near the Peace Now offices in New York. He said the police will strive to uncover elements such as those who have tried to smuggle arms into Israel.
