Silvio Berlusconi proposes a maximum tax levy (35 percent) and his allies are [National Rebirth Pact leader] Mariotto Segni (who has criticized Ciampi's maneuver), [Radical leader] Pannella, and the Northern League. And those who thought that Berlusconi was ready to incite a tax revolt, perhaps being struck by [League ideologue] Miglio's ideas, have been disappointed. The Knight [Berlusconi nickname] has made [Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) Secretary] Occhetto's and [PDS Deputy Secretary] D'Alema's moustaches stand on end with these words: "More than 47 percent of what we produce ends up in the State's coffers. This means that each Italian works from 1 January to 28 July for the government and works for his family only from 29 July on." The PDS response was immediate. [Sechi] Occhetto has called your proposals demagoguery and has added: "Berlusconi should tell me how many old people he wants to turn out into the street, how many schools and hospitals he wants to close." What is your reply? [Berlusconi] What old people on the street. How dare Occhetto talk of old people. He is the one who has contributed to destroying the real value of wages and pensions by forcing old people to live in poverty, by being the accomplice of a system that should have been opposed and not supported by an opposition party. My proposal focuses on increasing wealth and employment in Italy. It has been primarily the demagogic choices made by the PCI [Italian Communist Party] and the PDS that have damaged the national economy. [Sechi] The tax ceiling is just the foretaste of a broader program for economic recovery. Can you provide an outline, give an anticipation of some points to our readers? [Berlusconi] The program we are working on is at an advanced stage and will be made public in due course. The only anticipation I feel like giving is that it is a change in course compared to what has happened over the past 10-15 years. Our objective is to restore to Italians the liberties that politics has confiscated from them. It is a matter of freeing ourselves from the bureaucratization of society and the politicization of life. [Sechi] You are saying "Stop the blank checks to governments that devour money." How can the Italians say stop. The League tried with their tax strike but with little success. [Berlusconi] What I maintain is that when effective constitutional rules are lacking, the people in government are exposed to the almost irresistible temptation to acquire consensus and popularity by abusing public expenditure. Fortunately tax revolts are rather rare events and can lead to undesirable consequences. If we want to avoid these we must set our hands to reforming the state to move from a system based on trust in those governing to one that is based on the predictability of well-defined regulations. [Sechi] You have been defined as being a fan of the capitalistic Far West but propose a tax code, barriers, rules. Does this not seem to be contradictory? [Berlusconi] The capitalistic Far West is a folkloristic expression used by those who have still not understood that the market is a rule. I prefer a market economy and therefore it is perfectly in harmony with my partiality for constitutional rules. The supporters of the market economy are also the advocates of the state -- free traders in economics, liberals in politics. When the Left sees a contradiction between the market and rules it shows that it is insufficiently aware of the principles of a free economy. [Sechi] Who may your travel companions against supertaxes be? [Berlusconi] I strongly doubt that today there is anybody who is convinced that taxes should be increased. There is no self-employed person, shopowner, or businessman who is not aware of the fact that in Italy there has been an intolerable abuse of tax pressure. The success of the League is one of the many confirmations of this fact. Only the Left has not realized this yet, even if they are careful not to openly suggest tax increases. [Sechi] Miglio says that your program has been copied word for word from that of the League. [Berlusconi] Miglio knows very well that the introduction of a tax ceiling is not something new but has been supported for many years and in the most varied countries. However, the problem is not to determine the paternity of the idea but rather to make it accepted and translated into state legislation. [Sechi] The PDS states that you could not care less about the deficit and that you want to maintain consumption high to keep your group's revenues up. [Berlusconi] Like before, the postcommunists are masters in the art of misinforming. As for the deficit, which is threatening the financial solvency of our country and to whose increase the postcommunists have largely contributed by proposing ever increasing expenditures, the past year shows that tax experiments do not solve the problem. Taxes have increased enormously but the deficit, far from decreasing, has also increased. In order to balance the government budget one must do precisely what the Left does not want to do: cut public expenditure. As for consumption, I am not the one who is saying that private consumption has decreased, it is the official figures. Finally, the fact that those asking that available income be restored to families and workers are doing so in their own interests, and this shows how little "those of the Left" are worried about the well-being of the Italians. [Sechi] Is the Left eating balance sheets or has it really converted itself to capitalism? [Berlusconi] Everything is possible. But is seems highly unlikely that those who have preached statism and disdained the market economy and capitalism suddenly become supporters of economic liberty. If we ask ourselves why the enemies of the market economy suddenly proclaim themselves liberals and free traders, the answer is obvious: Statism has produced mourning and ruins wherever it was attempted and it has thrown such discredit upon itself that it is in nobody's interests to proclaim oneself a statist. [Sechi] Professor Martino has proposed a pay packet without any deductions and the abolition of withholding taxes to unhinge an old and oppressive taxation system. Do you agree? [Berlusconi] The abolition of withholding taxes would make workers know exactly how much taxes they must pay. Once again, this must be a rule: Taxes must be clear and visible. Whether this will then contribute to changing the tax system depends on the taxpayers' reaction in determining the amount of taxes that each has to bear and primarily to what extent those in government will take this reaction into account. [Sechi] How can expenses be reduced? Everyone has tried but without success. [Berlusconi] There are expenses that can be reduced immediately and expenses that require radical reforms to be reduced, but one thing is certain: In order to reduce public expenditure it is first of all necessary to want to do this (even though this is not sufficient). Nobody can deny that this is a difficult task but it is not an impossible one if there is a desire to see it accomplished. It is the task of politics to accomplish things that are desirable. [Sechi] Do you think that the problem of tax evaders can be resolved? They say that you are their new Robin Hood. [Berlusconi] Tax evasion must be fought without hesitation in order to have justice. However, if we really want to reduce evasion and not limit ourselves to talking about it then we must act on the causes: When income taxes are too high, this discourages the production of income and encourages attempts to avoid paying them in various ways. For this reason, I think that we will have to follow the example of many countries, such as Sweden and the United States, which have reduced tax rates precisely to reduce evasion. Less exasperated progressive taxes provide incentives for production and increase state revenues, as the experience of other countries has confirmed. Second, if it is true that we have a great number of useless taxes that do nothing or little for state revenues, we should do away with them. In doing so we will simplify the taxpayer's life and the work of the tax authorities who could dedicate themselves to seeing that the taxes that really contribute to increasing revenues are paid. In any case, though we cannot give up the battle against evasion, this is certainly not the road to balancing the government budget. [Sechi] If you were Ciampi what would you have done in Crotone [scene of industrial unrest]? [Berlusconi] What distinguishes the statist from the politician is that the first is willing to run the risk of becoming unpopular in pursuing the interest of all, while the second does not hesitate in placing his political career before the interest of the public. This does not mean that there are no exceptional circumstances that call for specific, pragmatic solutions. I only want to say that these exceptions must be rare and not part of normal behavior. [Sechi] Let us talk about savings. How can you convince the army of BOT [government bonds] people that you are not against them? And above all, how can you convince them to have faith in joint-stock companies, in the Stock Exchange? [Berlusconi] I really do not see why the people who hold government bonds should be afraid of those who have always defended savings and the right of ownership. Those that should be afraid are those that have tried to criminalize these people for years by accusing them of being parasites, the owners of financial income, and responsible for the balance of payments problem. Italian savers will turn to shares if the recovery of the Stock Exchange can convince them of the advantages of investing in shares. [Sechi] Prof. Raffaello Lupi who is Minister Gallo's consultant has said: Berlusconi seems to be like Zhirinovskiy: He promises less taxes and more vodka. Rather than Einaudi, according to the Left, you are a demagogue whose only expertise is debts. What is your reply? [Berlusconi] I would like to remind you that Zhirinovskiy is a postcommunist nationalist Russian who calls himself a liberal democrat. If there is somebody that resembles these people it is not me, it is those that have acclaimed the Soviet Union for years and that now proclaim themselves democrats just like the tenants of Botteghe Oscure [PDS party headquarters]. As for the content of this strange affirmation, I think that it confirms the importance that the postcommunists give to the well-being and liberty of the taxpayers. [Sechi] When will you taste the bitter cup of politics? [Berlusconi] We will see. Perhaps soon, perhaps never.
