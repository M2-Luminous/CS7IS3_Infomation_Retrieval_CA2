Most of the Russian unemployed are women and unskilled workers, since those are the ones most often laid off. Statistics show that there are almost one and a half million jobless in Russia now. One million 219 thousand of them had been officially recognized as unemployed. Two out of every three people on the dole are former unskilled labourers. Women are the unluckiest of all in the job market. Two-thirds of the jobless are women. Moreover, the youngest seem to suffer disproportionately: every third is in the 16-29 age group.
