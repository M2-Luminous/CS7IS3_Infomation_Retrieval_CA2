The discussion, on the contrary, concerns improving and optimizing them, and trying to make the armed forces effective and, at the same time, cheap. So how are matters proceeding in Ukraine? No one has any doubts that the army costs a lot and needs to be cut back. But what are the realities? Defense appropriations under the approved budget are 14,741,870 karbovantsi (1.17 billion dollars at the exchange rate of 12,600 karbovantsi to the dollar used by the National Bank, or 387,945,000 dollars at the market settlement rate of 38,000 karbovantsi to the dollar). Is that a lot or a little? Let us compare. The 1993 defense budget for Slovakia was equal to 284,340,000 dollars, Poland 2.25 billion, Hungary 1.16 billion and neutral Sweden, which maintains an army of 65,000 people, 5.24 billion dollars. The planned U.S. military budget for the 1994 fiscal year is 263.7 billion dollars, with overall military spending as a percentage of GNP in 1992, according to the data of SIPRI, 5.4 percent in the United States, 4.0 percent in Great Britain, 3.9 percent in Turkey, 3.4 percent in France and 2.2. percent in Germany. Military spending per capita will reach 1,100 dollars this year in the United States, 730 in Great Britain, 810 in France, 815 in Norway and 500 dollars in Greece and the FRG. They are 283,500 karbovantsi (at the different exchange rates, from 7 to 21 dollars) in Ukraine. The following circumstances should also be taken into account when evaluating the military budget of Ukraine: First, the increase in inflation in Ukraine in 1993 was approximately 47 percent a month, so it is being cut back substantially every year even without any formal reduction in military spending. Second, it must be kept in mind that the cost of military hardware and weaponry, as well as some types of operations, has increased substantially with the transition to economic accountability and self-financing. Third, the cutbacks in the size of the armed forces and the realization of the START-1 treaty, as well as the conversion of the military-industrial complex, will require additional appropriations rather than cutbacks in the first few years. Fourth, it should be taken into account that the military inventories are filled to overflowing with obsolete hardware, and the weaponry and hardware needed to replace them are expensive. All of this in the aggregate is not fostering an augmentation of military might and reserve capacity and, most likely, gives rise to the question of whether it will be very easy to provide for defensive sufficiency under such conditions. The answer suggests itself. It is not just a matter of the military budget, however, but also its structure. The distribution of overall appropriations of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine by dedicated purposes is not precisely known, but one can already state today that the funds that are being allotted for the procurement of weaponry and military hardware are insufficient, since the rate of aging of that material is quite high. The military budget for 1994, with a regard for the current social and economic situation, is naturally quite large. The funds that are being allocated for the country's defense, however, do not seem all that large against the background of the overall non-productive expenditures and losses in the national economy, as well as the presence of criminal capital in the country (which includes the "shadow" economy), which are measured in the hundreds of millions of karbovantsi. And the fulfillment of the requirements of the Military Doctrine and the implementation of the armaments program, the realization of which has been approved, does not withstand any criticism at this time. The picture is similar with the financing of military scientific projects aimed at the development of modern types of weapons. Here is an example: Science is an average of about 15 percent of military spending for the Americans. The U.S. government spends 76 billion dollars on all science today. Sixty percent of that is for purely military programs. The breakdown of budgetary appropriations for defense in Ukraine gives no precise answer as to how much of the budgetary funding is going to science. The amount of that spending, in the estimation of specialists, is less than ten percent, and that naturally provides no opportunity to conduct basic and investigative research. This situation is leading to entirely foreseeable consequences in the near future--we will not be able to create advanced weapons systems. We will not be able to if the state--and there is still no other customer or other source of financing aside from the state budget in Ukrainian military science--does not direct the necessary quantity of funds to basic and investigative research, the development of dual-purpose high technologies and the creation of scientific and technical potential. It should be borne in mind that equipping the troops with weaponry and military hardware depends substantially on the state of the economy. Moreover, the influence of scientific and technical progress on the quality of those weapons and military hardware is being manifested in more and more pronounced fashion of late. There is rapid growth in the cost of weaponry and other mat√©riel, first and foremost owing to the large concentration of efforts in scientific research and development connected with the creation and production of new arms systems. The sharp rise in the cost of weapons is restricting ever more the capabilities of the economy with regard to their mass production. A trend toward compensating for quantitative indicators through qualitative characteristics--an increase in destructive power, accuracy etc.--is thus being noted even today in foreign armies. This inevitably leads to further complexity, and hence, to increases in the cost of the weapons. Spending has increased considerably on the operation of the weaponry, which is now approximately half of the funds that are spend for the technical equipping and upkeep of the armed forces. The cost of operating some of the most complex combat systems is sometimes even higher than the cost of production. Military-economic spending is also increasing as a result of the increased speed of the obsolescence of weaponry. The upgrading of the armaments of the NATO armies thus occurred every 15 years in the 1950's, every 10 years in the middle of the 1960's and is now approximately every 6-7 years. The replacement periods of weaponry have been shortened so much that some models are removed before the start of series production. That is the fate that befell the Sergeant York self-propelled anti-aircraft gun mount in the United States in the 1980's. The funds for the procurement of weaponry and military hardware for Ukraine, in the estimation of specialists, do not exceed 20 percent--they are, that is, not all that much. This could have a negative effect on the condition of enterprises in the defense sectors of industry, and cause an increase in the ranks of the unemployed. The defense complex, aside from the social consequences, could also lose its basic scientific and industrial potential, in which advanced technologies are concentrated. The outflow of highly skilled specialists is even today leading to a weakening of the position of Ukraine in the creation of high-technology models of weapons and military hardware. All of this will ultimately cause the appearance of a threat to the national security of Ukraine.
