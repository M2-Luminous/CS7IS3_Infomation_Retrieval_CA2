The reason is that the business world, which advocates lifting the ban, has involved foreign firms in its tactics by using the logic that "the change is necessary to encourage direct foreign capital investment in Japan." It is said that, foreign firms of Europe and the United States are voicing strong sentiments that "we would like to establish holding companies in Japan and launch operations in different industries." The business world is stepping up its movements in such a direction with the help of foreign firms, and it appears that the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] will be facing the situation where it will have to make some difficult decisions. At the beginning of this month Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic Organizations] compiled and presented an emergency recommendation package to the Management and Coordination Agency [MCA] saying, "We should revise section 9 of the Antimonopoly Law." The recommendation package includes plans for encouraging direct investment in Japan by foreign firms, but a major provision of the plan includes lifting the ban on holding companies which is stipulated in section 9 of the Antimonopoly Law. On the 24th, in a meeting at which Keidanren and the MCA exchanged opinions, Isao Nakauchi, Keidanren vice president and chairman and president of Daiei, restated the request to Director General Ishida for approval of the recommendation package. Keidanren Assumes Aggressive Stance A holding company owns stock in a firm to control the latter's operations, but the Antimonopoly Law prohibits such ownership with the belief that it allows for specific firms to control markets and restrain competition. However, holding companies provide the advantage of maneuverability in business operations. The reason is that holding companies can serve as command posts whence decisions can be made to spin off promising operations to form strategic subsidiaries, while facilitating the consolidation of companies whose operations are not promising. Holding companies are sanctioned in Europe and the United States. According to Keidanren, European and U.S. firms and firms owned by foreign interests have displayed increasing interest in "establishing holding companies in Japan and engaging in a variety of business operations." Concurrently, increasing discontent is voiced in comments such as "holding companies are authorized in our homeland, but why is it that they are not allowed in Japan?" Keidanren, on a mid- and long-range basis, is endeavoring to cultivate a scenario in which the holding company ban will be lifted. In the current form in which financial institutions own 100 percent of subsidiary companies, there is not adequate provision for entry into other business forms and the financial industry plans to present the holding company format as a new approach. Industry as a whole plans to use a strategy of timing its argument that "it would be illogical to allow holding companies in the financial industry only" so it coincides with the broaching of the issue by the financial industry and thus seek equal treatment for industry as a whole. Although there is strong resistance to changing the law, Keidanren plans on a lengthy but persistent strategy. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry Also Lobbies for Change This is not the first time that the business world has lobbied for a lifting of the ban. Controversy over the issue was also generated in the latter half of the 1960's, when the tide for deregulating capital movement approached and there was a cry for shoring up the competitiveness of domestic firms. As recently as October 1992, the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] called for lifting the ban in a package of recommendations on corporate legislation. A common characteristic found in corporate arguments for lifting the ban is that "holding companies will enhance management efficiency and be useful in shoring up competitiveness." Generally speaking, expanding organizational structures tends to detract from rapid dissemination of information and the decisionmaking process and lowers efficiency. The proposed lifting of the ban envisions the breakout of operating divisions into subsidiaries to improve efficiency and to use such changes to enhance operations of the group as a whole. In response to such positions taken by the business world, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] has begun to negotiate with the FTC. In November 1993, the Industrial Structural Council, a MITI advisory organ, issued an intermediate recommendation calling for a revision of the regulations on holding companies as a means to facilitate restructuring of businesses. MITI has arrived at the conclusion that competition among subsidiaries of various holding companies which succeed in attaining efficiency, will revitalize the Japanese economy. In response to such assertions, the FTC shows no sign of changing its position, as stated by commission chairman Masami Kogayu: "The holding company concept undermines the basic concepts of the Antimonopoly Law and we have no intent of approving the proposed changes." If holding companies are recognized, it will lead to the creation of powerful corporate groups that exercise strong control over markets and would pose the risk of excluding new market entrants. There is the strong sense of crisis that competition would be restrained and the overall efficiency of the economy would be undermined. On the other hand, Japanese corporate holdings of outside firms are relatively high and, as can be seen among corporate groups, interlocking ownership of stocks is widespread. Commission chairman Kogayu says that "corporate groups would be stronger" if holding companies were sanctioned under such conditions. He fears that the result may be an exacerbation of distrust by foreign nations, including the United States which asserts that "Japanese markets are exclusionary." Debate Lacks Meeting of Minds At present there is no meeting of the minds in the debate between the business world and the FTC. FTC officials rebut arguments to lift the ban as a means of promoting foreign capital investment in Japan by commenting, "It would not be fair to sanction holding companies for foreign capital only. If they are to be approved, they should be authorized for Japanese firms as well, but that is impossible." However, "external pressure" is about to become a lever in the business world's drive for lifting of the ban and the debate concerning holding companies appears to be headed for a higher level of intensity.
