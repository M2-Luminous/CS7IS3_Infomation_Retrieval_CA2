Based on the current trend of increased emphasis on environmental administration, the Environmental Agency [EA] is trying to shift its policy to a global environment preservation- oriented administration concerned with the nation's overall policies from the current regulation-oriented administration which emphasizes pollution control and nature preservation. However, there is growing criticism within the EA and outside that the "EA has no clear policies," and that "it lacks the ability to work out plans." The path toward "breaking away from old traditions" is unlikely to be easy. The EA Falls Behind the Ministry of Health and Welfare Recently, there is a growing "tense atmosphere" in the EA because the Ministry of Health and Welfare [MHW] has spelled out its plan to enact a new law designed to improve the water quality of rivers, lakes, and marshes which are the source of tap water. Musty tap water in the metropolitan area and the Kinki area and the detection of cancer-causing substances from water are major problems. While tap water is under the jurisdiction of the MHW, public waters such as rivers, lakes and marshes, which are the source of tap water, are under the EA's jurisdiction. Some people believe one cause for the EA's tense atmosphere is the sense of crisis that "the MHW will make a raid into the EA's jurisdiction using the opportunity of the enactment of the new law." There have been strident calls within the EA for some measures to be taken to deal with "unsavory and dangerous water." In response to the MHW revising water-quality standards for tap water in late 1992, the EA began studying comprehensive measures to improve water conditions through cooperation with various ministries and agencies. As the EA is about to work out water measures, the MHW is trying to take action by utilizing the enactment of the new law as leverage. It can be said that the EA was taken by surprise. EA officials offered the excuse: "We have delayed coming up with measures due to staff shortages." However, it is a fact that many people were critical of the EA's slow moves, saying: "Despite mounting public expectations for environmental administration, the ministry failed to grasp it at an early date." As global environment disruption is advancing, it is necessary to shift the emphasis of environmental administration to global environment preservation-oriented policies, which require wide- ranging measures on economy, international relations and other issues, away from pollution control policies centering on regulations. It can be said that the "tap water issue" between the EA and the MHW indicates that although the EA is trying to break away from old traditions in view of this trend, it needs to make additional efforts. EA's Plans Are Leaked to Other Ministries and Agencies The EA was set up in 1971 for the purpose of centralizing pollution control administrations. From the beginning, the EA has faced two problems. One is that the EA is a mixed force comprised of officials who have been transferred temporarily to the agency from other ministries, and another is that other ministries and agencies, as well as industrial circles, are apt to regard the EA with enmity. Since environmental preservation measures such as pollution control do not easily coexist with development and economic progress, it is hard for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry and industrial circles to accept them. In 1981, the EA submitted to the Diet an "environment assessment bill" designed to make a pre-survey of the impact of development works on the environment, and to work out counter-measures. The EA faced tough going from the initial stage of working out the bill due to pressure from industrial circles and other ministries. When the bill was compiled at long last, the EA had made considerable concessions and the content of the bill was very different from its original idea. For example, the EA excluded power plants from the list of targets for environmental assessment. As a result, Diet deliberations became entangled and the bill was eventually scrapped. Discord between career officials and officials temporarily transferred to the EA is noted in the agency. EA's career officials said in anger: "In some cases, EA's plans were demolished in advance because its strategy toward important projects were leaked to ministries and agencies to which transferred officials originally belonged." Takashi Kosugi, House of Representatives member (from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]) and former parliamentary vice-minister of environment, expressed criticism, saying: "As officials temporarily transferred from other ministries and agencies think their job at the EA is merely a stopgap, they tend not to tackle environmental administration in earnest. This is an abuse caused by a mixed force." The term "the faithful of the environmental persuasion" is often used at the EA. This term refers to officials who entered the EA resolving to contribute to the preservation of nature as well as to solve pollution problems, and such officials show their intense enthusiasm for tackling environmental problems. They are irritated by the attitude of some transferred officials who pay attention only to ministries and agencies to which they originally belonged. A senior official who had been temporarily transferred to the EA once fired subordinate officials, saying: "You have to work hard while keeping in mind there are not many companies that will accept so-called `Amakudari' [high government officials' landing a fat job in a semi-government or private corporation upon retirement] officials from the EA." The senior official's remarks indicate EA officials would be unlikely to secure future posts with private companies upon retirement unless they work hard because the EA does not have a long history. A career official who heard the story said in anger: "I entered the EA because I want to tackle environmental problems. Working for the sake of a future post means putting the cart before the horse." No Strategy for Making the Next Move The EA's current greatest concern is a basic environment bill. At last the bill is likely to pass the current Diet session. The basic environment law is the so-called "constitution" concerning environmental administration which will enable the transformation from the current anti-pollution administration to an administration oriented toward preservation of the global environment. Enactment of the bill is the EA's long-cherished desire as all EA officials say: "Unless the bill is enacted, we cannot make the next move toward concrete measures to preserve the environment." However, there is a view that even if the basic environment law is enacted, it will be difficult for the present EA to "make the next move immediately." This is because the EA has failed to establish a full-fledged, systematic strategy toward preserving the global environment. Kazuo Aichi, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] member in charge of policy affairs and former EA director-general, expressed his concern: "With the transformation to an environment preservation-oriented administration, the EA's policies will be entwined with various factors such as the economy, diplomacy and education. EA officials may be at a loss on how to deal with matters that they have not dealt with before." Taking into consideration the increasing importance of environmental administration, Ryutaro Hashimoto, chairman of the LDP's Policy Research Council, stated his recommendation: "The EA should be placed under the direct control of the prime minister so it can check policies of other ministries and agencies from the viewpoint of environment preservation." It is noticeable that other politicians who had shown little interest in environmental issues often comment on environmental issues, including environmental taxes. The number of "supporters" for the EA is steadily increasing. Although EA Director General Wakako Hironaka was greatly respected as an expert in environmental issues, she has failed to make clear-cut statements on the issues. The director general intends to overcome the current economic recession by expanding environmental preservation investments. However, it is reported that although she has urged sections in charge to embody the idea, there has been barely any response. It seems that Director General Hironaka's hope that the "EA will be able to make positive comments" has not yet been realized. One cause of this situation is the weakness of the mixed force which is apt to give consideration to other ministries and agencies. However, the main cause is that "since the EA itself has failed to put its views on environmental issues in order, its ability to work out plans is weak," (as stated by Shinseito's Aiichi). Meanwhile, there are some merits in the mixed force. There is a view among career officials that, "thanks to efforts by transferred officials who are proficient in negotiating with other ministries," the basic environment law is about to be enacted despite the resistance of other ministries and agencies, (according to Toshiro Kojima, chief of the EA's Water Quality Management Division). To make utmost use of the trend of emphasizing environmental preservation, the EA should not grieve about the shortage of staff or the mixed force but take an attitude of changing its demerits into strengths.
