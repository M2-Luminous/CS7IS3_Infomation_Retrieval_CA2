Of late, Sieng Lapresse, ancillary spokesman of the two-heads-three-eyes government, has stated that the NADK has burned people's rice fields. 2. The NADK spokesman totally rejects this accusation by the ancillary spokesman of the two-heads-three-eyes government. 3. The NADK spokesman wishes to clarify that the NADK is the defender of the nation, people, and peasants. It is also the peasants' helper and liberator opposing aggressors who oppress them. This is the NADK's longstanding tradition which cannot be distorted. On the contrary, it is only the communist Vietnamese aggressors and the communist Vietnamese puppets as well as their foreign cronies who have exploited the nation and people. They are pocketing foreigners' money and colluding with them to oppress and destroy the nation, people, and peasants. This is why they have no support from the peasants' force. As for NADK and Democratic Kampuchea [DK], they have support. This is because the DK and NADK are defenders of the nation and people and liberators of the peasants. [Dated] 15 January 1994 [Signed] NADK spokesman
