Special attention, the protocol reads, will be paid in this respect to the development of the relations with the European communities, the consolidation of Romania's position in the Council of Europe, Romania's joining in the NATO as a strategic requisite for its political-military security within the new political architecture which is being built in Europe, the promotion of a foreign policy in keeping with the Romanian people's national interests, with its vocation as partner open to collaboration and understanding with other peoples, the neighbouring ones first of all. The two parties stress the necessity that the future government should be a political one, so that all its members, starting with the prime minister, should be members of one of the parties making up the government coalition. It is envisaged in this respect to change the composition of the Nicolae Vacaroiu government, by switching from the current format of the government made up of members of the Party of Social Democracy of Romania and independent experts, to the format of a bicolour political government (PDSR and PUNR). To this end, the two parties agree upon including in the Vacaroiu cabinet, by January 24, 1994, through government reshuffle, four PUNR representatives, who will be given the following ministerial portfolios: justice, agriculture, transport, communications. The candidacies for these portfolios will be analyzed together by the two parties' leaderships, with the participation of the prime minister. The same procedure will be employed in the case of possible changes with the portfolios of other ministries. In view of furthering the process of democratization of the institutions of the state of law and in compliance with the Council of Europe's recommendations, the two parties agree that the future ministers of national defence and the interior should be civilian political personalities.
