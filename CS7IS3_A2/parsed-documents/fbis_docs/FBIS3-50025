FBIS3-50025 "dreeu014__a94031" FBIS-EEU-94-014-A Document Type:Daily Report 21 January 1994 ANNEX Slovakia Constitutionality of Screening Law Questioned AU1901185994 Prague CTK in English 2100 GMT 18 Jan 94 AU1901185994 Prague CTK Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Bratislava, Jan 18 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government believes that the screening or lustration law, "in its full scale," contradicts the Slovak Constitution as it discriminates against some categories of people, does not respect the presumption of innocence and the need for consideration of individual cases in court, government representatives told journalists today. The government has therefore decided to ask the Constitutional Court to rule whether or not the lustration law is compatible with the Slovak Constitution, they said. State Secretary in the Slovak Ministry of Justice Milan Handel pointed to several cases in which one person has been screened both positively and negatively. Hanzel ruled out the possibility of political aspects influencing the government decision, arguing that the ministry had been dealing solely with "the judicial part of the matter." He said the ministry had received some 50 complaints in connection with the lustration law. He did not, however, give the number of people who have been screened in Slovakia. The screening law passed by the now-defunct Czechoslovak Federal Parliament in 1991 bars former Communist Party officials, agents of the former secret police (StB) and members of the people's militia (Communist Party Armed Force) from high economic and political posts until 1996.
