On the contrary, Latvia endorses Russia's participation in various European institutions to manifest its understanding of partnership and responsibility for the current processes, said Gorbunovs. The anticipated citizenship law should provide a gradual growth of the body of citizens, said the Saeima speaker. If naturalization of non-citizens is too swift, the motion will bring on a great political counterreaction by ethnic Latvians. Hurd noted that political instability could also be provoked by a vague status of a large group of population. Gorbunovs agreed that the status of people who are not entitled for immediate naturalization should be politically and economically balanced. As reported, Hurd met Wednesday with the Baltic foreign ministers and high-ranking Latvian officials.
