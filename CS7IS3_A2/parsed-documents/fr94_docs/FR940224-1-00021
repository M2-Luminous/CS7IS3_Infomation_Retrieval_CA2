The sum remaining is the amount of available entitlement for use except that (i) entitlement may be increased by up to $10,000 if the loan amount exceeds $144,000 and the loan is for purchase or construction of a home, purchase of a condominium, or for an interest rate reduction refinancing loan, and (ii) entitlement for manufactured home loans that are to be guaranteed under 38 U.S.C. 3712 may not exceed $20,000. * * * * * 8. Section 36.4311 is revised to read as follows: §36.4311 Interest rates. (a) In guaranteeing or insuring loans under 38 U.S.C. chapter 37 the Secretary may elect to require that such loans bear interest at a rate that is (1) agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, or (2) established by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, change the election under this paragraph by publishing a notice in the Federal Register . Provided, however, that the interest rate of loans for the purpose of an interest rate reduction (38 U.S.C. 3710 (a)(8) or (b)(7)) must be less than the interest rate of the VA loan being refinanced. (b) For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points in connection with the loan. The discount points may not be included in the loan amount, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7). For loans bearing an interest rate agreed upon by the veteran and the lender the provisions of §36.4312, paragraphs (d)(6) and (7) do not apply. (c) Interest in excess of the rate reported by the lender when requesting evidence of guaranty or insurance shall not be payable on any advance, or in the event of any delinquency or default: Provided, That a late charge not in excess of an amount equal to 4 percent on any installment paid more than 15 days after due date shall not be considered a violation of this limitation. (d) Adjustable rate mortgage loans which comply with the requirements of this paragraph are eligible for guaranty.
