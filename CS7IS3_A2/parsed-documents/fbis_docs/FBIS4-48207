FBIS4-48207 "drafr094_e_94007" FBIS-AFR-94-094 Daily Report 14 May 1994 WEST AFRICA Liberia Nigerian, Guinean Troops Cited in ULIMO Arms Sales Nigerian, Guinean Troops Cited in ULIMO Arms Sales AB1405163094 Gbarnga Radio ELRL in English 1400 GMT 14 May 94 AB1405163094 Gbarnga Radio ELRL English BFN [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The latest Nigerian-supported genocide against the innocent civilians has again opened sore wounds regarding the neutrality of the Nigerian contingent within the multinational peacekeeping force in Liberia. Angry citizens in Gbarnga are calling on the leadership of the NPFL [National Patriotic Front of Liberia] to demand the unconditional withdrawal of the Nigerians from Liberia. The citizens also accused ECOMOG field commander General John Inienger, who is also a Nigerian, of misleading the people of this country into believing that the Nigerians, for peace sake, have turned over a new leaf only to realize that they are still bent on the destruction of innocent lives and property. Local and international observers say the activities of the Nigerian troops within ECOMOG [Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group] are in themselves an obstacle to the peace process and that the only guarantee for lasting peace is the complete withdrawal of Nigeria from the process here. Since the inception of the civil crisis in Liberia, the Nigerians have continued to create splinter armed groups against the people of this country with direct support intended to prolong the civil crisis. Evidence has emerged in Monrovia that the latest upsurge in fighting between rival ULIMO [United Liberian Movement for Democracy in Liberia] factions is being fueled by arms sales to both groups by ECOMOG. Intelligence sources in ECOMOG itself have relayed that the Guinean and Nigerian troops within the ECOMOG are involved in the sale of arms to the two fighting tribes within ULIMO. Our sources said the sale of arms to rival ULIMO factions involved some top-level personnel of the Nigerian and Guinean contingents of ECOMOG. The report said the economic gain of the sale is the main factor behind the delay by ECOMOG to take any decisive step in (?securing and end) to the fighting between the two ULIMO forces. The Koromah group is mainly supplied by the Guinean troops of ECOMOG while the Krahn faction is being supplied by the Nigerian contingent.
