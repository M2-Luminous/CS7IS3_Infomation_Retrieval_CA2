Estimated Annual Burden: 50 responses, 160 hours average burden per response, 8,000 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: FCC Report 43&hyph;08 is one of several reports comprising the automated reporting system. It is an annual report which consists of statistical schedules previously contained in FCC Form M which are needed by the Commission to monitor network growth, usage, and reliability. The information contained in the automated reports provides the necessary detail to enable this Commission to fulfill its regulatory responsibilities. Automated reportingeatly enhances the Commission's ability to process and analyze the extensive amounts of data that are needed to administer its rules. Automating and organizing data as submitted to the Commission facilitates the timely and efficient analyses of revenue requirements and rate of return, provides an improved basis for auditing and other oversight functions and enhances the Commission's ability to quantify the effects of policy proposals. This submission is an extension of the current OMB approval - no changes to requirements. OMB Number: None. Title: Application for AM Broadcast Station License. Form Number: FCC Form 302&hyph;AM. Action: New collection. Respondents: Non-profit institutions, and businesses or other for-profit (including small businesses). Frequency of Response: On occasion reporting requirement. Estimated Annual Burden: 400 responses; 639.88 hours average burden per response; 255,952 hours total annual burden. Needs and Uses: On 7/16/92, the OMB approved for use a new FCC Form 302&hyph;FM (3060&hyph;0506) to be used by licensees and permittees to apply for a new or modified FM license. The FCC Form 302&hyph;FM was created through the Total Quality Management (TQM) process. At the time of approval, the current FCC Form 302 was to be used only for the AM and TV services. At this time, the Commission is separating the AM and TV services into separate forms. The FCC Form 302&hyph;TV will keep the current OMB control number (3060&hyph;0029). The FCC Form 302&hyph;AM is being submitted as a new collection. Licensees and permittees of AM broadcast stations are required to file FCC Form 302&hyph;AM to obtain a new or modified station license, and/or to notify the Commission of certain changes in the licensed facilities of these stations. Additionally, when changes are made to an AM station which alter the resistance of the antenna system, a license must initiate a determination of the operating power by the direct method. The results of this are reported to the Commission using the FCC Form 302&hyph;AM. The data is used by FCC staff to confirm that the station has been built to terms specified in the outstanding construction permit, and to update FCC station files. Data is then extracted from FCC Form 302&hyph;AM for inclusion in the subsequent license to operate the station. Federal Communications Commission. William F. Caton, Acting Secretary.
