The Greek Government, Venizelos stressed, considers the Turkish foreign minister's remarks as an attitude of decreased tension, within the more general climate of cultivating artificial tension with the neighboring country. The government spokesman also referred to the meeting between Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and Cetin later today in Istanbul, and said that the issues that will be raised by the Greek side include provocations against the Ecumenical Patriarchate and also the ridiculous and unfounded claims by Turkey regarding a relationship between Greece and the illegal Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK].
