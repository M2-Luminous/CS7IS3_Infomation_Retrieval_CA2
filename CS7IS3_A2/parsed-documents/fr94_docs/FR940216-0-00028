FR940216-0-00028 FR940216-0-00008 The best available information on estimated halibut bycatch is available from 1993 observations of the groundfish fisheries as a result of the NMFS Observer Program. The calculated halibut bycatch mortality by trawl, hook-and-line, and pot gear through December 16, 1993, is 1,993 mt, 1,279 mt, and 2.4 mt, respectively, for a total of 3,214 mt. Halibut bycatch restrictions seasonally constrained trawl gear fisheries during the first, second, and third quarters of the fishing year. Halibut mortality did not constrain trawling effort in the fourth quarter of 1993. Trawling, with the exception of trawling for pollock with pelagic trawl gear, was closed in 1993 from March 24 to March 29 (58 FR 16372, March 26, 1993), from April 19 to June 28 (58 FR 21545, April 22, 1993), and from August 3 to October 4 (58 FR 41640, August 5, 1993) as a result of halibut PSC seasonal allowances. Hook-and-line gear was closed to directed fishing for all but DSR on June 4 to December 31, 1993 (58 FR 32064, June 8, 1993; 58 FR 46095, September 1, 1993). The amount of groundfish that trawl or hook-and-line gear might have harvested if halibut had not been seasonally limiting in 1993 is unknown. Even though halibut mortality was not constraining in the fourth quarter of 1993, some amounts of groundfish remained unharvested. Sablefish and Pacific cod are of the most interest to fishermen using hook-and-line gear. Over 900 mt of sablefish in the Western Regulatory Area, and 1,000 mt of Pacific cod in the Eastern Regulatory Area remained unharvested during 1993. An unknown portion of these amounts likely would have been harvested had 1993 halibut restrictions not been limiting. (B) Expected Changes in Groundfish Stocks At its December 1993 meeting, the Council adopted lower ABCs for pollock, Pacific cod, deep-water flatfish, flathead sole, shallow-water flatfish, arrowtooth flounder, and POP than those established for 1993. The Council adopted higher ABCs for sablefish, pelagic shelf rockfish, and demersal shelf rockfish than those established for 1993. The ABCs for other groundfish are unchanged from 1993 levels. Rex sole and Atka mackerel were separated out of deepwater flatfish and ``other species,'' and established as separate target species categories for 1994. More information on these changes is included in the Final SAFE report dated November 1993 and in the Council and SSC minutes. (C) Expected Changes in Groundfish Catch The total of the 1994 TACs for the GOA is 304,595 mt, a slight decrease from the 1993 TAC total of 306,651 mt. At its December 1993 meeting, the Council changed the 1994 TACs for some fisheries from the 1993 TACs. Those fisheries for which the 1994 TACs were lower than in 1993 are pollock (decreased to 109,300 mt from 114,400 mt), Pacific cod (decreased to 50,400 mt from 56,700 mt), POP (decreased to 2,550 mt from 2,560 mt), and ``other rockfish'' (decreased to 2,235 mt from 5,383 mt). Rex sole was separated from the deep-water flatfish complex in 1994 and assigned a separate TAC resulting in a slight increase in the total TAC for the two target groups but reducing the TAC for deep-water flatfish. Those species for which the 1994 TAC was higher than in 1993 are shallow-water flatfish (increased to 18,630 mt from 16,240 mt), sablefish (increased to 25,500 mt from 20,900 mt), shortraker/rougheye (increased to 1,960 mt from 1,764 mt), pelagic shelf rockfish (increased to 6,890 mt from 6,740 mt), DSR (increased to 960 mt from 800 mt) and thornyhead rockfish (increased to 1,180 mt from 1,062 mt). (D) Current Estimates of Halibut Biomass and Stock Condition The stock assessment for 1992 conducted by the IPHC indicates that the total exploitable biomass of Pacific halibut was 265.8 million pounds. This represents a decline in biomass of 11 percent from the previous stock assessment, a rate similar to declines observed in previous years. The decline is expected to continue over the next few years as a consequence of reduced recruitment. (E) Potential Impacts of Expected Fishing for Groundfish on Halibut Stocks and U.S. Halibut Fisheries Halibut fisheries will be adjusted to account for the overall halibut PSC mortality limit established for groundfish fisheries. The 1994 groundfish fisheries are expected to use the entire halibut PSC limit of 2,750 mt. The allowable directed commercial catch is determined by accounting for the recreational catch, waste, and bycatch mortality, and then providing the remainder to the directed fishery. Therefore, although the amount of halibut available for directed halibut fisheries will be reduced, halibut bycatch in groundfish fisheries is not expected to have any effect on halibut stocks. (F) Methods Available for, and Costs of, Reducing Halibut Bycatches in Groundfish Fisheries Halibut bycatch may be reduced by (1) reducing amounts of groundfish TACs, (2) reducing halibut bycatch rates through a Vessel Incentive Program, (3) modifications to gear and fish handling procedures, and (4) changes in groundfish fishing seasons. Reductions in groundfish TACs do not usually provide incentives for fishermen to reduce bycatch rates. Costs that would be imposed on fishermen as a result of reducing TACs depend on species and amounts of groundfish foregone.
