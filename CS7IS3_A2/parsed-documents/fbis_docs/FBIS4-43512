It is Berlusconi's first foreign visit since he led a three-party center-right coalition to victory in the parliamentary elections in March, formed his cabinet on 10 May, and then received a vote of confidence from the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Berlusconi's visit has thus highlighted Germany's importance for Italy as a partner of the highest order within the European Union as well as Kohl's significance for personal and substantive issues involving Europe's states against the background of the Commission in Brussels and the conferences that will take place on Corfu and in Naples over the next few weeks. However, there is an element of excitement about the visit. Since the billionaire and media businessman Berlusconi decided to enter politics at the end of January, challenging the Left and winning the elections, and since accepting the postfascist National Alliance as a coalition partner, he has been the target of hefty criticism both in Italy and abroad. Reporting by some of the Italian media stems from unfriendly to hostile. Rome has noted with regret that the German media in particular have been launching attacks against the Italian Government, and the fierceness of the attacks is out of proportion to their content. To spare the guest from Italy a furor, it has been decided not to stage a general news conference in Bonn. It has been announced that Berlusconi will only be available to a few journalists at the embassy. In considering the pros and cons regarding Berlusconi, it should be borne in mind that his opponents do not necessarily represent a majority of the electorate. In contrast to Kohl, Berlusconi has successful national elections behind him; both of them can congratulate themselves as victors in the European elections. Speaking to this newspaper, Foreign Minister Martino set out the government's field of activity. That the center-right coalition should encounter fierce opposition is no surprise. As head of Forza Italia, Berlusconi, along with his allies in the Northern League and the right-wing National Alliance, has started to change the corrupt party and state systems. He has been charged with doing so by a majority of the electorate. It is understandable that there are forces that oppose. Providing an example, Martino mentioned that since 1978, what was at that time the communist party and is now the opposition left-wing democratic party backed 95 percent of government budget policies and thus unrestrained state expenditure. At that time, all the parties bought the support of voters with public expenditure. Now, the Italians have to expose the costs of that wastefulness, reduce costs, and be given an honest pay for their work. The 52-year-old Sicilian Martino talked openly about the problem of fascism and fascists. He said that in his opinion, fascism was something entirely different from what appeared in Berlusconi's government program. As a liberal economist, he only joined up with Berlusconi because Berlusconi wants to reduce state intervention in the economy and society -- a difficult task in Italy, because of the high level of state involvement in the economy and an extravagant social system that cannot be financed. Both these phenomena stem from the fascist period, but have been stubbornly defended by the parties over the past few decades. The program is being supported by the five National Alliance ministers, because they are not fascists, said Martino. In his opinion, the polemics about fascism will die down. Martino did, however, concede that representatives of the National Alliance had made unnecessary, damaging statements: The lack of wisdom about those statements was balanced out by statements in a similar vein on the other side. On the other hand, the advantage of these exchanges of differing views was that greater clarity had emerged. He described his meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Peres on Monday [13 June] as "cordial and friendly," and "friendlier than would have been the case if certain statements had not been made." Regarding policy on Europe, Martino and the Berlusconi government share the chancellor's view that content and the joint goal are more important than the timeframe. This indicates that he is a supporter of a free market and does not think much of Brussels dirigism and unnecessary EU intervention in national sovereignty. "Intervention from above justifies division, harms interests, and restricts free trade," said Martino. This also showed that the foreign minister was in tune with the feelings of his voters, who do not appreciate being told what to think by politicians and made to display enthusiasm about Europe. There is no doubt in Martino's mind that Italy will seek to fulfill its European duties. Martino has a consolation ready for the Christian-Democrat chancellor in Bonn, who will no longer be able to speak to an Italian Christian-Democrat head of government. Berlusconi's "Italia" is a "recovered Democrazia Cristiana," a popular party of the center, which is open-ended in the case of voters on the Right and whose limits on the Left are the competing opposition parties.
