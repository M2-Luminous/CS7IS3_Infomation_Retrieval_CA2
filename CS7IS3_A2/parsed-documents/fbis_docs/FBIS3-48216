The government has reacted coolly to repeated calls for an easing of the financial restrictions from group management, the source said. Hyundai Chairman Chong Se-yong, a younger brother of Chong, asked President Kim Yong-sam in their tete-a-tete in September for his help in having financial institutions resume financial assistance to Hyundai, and a similar appeal was made to Economic Planning Minister Chong Chae-sok last week, but to no avail, the source said. Even close aides to the president and some cabinet ministers have tried to persuade Kim to ease the restrictions, but Kim has reportedly hinted that there is no possibility of the government relaxing its position with regard to Hyundai. Hyundai's relations with the government soured so much after Chong entered politics two years ago that the group has continuously been excluded from the beneficiaries of KDB facility investment loans and other financial assistance.
