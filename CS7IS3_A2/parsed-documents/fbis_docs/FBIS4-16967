An area of more than 4.5 million hectares has been vacated after the withdrawal of certain units of the Russian Strategic Missile Forces. Use of this land, however, has been complicated by the fact that increased radiation has been observed at numerous sites. For example, in Marina Horka -- one of the Russian units' bases -- the level of radiation exceeds the norm by 10 times. There have been reports that radioactive emitters, which were used for didactical purposes, were stored here. The lack of controls and natural aging of the emitters have led to the increased radiation levels. At Rechytsa, a radioactive waste dump which has been handed over to the Belarusian Interior Ministry, radiation is detectable within 200 meters of the perimeter. Since the dumping ground is located in an unprotected forest area, the local citizens -- unaware of any danger -- are taking advantage of nature's bounty there.
