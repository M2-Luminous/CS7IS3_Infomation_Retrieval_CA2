Changes in their top leadership are being forecast: changes that would favor rapprochement and mergers such as the peripheral organizations are now advocating. Confindustria Also Participates "We welcome the prospect of labor union unity, and I would further state that by signing the Unitary Labor Union Representation accord we contributed to that unity." These are the words not of a labor union official but rather of Confindustria [General Confederation of Italian Industry] Vice President Carlo Callieri, who wants the industrialists to participate in the debate on labor union unity. This should come as no surprise. Labor appears to have lost some of its political connections and to be seeking a new identity in an attempt to reaffirm its status as a major player, in anticipation of the Second Republic. The industrialists' organization accordingly wishes also to have its say, inasmuch as the renewed debate on the subject of labor unity has until now--at least as far as the top leaders of the labor confederations are concerned--consisted solely of reciprocal invitations, although an embryonic movement in favor of unity the can already be discerned within the craft unions and territorial organizations. The face of unitary trade unionism has not yet taken shape, but it will definitely not bear any resemblance to either Bruno Trentin, Sergio D'Antoni, or Pietro Larizza. This is because the first step toward that goal will be taken in the factories and offices with the election of the unitary representatives--a process that is scheduled to begin within the next few weeks. The embryos of unity that are becoming visible within some territorial organizations and craft unions do not yet project an image of this "new" federation. They take the form of meetings to study proposals with respect to unity such as those put forward by the Lombardian regional secretaries of the three labor confederations. These proposals include the creation of a single treasury, such as the Campania textile workers created when they paid their membership dues for 1944; the reconstitution of unitary directives, such as the commercial workers' unions have chosen to do; and nonaggression pacts, such as the one between textile workers and metalworkers in anticipation of the election of the RSU [Unified Trade Union Representatives]. The textile workers will offer a single ticket at the RSU election, although the affiliation of the individual candidates will be indicated. The metalworkers, on the other hand, have decided that no one will be left without representation: If in a given factory or office one of the three confederations fails to elect a single representative, the other two will give it one of their seats. The pensioners--who constitute at least half of the membership of the CGIL [Italian General Confederation of Labor], CISL [Italian Confederation of Trade Unions], and UIL [Italian Federation of Trade Unions]--have already scheduled a joint meeting for 15 February to consider a proposal to be presented for discussion by the rank and file. The proposal also contains initiatives that reveal a desire for unity but still do not confront the real issues. The Obstacles In reality, what has taken place so far is more in the nature of a reorganization of the joint efforts made in recent years than the beginning of a process designed to achieve unity--a process that will face its share of difficulties. Despite the powerful incentives that motivate them, the pensioners themselves make no secret of the obstacles that their proposal is encountering even within their own ranks. More Than a New Logo Under Discussion The obstacles are even greater at the next higher level in the labor union structure. The political obstacles remain, for although many of labor's political connections no longer have a name (for example, the DC [Christian Democratic Party] and PSI [Italian Socialist Party]), the respective visions of the kind of society in behalf of which the labor movement would like to struggle are still quite diverse. The organizational difficulties remain, because the problem as to whether the movement should represent basically its own membership or all workers has not yet been resolved. The internal structural difficulties also remain, because before a unified structure can be achieved, the respective leaderships must in any case not only be changed but reduced in size. According to CGIL Organizational Secretary Paolo Lucchesi, at least 30 percent of these leadership positions will have to be eliminated--no easy task. But this is a problem for the distant future, like that of a new logo that will do justice to everyone. There is much more under discussion. When an adjective must be chosen to describe the new labor federation, what will the right word be? Or rather, what word will be acceptable to everyone? No one has yet come up with that word. In negotiations with the other side, for example, will a strategy of conflict prevail, or one of cooperation? And will the prevailing concept be joint management or codetermination of policy? The CGIL leadership is quite cautious in designing the profile of the new entity which it seems inclined to create in cooperation with the other labor organizations. Sergio Cofferati, who many say will succeed Bruno Trentin as the head of the most powerful of the labor confederations, will suggest only what the future organization should not be. "It should be a union organization devoid of any trace of a corporative structure, but instead characterized by a strong spirit of solidarity," he says. "Moreover," he adds, "this is a course that we have already begun to follow. There is no lack of examples: they range from the labor dispute with Olivetti to the agreement with Iveco of the FIAT Group and our proposals for negotiations in the automobile sector." This policy would appear to exclude COBAS [rank-and-file committees] and all other independent organizations, whose only reason for existence--and for opposing the confederations--is precisely the defense of special interests. "Rather than unity," Piergiorgio Tiboni--secretary of FLMU, the independent union of metalworkers and mechanics--notes, "what the CGIL, CISL, and UIL have in mind is a single union, although they are ashamed to call it that. They obtained a reward from Confindustria: a reserve of 30 percent of the representatives, in each company, over and above the success of the individual slates, whereas these elections are precisely the occasion when the real strength and representativeness of each labor organization should be recorded!" Representatives The CGIL has in fact officially renounced its quota. Trentin is insisting that the real representativeness of each organization be continually verified, and on this point even the internal minority--the "Be a Union" faction--is in agreement. Alfonso Gianni, one of the heirs of Fausto Bertinotti--who left the confederation because he was elected secretary of the Communist Renewal party--wants the accord concerning the RSU to be replaced by a law whereby the 30 percent reserve for the so-called more representative confederations would be abolished and every organization would fight on equal terms. To obtain this objective, Trentin and Gianni advocate a referendum to abolish the criterion of "greater representativeness," on the basis of which the representatives who have a voice at the negotiating table are currently selected. In the unitary labor organization of the future, will there be a place for the extreme factions--for those who are still installed in the organs of the CGIL leadership or who while away their time in the CISL and are kept at bay in government jobs, for example, by D'Antoni's prestige? The Problem of COBAS and the Independents Remains Unresolved "The impulse of solidarity and of conserving the existing system must reconciled," says Carlo Ghezzi, secretary of the Labor Chamber in Milan. "I do not rule out the possibility that some people will not be recognized in a new labor confederation. However, the clarification could come immediately, with the election of the RSU." Cofferati is more cautious. "Unity does not mean a leveling," he says, "nor a disappearance of differences, either among the confederations or within the confederations." But neither does he want to deny that some segments of unions that represent radical positions could be lost along the way. "And not only leftist segments," he explains. The reconciliation has in fact already begun, and not just today. The first crack was opened with the signing of the accord of 3 July 1993 between the government and the corporate interests, and others developed during the difficult negotiations for the restructuring of large economic groups. Codetermination of policy, rather than joint management, would certainly appear to be the keystone for managing processes that are painful and inevitable. And this may be precisely the basis for the welcome--and indeed the appreciation--that has been expressed by Confindustria.
