Officials believe that the economic embargo imposed after the invasion of Kuwait is restricting the dictator's ability to buy loyalty and increasing the chances of a successful coup. Reports of defections by military officers and terrorist attacks in Baghdad against government offices have fuelled speculation that the regime's hold is weakening. President Bill Clinton's National Security Adviser, Mr Anthony Lake, noted with approval recently that "despite Saddam's efforts to buy loyalties, sanctions are taking their toll on the crucial inner circle on which the regime depends. "There are now frequent reports of coup attempts and unrest among the relatively privileged Iraqi elite." Mr Lake went on to say that "these trends could lead to new conditions for the citizens of Iraq and new opportunities to build a more peaceful and normal relationship between Iraq and the outside world" -- a coy reference to the possibility of Saddam's overthrow. The hope that the dictator could be ousted in the not-too-distant future has increased American determination not to slacken the international blockade. So far, London and Washington have managed to resist pressure in the Security Council to reward Saddam for his more co-operative attitude towards UN inspectors trying to track down his weapons of mass destruction. The advocates of a less stringent policy are led by Russia, for whom Iraq is a major debtor. But France also has sound economic reasons for softening the line against Saddam. It had lucrative economic ties with Baghdad before the war, buying Iraqi oil and selling military aircraft. French enterprises are already positioning themselves to be in the best possible position to exploit opportunities once sanctions are lifted. The Elf Aquitaine and Total oil companies have held extensive talks with the Iraqis over the future exploitation of two fields in southern Iraq where there is an estimated 20-30 billion barrels waiting to be pumped -- more than in the North Sea. The French insist that nothing will be signed until sanctions have been eased or lifted. But their actions have caused anger in London, where they are viewed as undercutting British commercial interests and breaking the spirit of the allied strategy against Saddam. After initially believing that its interests were best served by leaving a weakened Saddam in place to hold the country together and act as a counterweight to anti-Western Iran, the US has come round to the view that it would be better for Saddam to go. The US now supports the Iraqi National Congress, the broad spectrum exile organisation which has moved its headquarters to the Kurdish-held north of the country.
