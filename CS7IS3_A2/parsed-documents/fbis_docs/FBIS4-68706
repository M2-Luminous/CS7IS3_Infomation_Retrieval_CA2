Now the excise tax will be computed not in percentages of the price, but in absolute values (the average amount of the excise tax will be 14,750 rubles per ton of oil). The new system was introduced by the decree entitled "Excise Tax on Oil Produced on the Territory of the Russian Federation," which was put into the official delivery system yesterday. The levying of excise taxes on the sale of oil by the petroleum and gas associations was introduced as long ago as September 1992. At that time it was established that the excise tax is levied in the form of a certain fixed percentage of the price of the output that has been sold. Such a measure was completely understandable -- under the conditions of the formal freeing of the oil prices, the government was attempting to link the price increases with the budgetary proceeds (by raising the price, the oil producer automatically increased the payment of the excise tax). It is noteworthy that, unlike the excise taxes on ordinary commodities (for example, alcoholic beverages and tobacco), the Russian excise tax on oil is levied at a different rate for various petroleum-producing associations: for less effective producers, the rate of the excise tax is lower than for the more effective ones. Moreover, a number of associations operating at a low profit rate are completely freed of having to pay the excise tax. Thus, realistically speaking, the oil excise tax is, rather, a kind of variety of differentiated rent -- in the instructional guide concerning the levying of this excise tax it is stated outright that the payers of the excise tax are the producers who are situated in relatively better natural and economic conditions. In September 1993 the rates for the excise tax were increased. However, the principle remained the same -- the levying of the excise tax in percentages of the price. Now, however, in conformity with the new decree, the principle has been changed --it has been decided to levy the excise tax in the form of a fixed amount, with its monthly indexing in conformity with the change of the exchange rate of the dollar to the ruble. For the time being, the rate of the excise tax has been established in the amount of 14,750 rubles per ton; simultaneously Minfin [Ministry of Finance] and Mintopenergo [Ministry of Fuel and Energy] have been instructed, within the period of one week, to develop new differentiated rates for the excise tax for individual petroleum and gas producing enterprises and associations. In addition to petroleum, the decree also pertains to an excise tax on gas --Gazprom [gas industry] has been instructed to develop recommendations concerning the possible increase in the rate for this excise tax, effective 1 July 1993 (for the time being, it constitutes 15 percent). One's attention is drawn by the fact that, with the existing level of the release prices of petroleum, the new principle for levying the oil excise tax does not increase, but even somewhat decreases, the payments made by the petroleum enterprises to the budget. Moreover, the state actually is rejecting the idea of continuing to augment the budget at the expense of the increase in oil prices -- inasmuch as the average amount of the payments becomes independent of the actual price level. Thus, the new excise tax that is fixed in its absolute expression enables the authorities to achieve two goals at once. First, the government demonstrates its concern for the financial status of the petroleum producing enterprises, enabling them, if they so desire, to keep more funds at their disposal. Secondly, the authorities are emphasizing their disinterest in raising petroleum prices and are deflecting from themselves any accusations to the effect that the high prices are explained by the high excise taxes. Thus they are managing to display also their concern for the consumers of petroleum in the domestic market. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Evolution of the Russian Excise Tax on Oil | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Time of introduction |Average rate of excise tax | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |September 1992 |18 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |July 1993 |24 percent | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |April 1994 |14,750 rubles | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
