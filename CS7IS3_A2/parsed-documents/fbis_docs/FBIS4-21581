Prime Minister Mart Laar and Commander in Chief Aleksander Einseln had to answer questions concerning their compatibility to the NATO standards and quality. The Israeli-made small arms do not meet the STANAG agreements since Israel is not a member of the NATO, General Einseln explained. However, since the agreements concern primarily ammunition, the weapons can be considered as meeting the STANAG requirements, he stressed. Einseln added that the government had not approached him before on the NATO standards issue and the decision to purchase weapons from Israel had been made before he became Commander in Chief. MP Andra Veidemann questioned Mart Laar on the incomplete weapons consignments and the premier claimed the drawbacks to be insignificant. Laar mentioned some missing cartridge clips and bayonets, stressed that this does not prevent the weapons from being used, and added that the Israeli company will supply the missing parts. Estonian experts will later check on the completeness of the consignments before they will be shipped to Estonia, Laar assured the parliament. Further questions concerned the presented 23-millimetre anti- aircraft guns. Laar told the Riigikogu [parliament] that the decision had been made after an appeal by GHQ chief of staff Colonel Ants Laaneots during his visit to Israel last year. Laar claimed that the anti-aircraft guns as well as the machine guns had really been a present, outside the consignment which had been paid for. The Israeli supplier will help to repair the unusable weapons, he added. But the opposition members disagreed. Peeter Lorents claimed to have rarely heard "such a barefaced lie" as told by Laar and further explained that tests had disclosed more serious drawbacks with the weapons. He specifically mentioned defective mines and anti-tank ammunition. Lorents was seconded by MP Jiri Toomepuu, who claimed to have seen the original agreement, according to which the defective anti-aircraft guns were a part of the deal. They were supported by some other members. Centrist MP Olav Anton commented that only the Defence Minister, who has never served in the army, could believe such vague explanations. Centrist MP Liina Tdnisson asked about the renting of the building in 3 Toompuiestee and Laar explained that the government had decided to hold an open auction. But he repeated that the government keeps supporting the idea of renting it to the company "Koneston", which intends to organise a Russian business centre there. Laar rejected the claims that the mari airfield is being used for transporting stolen cars out of Estonia. The Estonian border guard is checking the leaving aircraft, he said. Laar also explained that the government had decided to spread the funds of the national budget between different banks purely in order to cut the risks. He added that a closed contest will be held to determine the banks which will handle the funds next year. Laar assured the parliament that the investigation of the cases when police officers mistreated Defence League members is continuing and Interior Minister Heiki Arike has been instructed to pursue the matter. But the names of most policemen who allegedly beat the volunteers are still unknown, Laar admitted. The "Independents" faction of the Riigikogu elected Jaanus Raidal its chairman and Mart Niklus vice-chairman. Other members of the six-man faction are Ants Erm, Avo Kiir, Kalju Pdldvere and Toivo Uustalu. Raidal announced that the faction meeting approved a resolution to support the reinforcement of law and order in Estonia.
