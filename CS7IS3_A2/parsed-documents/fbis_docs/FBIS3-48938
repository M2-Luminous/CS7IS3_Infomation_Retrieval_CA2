In its message of support to the miners, the SPO says that "the disgraceful truth is that in todays's Serbia loiterers and criminals get rewarded while miners cannot afford a crust of bread." "The SPO and Depos resolutely support the view that the authorities who cannot secure at least two things: That no one in Serbia is hungry and that every citizen's salary is enough to feed himself and his family, must be removed," the statement says. The Civic Forum's [nonnationalist intellectual group] statement, also forwarded to TANJUG, says that "the latest events show that the authorities are trying to provoke the introduction of a state of emergency." "The strikes by public services of vital importance for the functioning of our state and for citizens' lives, such as electricity supplies, railroads and local transportation, show that the authorities have decided to use these events to justify the introduction of a state of emergency," the Civic Forum's statement says.
