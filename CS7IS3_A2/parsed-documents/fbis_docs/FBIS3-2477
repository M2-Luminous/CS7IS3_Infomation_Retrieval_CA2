The fifth lecture, entitled: "The Banking System," is given by Zhou Zhengqing, vice president of the People's Bank of China. Zhou begins by introducing the three aspects of banking reform he is going to discuss: 1) A brief review of reform of the banking system over the past 15 years; 2) The main aspects of and the major measures for the current reform; 3) Several issues that merit attention in the course of implementing banking reform. In reviewing banking reform over the past 15 years, Zhou describes five aspects of banking reform carried out in China over the past 15 years: 1) establishing diverse banking institutions; 2) establishing a central bank system and gradually implementing an overall banking regulation and control system combining direct and indirect regulation and control; 3) developing various banking instruments and forms of credit; 4) greatly expanding the banking market; and 5) reforming the foreign exchange control system. Turning to the main aspects of and the major measures for the current banking reform, Zhou summarizes them as: "1) Instituting an overall regulatory and control system through the central bank, which will independently implement a monetary policy under the State Council's leadership; 2) establishing a banking organizational system under which policy-related banks and commercial banks are separated, and various banking institutions exist side by side with state-owned commercial banks serving as the mainstay; 3) building a unified and open banking market system based on orderly competition under strict control; 4) turning the People's Bank of China into a genuine central bank; and 5) developing the current specialized banks into genuine commercial banks." Elaborating on these five aspects of banking reform, Zhou discusses plans to convert the People's Bank of China into a genuine central bank, to establish three policy-related banks, to convert the current specialized banks into commercial banks, to establish rural and urban cooperative banks, to further expand and improve the banking market, to correctly guide the healthy development of non-bank financial institutions, and to reform the foreign exchange control system. Zhou goes on to discusses several issues that merit attention in the course of implementing banking reform. According to him, these issues concern the need to control the total credit volume during the transition from the old system to a new one in order to prevent serious inflation, the impact on loans for enterprises of the lengthy process of converting state specialized banks into genuine commercial banks, and the need to institute a legal system to ensure healthy and orderly progress in banking reform. At 0710 GMT Zhou concludes by highlighting the need to implement the above-mentioned five aspects of banking reform so that "all banking tasks will better serve the purpose of establishing and improving the socialist market economic system, and will make due contributions to promoting sustained, rapid, and healthy national economic development."
