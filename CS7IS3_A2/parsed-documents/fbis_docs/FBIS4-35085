Speaking about the position Mexicans can expect from the PRI the day following the elections, Pichardo said: "We are committed to scrupulously respecting the results of the votes, the people's will as secretly expressed in the polls." Politicians and experts have spoken about the most diverse hypothesis as to what will happen after the elections, including the possibility of violence once the PRI announces victory while the opposition shouts fraud! Pichardo said: "I do not know what is going to happen on 22 August." He mentioned two premises, though: the Chiapas factor as a catalyst of change and a respectful attitude for the votes, as a means of avoiding violence as an aftermath of the presidential election. He said Chiapas, where an Indian rebellion exploded on 1 January, gave speed to electoral changes that were in the process as a "product of agreements reached by parties in response to what society was demanding." He said we must "be strict in ensuring that the votes are clear, legal, and respected." With these two situations assured, we must work so that there is no violence as a result of the elections, he said. "We have an impartial and objective framework," he said. [passage omitted] Mentioning the Mexican observers, Pichardo said: "These will be closely watched elections." He added: "The PRI is satisfied because it has admitted we must not only win, but we must also be able to convince everyone we won cleanly and lawfully." Pichardo said the PRI "plays a fundamental role in the country's democratic progress." He said the reforms "we have promoted" are the best evidence the PRI clearly understands that the path of an ever improving democracy is an irreversible path. Regarding the political campaign of Ernesto Zedillo, who was designated the PRI presidential candidate following the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, Pichardo said he is satisfied because confidential PRI polls indicate the margin between Zedillo and other candidates "is increasingly wider." On 21 August, Mexicans will elect their president, 500 deputies, 96 senators, and 66 representatives to the Federal District Assembly in the country's 300 districts, 40 of which are in the Mexican capital. Pichardo said that from a political viewpoint, the PRI cannot accept the idea it may "lose in any district or admit defeat beforehand. This is inadmissible. The idea is to win every single district and win the Presidency of the republic by a broad margin." He said, however, "I am realistic and admit there is intense competition, especially in certain urban districts where the tallies are very close, and we have to struggle hard to win or recover them, as the case may be." Regarding the future of Chiapas, Pichardo said the peace process is the responsibility of the government and the Zapatist National Liberation Army. He said the PRI has asked the government to seek political mechanisms to renew the dialogue, which was officially terminated on 11 June. Pichardo said his party can contribute to the peace process "by creating an environment of tolerance, plurality, and calm in the framework of which we may proclaim ourselves in favor of the search for political, not military, solutions."
