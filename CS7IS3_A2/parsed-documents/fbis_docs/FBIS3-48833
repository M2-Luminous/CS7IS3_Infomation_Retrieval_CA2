"Choam Khsan is still in our hands as before," the officer said referring to the border town in remote Preah Vihear province which started to come under heavy artillery attack early this week, with about 100 rounds being fired each day. Several hundred familes fled their homes to escape the intense shelling and rocket fire and moved to the safety of the provincial capital, Tbeng Meanchey, the officer who requested anonymity said. Many families had to leave before they could harvest their rice crops and hundreds of rice-fields were burnt, he said. The government cooperated with aid agencies and to airlift in food and shelter Friday for more than 2,000 displaced people who had gathered in Tbeng Meanchey, an aid agency official said. Tbeng Meanchey is currently inaccessible by road but government troops were reported to be trying to clear mines which block the road running north through a heavy Khmer Rouge area in central Kompong Thom province. Meanwhile "serious military activities" were taking place around the Khmer Rouge's headquarters for all of northern Cambodia at Anlong Veng, Cabinet Minister Veng Sereivut said without elaborating. Defence Minister Tie Banh said that government troops started moving on the Khmer Rouge base at Anlong Veng on Friday in a bigger assault than previous ones. Earlier offensives in the area were called off because of bad weather and poor logisitics. "Our troops should have no problems capturing that area," Tie Banh said. Other government officials would not specify whether the advance was an all-out assault to take the base or just an attempt to use military pressure to push the guerrillas towards peace talks. Reports of an impending attack have been circulating for weeks, confirmed by some government officials and denied by others. A Western diplomat said that some military officials were reluctant to talk about activity in the area "because they didn't want to build up expectations and then have a failure." But he said he would not be surprised if the government had launched a major attack. "They were pretty much gradually creeping towards Anlong Veng over the past two weeks," the diplomat said. Another Western diplomat said he was aware the government had been moving men and munitions into the area for some weeks but could not confirm what was happening on the ground. However, he questioned the military significance of capturing the base. If the Khmer Rouge were faced with a large-scale attack, the guerrillas would probably just abandon the base like they did when a similar base came under heavy attack at Phum Chat in northwestern Cambodian last August, he said. Phum Chat is right beside the Thai border and government officers said at the time that the guerrillas had crossed into Thailand and escaped. "The question to ask is `Can the Khmer Rouge continue to abandon bases?' And if they can, `Do they have others in a neighbouring country?'" the diplomat said. The Khmer Rouge's infamous one-legged general Ta Mok was based in Anlong Veng but military officials and diplomats said he left in December, together with a number of his men, to set up another command post in Preah Vihear province not far from Choam Khsan. Attacks in the Choam Khsan district have increased since then.
