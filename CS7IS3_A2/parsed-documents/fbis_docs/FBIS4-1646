However, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) demands dispatching an international-observer battalion of about 400 persons and a Palestinian battalion of the same size. The sources told XINHUA that this is the first time for Israel to agree on dispatching lightly-armed international observers to the occupied West Bank. This agreement came in the context of a draft accord achieved between the Palestinian and Israeli delegations after a 14-hour negotiation in Cairo Thursday [24 March]. The PLO-Israeli talks on the implementation of the September 13 PLO-Israeli peace agreement was stalled in the wake of the February 25 massacre, in which a Jewish settler gunned down some 40 Palestinian worshipers at a mosque in Hebron. The sources said the PLO has not agreed so far on the number of Palestinian policemen and international observers as Israel did. The Cairo talks focused on dispatching international armed observers to Hebron, early access of Palestinian policemen to Hebron, nominating a municipality head of Hebron town by the PLO and evacuating 42 Jewish families from Hebron. The sources said that Israel agreed in principle on the evacuation of the Jewish settlers from Hebron to Keriat Arba' settlement near Hebron. The PLO calls for dispatching a total of 1,500 international observers to the occupied Palestinian territories. The sources said the PLO-Israeli negotiations are expected to resume next week.
