The Russian president also pointed to its high profit level and progressive production methods in the growing of vegetables. Even so, Mintimer Shaymiyev, Tatarstan's president, acknowledged that the republican's agricultural industry could not have developed without subsidies from the Russian budget. Fatikh Sibagatullin, minister of agriculture and food, said in an interview with ITAR-TASS correspondents that 80 billion rubles [R] had been transferred to the republic from the Russian exchequer to meet rural needs and, following the arrival in Kazan of Russian Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, the republic's agricultural sector would receive in June a further R35 billion in the form of credits. It is evidently for this reason that Tatarstan manages to keep food prices lower than in other regions. However, Boris Yeltsin told an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "these sums should not be called subsidies: Tatarstan and ourselves live on the basis of a treaty, and we arrange our division of labor and finances in accordance with it." The president of the Russian Federation explained the fact that Tatarstan has owed the Russian budget R43 billion since the beginning of the year as being due to the general cash-flow problem. Mintimer Shaymiyev told journalists that, once the cash-flow problem has been solved, Tatarstan's debts to the federal budget would be paid off.
