FBIS4-5887 "dreas073_a_94022" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Tax Panel Chief Urges New Regional Tax Tax Panel Chief Urges New Regional Tax OW1504120594 Tokyo KYODO in English 1016 GMT 15 Apr 94 OW1504120594 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, April 15 KYODO -- The head of a government tax panel indicated Friday [15 April] his support for adopting a new regional tax instead of simply raising the consumption tax as a new tax revenue source. "It could be a tax on consumption...but new thinking is necessary," Kan Kato, chairman of the Tax Commission, an advisory panel to the prime minister, told reporters after a panel meeting. Noting that the views were personal, Kato, emeritus professor at Keio University, said regional governments need their own tax sources to decentralize national authority and to improve regional social welfare. His proposal apparently stems from a welfare tax plan that called for permanent cuts in national income and regional residents' taxes to offset a 7 percent welfare tax, which was proposed to replace the 3 percent consumption tax. Under the current consumption tax system, the national government collects the tax and distributes a given amount as tax grants to regional governments. The plan drew strong opposition from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) -- The largest of the ruling coalition parties -- and was scrapped a day after Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced it in February. But the SDP has recently relaxed its stance on accepting a higher consumption tax in view of increasing welfare costs amid an aging society. Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii maintained his opposition to a regional consumption tax in his recent press meeting. Kato said the issue will be discussed thoroughly at a working group for regional tax that was officially formed at Friday's panel meeting. The group of 11 private experts will hold its first meeting on Tuesday, aiming to issue a report in May, Kato said. The panel meeting centered on burden sharing between tax and social insurance in line with a welfare vision for the 21st century that was compiled by an advisory forum to the health and welfare ministry in March, Kato said. He noted the panel will next meet on April 22 to continue studying welfare from broader aspects. In line with requests made by Hosokawa at the first meeting on April 8, the commission is discussing permanent income and residents' tax cuts and net tax increases to realize a balanced tax system to cope with an aging society. A final report offering several options for politicians to decide later is slated for issue in June.
