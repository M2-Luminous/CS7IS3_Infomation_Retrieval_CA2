Meeting With the Leaders of Political Parties and Grassroots Movements"] [Text] On 17 November Geydar Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijan Republic, held a meeting with the leaders of political parties and grassroots movements at which were discussed the war situation, the sources of the emergence of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, and ways of settling the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict. Rasul Guliyev, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, State Secretary Lala-Shovket Gadzhiyeva, other officials, and the leaders of all political parties and grassroots movements, except for the People's Front of Azerbaijan, and also representatives of the news media, took part in the meeting. The meeting was opened by Geydar Aliyev. He said, in part: Discharging the functions of chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan and subsequently assuming the office of president of the republic, I expressed my opinion concerning the social and political and economic life of Azerbaijan. This you know. I would like once more briefly to mention that the continued existence of the Azerbaijan Republic is connected exclusively with state independence. Azerbaijan must build its state on the basis of democratic principles. This means that a state based on the rule of law should be built and a democratic society created in the republic. We must take advantage of the achievements of world democracy and the traditions of the first independent state of Azerbaijan created in 1918. Freedom of the individual, freedom of speech and worship, defense of human rights, the equality of all citizens, and political pluralism should be established in Azerbaijan as the basic attributes of a democratic society. As president, I will organize my activity on the basis of these principles, G. Aliyev went on to observe. I have summoned and once again summon the political parties and grassroots movements of the republic to joint action and cooperation based on these principles. Speaking of the social and political and military situation in the country, the president declared that, possibly, these principles were not entirely applicable to the present position of Azerbaijan, which has for approximately six years been living under the conditions of war. Part of our land, the head of state recalled, has been captured by the Armenian armed forces. There are more than 1 million refugees in Azerbaijan. The republic's economy is in a profound crisis. All this is forcing the republic to live in accordance with the laws of wartime. But, the president observed, I believe that all social and political forces of the country and all citizens of Azerbaijan, regardless of their beliefs, should today be serving a single goal--that of defense of the unity, integrity, and sovereignty of Azerbaijan. It will then be possible both to organize defenses and to extricate the republic from this grim situation. I believe, he emphasized, that we still have the opportunity for this. Following the path of democracy, political pluralism, and the market economy and creating extensive opportunities for the development of enterprise, we can, having united all forces, secure the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the republic. Having dwelt on the role of the political parties in the accomplishment of national and state tasks, Geydar Aliyev observed that the constructive position of all social and political organizations is an essential condition of cooperation. We must on this condition either continue our activity on the basis of democratic principles or adopt the frequently advanced proposal concerning the declaration of martial law to save Azerbaijan and extricate the country from the crisis. Speaking of the reasons that had prompted the leadership to organize this meeting, the head of Azerbaijan emphasized that in building the strategy of his activity on democratic principles, he would give preference to cooperation with all political parties and public organizations operating in the republic. In order that this meeting might be held on a democratic basis, he announced, the representatives of all political parties and public organizations were notified two days earlier on television and invited to this meeting. We wanted, G. Aliyev said, each social and political organization to send its representatives to it itself. We wanted to meet and exchange opinions with the representatives of all parties and movements, regardless of their size and degree of influence on the social and political life of the republic. Geydar Aliyev expressed gratitude to the representatives of all political parties and grassroots movements for their participation in the meeting. In his opinion, the refusal of representatives of the People's Front of Azerbaijan to take part should be seen as the absence in this organization, which has in recent years performed a definite and important part in the political life of Azerbaijan, of a desire for constructive cooperation. Having touched on the questions to be submitted for discussion by the participants in the meeting, the president observed that its main purpose was consultation and an exchange of opinions on a number of problems. There are many subjects for discussion, but I believe, Geydar Aliyev said, that you will agree that the main and at the same time most difficult task for our republic, our people, and the state today is an end to the war. We have been trying to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, which was imposed on Azerbaijan, for approximately six years now. It seems to me that this is the most urgent, most important question. If we can find ways out of the war, get back the captured territories, and resolve the Karabakh problem, the president observed, a solution of the other problems will be possible. Only by having resolved this problem can we achieve a significant improvement in the sphere of constitutional development, the economy, and social policy, overcome the crisis, and erect a barrier to crime. I call on you, therefore, for an exchange of opinions primarily on these matters. In the past six years, Geydar Aliyev went on to say, social and political organizations and parties and state authorities and also organs of the press have expressed various opinions, considerations, and proposals and implemented certain measures. But none has thus far produced the desired result. Whereas six years ago the Nagorno-Karabakh question was perceived only as a problem, an incident, subsequently, growing by the day, by the month, by the year, this problem became a casus belli between the two states, between the two republics. There have been tough military operations as of late. The fruitlessness of the measures adopted by Azerbaijan is shown also by the fact that control over the entire territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Oblast has been lost in the recent period, and even our areas bordering the oblast have gradually been occupied by Armenian armed forces. The parties, public organizations, and organs of the press are at this difficult time of our life once again presenting various proposals and thoughts. Some people believe that this question could be settled quickly and that Azerbaijan would be spared this tragedy were their proposals adopted and the path that they propose chosen. I believe that the representatives of the political parties and grassroots movements should advance their proposals today, the head of state said. If the adopted measures are not producing the desired result, Azerbaijan is suffering one defeat after another, and some people believe that they are capable of averting such a course of events, then let us confer. Each thought, each proposal is valuable. If these proposals help extricate Azerbaijan from the present difficult situation, these proposals should, regardless of who made them, be adopted, and we should join forces. In my appeal to the people on 2 November, I called on all citizens of Azerbaijan to rise up and join their efforts at this difficult time for the republic, the president observed. I called on all political parties and grassroots movements for solidarity and service of the cause of defense of the territorial integrity of the Azerbaijan Republic and a return of the occupied land. Such is my opinion, and it is sincere. I repeat: Everyone and all parties and organizations holding different, even, possibly, diametrically opposite positions, should unite for the sake of this goal. Everyone here has one motherland--Azerbaijan--and we all live on the same soil--Azerbaijani. Each piece of this earth is sacred for each of us. If this rivalry and squabbling and this struggle for power, wherein use is made of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem, continues, if all this becomes the cause of a weakening of our defense capability and a further expansion of the aggression of the Armenian armed forces, if Azerbaijan falls apart and perishes, where will those who are struggling for power form their governments? I repeat: We have one motherland, and all should act in its name. I would like you today to have a candid, fruitful conversation and for your thoughts not to be dissipated on other topics, the president said. If we arrive at a specific opinion on the matter under discussion, if we can truly unite all forces, we will continue such meetings and hold discussions on other matters also. But this will depend on today's discussion. I hope that I have managed to clearly convey my thoughts to those present. And now I am prepared to listen closely to your opinions and proposals. The floor was given over to the participants in the meeting. In the course of the meeting, which lasted more than five hours, the leaders of more than 20 parties and grassroots movements, who had their say on the current strained atmosphere in the republic and on ways of stabilizing the situation in Azerbaijan, spoke. Some of the speakers condemned the People's Front of Azerbaijan for the fact that its representatives had declined this meeting. A large part of the speakers evaluated this meeting as an important step en route to political dialogue in the business of regulating the social and political and military situation in the republic. The activity that had been exercised as of late, geared to the removal of the chaos and lawlessness which had taken shape in the period of the leadership of the former authorities, was approved. The need for the adoption of laws in the military, political, and economic spheres, for a display of decisiveness on a number of issues, and for the adoption of tough measures was noted. A proposal concerning the creation of a political consultative council and the preparation of the mechanism of its work was advanced at the meeting. But, in the opinion of a number of speakers, were this council to be formed under the auspices of parliament and its legal status to be defined, more effective results could be expected. A large part of those who spoke approved this proposal. It was observed that, having united the forces of all political parties and grassroots movements of the republic and having perfected and accelerated even more the organizational development of the army, it was essential to adopt comprehensive measures to prevent the seizure of our land. Those who spoke observed that inefficient use was being made in the republic thus far of the material, scientific, and personnel potential, the preparation of the youth for military service had been organized unsatisfactorily, lawlessness was being perpetrated at times under the guise of mobilization, and the necessary conditions for speeches to the fighters in areas of the front of the artistic intelligentsia and veterans to raise the former's patriotic spirit were not being created. The speakers said with concern that there is in the capital of the republic and in other large cities no sense that there is a war going on. They expressed regret in connection with the fact that an uncompromising struggle was not being conducted against mafia groups and criminal outfits, which are abusing the current situation. In the opinion of certain speakers, martial law should be declared, mobilization should be intensified, all production bays, enterprises, and administrations should organize their work in accordance with the requirements of wartime, and everything should be adapted to the interests of the front as quickly as possible. The participants in the meeting spoke in detail about the mistakes in the organization of the work of defense and noted the importance of sponsorship of each unit and increased state concern for the families of the fighters. A main military control inspectorate should begin to function to shore up discipline in the army. Many speakers emphatically condemned the fact that material of an insulting nature, unsubstantiated and contentious, is appearing in a large quantity in many press organs and considered it necessary under the present conditions to suspend the activity of all political parties and grassroots movements and also to suspend the activity of a number of press organs. Mention was made with satisfaction at the meeting of the activity of the present leadership of the republic aimed at a solution of military problems by political methods and of the need for a continuation of this work. It was observed that a cease-fire, if only for a short time, was necessary at this difficult time for the country. In the opinion of the participants in the meeting, it is necessary to find new diplomatic channels, to use all means that could contribute to the implementation of the resolutions passed by international organizations, and to work actively on conveying to the world public the truth about the predatory actions of the Armenian aggressors. Those who spoke emphatically condemned the attempts to create antagonism between the authorities and the opposition and said that the present opposition was in fact conducting not so much a political struggle as a struggle for power, which was fundamentally contrary to the wishes of the Azerbaijani people. Closing the meeting, Geydar Aliyev said, summing up the exchange of opinions: Although this meeting was belated, it was useful, nonetheless. We have for five hours had a wide-ranging exchange of opinions, and the representatives of political parties, organizations, and movements have advanced a whole range of proposals and thoughts. They included, undoubtedly, thoughts that were useful, but also those that are far removed from the main subject of our meeting. But I approach with respect and attention each proposal and each thought, and I hope that all this will be useful in the future. At the start of our meeting, I explained that the main conversation and main discussion should deal with one issue--the extrication of Azerbaijan from the state of war, the return of the occupied land, and a resolution of the Karabakh problem. Unfortunately, there have not been enough specific proposals in this connection. You know that some newspapers operating from an accusatory position in this connection and their owners want to create in society the impression that they know the paths of a solution of these questions and that the people who are directing the state at this moment are pursuing the wrong policy and occupying the wrong position and do not know how to resolve the urgent problems. But today's meeting has shown that these words, rumors, and slanderous articles are not backed by a single specific suggestion or constructive thought. I am convinced that in a republic subjected to military aggression, confrontation needs to be brought to an end. Enough. In these five or six years, confrontation in Azerbaijan has reached extremes. This has been of no benefit either to the people or the independent state of Azerbaijan. It is merely damage that has been caused from year to year. All these blows, having mounted up, have ultimately put the economy of the republic in a difficult position, and this has been reflected particularly in a weakening and limitation of the possibilities of averting military aggression. As a result, part of the republic has been snatched away. And unless an end is put to the confrontation, certain forces, taking advantage of the Karabakh problem, will continue the struggle for power. If the people who were yesterday in power and who reduced the republic to such a condition, daily giving interviews in the newspapers, continue, as before, to publish provocative ideas, it will be impossible to preserve the republic, and it will fall apart. Those who were in office yesterday and who have now been removed and who were unable to resolve the urgent problems do not today have the moral right to criticize, debunk, and give interviews. They have quit the scene, and if they have understood their mistakes, they should now be doing everything really to help extricate the people from the present difficult situation. Or they should step aside and say: Yes, we were unable to handle this, let us see how it ends. But once again stepping up confrontation under the motto, as Gabil Guseynli said, "Either us or no one"--this should be seen merely as treachery in relation to the people, which can only destroy the republic. And this is complicating even more the already difficult situation of the country and causing its economic potential and military power great harm. As many speakers observed, some persons, who are repeating over and over: "We have lost yet another village," "One more district has been captured," and rejoicing at this, are celebrating it. Instead of uniting the people, they are inflaming passions, which is increasing in society the trend toward disarticulation and is an even more telling blow than that which is being delivered by our enemy. I want at our meeting first and foremost to bring to your attention the fact that, as a president who has assumed this immense responsibility, I know and sense how complex and difficult it is. I would like those who love their motherland, the land, and the people, and who are committed to an independent Azerbaijan Republic, to help me see this mission through to the end. If, on the other hand, assistance does not follow and some people remain in opposition and engage in complaining, I will undoubtedly have to put an end to this attitude. I concur with the opinion of Neymat Panakhly to the effect that division by the "power-opposition" principle is out of the question at this time. If the state has for five years been in a state of war and has for five years been losing land, how long will there continue to be talk about such a division in this state? The "power-opposition" question is usually based on two principles. The first is ideological. The opposition forces, cleaving to different ideological views, disagree with the ideology of the authorities, dismiss them, and implement their own ideology. There is no ideological disconnection here at this time. We all advocate the independence of Azerbaijan and must defend this independence. There are no other opinions. Etibar Mamedov has said that Azerbaijan's membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States is weakening and limiting its independence. I disagree with this opinion. I have my own opinion in this connection, of course. And Etibar Mamedov knows that the issue is by no means as he frames it. But he expresses this opinion, since he has to be in opposition. Of the 15 republics of the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics that gained independence, 12 are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. Only the Baltic states have not joined. But have the countries that have joined the CIS lost their independence? Have Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, or neighboring Turkmenistan, which from the economic viewpoint comes out the winner, as they say, lost their independence? Someone said here that although Turkey a year ago allocated Azerbaijan a loan in the amount of $250 million, not $1 million of this sum has been utilized as yet. But Turkmenistan has utilized it. According to information available to us, many states are making big investments in this republic. But is this meeting with any objections? Although Turkmenistan is a member of the Commonwealth of Independent States, there are a number of CIS documents that it has not signed. Why are we, joining the Commonwealth and not yet having had time to properly see what is what, saying that we have lost independence or are limiting it? I would like to say once more that we all support Azerbaijan's independence and that I personally have observed repeatedly that I will defend Azerbaijan's state independence, regardless of where I am, with all my activity, until the last minute of my life. If the forces which are in opposition are supporters of the independence of Azerbaijan, we have, consequently, no difference of opinion. This is what our ideology is based on. In the past, our ideology was Marxist-Leninist, and now we have rejected it. The representative of one party observed here that he is a supporter of socialism and is opposed to a market economy. This is his personal affair. But the majority of Azerbaijani society has rejected communist ideology and the building of socialism, and are supporters of Azerbaijan's taking the path of the building of an independent, secular, law-based state, founded on values common to all mankind and national traditions. This, consequently, is our ideology. One part of it is composed of spiritual values and national traditions. We are true to all this--culture, religion, national spirit, all national traditions, and our history; I am not mistaken here, I believe. As far as our religion is concerned, I will give you one example. The Islamic religion is the religion that we have followed for many centuries. Not only the Islamic, but also all other religions, were in the Soviet Union under prohibition for 70 years. We have now been given freedom and we have returned to our faith, and the freedom of worship of each individual is guaranteed. And this being the case, if between the authorities and the opposition there are no ideological differences, there are other complaints here: "You are in office, and I am not; consequently, I will fight you in order to remove you and take your position myself." Come on, brother, let us finish the war, and you can take for yourself any position. But let us remember: The present implacable opposition held until recently all the high offices. No one took these offices away from these people; they left of their own accord. I have spoken about this repeatedly. And for this reason there are no grounds here, in a country that has been at war for six years, for talking about power and opposition. There should be no talk about this. Mistakes of the state and the state authorities should undoubtedly be subjected to criticism. The authorities should know their mistakes, to avoid making them in the future. But this by no means signifies that it is necessary to adopt a hostile, treacherous, terrorist position in respect to them. There are currently among those in opposition persons who live by terrorist sentiments and are hatching terrorist plans. An investigation has shown that certain people were brought in here for the physical extermination of Geydar Aliyev and that measures for his removal at a particular time had been implemented. So what kind of opposition is this? What faith does it confess? Do these terrorist organizations really want to save Azerbaijan from Armenian aggression, or have they chosen this path to achieve their personal ends? Terrorism is the meanest, dirtiest path. So it has been throughout history, in all states. There needs to be an end to this. As chairman of the Supreme Soviet, I treated such phenomena with patience and do so now also. But this does not mean that this patience is unlimited. I believe that for Azerbaijan to be extricated from the state of war all forces must now unite. All specific proposals in this connection will be studied and applied. I have not heard any today. There was just one specific proposal--concerning the creation of a consultative council. I personally agree here. The state secretary will handle this matter. A consultative council should be created, evidently, in connection with the Karabakh problem. A general consultative council would enable us to achieve a great deal. It should be created in connection with the specific Karabakh problem, in order that this problem be tackled within its framework with regard to the existing proposals and possibilities. If you wish to create a consultative council for the administration of the state, there is no need for this at this time, it seems to me. If the people have elected a president, he will take the necessary steps to administer the state. The Karabakh problem is the main problem for us. Together with the problem of how to extricate Azerbaijan from the state of war, there are undoubtedly other questions also, and they will not be overlooked, either. But a consultative council is needed for a solution merely of the Karabakh problem. If a consultative council were really to work actively and this problem were to be settled, this would be a notable event, because we have for six years been unable to resolve it. Inasmuch as this is a very big problem, and since a specific discussion of ways out of the war seems unacceptable to some people at the present meeting, evidently, I ask the representatives of all the parties that are present here and of those that are not to present within five days' time specific proposals in writing on the Karabakh question and the country's withdrawal from the war. We will examine all of them in the consultative council, and I will examine them as president also. You should know that from day one of my work as chairman of the Supreme Soviet through the present, I have devoted 80 percent of my working day--and you know, most likely, that my working day is quite long--only to this question. There is no other solution. I personally have sought and continue to seek many paths. On a number of matters I have conferred with persons in my circle, members of the Defense Council included. Meetings and negotiations have been held here within the framework of Russia's mediation mission for a settlement of the Karabakh problem with Ambassador-at-Large Vladimir Kazimirov. As you know, I have taken a number of steps. Some people will like them, some, not, evidently. But all this--negotiations with the leadership of Armenia and of some of our officials with the leaders of Nagorno-Karabakh--represents steps dictated by necessity. I have conducted negotiations with the leadership of Russia, Turkey, and Iran and with representatives of the United States and other countries. There is no need, I believe, for me to tell you about all this. But I am trying and will continue to take advantage of all opportunities. Perhaps you have greater opportunities. Please, give us your proposals. We do not need empty words, accusations, squabbles, or rows; we need to present specific proposals. Some of those who spoke here approved our successes in the achievement of a cease-fire. I will continue to endeavor to ensure, operating from these positions, that fire not be resumed. This is my personal position, and I will continue to work in this direction. But how far this activity will be successful I do not know. You have seen to what casualties the violation of the cease-fire agreement has led. I am taking certain steps in this sphere also. I said in my speech on 2 November and I repeat now that I see a possibility of Azerbaijan's escape from the state of war and a return of the lands in peaceful fashion. If some people can assist in this direction, let him make his suggestion. Those, on the other hand, who think otherwise may present their proposals also. At the same time, on the other hand, there is no doubt that we must strengthen our defense capability. It has been observed here that there have been many reasons for defeats. If the absence of internal stability and the weakness of the authorities may be cited among them, ineffective use has at the same time been made of the time since the winning of independence, and we have been unable to create an army capable of defending Azerbaijan. Mention has been made here of mafia groupings, instances of bribe-taking--all this has occurred. But mafia groupings have penetrated in great depth the army structure also. While blood was being spilled at the front, individual people here were appropriating monetary resources. At a time when people have been dying, losing their homes, and becoming refugees, some people, taking advantage of the situation, have been enriching themselves illegally. This is our misfortune, our tragedy. This also is why an army has not been created. It is rumored--I touched on this yesterday in conversation with Etibar Mamedov--that certain battalions had been illegally disbanded, and this was the reason for a number of defeats. I am accustomed to speaking frankly. These inventions are far from the truth. Let us agree to be frank. Military matters are not decided by one person. Each party has the opportunity to apply to a state body in writing and to obtain a written response. But we should not be writing in the newspapers that one battalion did this, another battalion, the other, and so forth. Yesterday I called in Etibar Mamedov's presence the chief of the Main Staff and told him that eight battalions had, it is said, been liquidated and that this was why we had been defeated. I ascertained that this was not the case. This is the information: Instead of the 400-500 men that a battalion should have, there were 15-18. And it is called a battalion, and money and provisions are issued for 400 men, and so forth. The military cited for me monstrous facts. In some army units both in the past and until recently, the commanders would five days before the issue of pay give 70-80 percent of the fighters home leave, appropriating their money for themselves. In addition, they would extort bribes from them so that they might be given home leave. When we revealed the truth, reporting this on television, some people objected: You cannot talk about the army this way. But what should we do? This is the truth, and without disclosing this truth, there is be no result. All this--the fact that an army has not been formed as yet, that there have come to be negative elements in its ranks, that individual mafia groupings deriving personal gain from everything have begun to operate within the army (such, incidentally, was the grouping of Alikram Gumbatov, although many people spoke about him to me as a hero, yet he has done such thievery in the region as to have grabbed an armed unit)--is the most important reason for our defeats. Our priority path is negotiations in various directions for a peaceful settlement of the problem. At the same time, on the other hand, we need to organize the army at the proper level, strengthen it, and form highly professional units so that Azerbaijan might defend itself both today and tomorrow and in five and 10 years' time. If Azerbaijan is an independent state, it should know how to defend itself. Whoever, therefore, has specific proposals on this issue and on the question of our peace negotiations and on the use of other possibilities of the state, let him say what paths he sees. Someone could, possibly, do something besides this also--let him say, and I will only be grateful. In respect to the army: Let us reach agreement. It has been said here that the army needs political leaders. Indeed, there are 40 parties, and if each sends his representative, what would be the result? In the past there was one--the Communist Party--and each army subunit, from the platoon up, had a party organization and a deputy commander for political matters. In some instances other factors are employed, it is said. But it seems to me that if we concentrate all forces and appeal for assistance to the intelligentsia, religious figures, scientists, and respected persons, and if they can operate in organized fashion, performing the necessary work in the army units, and can foster in the fighters ethical and moral qualities and fortify their spirit and will--this will be both our political and ideological work. But this work should be performed not occasionally, but constantly and in organized fashion. Other questions were broached also. I do not wish to dwell on them. We will work in the economic and other spheres. The preparations for an important conference on problems of the economy are under way at this time; it will be held on Friday, evidently. It was rightly mentioned here that the decline in production in both industry and agriculture has continued here in recent years and that the manufactured product is being squandered. We know that there is a big gap between exports and imports. Not even 10 percent of the value of the exported commodities has been returned to the republic in many sectors. All this has been lost somewhere and appropriated by individual persons. On the one hand, we are losing the republic's land; on the other, certain persons are weakening our already limited economic opportunities. We are dealing with these matters. Some of those whose activity is connected with the economic sphere spoke here. I would ask that the parties present proposals on economic problems also. This would help us. We would examine and avail ourselves of them. But I would not want to start a wide-ranging discussion at this time. I mentioned earlier that the main question is that of the war. Summing up the discussion of the war, there are some things that I would like to add. Let us agree: Let the newspapers stop using the subject of the war as an instrument of struggle. If this goes on, I shall avail myself of my powers to adopt the necessary measures. Proposals have been expressed here concerning the imposition in the republic of martial law or a state of emergency and the suspension of the activity of parties and newspapers. These proposals are well founded. I want to tell you frankly that, as president, I am assessing these proposals and thinking about this. But I would not want to resort to such extreme measures. But if it is necessary, to save the people, the republic, Azerbaijan, possibly, we will be forced to take serious steps. It has rightly been observed here that any step is justified in the name of the salvation of Azerbaijan. I would like these questions to be tackled on the basis of mutual accord, national solidarity, and civic unity. This would attest to our high culture. It would show that we are really committed to democratic principles. At the same time, if we see that all is falling apart, we will then avail ourselves of any means, and this will be justified. I therefore warn the newspapers: The slander campaign against the president, the president's staff, the state secretary, and other officials must cease. Criticism and insults are not the same thing, this is the first point. Second, the criticism itself must be fair. Certain speeches today were connected with personnel policy. We have still done nothing to respond. What sort of personnel policy can there be if there have still been no serious personnel transformations. There has long been such talk. At the same time, on the other hand, bear in mind that personnel policy is a most complex field. Many people have in this transitional period lost their sense of ethics, unfortunately. Yes, some are saying: Dismiss me; I will set up a commercial structure and live better than before. And this is truly the case. It has been said today that bribe-taking has now assumed the greatest proportions. I disagree. I was in charge of this republic for 14 years, and right from the start of my activity through the last days, even when I left in 1982 to work in Moscow, up to and including my retirement in 1982, I fought against bribe-taking. How were people punished at that time? They were dismissed and expelled from the party (this was a big punishment at that time. There is now no Communist Party, and party expulsion is no longer frightening). Yes, I resorted to these measures. We punished by imprisonment also. But subsequently those who had been caught taking bribes donned the garb of "victims of the stagnation period" and came to occupy the highest positions. Are these the realities of our life? Is this our history of the past 20 years? I was a participant in this history. I was merciless toward bribe-takers. Both the person giving the bribe and the person taking it are criminally liable. People give bribes because they are accustomed to doing so. When I worked here, I was often told that some people, giving bribes, believed that they were in this way establishing a close relationship with those to whom they were being given. When I retired, there was no one left by my side. Some people explained this by the fact that I was tied to no one. They said: You were tied only to an ideology, and now it has fallen apart also. Those who came after you were surrounded by people. Some live in Moscow or elsewhere, but they have their entourage. But I will never be bound by such ties. I am today also linked with the people spiritually and will live with this moral philosophy. Do not think that I should fight bribe-taking alone. You must all fight it. But let us investigate which political party is fighting bribe-taking. Who is fighting the mafia groupings? Sponsorship is currently in vogue. Everyone has a sponsor. How are the newspapers published? When I worked in the Supreme Soviet, there was no possibility of publishing the newspaper AZERBAIJAN. The state had no money. But the newspaper DZHUMKHURRIYET appears three times a week, things are even better for the newspaper AZADLYG, and the newspaper MUSAVAT comes out more often than AZERBAIJAN. Where are they getting the money from? With what funds are they being published? Is it not the funds of the mafia groupings? Or perhaps they inherited the money with which they publish the newspapers? Let us speak frankly. I have fought bribe-taking all my life and will continue to do so. At that time, even if people of the system, from my circle, were proving to be an obstacle, I would fight alone. It has happened also that on five occasions I dispatched a commission to look into the work of the first secretary of a district party committee, and everything was covered up. The sixth time I formed a commission that revealed everything. This person was expelled from the party and arrested. Then Vezirov came and extolled them all. And the newspapers wrote that whereas the punitive measures in 1937-1938 had been carried out by Stalin and Bagirov, in the 1970's these punitive measures had been carried out by Geydar Aliyev. What punitive measures did I carry out? I was and will continue to be merciless toward bribe-takers. I was and will continue to be merciless toward thieves. I have never been nor will I ever be guided by personal interests. But you also should be the same. The whole people should be the same. Everyone is now saying: "Bribe-taking has the world in thrall." Very well, why do those who say this not grab the bribe-taker by the hand? If he subsequently does not incur punishment, we who are closing our eyes to this may then be held to account. I agree entirely that not only now but yesterday, 10, 20 years ago, our morals were damaged by bribe-taking. And this phenomenon is progressing from year to year. On account of a lack of discipline, on account of the fact that bribe-taking is widespread in the law enforcement authorities themselves, and its dimensions are spreading constantly, and we are duty-bound to fight it. Everyone must fight this, and each in his own sphere. If the political parties have ideas on this question and have specific considerations or information on actual instances of bribe-taking, we are prepared to use them. Leave aside personnel policy. Mistakes may be made in personnel policy. We have not yet begun personnel policy. People are talking about Geydar Aliyev's circle. Who is in my circle? Just two or three persons. And I believe that they are serving the people loyally. Public opinion should not be shaped by spreading various rumors. A proposal concerning the creation of a higher military inspectorate was made here. I believe that this is a workable proposal. We could implement it. I hope that our present meeting will initiate all subsequent work. We will in the very near future adopt decisions on the proposals that have been expressed here--on the consultative council and the rest. I ask the political parties once again to present within five days' time their proposals for what can be done both in respect to negotiations and in the sphere of military organizational development. I express my gratitude in advance. I believe that we have had a productive discussion. If you have no objections and if you show an interest, I intend to continue our meetings. I hope that they will be useful. I thank everyone once again for their proposals and opinions, and I hope that today's meeting will become a factor laying the foundation of civil unity and civil solidarity in Azerbaijan. Au revoir.
