Last year, the output value of civilian products turned out by the war industry in the southwest reached over 8 billion yuan, accounting for more than 90 percent of the total output value of the industry. The war industry in the southwest is an important part of the war industry in China. The industry consists of over 50 enterprises, research institutes, institutions of higher learning, and schools. It employs 250,000 staff members and workers and has fixed assets amounting to over 4 billion yuan. In the 1950's and 1960's, the war industry of the southwest mainly produced military products and occupied a decisive position in the war industry of China. The war industry of the southwest began its strategic shift to the production of civilian products at the beginning of the 1980's. This production has been expanding year after year and at present, its scale is considerable. It now turns out more than 10 categories of major products including mini-cars, motorcycles, heavy-duty trucks, machines for oil production, optical and electrical instruments, refrigerators, and cameras. It has formed a production set up in which the production of cars occupies a dominant position. By the end of 1993, the southwest war industry had produced an accumulated total of over 5 million motorcycles, over 140,000 mini- cars, 800,000 cameras, and nearly 500,000 refrigerators. Ninety percent of its enterprises have their own leading civilian products. Since it began its shift to the production of civilian products, the southwest war industry has established ties of cooperation with over 500 civilian product enterprises and over 300 rural enterprises in China. It has also strengthened its cooperation with foreign countries and has imported a lot of advanced technology and equipment from abroad. More than 20 of its major projects have advanced technology and production lines imported from foreign countries for turning out civilian products. To date, the southwest war industry has over 50 Sino-foreign joint ventures for turning out civilian products and agreements signed by these joint ventures involve investment amounting to a total of over $1.5 billion. The export of civilian products by the southwest war industry has exceeded 1 billion yuan. It is learned from the Southwest Company that by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan, both the output value and sales volume of civilian products turned out by the southwest war industry will reach 10 billion yuan. The company will use various channels to introduce foreign capital to develop the production of civilian products and is ready to make investments and set up factories abroad.
