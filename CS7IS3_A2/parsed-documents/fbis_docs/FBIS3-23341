Wali 'Abd-al-Hadi al-Ghazali, a 36-year-old Iraqi, denied working for the Iraqi intelligence service, reversing his stand when the trial opened on June 5. At the request of lawyers for the two main defendants--al-Ghazali and another Iraqi, Ra'd 'Abd-al-Amir al-'Assadi--the court adjourned the trial until April 2. "I did myself wrong by my confessions," said al-Ghazali, denying that the Iraqi intelligence service employed him to assassinate Bush in a suicide mission in Kuwait in April 1993, using a car bomb or explosives strapped to his body. Earlier al-Ghazali and al-'Assadi, 33, regarded as the ringleader of the group, said the Iraqi authorities had "forced" them to carry out the mission. Another defendant confessed to having transported explosives into Kuwaiti territory, but said he did not know about any plot to assassinate Bush. Iraqi Ahmad Jabbar Habib, 21, repeated his denial Saturday. The other defendants also denied any involvement in the plot or links with Iraq. [passage omitted on Gulf War]
