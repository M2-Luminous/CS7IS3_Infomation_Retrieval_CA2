The acronym means "Identification -- Friend or Foe?" The system is used by allied military aircraft and helicopters. The pilots use the system to determine whether the aircraft on their radar screens is a friend or a foe. Why did the F-15 aircraft, which are affiliated with the Hammer Force, destroy the two Black Hawk helicopters without using their IFF systems? Obviously, a stupid communications error must have happened, just as in the case of the [USS] Saratoga incident in the past. The flight information of the U.S. helicopters over northern Iraq was not conveyed to the U.S. military aircraft patrolling the region. That was an incredible mistake on the part of the U.S. officials. If that is the case, it is not totally absurd to postulate the following: The U.S. pilots were not informed of the U.S. helicopters' flight plan. Could it be that they took them to be Turkish helicopters and deliberately shot them down without using their IFF systems? According to British aviation experts, confusing the Black Hawk helicopters with Iraq's Soviet-made helicopters, even at a great distance, is impossible. Meanwhile, it was common knowledge that many Black Hawk helicopters were in the air to support the Turkish military forces' cross-border operation into northern Iraq. The U.S. pilots should have considered that and used their IFF systems. Considering all that, we ask whether we are confronted with a tragic but comical situation, one in which U.S. officials who do not support a military solution to the problem in southeastern Turkey, have downed their own helicopters while trying to "teach a lesson" to Turkey by destroying one or two of its helicopters? The picture becomes worse when that incident is put into context with the "private" talks President Clinton held with Prime Minister Tansu Ciller in Washington. According to the U.S. officials who drew up the agenda for the 12-minute talks, they were to confer on only three issues, the first being Turkey's economy. Clinton was to inform Ciller that he would support Turkey's economic stability measures if Ankara agreed to sign a "stand-by" agreement with the IMF. The second issue was the problem in southeastern Turkey. Ciller would be asked to abandon the quest for a military solution and instead seek a "political settlement." The third issue was the Cyprus problem. An effort had to be made to convince Turkey to say "yes" to the "package of confidence-building measures," which has been changed by the UN officials. We have been thoroughly informed on the outcome of the discussions on the first issue; Ciller disclosed that she agreed to the condition on the IMF. However, she is unable to make an open disclosure on the second issue because she is aware of the consequences of revealing that she has agreed to those terms. Meanwhile, in view of her ignorance of past developments, she may not fully realize the implications of agreeing to the suggestions presented to her on the third issue. Therefore, we wish to recall a few points to help her realize who our true friends are and who are not. The latest package on Cyprus is very meaningful, regardless of the fact that it has been described as a "mini" package. It calls for giving up a certain piece of territory. That requires reciprocity -- that is, something very substantial and permanent. However, the amended package calls for the Turkish Cypriot side to lose control of a piece of territory as large as Maras [Varosha] itself. That step will probably be taken before the Nicosia International Airport is reopened and before officials have an opportunity to establish whether or not opening the airport has contributed to the lifting of the embargo on the Turkish Cypriot side. In view of the abandonment of the former concept on the boundary of Maras, the package was only accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side due to significant pressure. Considering that, any policy tantamount to a step back from that package will be rejected in northern Cyprus and Turkey. In fact, such a policy would be suicidal. Therefore, those who try to use Ciller's lust for power to encourage her to adopt suicidal decisions cannot be her friends.
