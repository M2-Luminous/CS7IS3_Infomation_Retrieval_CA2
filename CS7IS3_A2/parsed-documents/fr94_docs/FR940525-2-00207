FR940525-2-00207 FR940525-2-00118 Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations and priorities. However, for the following reasons, the Secretary is publishing the absolute priority for manufacturing technologies demonstration projects without seeking public comment. In FY 1993, the Department awarded a contract for the purpose of carrying out a manufacturing technologies demonstration project under the cooperative demonstration authority. Similarly, the Department initially planned to award a contract for this same purpose in FY 1994. However, the Department recently determined that a contract cannot be used for funding manufacturing technologies demonstration projects in FY 1994. Since the FY 1993 appropriations available for this competition must be obligated by September 30, 1994, solicitation of public comment on the absolute priority for this FY 1994 manufacturing technologies competition would not allow sufficient time to publish the priority in final form, announce and conduct the competition, and award the funds by September 30, 1994. Therefore, the Secretary finds that solicitation of public comments would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest under 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program. Applicable Program Regulations 34 CFR parts 400 and 426. Program Authority: 20 U.S.C. 2420a.
