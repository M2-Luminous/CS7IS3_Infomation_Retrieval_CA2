FBIS4-46855 "jpusr061___94026" FBIS-USR-94-061 JPRS FBIS Report: Central Eurasia 1 June 1994 RUSSIA ECONOMIC & SOCIAL AFFAIRS `Rostest' Consumer Goods Testing, Certifying Described `Rostest' Consumer Goods Testing, Certifying Described 944E0883A Moscow RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA in Russian 1 Jun 94 p 2 944E0883A Moscow RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA Russian CSO [Article by Svetlana Svetlanova: "We Eat and Drink Any Old Thing and Sometimes -- We Poison Ourselves: Is the Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights in Russia Really in Force?"] [Text] It is no secret: in the last three or four years the quality level of domestic products has fallen. Boris Migachev, general director of the Russian Testing and Certification Center, has stated this repeatedly. It is a paradox: 57 certification organizations and 152 testing laboratories are fighting over the important task of making our products meet safety and medical-biological norms. Moreover, this struggle is not without its banner. In fact, there is, after all, a Law on Protection of Consumers' Rights. Almost 90 percent of the foodstuffs and 70 percent of industrial products are certified. It is a bit worse with imported goods: in 1993, Rostest rejected... one percent of the goods. And in general not because the rest were "okay." Is satisfaction too expensive?.... It turns out that the price of a certificate issued by Rostest at the request of enterprises for a food product "stretches" to 80,000 rubles [R]. This includes the cost of tests and services upon conclusion of the expert examination. Meanwhile, is the consumer chewing up unfit cheese and washing it down with unfit milk? The quality of the products supplied from many CIS countries is very bad. As Migachev stated, however, "beginning on 1 July, barriers will be set up." It is curious: throughout Russia... there is no figure on rejected goods. Even though the consumer tested on his own skin (and repeatedly) the carelessness of the suppliers. ZIL, for instance -- it produced a microwave oven, which Rostest immediately rejected. The Krugozor Toy Factory was reprimanded for violation of the production process. Some products of the Mikoyanov Meat Combine and the Cherkizovo Dairy Combine were rejected. Forty Western firms have now turned to Rostest with a request to certify their products. Eighteen German washing machines are being tested. Let us hope that Moscow has every opportunity of testing products. One thing is particularly depressing: The hawkers and kiosk attendants "pass around" quite a few fake certificates. The general director of Rostest therefore appeals to us to be on the alert. If you don't want them to cheat you -- ask for a certificate. Not just any one. Be sure that the form has the seal and logo of the Rostest representative on it.
