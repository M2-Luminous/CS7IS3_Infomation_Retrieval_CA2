Mr. Mohammadi has stressed: The Islamic Republic of Iran is cohesively supporting the expansion of good relations and peaceful coexistence with Islamic countries such as Saudi Arabia. However, this trend cannot be one-sided. What must be viewed as a reality is the presence of contradictions and ambiguities in the behavior of the Saudi statesmen; a behaviour for which one cannot find any justification except the intervention of the foreigners. The Islamic Reublic of Iran fully supports the implementation of the agreement between the foreign ministers of both countries reached in Oman after the conclusion of the 17th session of the meeting between the Islamic countries' foreign ministers. On the basis of the same agreement, the Islamic Republic of Iran has proposed negotiations between high-ranking delegations from both countries, with the aim of making the implementation of the agreement possible during this year's Hajj. So far, however, Iran has unfortunately faced contradictory postures and procrastinations from the other side. This constitutes a fact which is denied in the remarks made by the Saudi official.
