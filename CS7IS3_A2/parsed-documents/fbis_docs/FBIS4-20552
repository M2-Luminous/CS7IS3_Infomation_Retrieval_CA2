Most of the R&D has been incorporated in the five departments or business units. This makes the divisions' R&D responsibility complete. While the initial goal of decentralization was to guide research and the use of its results in the proper direction, it now also deals with the management of the researchers themselves. This step can be regarded as the final phase of the process which was initiated in 1990 to make R&D more market-oriented. From that moment on, the it was no longer the R&D organization that determined which research had to be done, but the departments. The technology manager was assigned the important role of watching the long-term developments of customers and competitors, and deciding which developments were interesting for the departments involved. In cooperation with the department's management, he determined the R&D policy. R&D was organized by project. The researcher was given clearly outlined objectives, but continued to work within the central R&D organization. R&D became the strategic partner of the departments. Thinking along with the customerswas essential. Cut and Paste Throughout 1993, however, it became clear that efficiency still needed to be improved. Corporate strategist Joop Roels says that this is mainly due to external circumstances: "Fierce technological competition constantly forces you to seize upon new developments very fast, to take immediate advantage of market opportunities, and to work cheaper. As it turned out, creating an organization which was even more efficient than before, was only possible by incorporating research people and resources in the departments wherever possible. In genetic engineering terms, this means cuts in R&D, and then pasting in the divisions." This reshuffle of over 500 researchers did not involve any layoffs. The reorganization, which was carried out within three months, resulted in five units with an integrated research activity: Industrial Pharmaceutical Products Division (IPPD, penicillins and cephalosporins); Bakery Ingredients Division (BID, yeast and other bakery ingredients); Business Unit Savory Ingredients (BUSI, yeast extracts and other flavoring substances); Bio-Specialties Division (BSD, industrial enzymes); Corporate New Business Development (CNBD, development of new products, which fall outside the four above-mentioned core activities). The part of the research which could not be decentralized for reasons of efficiency, for instance the test plants and analysis, is incorporated in a central technical cluster, which supports the divisions. Expansion According to Roels, the reorganization of R&D has contributed to giving Gist-brocades a good position for the company's next evolutionary phase, which is expansion. "The departments are now well positioned. The company has clearly opted for those areas, in which it is strong or thinks it is strong. This knowledge makes it possible for the company to gradually expand its business. We will shun neither major acquisitions nor partnerships, whenever the opportunity arises." Roels advocates a balance between inventing and purchasing, when it comes to acquiring the required technology as effectively as possible. "Why bother to learn the technology yourself, if good technology is available outside the company?"
