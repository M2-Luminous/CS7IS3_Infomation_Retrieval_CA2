Where has the state apparatus become "swollen?" What today is the position of state employees? Can the struggle for sectorial and departmental interests be shifted into the channel of civilized lobbying? At a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent's request Federal Minister Vladimir Kvasov, leader of the Russian Federation Government apparatus, considers these questions. As for the reorganization of the Government apparatus, its reduction, the merging of departments, and the creation of new ones, it is still early to speak of the results of this work. Work is in full swing. If we are speaking of the state management apparatus, which has indeed over recent years come close to the million mark, then such an enormous increase occurred through the increase in the regions -- in Russia's krays, oblasts, and rayons. After all, there are about 350,000 officials at rayon management level alone, as was mentioned by government head Viktor Chernomyrdin. And the federal organs' apparatus has not grown for several years and numbers about 35,000. Thus the state apparatus has been "swollen" because of the regions, which under the Federation Treaty are independent in their decisions. The federal organs exercise less and less control over them and it remains for us only to "collate the statistics." It s known that the main task of the government apparatus is to prepare its decisions and the second, no less important, is to monitor the fulfillment of these decisions. But naturally it is impossible to monitor all government instructions. After all last year alone there were nearly 48,000 of them. But the most important, on which the state of affairs in the national economy and other spheres depends, are monitored, and quite toughly. As for lobbying, perhaps I shall say something almost criminal, but I myself have been lobbied. But... in a civilized manner. For our country the concept of lobbying and lobbying itself is something new. Lobbying is only emerging and has not yet assumed the form of legislative acts. perhaps it is for that reason that Russian lobbying is of an uncivilized nature. On the other hand, for instance, a deputy elected from some region to the State Duma has undoubtedly been lobbied. And that is understandable, even in purely human terms. Why was he elected if he not only will not represent his region's interest but will not "promote" them? But when it is a case of "promoting" some document to the government to make it make an important decision and the document itself is raw and unfinished as they say, then that kind of lobbying is blatantly uncivilized and is based mainly on amicable relations with someone from the government leadership. And in this connection we can dwell on work with ministries and departments. Demands on the preparation of documents submitted for the government's examination have now been made sufficiently tough. Incidentally, according to existing norms all documents which are to be examined by the government are unfailingly agreed on in advance with the ministry and department. Actually, under the existing situation, only an agreed document is examined in the government, and the role and task of the government apparatus is merely to legalize it and report it. But unfortunately a situation often takes shape in which an attempt is made by hook or by crook to "promote" an unfinished or, as we say, a "raw" document. At that moment people do not think of the problems which will unfailingly arise and could have various and sometimes grave consequences. That is why the apparatus has now considerably toughened demands on documents of this nature. Unfinished documents are simply sent back, which of itself is already a serious warning. Now about state employees. It is no secret that there is always a problem with good and well qualified cadres, especially now when there is a temptation to get more money by working in commercial structures. But the president has signed the edict on introducing the statute on state service and the necessary normative documents are being elaborated to implement this statute. These are the fundamental legal documents giving a state employee certain guarantees for the entire period of his work in state service. And when they begin to operate the attitude toward the state employee will change fundamentally. Has the government apparatus work style changed? Undoubtedly it has, for life does not stand still, everything is changing rapidly. Of course, work in the apparatus is complex and takes up almost all one's time. But if you succeed then you feel great satisfaction. Probably this can be said by anyone of his work to which a man actually devotes almost all his life.
