We express thanks for this important invitation which offered an opportunity for us to assemble a large number of important businessmen, experts in economy, and politicians from the whole world in this world economic forum. During my stay here I have had a number of important, constructive, and positive talks. During those talks we approached a large range of problems connected with the peace process. This important role played by President Iliescu in the meeting organized between myself and Mr. Peres is not unusual. On this occasion, we discussed and approached the problems of peace and the installation of this peace. President Iliescu has made very big efforts and Mr. Peres and myself were impressed with his points of view. These efforts will be reflected positively in the talks and negotiations between us that will take place either in Paris or in Cairo. We thank again President Iliescu, the Romanian Government, and the friendly Romanian people, to whom we extend our gratitude and we thank all of them for this position toward the Palestinian people. We are convinced that the Romanian people and the Romanian Government will grant us support and assistance in the future establishment of our state which we hope will take place soon. Thank you.
