In an exclusive interview with Rui Araujo, Ali Alatas talks about progress but does not stop at criticizing Portugal and particularly the adoption of the so-called confidence building measures. [Begin recording] [Rui Araujo] Are you happy with the results of the meeting? [Alatas, in English with superimposed Portuguese translation] Reasonably happy because, we, again, made some progress in identifying and agreeing on some confidence building measures. [Rui Araujo] Some will argue that the talks, until now, have achieved little if anything substantive. [Alatas] No, it is true that we have not reached the substantive part of the talks yet, as was earlier agreed upon among the three sides [Portugal, UN and Indonesia]. We first tried to create a better atmosphere, a propitious atmosphere, before we go into the substance because we know that the two positions, the two basic positions are very far apart. So we have made progress with these confidence building measures. It was slow, not as fast as I would have liked, but we are making progress. You should see it from that point of view, rather that from the point of view of substance that we have not reached yet. [Rui Araujo] Are you optimistic about that issue? [Alatas] I would say I am reasonably satisfied with the pace of the talks. [Rui Araujo] You have accused Portugal of failing to act quickly to establish confidence building measures. What kind of measures were you expecting from Portugal? [Alatas] Just as a few illustrations, perhaps: when we started talking about confidence building measures at the beginning, we could not agree at all on any one of them and, if my recollection is correct, we agreed immediately at the first meeting already on something like exclusion of journalists, exclusion of personalities, etc. It took two meetings before Portugal came around to accept it. There were other things that were already proposed by the secretary- general from the very beginning, such as interest sections. You have heard about this proposal that we would not open diplomatic relations because that may be too early perhaps for Portugal, but interest sections, two officers, two diplomatic officers of Portugal in the Netherlands and two Indonesian officers in the Thai embassy or the Malaysian embassy in Portugal. They would quietly work there, they would be a channel of communications. In the case of the Portuguese diplomats, they can occasionally go to East Timor, report on what they themselves see rather than rely solely on the press. These are some of the good confidence building measures. [Araujo] Do you feel Portugal is changing now? [Alatas] I see no indication yet on that. [end recording]
