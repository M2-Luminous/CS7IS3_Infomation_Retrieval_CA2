Assessing that even a brief truce was better than a continuation of the conflicts and that the Bosnian Serb delegation has once again shown, by accepting the agreement, that it wants the war to end, the Democratic Party pointed out that the best solution would be the acceptance of the Bosnian Serb delegation's proposal on a permanent ceasefire. By insisting on a one-month ceasefire, the Moslem side has shown that it is not interested in a serious negotiating process, because it is clear to everyone that a peace accord cannot be reached in such a short time, the Democratic Party said in its statement which was sent to TANJUG. According to the ceasefire agreement which was signed on wednesday by special United Nations envoy for former Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi and Vice-Presidents Ejup Ganic of the Moslem-Croat Federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Nikola Koljevic of the Bosnian Serb Republic, the warring sides have pledged to refrain from all military activities for one month as of 12:00 hrs local time on June 10. Akashi had proposed a four-month ceasefire agreement, the Bosnian Serb delegation had been for a lasting ceasefire, but the Moslem- Croat side had insisted that the maximum period be four weeks. In a statement sent to TANJUG, tha Democratic Party of Serbia assessed that the signing of the Geneva agreement was still far from lasting peace, but that it should nevertheless be applauded as the fwrst step towards an end to the human suffering. From the diplomatic aspect, it is good that the Bosnian Serb delegation, despite the evident concessions to the Moslems who have always so far undermined the peace process, has once again shown flexibility and signed the document which can lead to a lasting ceasefire and a demarcation process, the Democratic Party of Serbia said. The Democratic Party of Serbia has understanding for the Serb side's dissatisfaction in Geneva, but diplomatic patience is necessary at this time which will be certain to bring lasting peace to Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement said. The Democratic Party, underscoring that the Bosnian Serb delegation has shown once again by accepting even such a short ceasefire that it is taking the peace talks seriously and that it wants the war to end. The Democratic Party pointed out that it is therefore all the more surprising that Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic should have said that the Bosnian Serb leaders were not constructive, thus weakening their negotiating position at the time when the agreement was being signed. The Democratic Party of Serbia also criticized Lilic for this in a statement released earlier today. Lilic on Tuesday said that Yugoslav citizens cannot be hostages of any one leader or part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, or the Bosnian Serb Republic, or the republic of Serb Krajina in former Croatia.
