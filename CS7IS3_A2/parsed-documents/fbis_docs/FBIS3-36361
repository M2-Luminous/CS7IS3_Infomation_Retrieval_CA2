He emphasized in an interview with INTERFAX that this was likely to happen unless Russia ceased to use force and blackmail and started to use diplomacy and negotiations in its relations with the mountain nations. He thinks that Russia is encouraged in its ill-conceived North Caucasian policy by "certain quarters in the West who want Russia to disintegrate and lose statehood." Dudayev believes that the abundance of weapons and uncontrolled militias had contributed to making the region unmanageable. This situation affects Russia itself. He said that "weapons are moving from the Caucasus into the depths of Russia where armed fascist and nationalist bands are formed." In Dudayev's view, "this complicated situation is likely to aggravate, making a new Caucasian war possible. Those in the Russian leadership who play into the hands of the West and lead Russia to a collapse while making a lot of noise about keeping it united and indivisible have a significant role to play in this process." He said that Chechnya was prepared to look, jointly with Russia, for ways to stabilize the Caucasus.
