[passage omitted] The French Foreign Ministry adds a note of caution: this figure of 2,500 will have to be adjusted. First, because the withdrawal operation of 1,000 blue helmets from Sarajevo was already planned. As for the rest, we will wait and see, Alain Juppe says: [Begin Juppe recording] This operation is under way. It is a gradual reduction, if I may say so, which was planned and announced within the context of the concentration of our troops in Sarajevo, an idea we have entertained for a long time. For the rest -- that is, the 1,500 men or so who are in Bihac -- their status will be considered by the end of the year but no final decision has yet been taken. This, I repeat, will depend on the development of the diplomatic process. [end recording]
