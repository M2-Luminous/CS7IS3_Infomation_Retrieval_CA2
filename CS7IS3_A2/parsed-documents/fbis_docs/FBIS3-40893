Above all, because of the changes in occupational patterns, along with the ranks of workers who have a long tradition of revolutionary struggle, ranks of workers have appeared in new occupations that use modern technology, that have foreign investment, and that are expanding rapidly. This includes the oil and gas, information, electronics, posts and telecommunications, and service sectors. A number of these sectors are quickly moving to the forefront: the shipping, aviation, electric power, and light industrial production sectors. These changes have in turn led to changes in the value rankings of the sectors. Because of the growth of the world economic structure and because of their technological backwardness, many sectors that were once viewed as "key" sectors no longer enjoy that status. Along with this process has been the appearance of more and more young and healthy workers who have high educational standards, who can assimilate modern technology quickly, and who are working in electronic control and microcomputer offices, shuttle-less textile mills, and varied labor services networks. The changes in the structure of the economic elements has been devastating to those production and commercial installations that have clung to the state subsidies mechanism. During that period, many enterprises and production and commercial installations in the state sector operated at a loss and production was stagnant. The workers were not very interested in productivity, the quality of the products, or the economic results. Tens of billions of dong in commodities stagnated and could not be sold because of poor quality and high production costs. In the wake of the reorganization of production and commerce, at present only about half of the state enterprises are regarded as stable and have been issued permits to resume operations. About 19 percent of the enterprises have been disbanded. Along with this situation is the decline in the ranks of state workers and the movement of state-sector production chains to other economic elements (about 700,000 people). At the same time, the ranks of workers in the nonstate sector have expanded rapidly, with the number of such workers increasing to 2.2 million people by the middle of 1993. The labor pattern is quite varied, with self-employed, cooperative, private enterprise, and joint enterprise workers. The point worth noting here is that, at many factories, enterprises, and production units, the ownership rights and dignity of the workers are not respected. This has limited the labor zeal and creative abilities of the workers and reduced their ability to struggle to defend the truth. This is one of the reasons why workers at a number of enterprises and factories have left their jobs and gone on strike in the past. For example, since 1989, in the state sector there have been 27 strikes, and in the private sector there have been 17 strikes with economic demands, demands for democracy, and so on. On the other hand, the market mechanism has led to another phenomenon among some workers and laborers and that is a psychology of using personal interests as the motive force for action. Unless this psychology is kept in check, it will lead to pragmatism, the class concept of some workers will become corrupted, and they will not be proud of being members of the working class. They will become indifferent to the present situation and to the domestic and international political situation, their moral quality will decline, and their spirit of comradeship and class attachments will fade and be replaced by "group" and local relationships. One of the basic causes of the above situation is the state subsidies mechanism and the protracted lack of social fairness. This has weakened labor zeal, given rise to a concept of dependence on others and passivity, corrupted a number of workers, and done great damage to the ranks of workers with respect to thinking, organization, ethics, way of life, skills, and labor style. Many of the positions and policies on workers and production and commercial installations have not yet been standardized to form a synchronized, unified, and organized operating mechanism that can be implemented resolutely. The new management mechanism and the economic elements have gone into operation, but the necessary laws to go along with this have not yet been promulgated. Such laws include a worker and laborer health protection law, an unemployment law, and a labor law. On the other hand, because of reorganizing production, of the more than 700,000 workers who have left the production chain, only about 20 percent have managed to find a job. As for work conditions, because the machinery and equipment are old and outmoded, because the labor environment is dangerous, and because protecting the laborers has not been given the proper amount of attention, particularly in private enterprises, serious accidents occur frequently and work-related illnesses are on the rise. Labor intensity is high (averaging 9-10 hours a day in the private sector). Incomes are low, and the wages and bonuses paid to the laborers are enough for them to satisfy only their minimum needs. In the private and joint enterprise sectors, the workers and laborers must accept the low incomes if they want to have a job and maintain their lives. Because of this, the problem here is to provide the workers with an adequate standard of living based on their basic wage and principal occupation. Skilled industrial workers have been allowed to earn a living by crop cultivation, animal husbandry, and even trading, and that is why their thinking, psychology, and labor style have become more and more remote from a working class nature. This will weaken the social class basis of the party. However, in the new revolutionary stage, the working class has always agreed with the renovation line of the party. It has broken away from the old management mechanism, implemented a multifaceted economy, and acted in accord with a market mechanism controlled by the state. This unanimity shows that the working class and its vanguard units have remained united and that the party's lines are in accord with the wishes and interests of the working class, all strata of laborers, and all the people. This is an important factor in ensuring that the renovation movement moves in the right direction and is successful. As broad political-social organizations of Vietnamese workers and laborers, the trade union organizations face new challenges and new conditions. The trade unions must undergo a major renovation with respect to organization and activities so that they really become schools of socialism and solidarity and protect the interests of Vietnamese workers and laborers in the renovation movement. The "wealthy people, strong country, civilized society" target put forth at the seventh party congress is a struggle target of the working class and Vietnamese trade unions. The trade unions must really become the representative of the workers in fulfilling the obligations of masters of society and masters of the country in the renovation movement to have a wealthy people, strong country, and civilized society and to build and defend the fatherland. They must give attention to protecting the interests of the laborers and participate in managing the state. They must be broad organizations for mobilizing and educating the laborers. The renovation guidelines concerning trade union organization and activities must be directed toward the following requirements: Attracting large numbers of workers and laborers in the economic elements to voluntarily join a trade union and having them strive for national stability, democracy, social renovation, and the interests of the workers and laborers. Varying the forms of activities and launching a revolutionary action movement composed of large numbers of workers and laborers in order to contribute to hitting the targets and carrying out the tasks in the renovation movement. Building a rank of talented trade union cadres with organizational capabilities who can carry out the functions of the trade unions, who have a close relationship with the masses, and who are close to the primary level. Forming an organizational system that is in accord with a multifaceted economy that operates based on market mechanisms while still maintaining the principle of democratic centralism and improving the effectiveness and operating results of the trade union organizations at the enterprises and production installations. In recent years, the entire trade union system has been in turmoil. It has looked for ways to further clarify the renovation viewpoints of the party, ensure that trade union activities are in accord with the new mechanism, satisfy the requirements and tasks of building and defending the fatherland, satisfy the needs and hopes of the workers and laborers, give attention to and protect their legitimate and legal rights and interests, and at the same time give attention to participating in controlling the workers and laborers and educating them about their obligations. Trade unions at the central echelon and primary level have concentrated on spreading propaganda and mobilizing the workers and laborers to ensure that they thoroughly understand the renovation line of the party and agree with the production reorganization policy. Revolving around the target of "jobs, living standards, democracy, and social fairness," the various echelons have looked for ways to provide jobs and improve the work conditions and standard of living of the workers. In the difficult conditions of changing mechanisms, the labor movement to create and exploit innovations has been maintained. At the same time, new emulation movements have been launched with the targets being productivity, quality, and results in a market mechanism. At many production installations, the trade unions have established mutual aid funds to give loans to poor laborers and expand the family economy. Many localities have established job promotion centers, and a number of places have established legal consultation offices. The Secretariat of the Labor Confederation has participated in drafting the Constitution, trade union law, and many draft laws, regulations, and decrees related to the rights and obligations of laborers. In places where labor disputes and conflicts between laborers and owners have arisen, the trade unions have promptly coordinated things with the local authorities to provide direct guidance, resolve things on the spot, ensure the legitimate and legal interests of the laborers, and quickly stabilize the situation. Educating and mobilizing the workers has been renovated, and active and self-sufficient nature of the primary level has been exploited. The quality of the mass means of information has been improved. Summarizing practices and studying theory have been promoted in order to ensure that trade union activities are in line with the party's lines, to improve commercial production results, and to contribute to stabilizing the economic, political, and social situation. Emphasis has been given to finding and expanding the effective activities of the trade unions in the nonstate sector. This is a new and difficult task about which experience must be gained while carrying it out. At present, more than 180 primary-level trade unions, 42 labor unions, and 300 labor associations that have attracted approximately 110,000 laborers at cooperatives and private and joint enterprises have been organized and put into operation. These are initial bases that must be studied to see what the best forms are so that they can be greatly expanded in the coming period. Giving attention to building primary-level trade unions and to learning the experiences at the bases where trade union activities are strong, many typical examples such as the Ba Song Factory, the Cam My Rubber State Farm, the Hai Duong Porcelain Plant, the Deo Nai Coal Mine, and so on have been reported and copied throughout the country. However, because of operating for so long within a state subsidies mechanism, when switching to the new mechanism, the various-echelon trade unions have exhibited confusion and passivity. In guiding and implementing things, not all of the complex changes of the market mechanism can be gauged. There is a lack of concrete measures, and the trade unions have been slow to get involved in social activities. In the market mechanism, now that a labor market has been formed, the issues of ownership, hired labor, salaries, wages, labor protection, and improvement of labor conditions are very difficult and pressing issues. But the trade unions have been slow to study these issues. Also, the trade unions have not done a good job of educating the workers or getting them to respond to the action movements. In the nonstate sector, they have persuaded only 5 percent of the laborers and 10 percent of the production installations to join a trade union. In the coming period, the various-echelon trade unions will face even greater tasks. The trade unions must concentrate on mobilizing the working class. Regardless of which economic element they are working at, they must maintain labor discipline and good solidarity, exploit the creative potential, improve techniques, increase productivity, improve product quality, reduce production costs, contribute to expanding the multifaceted commodity economy and bringing the country out of poverty and backwardness, and strive to hit the "wealthy people, strong country, and civilized society" target. Above all, the trade unions must take steps to strengthen the state sector, manifest results, and play a guiding role in the economy. Together with the state, the trade unions must create the conditions and an environment in which the nonstate economic elements can grow. They must actively contribute to expanding agriculture, building the new rural areas, and solidifying the worker-peasant-intellectual alliance in renovating building and defending the fatherland. The trade unions must give attention to protecting the interests of the workers and laborers and participate in formulating laws and policies related to laborers. They must actively participate, together with the state, in creating jobs and improving work conditions. The primary-level trade unions must, as the representative of the workers, sign collective labor agreements with the owners of the enterprises in accord with the laws and monitor the implementation of those agreements. They must discover and resolve the conflicts that arise between owners and laborers. The trade unions must launch the workers and laborers in a struggle against corruption and smuggling and actively contribute to building a strong party and administration. They must renovate propaganda and training, contribute to building a strong working class, and take the lead in renovating the country. They must promptly enter into a dialogue with and grasp the thoughts and attitudes of the workers and laborers and grasp the conflicts that have arisen because of the mechanisms and policies so that they can submit timely proposals to the party and state to resolve the conflicts. They must safeguard the interests of the country and laborers and contribute to maintaining political stability and social order. They must continue to renovate organization and improve the abilities and capabilities of the ranks of trade union cadres. They must adhere to the principle of democratic centralism in trade union organization and activities. They must vary the forms used to assemble the workers and laborers in the economic elements. Emphasis must be given to guiding and renovating primary-level trade union activities. Attention must be given to summarizing the practices and conducting theoretical studies on trade union activities in the new mechanism. Economic activities must be promoted, and additional financial sources must be created for trade union activities. Cooperation with foreign trade unions and international organizations must be strengthened and expanded. In the face of the many changes in the domestic and international situation, the Vietnamese working class has undergone profound changes. This shows that the Vietnamese working class is always sensitive to what is new and can adapt quickly to the new. But this class is still the most progressive production force. It adheres to the key material bases and controls the activities of all of society. Because of this, it still has the mission, and ability, to take the lead in the development of society. Thus, building a strong Vietnamese working class is a decisive matter for the renovation of the country. This is not an issue just for the trade unions. It is also a task for the entire political system and the responsibility of each cadre and party member.
