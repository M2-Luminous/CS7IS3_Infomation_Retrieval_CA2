Three Questions From Tskhinvali or the Trigger Has Not Been Pulled Yet...Russia Is Tired of Bearing Her Cross in the Transcaucasus. But There Are No Alternatives. Who Else?..."] [Text] It seems the world has already managed to forget about the events that occurred only two years ago in South Ossetia. The subject of war, as it relates to Georgia, has been enriched recently by the bloody war in Abkhazia and the battle with the Zviadists in western Georgia. Today, intensive negotiations are being conducted concerning regulation of the situation around Abkhazia, but the fate of South Ossetia continues to be merely a subject of academic discussions. Yet, the internal situation in the self-proclaimed republic is extremely difficult, and the reason for this is the uncertainty of its fate. This is understood quite well in Tskhinvali by practically everyone I was able to speak with. But destinies, including of this territory, are not decided in the capital. The recent Supreme Council elections of the South Ossetian Republic made it possible to form a leadership consisting of relatively moderate politicians. In a fairly short period of time, a number of high officials of South Ossetia repeatedly announced rather loudly the desirability and need to begin the negotiation process with Georgia. Either there was no answer from Tbilisi at all or it was interpreted as negative. Thus, the head of the Georgian state, Eduard Shevardnadze, having evaluated the new membership in the South Ossetian parliament as "people with whom one could work," subsequently stated that they did not recognize the elections or the Supreme Council as such. In Dagomys There Is an Elder, but What About Tskhinvali? In the agreements that, on Russia's initiative and with her direct participation, were signed on 24 June 1992 in Dagomys by the leaders of Georgia and approved by the leaders of South Ossetia and the Chairman of the Supreme Council of North Ossetia, the point about ceasefire, separating the opposing sides, and introducing peacekeeping forces into the zone of conflict was the major one but not the only one. The Dagomys agreements stipulated that compliance would be overseen by a specially created Mixed Oversight Commission (SKK) made up of representatives of Russia, Georgia, and North Ossetia. In the first stage of the activity, it turned out that a mechanism had been created that was fairly successful for such cases. The Mixed Oversight Commission handled many problems, including the then critical problem of releasing or exchanging prisoners of war and supplying the local population with food and fuel, and coordinated the operations for confiscating weapons from illegal armed formations. Unnoticed at first glance, but extremely important in the commission's activity today, is the fact that its decisions were reported to the high officials of Russia and Georgia, which made it possible to react promptly to the change in the situation. Approximately a year ago, the Mixed Oversight Commission quietly faded out of sight without leaving a trace. They are trying to keep track of and analyze the problems of the war torn land and its residents today through short inspection trips from Moscow and Tbilisi, and there is no system to these visits, just as so far there are no apparent results. In South Ossetia, any kind of news or rumor about an inspection spreads immediately, and the words of one of the secondary guests from the Russian Government to the effect that "out of every three rubles Russia will give Georgia, one is intended for South Ossetia" initially evoked euphoria. As always in such cases, the euphoria was quickly replaced by disenchantment because so far the republic has received neither money nor construction materials to restore the practically destroyed economy. Nobody in Tskhinvali believes the promises of Georgian visitors at all. The recently appointed minister of affairs of Shida Kartli (this--Inner Kartli--is what they call South Ossetia in Georgia), Vazha Khachapuridze, visits only the Georgian villages around Tskhinvali. And, those rare guests from Tbilisi who go to the actual capital of South Ossetia give various figures and dates. The last sum of a half billion was promised a month ago. At the same time, it must be recalled that almost a year and a half ago a special multilateral commission determined the sum of damages caused by the war to South Ossetia at R43 billion. At the exchange rate at that time, this was almost $25 million. Now it is half as much. But, even in the aforementioned Dagomys agreements, the Georgian leaders promised to pay for two-thirds of the damages. If one keeps in mind the current lamentable condition of the Georgian economy and its complete dependence on Russian aid, although it has not been received so far, one can draw the conclusion that the entire sum will lie on Russia's shoulders one way or another. The Russian-Georgian Border--Is It the Ossetia-Ossetian Border? In April of last year, the Russian parliament at the time adopted the Law on the State Border of the Russian Federation. The demarcation with the so-called nearby foreign countries was difficult, and the innocent bystander might be reminded of anything at all but a well-considered state policy. First, the Russian border guards were withdrawn from the Transcaucasus to the Northern Caucasus where it was decided to create new "boundaries of the Motherland." So, they organized the North Caucasian border district with a staff in Stavropol, which is far away even from the new boundaries. The development of the basic forces has proceeded in various ways. In some places, it has not occurred at all--for example, in the Chechen Republic, which according to the new Russian Constitution is a part of the Russian Federation. And, in some places, it has proceeded with enviable acceleration and the unenviable quality that traditionally corresponds to acceleration such as, for example, in North Ossetia. Border guards have had to be stationed in the republic, which has little land and many people and is already impossibly overloaded with troops. The traditional Caucasian hospitality can hardly compensate for the absence of the necessary quantity of barracks and staff premises or provide any apartments or even rooms in dormitories for officers. The second stage of the construction of the new Russian border led to a situation where now our border guards are again guarding the outer borders of the former USSR in the Transcaucasus. The only place they have not moved in yet is Azerbaijan. The name of the border district has also changed--it is now the Special Caucasian Border District. It turns out that the Russian Federation now has two concentric borders. And, there is a gaping hole in the nearer one--Chechnya. And, the border in North Ossetia is being reinforced in a planned way. One of Fazil Iskander's heroes could not understand at all-- is Abkhazia Adzharia or not. It is also difficult to understand in real life what the Russian Border Troops are guarding at the northern Russian portal of the Rokskiy Tunnel--the border between Russia and Georgia or between one Ossetia and the other. The state border that passes through the middle of the territory populated by just one ethnic group evokes no enthusiasm in either North or South Ossetia, but it is not causing any special protest either. From time to time. So far, the law on the border has not been fully enforced here, as, incidentally, is also the case in South Dagestan, on the land of the Lezgin people. With the border strip, the border regime, and special passes for local residents. In South Ossetia, even now, they think that the Russian post with the armored equipment at the entrance to the area was placed here to close off the border in the event of "special circumstances." And, border and customs control is carried out not here but several kilometers below, on the territory of North Ossetia, where its own border personnel are also located. Another paradox noted in connection with the border innovations is the implementation of the agreement on service in Russian border troops by citizens of sovereign states of Transcaucasia. This decision is rather strange in and of itself. But, there are cases where it obviously cannot work, and this apparently should be stipulated, especially at the high legislative or governmental level. Who, for example, should protect that same Rokskiy crossing from the South Ossetia side--citizens of this territory or recruits from Georgia? It is quite clear what could happen if it were the Georgians. After all, the residents of South Ossetia are afraid not only of closing the border in and of itself but of what could happen as a result of a new outburst of military activity. Which Is More Important--Moscow or the CSCE? After Russia's actual withdrawal from political participation in the South Ossetian fate and supervision of the implementation of the agreements that were reached with such difficulty, participants in the CSCE mission tried to fill this sacred position. It would seem that the fact of keeping peace is important in and of itself, and whoever ends up first here is not so important. But, as one can see from a brief acquaintance with the situation in South Ossetia and its environs, nobody can replace Russia in this region. And, it would even be strange to think otherwise. Such is the case with the CSCE as well. Periodically the CSCE in Tbilisi and Tskhinvali put forth various plans to begin the negotiating process, but the example of Abkhazia, which is appropriate in this case, shows one thing. Namely: None of the countries participating in the CSCE or the United Nations are ready to actually pay with money or the health of their subjects for the peace process in the outskirts of the former USSR. None of the great powers except for Russia, since it is the only one vitally interested in real peace along its nearby boundaries. And, in this region, Russia carries more weight than all the rest of the countries of the CSCE taken together. Without Russia's participation, obviously, the problem of South Ossetia is not likely to be solved. A member of the State Duma who visited South Ossetia recently, Aleksandr Dzasokhov, advised the chairman of parliament, Lyudvig Chibirov, without rejecting aid from the mission of the CSCE, still to place any real hopes in Moscow. It seems that only Moscow is capable of breathing life into the plans for beginning real Ossetian-Georgian regulation. Well, Russia was the initiator of the ceasefire, and she apparently will have to continue to bear her cross. Otherwise, the brief period of relative peace in South Ossetia could come to an end. Out of a flimsy peace, it is necessary to try to make a strong one.
