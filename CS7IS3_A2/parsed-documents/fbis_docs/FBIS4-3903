The report in The Sunday Times quoted Zhang Rongshun, from the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, saying that the future Special Administrative Region (SAR) government might restore the death penalty. But Zhang said: "I did not say there was such a possibility. I just said it was for the SAR government to decide whether there was a need to restore the death penalty in Hong Kong." Zhang Junsheng, the deputy director of the local office of the New China News Agency (Xinhua), agreed. "What he said means that it is a decision to be made by the SAR instead of the central government," Zhang Junsheng said. "Of course, it cannot be said that the death penalty can never be used in Hong Kong." Simon Li, a retired high court judge and leader of the legal sub- group of the Preliminary Working Committee, said the death penalty was not discussed by the PWC. "I personally don't think it really matters whether or not Hong Kong should have capital punishment after 1997," Li said yesterday.
