The announcement, which dealt with the Iranian commitments concerning increasing the financial, diplomatic, and media-related support provided by Tehran to this movement, was made during meetings that were held between Iranian leaders and a Hamas delegation currently visiting Iran, which is headed by Musa Abu-Marzuq, head of the movement's Political Bureau, and Ibrahim Ghawshah, its official spokesman. So far the delegation has held a series of meetings with high-ranking Iranian political, military, and security officials. In order to underscore Iran's determination to more effectively oppose the agreements concluded between the PLO and Israel, Iran's spiritual leader, 'Ali Khamene'i, also met with the Hamas delegation. It should be pointed out that Khamene'i, as of the last few weeks, has personally taken over the supervision of Iran's efforts to frustrate the peace process. Analysts are of the opinion that there are indications of the existence of differences in points of view between Iran and Hamas. In an interview given yesterday by Abu-Marzuq to the newspaper JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI, which is published by Khamene'i, the Hamas leader expressed his belief that the PLO and Israel would not be able to accomplish the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho by the 13 December deadline. Abu-Marzuq hinted that the agreement would fail because of the contradictions inherent in it. He also expected that U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's current mission to the Middle East would be a failure. The Hamas leader's point of view is close to that of Syria, which is that it is necessary to remain uninvolved in the agreement between the PLO and Israel and thus allow it to fail. However, Iran believes that it is necessary to take additional measures in order to guarantee that this agreement fail. These measures, according to statements by the Iranian media, should include escalation of the armed conflict and intensification of the intifadah. But Abu-Marzuq is apparently convinced that the agreement still has the support of the Palestinians and that any parties attempting to blow it up might thus be risking their political positions. Hamas leaders also affirm that it is necessary not to provide Israel and the PLO with a pretext for holding Hamas and other hard-line groups responsible for the "inevitable failure" of their agreements. In his interview, Abu-Marzuq said the plan for autonomy, no matter how limited, can never work as long as the Israeli settlers do not withdraw from the occupied territories. Khamene'i had decided to call for the holding of an international conference to be attended by the parties and nations opposed to the agreement. But he failed to obtain the support of Syria and the Palestinian groups for such a conference. Apparently the idea of forming a new "rejectionist front" has been delayed until next year. One of the reasons for the delay has been Syria's wish to bide its time in order to see what can be achieved by means of U.S. mediation. Another reason is the fact that the hard-line Palestinian groups believe that Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat, during the next few months, will exhaust his supply of good intentions and thus pave the way for the emergence of a new leadership that will be more of the hard-line type. The final reason is that the Arab hard-liners are reluctant to hand over the reins of control of an Arab issue to a non-Arab country, that is, Iran.
