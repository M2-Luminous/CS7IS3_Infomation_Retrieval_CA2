The Polish Information Agency has been distributing at the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg a publication entitled "Outlines of the History of the Polish State," in which the Vilnius area is included in Poland. The information and press department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that attention is drawn in the note to the fact that the distribution of such publications on the eve of the meeting of the Lithuanian and Polish presidents cannot but provoke a negative assessment by Lithuanian society and does not contribute to the consolidation of good relations between the two countries.
