[Lamers] It was a necessary and consistent step. Although Mr. Kinkel is, of course, right when he says that this was an isolated operation, I would like to point out that the measure is part of the policy NATO has pursued with its ultimatum in accordance with the United Nations, and, for example, also in accordance with the opening of the bridge in Sarajevo. [Meurer] Mr. Lamers, does this mean that by shooting down those aircraft this morning, NATO wanted to show that it was taking the ultimatum of last Monday [21 February] seriously? [Lamers] Yes, and NATO, first of all, wanted to demonstrate that the Serbs were wrong in thinking that they could make partial and regionally limited concessions -- limited to Sarajevo -- while continuing their activities and attacks elsewhere to create facts. I think that this is a most decisive point. Now it will depend on their reaction -- the reaction of the Serbs, which, incidentally, will essentially depend on the reaction of the Russians. The choice is one between cease-fire and really serious efforts for peace and escalation. [Meurer] What is the importance of the military flights, the flights by the Serbian Air Force, for the war in Bosnia? [Lamers] This question is difficult to answer. There have been innumerous violations of the no-fly decision. Still, if I see and interpret things correctly then the attack against the ammunition factory was a very serious escalation by the Serbian side, which is, of course, of significant importance, because the Muslims and the Croats do not have such heavy weapons, and, in particular, no aircraft. [Meurer] In connection with the NATO ultimatum, which called for withdrawing all heavy arms from around Sarajevo, there has been some controversy with Moscow, which did not really approve of NATO's policy. What reactions do you now expect from Moscow? [Lamers] The first reaction of which I have heard is moderate, and absolutely all right. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that if things really happened that way, if there really was a Serbian attack against the ammunition factory, then it was a violation of the UN resolution, and then NATO's reaction was O.K. I hope that this position will not change. There can be no doubt that this is also a test of the constructive nature of Russia's role in Sarajevo. That there are some question marks in this connection is obvious; I also have some doubts. I do, however, hope that the Russians will continue to react in the way that is now beginning to show -- I have to put that very cautiously -- otherwise it would be problematic -- beyond Bosnia -- for relations between Russia and the West.
