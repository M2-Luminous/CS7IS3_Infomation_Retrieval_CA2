After the 56-year-old Hosokawa abruptly offered to leave the helm of government on Friday, top executives of the seven-party coalition began moving to choose a candidate for the next premier at their caucus. However, two ruling party heads raised doubts about the procedure of picking a successor to Hosokawa and demanded that top leaders of the coalition parties decide on a new premier. Because of the demand, the coalition representatives' forum before noon Sunday suspended efforts to find a suitable figure to replace Hosokawa and left the rest up to their party bosses. Social Democratic Party (SDP) chairman Tomiichi Murayama subsequently proposed holding a meeting of the heads of the coalition forces at noon Monday to break the selection stalemate. But the offer met with a flat refusal from two major forces within the coalition, accentuating deep division among coalition partners. "There is a consensus that the caucus of the ruling parties is to discuss issues of mutual concern," Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) secretary general Ichiro Ozawa told reporters, explaining his party's rejection of SDP chief's offer. "If this is disregarded, it will be perceived as dictatorial," the main strategist of the coalition added. Ozawa also asserted that should heads of the SDP, the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and new party Sakigake (Harbinger) hold talks themselves on the choice of a candidate to succeed Hosokawa, it would constitute a private talk. Koji Morimoto, chairman of Komeito's Diet Affairs Committee, also told a news conference Sunday night that his party will not accept Murayama's proposal to hold a meeting of the coalition party heads on Monday at noon. Although the chairman of the SDP, the largest coalition contingent, had asked Hosokawa by telephone to call such a meeting under his authority, the departing head of government replied he is not in a position to do so because he has already offered to resign, Murayama said. Behind the growing division within the coalition, an alliance of parties spanning a wide political spectrum, is the question of which party or parties will take control of the next government, political analysts said. While Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata is widely considered the most likely candidate for the next premier, the SDP and Sakigake have been especially cautious about the choice, fearing it would allow Hata's Shinseito and its closest partner Komeito to take initiative within the coalition. The SDP, for its part, has said that its chairman, Murayama, is also qualified for the premiership, though not clearly stating the party will field him as a candidate to succeed Hosokawa. Meanwhile, a move to reorganize the current framework of the coalition has been growing. Although the Shinseito-Komeito bloc wants to see Hata, who doubles as deputy prime minister, to be picked as Hosokawa's successor, it is also considering fielding former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe of the primary opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) as a candidate for the premiership. If Watanabe defects from the now-deposed party and agrees to run for the highest government office with the backing of Shinseito, Komeito and other coalition forces, the SDP, whose basic policies are still way apart from those of its coalition partners, is expected to get the boot. On Sunday, Watanabe signaled his readiness to bolt from the LDP and join hands with all or portions of the coalition if there is a comfortable number of LDP members to leave the party with him. During Hosokawa's eight months in office, the SDP has often put the coalition on the spot due to its policy differences with other coalition members over such issues as political reform, the partial opening of Japan's rice market and tax system reform. The party, along with Sakigake, also hampered Hosokawa's bid to revamp his cabinet in protest against his apparent intention to sack Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Sakigake is scheduled to hammer out an outline to form a new government on Monday and likely to begin seeking a tie-up with pro- reformers within the LDP. Sakigake is a splinter party of the LDP, which was toppled from power last August after 38 years of uninterrupted rule. LDP president Yohei Kono also called on Sunday for the establishment of a new coalition government by uniting conservatives and liberals with his party as the core. Kono did not deny the possibility of the LDP tying up with the SDP but brushed aside speculation that Watanabe will quit his party to join other forces.
