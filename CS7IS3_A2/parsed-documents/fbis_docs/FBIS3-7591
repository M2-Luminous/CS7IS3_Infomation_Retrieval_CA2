Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's plan to establish a policy study group of coalition legislators as the launching pad for a new party was shelved after the scheme threatened to topple the fractious coalition. Policy-making executives of the coalition partners set a meeting of representatives on Monday for improving soured relations among the coalition partners after the plan drew criticism from two of the seven ruling parties, the Social Democratic Party [SDP] and new party Sakigake [Harbinger]. The plan was being ambitiously pursued by Hosokawa, along with the coalition's two strategists Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], and Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of the Buddhist-backed Komeito [Clean Government Party]. The study group would have set the stage for merging the seven coalition parties into a single party with possible participation by some members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. The coalition partners who had pushed for the plan pointed the need for closer policy coordination among the members. Ichikawa, speaking at a meeting of Komeito legislators Wednesday, said, "There still remains the need to enhance the sense of policy unification among the coalition partners." "There will be no cooperation over elections without unity on policy," he said. Shinseito's deputy secretary general, Kozo Watanabe, who spoke at a meeting of party executives the same day, called for a grouping that everybody can join freely. "We need to cooperate toward creating a united party," he said. Takashi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic Socialist Party (DSP), also a coalition partner, joined the chorus of calls for continued efforts toward creating a new party. Yonezawa said the DSP should play an active role along with Hosokawa's Japan New Party and Sakigake in establishing a forum for discussing policy coordination in view of fielding joint candidates in coming national elections under the new election system. The move toward a new party was accelerated after Hosokawa pushed through a political reform package in January, replacing multi-seat districts with single-seat constituencies in general election for the House of Representatives. But the initiatives by Hosokawa, Ozawa and Ichikawa have met strong antagonism from the SDP, the largest bloc in the coalition, and new party Sakigake led by Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Koken Nosaka, chairman of the SDP's Diet Affairs Committee, said at the meeting of top coalition officials that making participation in the proposed study group preconditioned on supporting joint coalition candidates for elections could lead to a split in the coalition. Meanwhile, Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent member of the House of Representatives, who has been a major proponent for the scheme, said at a press conference that the plan for an interparty study group is still alive. He said he wants to start a preparatory committee for the group by the end of April. But a senior Komeito member said, "The situation is already beyond the power of Mr. Yamaguchi."
