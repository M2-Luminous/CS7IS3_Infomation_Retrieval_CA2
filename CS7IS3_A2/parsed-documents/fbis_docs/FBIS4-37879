My name is 'Ali Reza Rahmani, alias Hamid Reza'i. I was a member of one of the operational teams of the Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO]. I was sent into the country in order to place a bomb in Mashhad. I have been in prison for the last 20 months. Although I had given all the information I had, I was not prepared to take part in a television interview. However, following the recent crime carried out by the grouplet in the shrine of the eighth imam, I announced my readiness to take part in a television interview. I have two motives for this interview: First, to expose the antihuman nature of this evil grouplet; and second, to give a message to people like myself who have become puppets in the hands of this grouplet. [video of bombed shrine] After I left this country I was arrested by Iraqi intelligence and taken to prison. After interrogation in the Iraqi intelligence prisons, I announced that I entered Iraq from Iran in order to join the organization [MKO] and I provided them with the specific code. After giving them the specific code and other codes, the intelligence officers arranged a meeting between me and the leadership of the organization, who were in touch with Iraqi intelligence. I met Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh Yeganeh. At this meeting I gave the code and specifications I had, and managed to gain their trust. It became clear that I was one of the organization's supporters inside the country. After I was fully recognized, Mehdi Bara'i and Fereshteh Yeganeh sent me to the MKO camp, called Ashraf, which is near Baghdad. We were housed inside U-shaped buildings inside the camp. We were separated from other members of the organization. During this time, we received training in the use of colts, grenades, bombs, and destruction, and in weapons' recognition. Those directly responsible for this training were Fereshteh Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, Mehdi Madavi, and Sa'id. The single and group combat training took three months. At the end of the training period they put on certain ceremonies for us, called arming ceremonies. During these ceremonies, Pari Yusofi, representing the MKO leadership, read a message. The text of the message was: You are the best group of home headquarters [setad-e dakheleh] inside the country. You will be our vanguards inside the country. We hope that you will carry out your operations successfully. Yours, your brother Mas'ud. At the end of the ceremonies, the next day, we were divided into 16 groups. Each group consisted of two people. Each group was prepared for operations inside the country. We were the third group, which was dispatched into the country. The group I was in comprised of myself and Mohammad Javad, and because of the sensitivity of the task....[pauses] I mentioned that I was dispatched on a mission in Mashhad. Because of the sensitivity and worry that the organization had concerning that mission they separated us from the rest, and all the programs and explanations that we had were carried out separately and in total secrecy. My immediate briefing officer was Mehdi Bara'i, Fereshteh Yeganeh, Nasrin Berenji, and Sa'id. Fahimeh Arvani had direct supervision. For seven days we were in a building that was separate from the rest. During those seven days we learned more about the methods of bomb placement, methods for placing bombs, methods of reconnoitering the area and finding out about routes and traffic. And, in general, the buildings I was supposed to bomb were the municipality in Mashhad, the Justice Department in Mashhad, and the area near the Imam's courtyard in the immaculate shrine. Those were demonstrated to me on models. The places I had to bomb were all pointed out to me. I was briefed by maps. At that time I used to think that for the sake of the success of the organization any tasks must be carried out. Essentially I never thought that by placing a bomb in the municipality or the shrine or the Justice Department that some innocent people would be killed. After the briefings -- which I received from Mehdi Bara'i and Sa'id -- ended, Maryam Rajavi met me directly. At that meeting she once again reminded me of Mas'ud's message, and wished me success in my missions. She told me: When you complete your mission and return we will put resources and complete welfare facilities at your disposal here. We will even send you outside the country -- outside Iraq -- to study if you wish. And a series of empty promises. That night, after the end of the ceremony and the talks, we were briefed by 'Ali Shiraz about the route that we were to take into the country. 'Ali Shiraz was the head of the dispatch team responsible for dispatching forces into the country. On the map placed on the table he clearly briefed us on the route we were to take. Later, Mehdi Bara'i gave me three packages of cooking oil, which contained explosives and bombs, and said they are to be taken for operations at designated places. They gave me cyanide tablets and said I should not be arrested alive and that I should commit suicide if I felt in danger. They also gave me false identity cards to help me on the trip. We started off the following morning and were accompanied by 'Ali Shiraz, 'Ali Abolfathi, Hassan, and Sa'id. Coordination had been made with Iraqi posts along the way and we travelled from Baghdad to an area near the Qasr-Shirin border with no difficulty. We even changed cars at the Iraqi posts and received equipment. Finally we reached the Qalavand post, which is next to Naftshar on the Iraq border. With the cooperation of Iraqi officers there we used long-distance binoculars in the observation post to study the route we were to take. The dangerous points and Iranian posts were studied and noted. We were again and finally briefed by 'Ali Shiraz about the map. At night, Mohammad Javad, 'Ali Abolfathi, and Hassan and I started off on the designated route. We entered our own country, with the aim of placing our bombs in the designated areas once we reached our objectives, and we would carry out our mission in the best possible way and please our masters. I was arrested before I could reach Tehran. And in prison I learned that my team mate, Mohammad Javad, had been killed by his own bomb in Naser-Khosrow Street [in Tehran], while he was preparing it. Out of eight teams dispatched to the country, 14 persons were arrested, one was killed, and one escaped. [Correspondent] Mr. Rahmani, the question here is, why did you choose Mashhad to carry out the operation? [Rahmani] At the time, in 1371 [year starting 21 March 1992] Mashhad witnessed a lot of unrest. That was why the organization paid particular attention to Mashhad. As they said themselves, another commotion; uproar had to be created in Mashhad again. That was why they offered Mashhad to me. They offered areas to me; after 20 months in prison I now realize just how many innocent people would have been killed if I had exploded a bomb in the municipality or the Justice Department. [video shows crowds shown chanting: "Death to the MKO;" "Death to the Shameless MKO;" "Death to America." Crowd begins to repeat chants after a chant leader: "This is proof of America's crime;" "The Plot of the Shameless MKO;" "Where have these petals come from; they have come from the immaculate shrine of Imam Reza."] [Correspondent] You pointed out that you were to place the bomb in holy Mashhad and at the holy shrine of His Eminence Imam Reza, peace be upon him. Why was this place chosen? [Rahmani] Basically the aim of the organization in sending me to Mashhad and placing bombs in places I mentioned was because the places were crowded. The main aim of the organization was to explode the bomb in crowded places. It was emphasised to me to place the bomb in the municipality when the mayor was present, when the municipality would be the most crowded. As an answer to your question: The organization chose them simply because they were crowded. [Correspondent] As you say yourself, the municipality and the holy shrine of His Eminence Imam Reza are crowded places. What was your motive? [Rahmani] The atmosphere and the misguidance was such that I imagined everything was possible. Even killing and massacring people seemed normal to me. I was prepared to do anything to better present myself to my responsible officers and masters. I thought that the organization was all important. It was my father, mother and sister. There was misguided propaganda. They even told me that if I was arrested I would have boiling water poured over my body and I would be flogged. However, since the time of my arrest not the slightest disrespect has been shown toward me. I was under the influence of emotions and did not know what I was doing. Finally, I ask for the forgiveness of the martyrdom-rearing nation and the leader of the Islamic revolution. I can only say that I am sorry.
