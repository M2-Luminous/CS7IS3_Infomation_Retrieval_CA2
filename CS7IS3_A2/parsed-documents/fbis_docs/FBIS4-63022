We have established why the editorial office has not received the official text of the Russian Federation president's edict. It was explained to us at the relevant President's Staff organs that our newspaper was not on the distribution list for this document. Unfortunately, this is not the first instance of the editorial office's failing to receive certain official documents. We would like to recall once again that a procedure has been laid down whereby publication of Russian Federation presidential and government acts in ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA is an official basis for the documents' coming into force. Just which negligent civil servants should be reminded of this?
