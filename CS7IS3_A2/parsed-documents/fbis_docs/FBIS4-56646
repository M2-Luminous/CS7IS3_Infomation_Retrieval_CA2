FBIS4-56646 "drlat088_t_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-088 Daily Report 4 May 1994 Venezuela Banking Leader Says Exchange Market Controlled Banking Leader Says Exchange Market Controlled PA0505150694 Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 1100 GMT 4 May 94 PA0505150694 Caracas Union Radio Network Spanish BFN [Report by Vicente Briceno from Miraflores Palace for the "Union Radio News" newscast -- live] [Text] The situation recently provoked by the abrupt increase in the dollar's price, from 118 to 127 bolivares, prompted a meeting between President Rafael Caldera; Jose Bouza Izquierdo, chairman of the National Banking Council; and Berend Roosen, commissioner for financial reforms; as well as Andres Caldera, minister of the Presidency Secretariat, and Ciro Anez Fonseca, minister of agriculture and livestock. The well-known banker attributed Friday's decrease in the rhythm of the devaluation, from 5 percent to 2.5 percent, to actions that were coordinated by the Central Bank of Venezuela and private banks. This has managed to positively control the dollar's exchange rate which has prevailed since last week. [Begin Bouza Izquierdo recording] Nothing new or different is happening. The government has just ratified one more time that a foreign exchange control or a maxi-devaluation are not part of our current plans. I believe this is enough to believe we do not have to rush out and buy foreign currency with anguish, under pressure, or with nervousness. In fact, this only pushes the price upward and people who go to the parallel market will pay amounts that far exceed the foreign currency's real value. The banks are within the limitations that are characteristic of the operations we carry out, supplying the foreign currency that the Central Bank of Venezuela passes on to us. Our actions are within an absolutely regular scheme. I do not think we should feel concerned or nervous. That will only worsen the situation. [end recording]
