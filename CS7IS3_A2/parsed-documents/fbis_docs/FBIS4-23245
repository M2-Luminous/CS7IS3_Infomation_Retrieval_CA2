The new CFA franc will equal 100 current CFA francs and, since it will have the same value as the French franc, a single currency will circulate within the franc zone. It will be a simple solution. The move will clearly show that the CFA franc, even if devalued, remains resolutely attached to the French franc. Also it will show that the January devaluation is definitely the last one. The objective is to prevent any further devaluation of the CFA down the line and give additional support to the operation launched at the beginning of the year.
