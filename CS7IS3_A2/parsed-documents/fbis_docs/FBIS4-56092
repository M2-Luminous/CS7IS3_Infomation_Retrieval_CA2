Szilveszter Varga reports: [Varga] The drafts coming before the Paris stability conference do not meet the demands and the situation of the Democratic Community of Hungarians in Vojvodina [VMDK], Andras Agoston [VMDK chairman] said in his interview to Hungarian Radio. The VMDK chairman added that the other minorities probably have a similar standpoint. Asked what chances there are for dialogue between Hungary and Yugoslavia, in harmony with the assumption of bilateral relations -- which is being urged by the French -- Agoston said the following: [Begin Agoston recording] In view of the fact that the text itself, which is now on the agenda, says that those who want to enter Europe must sign this stability agreement, I hope that the taking up of Hungarian-Serb relations will be possible in this matter as well. A Hungarian-Serb dialogue could evolve between the countries as well. At the same time, I consider it important to stress here too that we should take part with an appropriate role in this dialogue, since in the course of the discussions it is us that they will be talking about. I think that in the coming period this taking up of contacts, of dialogue, will get under way, both between the Hungarian community and the Serb -- or Yugoslav -- government, and between the two governments. [end recording] [Varga] In answer to the same question, Momcilo Grubac, former minister of minority and human rights of the Panic government, replied that discussions between neighboring countries, where bilateral agreements should also be concluded, are useful, but that much more important is the internal political aspect of this issue, in other words, whether dialogue evolves between the powers that be and the minorities, because it depends on this dialogue how great will be the harmony between the neighboring countries.
