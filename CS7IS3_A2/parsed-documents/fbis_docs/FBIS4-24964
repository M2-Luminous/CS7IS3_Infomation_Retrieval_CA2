Addressing the inaugural meeting, the premier said that the founding of the CAE is a major event in the scientific, technological and engineering communities and of great significance for China's socialist modernization drive. He lauded the great contributions the Chinese technological and engineering communities have made to the country's economic construction and national defence since the founding of New China in 1949. Li pointed out that China has done a good job in many fields of engineering and technology and trained large numbers of outstanding workers in science and technology. For this reason, the premier said, the founding of the CAE, with outstanding experts in technological communities as its mainstay, will have a far-reaching impact on improving their social status, on arousing their enthusiasm and on stepping up the country's development of engineering technology. Li noted that the CAE is most honorable, consultative academic organ in China's engineering communities. He hoped that the CAE, entrusted by the central government, will give advice and suggestions on the state's major scientific and technological projects and programs, and on research and studies on major development issues. He also hoped the CAE will make active contributions to implementing the government's policies and principles on the work of science and technology, and to academic exchanges and cooperation at home and abroad. To further facilitate international exchanges and embody the authoritative and honorary status of the CAS membership system founded in 1955, the State Council decided to grant the CAS members the official title of "academicians", which is an international practice, while the academicians system will be carried out in the CAE, the premier said. He said the first batch of foreign academicians of the CAS is expected to be selected during the meeting. Li said the concept of "science and technology is the first productive force" put forward by Deng Xiaoping, should be carried out unswervingly throughout the whole course of the socialist modernization drive. He said that attention should be paid to three things: science and technology serving the country's economic construction, developing the high-tech industries and strengthening the basic studies. The premier also highlighted the aim of reform of scientific and technological system as the establishment of a new system that suits the development of a socialist market economy, accords with the law of science and builds a close tie between science and technology and economy. Talking about the international competition in science and technology, Li said that the CAE and CAS, the country's two top scientific bodies, should coordinate closely to make greater contributions to the country's modernization drive. He also urged the government and party leaders at all levels to take more care of the work and life of scientists and technical workers.
