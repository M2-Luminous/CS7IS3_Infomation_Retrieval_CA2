BELAPAN has learned that two key issues -- a summer treatment program for working people and their children and an increase in the minimum wage -- were discussed. In particular, it was stated that the government allocated 120 billion rubles [R] to treat those who suffered from the Chernobyl tragedy's aftermath. However, this money will cover treatment for only 15 percent of all those who actually need it. The Gomel Oblast Trade Union Council sent an open letter to Belarusian Prime Minister Vyachaslaw Kebich presenting the statistics regarding Gomel Oblast residents who badly need this treatment. The participants in the FPB session also raised the issue of increasing the minimum wage. According to the trilateral general agreement -- signed by the government, trade unions, and the Association of Employers -- the divergencies between indexes of a minimum consumer budget and a minimum wage should not exceed 27 percent. According to FPB experts's estimates, the minimum consumer budget (in June 1994 prices) will stand at R160,000 (currently, it is R60,000). All these issues will be raised at the session of the Conciliatory Council of the Republic of Belarus, which includes representatives from the government, the FPB, and the Association of Employers.
