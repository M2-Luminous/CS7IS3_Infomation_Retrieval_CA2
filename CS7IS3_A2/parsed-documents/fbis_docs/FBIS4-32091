Although the former CSFR made use of the possibility of asking the United Nations for partial compensation of the damage, along with Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Ukraine, its negotiations with the UN Security Council have not produced any results. "In view of the UN's difficult financial situation, the possibilities of compensation must be assessed realistically," Klaus states. Losses in the sphere of foreign trade amount to $259.4 million. Of this sum, $190 million (Kc5.7 billion) are foreign trade enterprises' claims in former Yugoslavia. The loss of another $69.4 million (Kc2.1 billion) is due to the failure by the republics of former Yugoslavia to cover their debt stemming from the clearing account between former Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic. One-off damages suffered by organizations of the Ministry of Industry and Trade amount to $17 million (Kc510 million). They result from nonliquid company claims and the costs associated with the halting, owing to the UN sanctions, of some planned deliveries to former Yugoslavia, work on which had already started. Damage in the sphere of transportation represents Kc82.9 million, of which some Kc80 million is accounted for by the loss of fees in railway transportation for transit from former Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the Czech Republic profits from the fact that civilian aircraft are banned from flying over the territory of Serbia and Montenegro and use international air routes over the territory of our Republic, for which they pay overflight fees. Losses incurred from the stricter regime for transit of natural gas to Croatia and Slovenia have been estimated at $13.7 million.
