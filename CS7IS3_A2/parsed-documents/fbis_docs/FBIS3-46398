It cannot be mentioned in the same breath as the JLG. During the interview, which lasted an hour or so, Davis revealed that after two months of consultations, the Chinese side has agreed to discuss with the British side the draft regulations on the Airport Corporation. At the next experts meeting of the defense and security group, Davis was quite confident that the Stonecutter's Navy base issue will be resolved. But he also admitted that it was a mistake that the agreement reached between China and Britain on the Court of Final Appeal had not won the support of Hong Kong's Legislative Council [Legco]. However, such things often happened under a democratic system. JLG Carrying Out "Underwater Activities" Sino-British relations have become strained due to the dispute over Hong Kong's political structure. It can be said that the JLG is the only British organ in contact with the Chinese side at present. But recently, the Chinese side has made active preparations for setting up a second stove--the PWC. The work and matters discussed by the PWC are almost the same as those of the JLG. Has the JLG changed its functions then? Davis admitted that the work of the JLG has progressed slowly. According to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the JLG's function is to serve as a channel for communications between China and Britain. However, the PWC is only a research organ offering opinions to the Chinese side on matters affecting Hong Kong. Therefore, both cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Davis emphasized that several international agreements, which had nothing to do with major issues, were adopted by the JLG at its 28th meeting last December. The Chinese representative told him that because of the political reform issue, it was hard for the meeting to make any progress. He described Sino-British relations at that time as being at the "tip of the iceberg." Even so, the JLG had still carried out some "underwater" activities. Guo Fengmin Was Informed of the Allocation of Funds for the Airport on 15 December Referring to the new airport issue, Davis said he did not understand why the PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman said the day before yesterday that there had been no diplomatic contacts between China and Britain on this issue. He said that on 15 December last year, he had personally informed Guo Fengmin of the airport fund allocation scheme, and, 10 days ago, Alan Paul, a member of the British side, had also presented a Legco document on the plan to the Chinese side, hoping that the Chinese side would discuss the issue with the British side or give its opinions. Even this week, he had also made telephone calls to the other side time and again, but the latter did not give a definite reply. The Chinese Side Hints that a Meeting of the Airport Committee May Be Held in March Davis said he did not know when the airport committee meeting could be held, but disclosed that the Chinese side had agreed to discuss the draft airport regulations with the British side after a two-month consultation period. This indicates that the meeting could possibly be held in March. However, are the differences between both sides too big to reach any agreement on the airport issue? Davis did not think so. He stressed that in any talks, there is room for both sides to take flexible measures. Therefore, the possibility that both sides may change their stand should not be ruled out. The most important thing is for the Chinese side to sit down and talk. When asked whether this indicated that the British side might make concessions on this issue, Davis said it was unwise to say that one would make concessions before sitting at the negotiating table. The Hong Kong Government will submit a bill on the Court of Final Appeal to Legco. An agreement has already been reached by the JLG on this bill, but it will not win the support of Legco and other legal institutions. When asked whether this had been erroneous assessment by the British side, Davis admitted that it had been a mistake. However, the possibility of a similar occurrence in the future could not be ruled out, he said. He explained that under a democratic system, the orientation of the administrative authority can not definitely be endorsed by the legislative organ and the intentions of the Legislative Council could not be clearly foreseen. Although the British side believed that the agreement was not the best one and had told the Chinese side this, under a situation where the Chinese side was willing to talk, this was the only choice. In the end, however, the matter should still be decided by Legco. On the issue of the definition of a permanent resident, which the Hong Kong people are worried about at present, Davis said this was a complicated and difficult issue. He was glad to see that the Chinese side had attached increasing importance to this issue recently. He also said that both sides have agreed in principle that Laurence M. Y. Leung, director of the Immigration Department, will pay a visit to China. But the timing of his trip had not been decided. So far, no response to this had been received. Although certain headway has been made in the last few rounds of meetings on the issue of the Stonecutter's Island navy base, which were held by the defense and security groups under the JLG, no agreement had yet been reached. However, Davis said an experts' meeting would be held very soon. If things go on smoothly, he was quite confident that an agreement would be reached. Both sides would bring their seals to the next meeting and be ready to sign the agreement. When asked why he was so sure of this, Davis refused to give further details. He also refused to admit whether the British side had made any concessions on the size of the future Stonecutter's base for the People's Liberation Army. He only stressed that both China and Britain had the common intention of reaching an agreement. Realizing Importance of Patience After Four Months in His New Post Having been in his new post for four months, Davis said he was still at a learning stage. His predecessor, Anthony Galsworthy, had advised him to be "patient." Now he had begun to realize the importance of being "patient." After taking up his new job, he also discovered the seriousness of his responsibilities, which have a bearing on the smooth transition of Hong Kong in the future. The only thing that had disappointed him was the slow progress of the JLG's work. He said he would feel distressed if things continued to go on like this.
