[Begin Joseph recording, in Creole] Certain solutions that have been proposed are supported by some sectors. I can put myself in the shoes of the private sector. I very much doubt that the private sector would have an interest in supporting the implementation of Art. 149. This is also my private position. Personally, I think the country is not ready to face the political and financial consequences of the implementation of Art. 149.
