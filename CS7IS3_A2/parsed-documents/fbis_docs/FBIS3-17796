Speaking before the newly elected parliament Tuesday, he said society expected the new legislature to ensure further development and strengthening of the state in the interests of all its citizens, regardless of their origin or faith. Snegur pointed out that various political forces had appeared on Moldova's political scene after the collapse of totalitarian rule. At the moment, they are divided into supporters of strengthening Moldova's statehood and independence, supporters of the unification with Romania and supporters of the republic's return to a reborn empire. In the meantime, the Moldovan people firmly supported Moldova's development as an independent democratic state at the sociological poll on 6 March, Snegur said. The outcomes of the poll must be law for everyone, he said pointing out that "a state cannot be built on the basis of an idea which splits and polarizes society." Snegur pointed to the top priority of such goals as the adoption of a new constitution, preservation of Moldova's territorial integrity, resolution of the issues of Transdniester and Gagauz-populated areas, democratization of society and enhancing economic reforms. Snegur also proposed a special law be adopted against insulting Moldova as a state.
