Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia, State Duma deputy and head of administration in Shakhovskoy rayon [Moscow oblast], has been appointed a member of the Russian Government. The relevant decree, INTERFAX reports, was signed by President Yeltsin. Travkin's range of duties is not specified. Here is what Travkin himself had to say when interviewed by our correspondent: [Begin Travkin recording] A consideration ever since 1992 and the start of the reforms has been how to communicate between the grassroots level, where the reforms take hold, and the level where they are planned, conceived and designed, and how to speed up the possibility of making adjustments and having direct contacts between the rayon and the government so that it is possible to respond promptly. It is in this connection that I have been made a member of the government, but it is as minister without portfolio. [end recording] Nikolay Travkin did not rule out the possibility that the heads of administration of other rayons would also be brought into the government. However, it is necessary here, Travkin said, to consider what the government will gain by this. Indeed, Shakhovskoy rayon has shown in practice its approach to reforms, and only in similar cases can the heads of other administrations count on receiving government portfolios, Nikolay Travkin emphasized.
