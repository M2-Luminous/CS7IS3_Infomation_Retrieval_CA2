FBIS4-2765 "drchi071_n_94011" FBIS-CHI-94-071 Daily Report 12 Apr 1994 Economic & Agricultural First Quarter Onshore Oil Production Up `Slightly' First Quarter Onshore Oil Production Up `Slightly' OW1204161394 Beijing XINHUA in English 1459 GMT 12 Apr 94 OW1204161394 Beijing XINHUA English BFN [Text] Beijing, April 12 (XINHUA) -- China produced more than 34 million tons of onshore oil in the first quarter of this year, slightly higher than a year ago. "This production makes up 24.7 percent of the projected total for the whole year," said an official from the China Oil and Gas Corporation, which is responsible for onshore oil exploration, development and production across China. Oil production in the first quarter used to be lower than the following quarters because of the holidays and the commencement of construction of new oil wells, the official explained. Considering this, he added, this year's figure is "really better than expected." He said that the stabilized production in the oil fields in eastern China and the increasing oil output in western China, were the "two contributing factors." In eastern China, oil output was maintained at the level of the fourth quarter of last year in spite of even greater difficulties in extracting oil from mature fields, he said. The methods of controlling water cut and confining oil deposits and the techniques of tertiary oil extraction have been used in Daqing and Shengli oil fields to avoid output fluctuation. Oil exploration was intensified at the same time, the official said. He disclosed that oil production in western China, including the Tarim Basin, was up 13.2 percent from the same period last year. There also appeared improvement in crude transportation toward the eastern region, thanks to coordinating efforts. China's onshore natural gas production in the first quarter was registered at 3.9 billion cubic meters, 25.4 percent of the planned total for this year. Challenged by growing demand for oil because of rapid economic growth, China's oil industry has worked out the strategy of "stabilizing oil production in eastern China while developing western China." More efforts were called for earlier this year to maintain oil output in mature fields at the level of 124 million tons each year in the three years to come. On this basis, oil output in western China will be markedly increased. According to the China Oil and Gas Corporation, China onshore oil production is targeted at 140 million tons and that of natural gas 16 billion cubic meters this year. As long as oil production keeps up the trend set by the first quarter, predicted an official, these targets are likely to be reached.
