The 2,800-plus deputies from all corners of China converged in the Great Hall of the People a half hour before the opening. When XINHUA reporters made a survey among 50 deputies, 30 considered economic development and reform the most important issue. In a government work report delivered today, Premier Li Peng devoted the longest parts to the principles governing China's economic work and arrangements to ensure substantial progress of the economic restructuring. Therefore, what the deputies are concerned about coincides with the priority of the government work. Other issues the deputies are interested in include the reform of the state-owned enterprises, protection of peasants' interests, development of ethnic minority areas, prices and social order. Though they touch upon many issues of common concern, deputies from different regions, industries and circles pay attention to different specific issues. For instance, entrepreneur deputies, without exception, focus on establishment of a modern enterprise system -- an important part of the economic reform this year; and peasant deputies generally stress development of rural economy and protection of peasants' interests. Four mayors surveyed said that they will try their best to handle well relations among reform, development and stability. This shows that the local executives pay more attention to the overall situation. Yue Qifeng, governor of Liaoning Province, said what he is concerned most is to invigorate the state-owned enterprises. Liaoning is China's leading heavy-industrial center with 1,200 big and medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Xie Shijie, secretary of the Sichuan provincial committee of the Chinese Communist Party, said he concentrates his attention to boosting peasants' income, as Sichuan is the biggest agricultural province in China. Li Yukun, deputy director of the Rugao Silk Carpet Factory in Jiangsu Province, said he is interested in reform of the foreign trade system because his factory manufactures carpets for export. Gesang Quje, a Tibetan and living Buddha from Qinghai Province, voiced his hope for prosperity of ethnic minority areas and stable state religious policy. Zhang Shan, the Barcelona Olympic skeet champion, and Song Shixiong, a noted Chinese sports commentator, concentrate their attention on development of China's sports and physical culture. As China will carry out an all-round economic reform and make breakthroughs in key fields this year, the interests structure will be further readjusted. Therefore, people are concerned with various major reform measures raised by the Chinese Government, from different perspectives. The deputies will earnestly deliberate the government work report, air their views and put forward suggestions at the current session.
