The participants in the congress also approved party statutes and the program of this extraparliamentary party. In the adopted documents, the Socialists have subscribed to the traditions of the CSS since 1897 when the CSS' predecessor "was born of the will of nationally and socially minded workers." However, the status of legal successor to the pre-November CSS was also claimed by Hirs' Liberal National Social Party [LSNS] when it was founded in May 1993. Unlike the present CSS, the LSNS emphasizes the tradition of Benes' National Social Party.
