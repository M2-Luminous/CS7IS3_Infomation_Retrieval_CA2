According to the Ministry of Forestry, the country has afforested 9.6 million ha by aerial seeding during the past 12 years, exceeding the total of the previous 23 years. The country's average survival rate under aerial seeding has increased by 22 percent in the same period. At present, a large-scale aerial seeding has been conducted in 700 counties of the country's 25 provinces and autonomous regions. Aerial seeding has been further expanded northward, becoming the world's first success in aerial seeding in areas with annual precipitation lower than 100 mm. Aerial seeding has also proven fruitful in northern China's sandy land and deserts as well as in some freezing high altitude areas in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Seeds of various broadleaf trees and arbors have been used in aerial seeding instead of the original single type. Thanks to the principle of spreading the operation in conjunction with experiments, aerial seeding techniques have been implemented quickly and effectively in many barren or sandy areas beset by windstorms, sandstorms and serious soil erosion. Statistics show that aerial seeding has saved the country's ten percent of sandy land from the invasion of deserts with 40,000 sq k of barren land now covered with trees. Aerial seeding has played an important role in afforestation in north China's shelterbelt project, known as Great Green Wall. A stretch of 540,000 ha of forest has brought green to sandy areas in northwest, north and northeast China through aerial seeding. Aerial seeding not only makes the afforestation possible in remote high or stony mountains and deserts but also surpasses manual afforestation with lower costs, minimal labor demands, higher speed, larger scale and higher survival rate. To better conduct aerial seeding, the central government earmarks large amounts of funds each year for the project. Permanent stations have been set up for tree management and protection work in provinces where regular aerial seeding is conducted. China airlines and the air unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have both actively supported the aerial seeding activity all over the country. China's aerial seeding has taken the lead in the world in both efficiency and technology and has attracted experts from more than 40 countries and regions of the world and from international organizations.
