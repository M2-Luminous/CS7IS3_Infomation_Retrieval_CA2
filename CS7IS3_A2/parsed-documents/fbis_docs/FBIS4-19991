FBIS4-19991 "drweu080__a94009" FBIS-WEU-94-080-A Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 ANNEX United Kingdom CIS Seen Hinting at `Countervailing Alliance' CIS Seen Hinting at `Countervailing Alliance' PM1904130294 London THE GUARDIAN in English 19 Apr 94 p 25--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY PM1904130294 London THE GUARDIAN English BFN [Editorial: "Troops and Dollars"] [Text] The signals are utterly, maybe disastrously, mixed. On the one hand -- after last week's meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States -- we see the beginnings of a "defensive union" which edges Russia still further from the Partnership For Peace that NATO half-heartedly offered. There is, here, the beginning of a countervailing alliance which, if the documents as duly signed have reality, will one day put Russian troops on the borders of Iran, Turkey and Poland. Meanwhile (the other hand) we're poised tomorrow for final International Monetary Fund approval of a $1.5 billion loan deal with Russia -- the breaking of the long log-jam to reform. This loan -- tiny though it is -- could pave the way for the next ($4.1 billion) tranche of the $28 billion announced long ago by the Group of Seven -- but never authorised. The Russian economy is still in an apocalyptic condition. The monthly rate of inflation has fallen from 22 per cent in January to 9 per cent in March as a result of the new-found stringency of the central bank, but industrial output fell 24 per cent in the year to the first quarter of 1994 after a 21 per cent contraction in 1992. These figures may exaggerate the scale of decline. Some of the lost output may have been worthless and the output of the fledgling private sector may have been underestimated; but, after all the excuses, it still leaves a huge hole at the centre of the economy. The stoicism of the Russian people may be legendary, but it is not inexhaustible. Economic erosion of this order can't go on for much longer without extremely serious social consequences. Such statistics paint a bleak backdrop to this week's annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development [EBRD] in St Petersburg. The EBRD, set up to help reconstruct East Europe, has been busily reconstructing itself after the financial excesses of Jacques Attali. Yet, even now, it has yet to make a serious impact on the spiralling problems of Russia, let alone the rest of East Europe. That is a job which, ultimately, can only be done by Russia. But the daunting task of economic stabilisation and market reform can, and must, be assisted by the world's richer nations. It is no use telling Russia that they will get Western billions after they have reformed -- for the simple reason they need help in order to put their house in order. A currency stabilisation plan of the kind that gave Poland a kick-start could have short-circuited the vicious devaluation-led spiral of inflation which is still a constant threat to the economy. It remains to be seen whether the new Russian parliament approves the austere budget proposals. If it doesn't, it will clearly make it more difficult for the IMF to speed up the aid programme. That said, the Russian government which ditched the Gaydar reformists has gone much further than anyone could have hoped at the time in accepting the economic strait-jacket which the IMF, sadly, expects supplicants to wear. If this opportunity is missed, the consequences for Russia could be very serious indeed -- which is precisely where the revival of some of the old Soviet military reach enters the equation. There are some who already see historic folly in the West's bolstering of a potential enemy. And the first flexing of those arthritic muscles -- against the poisonous background of a rampant Zhirinovskiy -- will exacerbate such fears. Mixed signals, and motives. But there is still a central equation. A Russia recovering economically will be a Russia more at ease with itself and more bound into a world whose Partnership For Peace needs to go further. The tracks don't yet diverge.
