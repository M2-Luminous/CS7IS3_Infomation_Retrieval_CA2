"Generally we are satisfied with the progress that is taking place on the ground," said UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams. "The Bosnian Serb Army is withdrawing heavy weaponry from the 20-kilometre exclusion zone and the general trend is positive." He said that the United Nations' special representative to ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi had sent a letter overnight Monday to NATO's secretary general Manfred Woerner telling him that he was satisfied by the Serb progress and was hopeful that they would comply with the deadline. Earlier in London, US Secretary of State Warren Christopher said that the Serbs had begun withdrawing their heavy weapons from around the battered enclave but not enough to avert the threat of NATO air strikes. "Today will be an important day. There has been some movement, but not enough," Christopher said after meeting with British counterpart Douglas Hurd. Christopher was to leave later Tuesday for Geneva and a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev. As he spoke, a four-sided working group began meeting in London in search of long-term solutions to the Bosnian conflict. Hurd said Monday there would be "no hesitation" in ordering air strikes if Serb troops and weapons were not withdrawn beyond a 20 kilometre (12 mile) radius from the centre of the Moslem enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday.
