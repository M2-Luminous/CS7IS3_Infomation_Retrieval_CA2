In the past three days, the Bosnian deputy prime minister held talks with high-level political and cultural officials of our country. In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral relations, the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the future of the country were also discussed and assessed. The visit by the Bosnian deputy prime minister to Tehran almost coincided with the last few days of the Croatian minister's visit to Tehran. This provided a suitable opportunity for a positive diplomatic effort in Tehran for bringing the stances of the two countries closer. This is extremely important in assisting the Bosnian Muslim nation in its current difficult situation. In the course of these talks, the establishment of a Bosnian-Croatian confederation, which was proposed a few months ago and was approved by the Bosnian parliament, was also discussed. This plan appears to be welcomed by the two sides involved. While in Tehran the deputy prime minister signed three memoranda of understanding for cooperation in the political, technical, scientific, and cultural fields with Iranian officials. Of course, in the current difficult conditions, these memoranda are more symbolic [preceding word in English] and indicate the wishes of two Muslim countries for cooperation in all fields. The Iranian nation, more than all the friends of the Bosnian nation, has displayed the greatest support and sympathy for the oppressed people of that country and special relations will be forged with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future as well. However, in the current circumstances it is significant that the Iranian Government and people will muster all their efforts to ease the hardships of the Bosnian Muslim people and to help them extricate themselves from the present crisis. While doing this they will certainly encounter the animosity and plots of the common enemies of the Muslims.
