Stavropol Kray Preparing for Introduction of Visa Regulations"] [Text] Stavropol Kray's State Duma Committee for Legislation and Human Rights has prepared a package of documents confirming the status of this vast border kray as a territory with special immigration regulations. This resolute attempt to bring immigration under strict control was the result of a significant deterioration in social welfare and the level of crime here. Deputies consider that one main, if not the main reason for this is the uncontrolled and barely verifiable process of rapid settlement of this land of plenty by citizens of former USSR republics, in particular from the Transcaucasus. What is more, you cannot in any way classify those coming to the kray to settle permanently as unfortunate, dispossessed refugees and forced migrants. During the years 1990-1993 almost 500,000 people moved to the kray as permanent residents, but only 10 percent of them are registered at the kray immigration service as forced migrants. Only about 2,500 have officially registered as Russian citizens, while the remainder are citizens of other CIS states. There are people living within Russia who are, it would seem, free from the obligations of Russian Federation citizens, in particular military service. Young people who dodge the draft feel "unrestrained" in everything else as well. Very often they come into conflict with the law and public moral standards. This provokes genuine revulsion among the indigenous population of the towns and villages, who often turn against all "ethnics" in general. Reports about village assemblies ending in ultimatums and demands that "outsiders" be evicted from this or that population center are all over the local press. Unregulated mass immigration is causing the general quality of life in the kray to deteriorate sharply. You are struck by the unusually high prices for the south of food in the markets and of manufactured and household goods in the stores. Prices here are higher than in Moscow and other Russian industrial centers, and incomes are a lot lower. But even this is not the main point: The whole of Stavropol Kray's infrastructure is bursting at the seams. A minimum of 40 new schools and an even greater number of kindergartens need to be constructed for the immigrants' children -- there has been an increase of 40,000 children in the past three years. A further 9 billion rubles are required for medical services for the newcomers. But the kray's treasury is empty. Yet many of the newcomers immediately buy up individual homes, garages, plots of land to build on, luxury dachas, and other real estate. Information about this in the possession of the service for fighting organized crime, which for the moment cannot be disclosed as there is a secret investigation in progress, is -- take my word for it -- very impressive. Representatives of many kray departments, parties, movements, and members of the intelligentsia participated in the stormy parliamentary hearings on problems of immigration. Practically all the participants came out in favor of introducing special immigration regulations. With the exception of Yevgeniy Borodin, cochairman of the kray organization of the "Democratic Russia" movement. He considers that the proposed measures are not in keeping with the Russian Federation Constitution and infringe human rights. He sees a danger in overzealous officials' introducing visa regulations "with a strong element of Russian nationalism." For example, Professor A. Avksentyev, who is well-known in these parts, stated directly: "In immigration, priority should be given to the Russian population, and all others should be regarded as having foreign status...." The motivation of the advocates of the "Russified approach" is equally serious: The proportion of Russians in the overall population of this kray, where more than 100 peoples and nationalities live, has begun to fall in recent years. There is also every sign that this trend will strengthen. What is more this is a trend with a clear criminal coloration. Corrupt Stavropol officials are accepting enormous bribes to grant inhabitants of the Transcaucasus -- people who are on the whole well-to-do -- permits to live in cities and population centers in the Mineralnyye Vody area of the Caucasus. Although there is a strict quota for residence permits here, this proves to be no obstacle. The quota has been exceeded twice over in the past three years. The deputies propose introducing different payments for residence permits in different regions while stepping up the monitoring process to check that quotas are adhered to. In the kray center it will cost immigrants from Russia 500 times the minimum wage, while it will cost immigrants from the CIS 1,000 times and foreigners 2,500 times the minimum wage. It is proposed to permit the entry of foreign citizens, including those from former USSR republics, and persons without citizenship only on production of an invitation from an inhabitant of the kray or a corporate body registered there. It will only be possible to register for permanent residence with the backing of an enterprise, organization, a state or municipal body, or relatives. A mechanism has also been produced to expel from the territory people who have gone there without a visa. The participants in the hearings complained once more about the legal mess over the border between Russia and Chechnya and again appealed to the Russian Government. "It is absolutely essential to finally determine our position vis-a-vis Chechnya," Nikolay Novoseltsev, hetman of the kray Cossack union, said indignantly. "If this is a republic which is part of Russia, order must be established there; if it is not, the border with it must be firmly closed." The situation really is unbearable: A wave of violence, robbery, and murder is spreading unimpeded from Chechnya across the whole of southern Russia. After making their "raids," the criminals hide there on its territory and feel absolutely safe there. It is not as if the borders here were "transparent." So the Stavropol deputies and public have approved the legislative base for immigration regulations produced by the duma committee. In the opinion of committee chairman Viktor Khloponi, a well-known kray specialist on combating organized crime and corruption, the local parliament will examine the question of introducing the visa regulations at its next session.
