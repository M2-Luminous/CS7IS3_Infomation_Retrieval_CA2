Army Commander General Reynaldo Caceres Quiroga told LOS TIEMPOS in La Paz that "anti-subversive" logistic operations are being carried out by diverse military units in the region. They follow an "activities schedule" drafted by the Armed Forces Third Department. Gen. Caceres said that at no time has his command ordered or instructed the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba "to move military contingents" to Chapare, Ichoa, or Chimore to carry out an "alleged intelligence dragnet to investigate the existence of armed groups in the zone." Caceres said remarks by General Guido Tavera Leyton, commander of the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba, were "misinterpreted" as a result of "superficial evaluations" on regular Armed Forces "antisubversive" operations. Caceres said: "All military movements in Cochabamba's tropical region over the next few days are within the framework of routine maneuvers scheduled by regiments and military units based in the region." Caceres added, however, that Gen. Tavera Leyton's remarks in Cochabamba will be "thoroughly investigated" to definitively establish what happened to the military announcements that were released to the press the past weekend. The military chief said that military activities in the zone merely seek to consolidate education, health, and basic sanitation projects in rural areas. "Those projects in no way seek to fight insurgent outbreaks in the zone. As far as the Army knows they do not exist, for there are only indications of that possibility," Caceres said. Last weekend the commander of the Seventh Army Division based in Cochabamba told the press that Army intelligence agents were "moved" to the Chapare region to investigate the possible presence of irregular groups linked with drug traffickers. Tavera Leyton also announced that a report will be released in the next few hours to inform the population whether there is evidence of subversive activities in Chapare, Chimore, and Ichoa. The military chief said that in June the Army will organize an "active" operation of all military units in the Chapare region to receive anti-guerrilla training. Gen. Tavera said that the Rene Barrientos Ortuno Regiment based in the Colomi settlement and the Captain Victor Ustarez Regiment based in Tolata will participate in the anti-guerrilla military exercises that will be carried out as a priority in the Chimore and Ichoa area. Tavera also ruled out the possibility of declaring Cochabamba's Chapare region a "military zone" as a result of "the growing" drug trafficking activity in this coca region.
