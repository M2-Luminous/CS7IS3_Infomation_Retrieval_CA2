FBIS4-4665 "dreas064_c_94001" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 2 Apr 1994 North Korea Envoy to UN Renews Call for Talks With U.S. Envoy to UN Renews Call for Talks With U.S. OW0204041494 Tokyo KYODO in English 0344 GMT 2 Apr 94 OW0204041494 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] New York, April 1 KYODO -- North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations on Friday [1 April] renewed Pyongyang's call for high-level talks with the United States to settle a row over international inspections on North Korean nuclear facilities. In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Pak Kil-yon said North Korea is not opposed to holding high-level talks with the U.S. if a ground for such talks is provided. Pak said, "not at this moment, but if the U.S. could lay the foundation for a third round of high-level talks, we have stated we will not oppose" such a move. On a UN Security Council statement Thursday calling for the North to fulfill obligations to open its nuclear facilities to international inspections, the ambassador said it is "a unilateral demand and (North Korea) does not have an obligation to meet it." In a statement issued Thursday, the Security Council urged North Korea to allow unrestricted inspections of its nuclear facilities and hinted at economic sanctions if it failed to comply. But Pak did not deny a possibility of accepting further inspections by the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), if negotiations with the U.S. proceed. "We have not yet heard of an official proposal from the UN," he said. Asked what he has in mind as a condition for holding the high- level talks with the U.S., Pak said "it is only the fulfillment of the U.S.-DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) agreement reached on February 25." In the agreement with the north on February 25, the U.S. announced it would call off the Team Spirit joint military exercises with South Korea in exchange for North Korea's acceptance of IAEA inspections on its seven declared nuclear plants. The IAEA started the inspections last month but after an IAEA inspection team was barred from collecting samples of nuclear material from one of the seven nuclear plants, the U.S. stiffened its attitude. The U.S. and South Korea then reversed the decision to call off the Team Spirit war games after the IAEA's announcement that Pyongyang had thwarted its nuclear inspections. The Security Council announced it would wait until the end of April, when the IAEA provides its report on the North Korean issue, before it decides if it will actually impose sanctions on the north. Diplomatic sources said the focus now has shifted to whether the U.S. and the north will resume unofficial contacts to pave the way for high-level talks as well as China's efforts to persuade Pyongyang to accept the U.N. request. China, as a permanent Security Council member, has veto powers on UN resolutions and has maintained close relations with North Korea even after the collapse of the former Soviet Union, once another supporter of Pyongyang.
