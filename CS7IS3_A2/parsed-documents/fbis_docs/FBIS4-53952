In volume, shipments also shrank for the third consecutive year, falling 16 percent to 140,254, it said. Association officials said the prolonged recession made corporations refrain from investing in office-use computers. Such companies tended to buy personal computers or workstations instead, they said. The association said shipments of office computers declined for all levels, including small business computers costing less than 3 million yen and large machines with a price of 10 million yen or more. By industrial sector, shipments to the financial industry jumped 35 percent in value and 19 percent in the number of units. The steady rise was attributable to a massive order from an insurance company, the association said. Shipments to the public sector rose 4 percent in volume, but those to all other sectors declined from a year earlier, it said.
