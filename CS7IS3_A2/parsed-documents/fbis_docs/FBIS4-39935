The statement notes that even in accordance with the initial draft, 20 percent of all budget expenditure was allocated for military needs. Moreover, when the budget was passing through the second reading it became possible to allocate an additional 3.5 billion rubles. Sources outside the budget to finance defense needs were determined, and Duma experts estimate that these will amount to another several trillion rubles. The statement acknowledges that the budget, which reflects the actual state of the Russian econony, is extremely tight. But, the statement says, the deputies are convinced that parliament, and society, through parliament, have to place the use of taxpayers' money under strict supervision.
