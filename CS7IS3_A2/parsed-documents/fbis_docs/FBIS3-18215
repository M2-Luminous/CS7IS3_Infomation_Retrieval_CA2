The Presidential Committee of the WEU -- the European pillar of the Atlantic alliance -- meeting in Paris, praised "NATO's resolve" in enforcing the UN-backed no-fly zone over Bosnia and the ban on un-policed heavy arms round Sarajevo, according to a statement issued after the meeting. However the WEU noted that NATO's 9 February ultimatum to withdraw heavy arms threatening Sarajevo or put them under UN control "could be implemented only thanks to a tacit agreement between Russia and the United States under United Nations auspices." But the WEU expressed "regrets" that it was "not possible for there to be prior consultation with the Central European countries whose close cooperation is vital to the conduct of any UN policy in former Yugoslavia." The WEU said the "positive development" in Sarajevo should encourage efforts to "apply the same policy to other threatened areas in Bosnia: Mostar, Srebrenica and Tuzla" amongst others. It said the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) should be provided "with sufficient additional troops to enable it to carry out its mission of controlling armaments." WEU members and NATO "should make all necessary preparations so as to be able to contribute military forces to the substantial peace-keeping force that will be required to ensure the implementation of a peace agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina," the statement said. The WEU groups France, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Britain. Denmark and Ireland have observer status.
