In March 1994, integration with the European Union [EU] was backed by 70 percent (three years ago it was 80 percent). Jacek Syryusz-Wolski, a government expert on integration, says comfortingly that we are more pro-European than the Danish--members of the Union. Experts warn, however, that the EU's rating will drop unless the Common Market opens up to commodities from Poland. Of the respondents, 40 percent believe that we should join the Union of Twelve right now. Every fourth respondent would prefer to wait five years. At the same time, Poles seem to be forgetting about the EU: Right now, 80 percent know what it is, whereas a year ago 86 percent knew. Only 17 percent of respondents knew about the Maastricht Treaty, which established the Union. More than half of all respondents were not able to answer this question. Advocates of Poland's integration into the EU are private entrepreneurs, managers, and school and university students. Indifferent to the EU or negatively disposed to it are peasants, inhabitants of rural areas, elderly people, and people with elementary education. The research was conducted in late March on a representative sample of 1,230 adult inhabitants of Poland.
