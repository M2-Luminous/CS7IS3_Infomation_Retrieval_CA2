This was stated yesterday by FRG Labor Minister Norbert Bluem in Schwerin. For this purpose, 35.6 billion German marks [DM] have been allocated to the eastern laender. A total of DM54 billion, 42 percent, of DM107.2 billion from the BA budget are used for "active labor market policy" in the country. "The core of the BA's active labor market policy is the promotion of vocational qualification," said BA President Bernhard Jagoda, who, together with Bluem, honored the 100,000th retrained construction worker with a certificate in the training center of the construction industry in the capital of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. More than 1 million people in eastern Germany have participated in advanced training since German unification. Vocational advanced training and retraining is subsidized with DM15 billion in Germany, DM7.7 billion of that in the east. The construction industry is considered to be the driving force of the economy in the new laender. Thus, from mid-1992 to mid-1993, the number of people employed rose by 11 percent to 700,000. At first, the billions poured into advanced training and retraining also attracted dubious figures. Bluem: "Especially in the new laender, black sheep had established themselves among the institutions providing training in order to earn a lot of money quickly." Together with the Nuremberg BA, this development was counted with determination by sending groups of inspectors on site. The latest inspection did not result in any complaints. Bluem assumes that up to 600,000 places in necessary advanced training measures can be financed in 1994. Advanced traning for master craftsmen or engineers are no longer subsidized in line with the Labor Promotion Law. However, those affected can participate in a new loan program, which is an instrument to bolster any adverse effects.
