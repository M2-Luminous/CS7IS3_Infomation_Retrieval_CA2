There are two approaches to an active income policy: economically rich in content and politically demagogic. The first path presupposes a rigid policy on income and a strictly time-limited phase of financial stabilization. That is, to put it simply, a wage freeze. It is quite obvious that it is much easier to suppress inflation by combining a restriction on emission with a restriction on income. Here one must clearly see that it is a question of restricting the wages of "laborers," and that this measure, with its unquestionable effectiveness, is related, in the first place, to the existence of a conscious desire to eliminate inflation, and on the other hand, to the presence in the government of self-confidence and a political mandate which is the only thing that can make it possible for it to be solved by such an extremely unpopular measure. Our government is not attempting to do this, and it is somehow awkward to accuse it of this, unless one has in mind a compulsion for suicide. On the other hand, our government, and specifically the Ministry of Labor, headed by Mr. Melikyan, is professing an alternative approach to the income policy, that is, the struggle for its (the income's) control so beloved by the broad masses. The staff members of Mr. Melikyan's department are not at all inclined toward productive activity, and have obviously done a lot of reading of the newspaper PRAVDA, which particularly loves to stir up not fully intelligible information on the unprecedented gap between incomes of various groups of the Russian population. Since the president sharply expressed to the government his concern for the lack of reform activity, the Ministry of Labor, trying not to lag behind other departments, hastened to make a show of its activity. Moreover, in the most inoffensive and at the same time purely populist form. No real harm will come from the initiative of the Ministry of Labor on introducing a more "progressive" income tax. Or rather, nothing will result from it at all, since all countrymen who are more or less oriented to the situation know that for a long time now no one has revealed his real income, if it exceeds a certain level. There are innumerable, fully legal, ways of getting any part of a personal income out from under taxation. In a country where the entire real legal support of economic interrelations between all the participants in economic life is implemented exclusively by gangsters, where the state is incapable of providing a guarantee of even one payment, Mr. Melikyan has decided to regulate incomes. Let him submit the plan of his socialist initiative to the Mr. Gangsters and ask them if they will permit him to tax their indecently high incomes more "fairly." I do not think that Mr. Melikyan will turn to the gangsters, since he is pursuing no specific economic goals with his project. Just as the entire government as a whole pursues no such goals, since it consistently portrays some sort of efforts to reform and regulate some abstract picture of economic life, which has no relation to reality.
