What will happen if the organizers and participants in Sunday's incidents repeat their actions on other occasions?. What will happen if they say that they will be holding rallies today for Bosnia, tomorrow for Azerbaijan, the next day for Western Thrace, and the day after that for Cyprus and they use the same methods? In other words: What will happen is they exploit the justified sensitivity of our people toward all those national causes to advance their own "cause"? What if they initiate a "jihad" under the green banner against the secular system of the state and our citizens who are loyal to that system? What if they stone official and party buildings and attack foreign embassies? And what is more dangerous than that: What if the administrators of the legal political parties do not condemn the action of these supporters, but on the contrary, issue statements encouraging them? To what will this lead? Everyone should seriously consider the reply to this question. Above all, Prosperity Party [PP] administrators should, among themselves, consider the following: It is true that they have been most successful in the 27 March elections and they have increased their votes from 10-11 percent to 19 percent. Is this, however, what the new recruits expect from the party? Did they cast their votes so that our metropolitan areas could be turned into fighting arenas? And the PP members? Is this what they promised the citizens when they asked for their votes prior to 27 March? Did they not say "We will bring peace and brotherhood to our people"? Were they not sincere while they were making those promises? Were they acting as "wolves in sheep's clothing" in order "to get the votes and to do what they please afterwards"? PP administrators should diagnose their situation from this angle. If, in an atmosphere of victory in the aftermath of the recent elections, they believe that their promises are no longer binding... If they seem like "wolves" who no longer need "the sheep's clothing"... If they are saying: "We have accomplished what we wanted. The administration of most of the metropolitan areas is in our hands. The time has come now to occupy the streets." To what will this lead? One cannot know the details of what will happen. In general, however, the following is clear: It will not be beneficial for anyone. We believe that whatever is "clear" to us is also clear to the Prosperity administrators. If so, they should make it "clear" that their preelection promises are binding. They should categorically issue a warning to their supporters who are willing to wage a "jihad" against the democratic and secular republic and 90 percent of its people. Those who do not heed this warning should be kept away from the party and the administrators should be the first ones to wage a struggle against them. We hope that they will be exercising this "foresight."
