European Parliament member and former French army chief-of-staff Jeannou Lacaze told AFP the delegation would strive for a lifting of the embargo slapped on Iraq four days after it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. General Lacaze, who described his talks with Iraqi officials as "very positive," said the delegation would "present several proposals reflecting the Iraqi viewpoint," but gave no details on the issues to be raised. He said his team supported an easing of restrictions, notably on medical products. The delegation had decided to donate five tonnes of powdered milk to Iraqi infants, he added. The French delegation, which leaves Monday for Amman, met Sunday with Prime Minister Ahmad Husayn Khudayyir and parliamentary speaker Sa'di Mahdi Salih. A French official said Friday the visit was "a personal initiative and that it does not commit the French authorities" or represent a change in policy towards Iraq. He added that France was still for Iraq's implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions on disarmament. Franco-Iraqi ties were severed at Baghdad's initiative during the Gulf crisis to protest France's participation in the international coalition that ousted Iraq from Kuwait after seven months of occupation. Iraqi newspapers reported Friday that Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz had discussed the possibility of restoring diplomatic ties between Baghdad and Paris with the lawmakers. The delegation, which arrived Thursday, was led by Senator Serge Mathieu, head of the Franco-Iraqi Friendship Association. It also held talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Muhammad Sa'id al-Sahhaf.
