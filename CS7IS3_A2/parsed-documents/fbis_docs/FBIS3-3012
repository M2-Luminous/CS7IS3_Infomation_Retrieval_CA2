The meeting was presided over by Executive Chairman Cheng Siyuan. Finance Minister Liu Zhongli dealt on reasons for the enactment of a budget law, whose draft has been presented to the session for deliberation. Liu said the law aims to strengthen the management of, and supervision over, budget planning, examination, implementation and enforcement. Such a law is needed, he said, to guarantee and promote a healthy social and economic development. State budget, as an important macro-control means, plays an important role in the country's political and economic life, Liu said. Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, made a speech explaining an NPC draft decision to grant legislative power to the Xiamen Special Economic Zone (SEZ). As one of the earliest SEZs, Xiamen has become the mainland's important window of economic and trade relations with Taiwan and the outside world, he said. To open the zone wider and to attract more overseas investment, the Law Committee suggests that the Xiamen People's Congress and its Standing Committee be authorized to enact local laws and regulations and that the Xiamen municipal government to formulate regulations for implementation locally, he said. Tian Jiyun, a vice chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, delivered a report on the work of the NPC Standing Committee over the past year. Tian defined the five-year term of the current NPC Standing Committee as a period when establishment of a socialist market economy is to be speeded up and China's second-phase modernization goals are to be attained. The guiding thinking of the Standing Committee is, under the guidance of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, to take as its fundamental task the strengthening of a socialist democratic and legal system, further improve the People's Congress system, guarantee the implementation of the constitution and other laws, and promote the development of a socialist market economy, he said. To attain these goals, Tian said, the Standing Committee will continue to give economic legislation top priority so as to gradually establish a legal system that conforms to a socialist market economy. Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said in his work report that courts throughout the country should provide a strong judicial guarantee for a sustained, rapid and healthy development of the economy, and maintain social stability through strict law enforcement. In 1993, people's courts at various levels handled more than 3.4 million cases of the first instance, of which three fifths were civil cases. In his work report, Zhang Siqing, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, said in 1993 procuratorates throughout the country and military, railway and other special tribunals reinforced their function of legal supervision. They devoted much efforts to handling major cases of embezzlement and bribery. Criminal cases were severely dealt with, and cases involving infringement of people's democratic rights and dereliction of duties were also handled, Zhang said. According to Zhang, in the last four months of last year, procuratorates investigated more than 8,000 serious cases of bribery and misappropriation of public money for personal use. Each bribery case involved more than 10,000 yuan and each case of the latter category more than 50,000 yuan. Seven hundred and fifteen officials at or above the country level implicated in such cases were dealt with according to law, he said.
