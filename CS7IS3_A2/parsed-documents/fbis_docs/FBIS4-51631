The meetings are the third of their kind since a memorandum of understanding on beef market access was signed between Korea and Korea's three major beef exporters last July, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said. In yesterday's meeting, Australia urged Korea to expand the volume of its grass-fed beef sold in wholesale markets to 5,000 tons from the present 800 tons, said a ministry official who attended the meeting. New Zealand is expected to make similar demands in a meeting with Korea scheduled for April 25, the official said. The United States with which Korea is scheduled to have a beef negotiation April 26 will likely urge Korea to ease restrictions on the local distribution of beef.
