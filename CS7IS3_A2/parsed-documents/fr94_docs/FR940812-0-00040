FR940812-0-00040 FR940812-0-00011 We revised §416.269 to reflect the statutory expansion of the factors considered in determining the sufficiency of a person's earnings to provide a reasonable equivalent of the benefits which would be available absent those earnings (see §416.265(d)). We determine insufficiency of earnings by comparing actual and/or anticipated gross earnings for the 12-month period, beginning with the month for which special SSI eligibility status is being determined, with a threshold amount for the individual's State of residence. We determine the threshold amount using the amount of gross earnings that it would take to reduce to zero the Federal SSI benefit and State supplementary payment for an individual with no other income living in his or her own household and the average Medicaid expenditures for disabled SSI cash recipients for the State of residence. If an individual's gross earnings exceed the State threshold amount, we do a second comparison to compare the earnings with an individualized threshold. In making this determination, we will consider any amounts excluded as impairment-related work expenses or work expenses of the blind, amounts used or set aside for use under an approved plan for achieving self-support, and the value of any publicly funded attendant care services. We also added §416.269(d), which explains that we will consider the value of attendant care services for purposes of sufficiency of earnings determinations if the services are provided by a paid attendant, needed to assist with work-related and/or individual functions, and paid from Federal, State, or local funds. We also added §416.269(e) to reflect that we will base determinations of sufficiency of earnings on information and data updated no less frequently than annually. Also, because §416.269 predated retrospective monthly accounting, we further revised it. For sufficiency of earnings determinations, we will use the calendar month, rather than quarter, for which we are determining eligibility for special SSI eligibility status as the beginning of the 12-month period. 4. Impairment-Related Work Expense Change In enacting Pub. L. 99&hyph;643, Congress recognized that disabled individuals who make work attempts may not be able to follow a steady progression from regular SSI status under section 1611 to special SSI cash benefit status under section 1619(a), to special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b), and then to a status of complete independence. In reality, such individuals tend to have setbacks which may cause a drop in earnings and, therefore, a change in eligibility status. According to the legislative history of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643, it was Congress' intent to provide for easy transition, in either direction, between the various categories of benefits. Therefore, we revised §416.1112(c)(6) to facilitate easier movement between different benefit statuses. For periods prior to December 1, 1990, an individual who remained continuously eligible for a benefit under section 1611, 1616 (if supplementation is federally administered), 1619(a), or 1619(b), continued to qualify for the impairment-related work expense exclusion in determining financial eligibility for SSI. Also, to reflect section 5033 of Pub. L. 101&hyph;508, for periods after November 30, 1990, we removed the requirement that an individual must establish eligibility without benefit of the impairment related work expense exclusion. 5. Administrative Actions Under Section 1619(a) In addition to the changes already discussed, these regulations contain changes which we believe are consistent with the legislative intent of Pub. L. 99&hyph;643 to simplify administration of section 1619 and facilitate transition among the various categories of benefits. We revised §§416.1402 and 416.1403 with regard to initial determinations in order to state our policy on determinations involving transitions between sections 1611, 1619(a), and 1619(b). We revised §416.1402(a) to clarify that initial determinations regarding SSI benefits include, but are not limited to, determinations about eligibility for or the amount of SSI benefits or special SSI cash benefits, except actions solely involving transitions to eligibility between these types of benefits. We revised §416.1402(b) to clarify that the administrative actions of ``suspension'' and ``termination'' pertain to special SSI eligibility status under section 1619(b) as well as SSI cash benefits under section 1611 or section 1619(a). We deleted former §416.1402(h), which provided that a determination about whether an individual is eligible for special SSI cash benefits under §416.262 (section 1619(a) status) is an initial determination, and redesignated the subsequent paragraphs. The change recognizes that transition alone from eligibility for regular SSI benefits under section 1611 to eligibility for special SSI cash benefits under section 1619(a) and vice versa generally has little practical effect on an individual. The change allows movement between the statuses to be made with fewer steps, saving time and administrative expense. We believe this change is consistent with Congress' intent to simplify transitions between benefit statuses.
