FR940511-1-00111 FR940511-1-00016 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: 1. Maintenance and Location Fees Most of this rule is devoted to amending the regulations (43 CFR parts 3730, 3820, 3830, and 3850) previously published in the Federal Register on July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38186), and corrected on August 3, 1993 (58 FR 41184). That rule implemented the Act of October 5, 1992 (106 Stat. 1374), which required a $100 rental fee per mining claim or site for the 1993 and 1994 assessment years, with payment due for both assessment years by August 31, 1993. The law exempted claimants who owned 10 or fewer mining claims and sites and met other criteria. The 1993 Act extended the $100 per claim or site fee to September 30, 1998, making it an annual payment of $100 due on each August 31st, to hold the claim or site for the upcoming assessment year. The name of the fee was changed in the Act from ``rental fee'' to ``maintenance fee.'' A new fee of $25, called a location fee, is required under section 10102 of the Act. It is a one-time fee to be paid to BLM at the time the new mining claim or site is recorded. The Act allows a waiver from the maintenance fee for claimants who own 10 or fewer mining claims and sites, for certain mining claims and sites undergoing reclamation, and for several other situations. Numerous specific provisions in the regulations on mining would be amended to reflect the new terminology and the requirements of the 1993 Act. These include provisions relating to filing claims on O. and C. (revested Oregon and California Railroad and Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon Road Grant) Lands in subpart 3821. On April 16, 1993, Public Law 103&hyph;23 (107 Stat. 60) was enacted, requiring new procedures and filings for claimants locating and operating mining claims on lands patented under the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916 (SRHA, 43 U.S.C. 299). Effective October 13, 1993, prior to locating a mining claim on such lands, a claimant is required to file with the Secretary of the Interior a notice of intent to locate a mining claim and to notify the surface owner of such notice of intent. SRHA lands may not be entered for the location of a mining claim until 30 days after the surface owner has received notice of the filing of such notice of intent to locate. Filing of the notice of intent with BLM also has the effect of segregating the land sought for 90 days from all other land and mineral entry by anyone else. Filing of a Plan of Operations (now required by the SRHA) extends the segregation until the Plan is approved or denied by the BLM District Office. A section-by-section discussion of the amendments to implement these statutory changes follows. Other changes would be made in certain sections for purposes of updating and clarifying the regulations. Subpart 3730_Public Law 359; Mining in Power Site Withdrawals: General. The sections on authorities (§3730.0&hyph;3) and information collection (§3730.0&hyph;9) would be amended to add references to the Act of August 10, 1993 (107 Stat. 312). The section on Purpose (§3730.0&hyph;1) would also be amended to refer to lands included under the O. and C. Act, and would be subdivided for clarity. Subpart 3734_Location and Assessment Work. Section 3734.1 of this subpart, which requires the owner of a claim to file notice of location and assessment work, would be amended at paragraphs (a) and (c) to provide for the maintenance fee required by the Act. Subpart 3833_Recordation of Mining Claims, Mill Sites, and Tunnel Sites; Payment of Service Charges, Rental, Maintenance, and Location Fees. This subpart, including its title, would be amended to reflect the addition of maintenance and location fees required by the Act. Various sections would be amended as follows: Section 3833.0&hyph;1␣Purpose. Paragraph (c) of this section would be amended to add as a purpose the implementation of the annual maintenance fee established by the Act. Section 3833.0&hyph;3␣Authority. Paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section would be amended by adding the Act to the rental fee authority. A new paragraph (g) would be added to implement the mining claim entry and location amendments to the Stockraising Homestead Act of 1916 enacted by Public Law 103&hyph;23, 107 Stat. 60. The new paragraph cross-references part 3814, which has not yet been amended to reflect the Act of April 16, 1993, as of this publication. However, BLM is preparing a proposed rule that would amend part 3814 for this purpose. A new paragraph (h) would be added to refer to the Soldier's and Sailor's Relief Act of 1940 (50 U.S.C. Appendix 565), which excuses active duty military personnel from performance of assessment work.
