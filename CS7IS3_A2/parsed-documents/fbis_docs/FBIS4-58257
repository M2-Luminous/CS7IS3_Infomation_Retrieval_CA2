We were afraid that our writing could be interpreted as promoting narrow regionalism and striking at Jordan's national unity. However, the road chosen by the PLO leadership, especially after it signed the Oslo accord with the Zionist enemy and its agreeing to an unequal alliance with the Zionist entity -- an alliance of service, exploitation, and relinquishment of most of the Palestinian territory and rights in return for a meager authority -- has stripped this leadership of its claim to be representing the Palestinian people. This leadership is now no more than a party that controls Palestinian decisonmaking. This is an established fact despite the recognition of this leadership by the majority of nations, because what is important is the extent of recognition and respect extended to this leadership by the Palestinian people, who adhere to their cause and rights. I wrote this introduction to point to the high commissioner spirit displayed by some PLO leaders in their reaction to some local Jordanian developments and their provocative interference in Jordanian issues. Observe how Hakam Bal'awi a few weeks ago conveyed protests from his president against mosque preachers, the Jordanian press, and the activity of some people who oppose a Middle East peace settlement, such as the Hamas Movement and Hani al-Hasan. Mr. Bal'awi was not satisfied with direct protest. The PLO leadership has had recourse to the U.S. Administration and its ally, the Zionist enemy, to put pressure on Jordan. Thus, we heard Zionist threats against Jordan to stop the media and political activity of Hamas on its territory. His excellency the Palestinian ambassador in Amman has also been doing the same thing for quite a while. He has interfered with some newspapers, threatened some writers, and tried to buy some others. All these practices are done in public. The most recent example of this is his protest against some of the writings of Khalid Mahadin about some PLO stands. This prompted the prime minister to order censoring the writings of Mahadin or preventing his writing. The PLO leadership does not like to see Jordan lead a democratic life. It is unhappy with the freedom we are experiencing. We thank God that we are not among the subjects of Mr. 'Arafat and his democratic leadership. If this were the case, gallows would be erected and harsh sentences would be passed against whoever opens his mouth. We feel sorry for our brothers who will live in the Gaza-Jericho protectorate under the democracy of the PLO leadership. The PLO leadership should stop interfering in Jordan's affairs and manifesting the spirit of the high commissioner in the way it deals with the Jordanian arena. This leadership does this because it feels that it is supported by the U.S. Administration and the Zionist enemy. This leadership has no right to set a ceiling to our democracy. We are more concerned about observing laws, regulations, and the Constitution and we will not exchange this ceiling for the whims and wishes of this leadership. I reassert that we are talking here about a powerful faction of the PLO that is now linked strategically with the Zionist enemy and is conducting itself according to the enemy's desires and terms at the expense of the rights of the Palestinian people first and the rights and sovereignty of some Arab countries.
