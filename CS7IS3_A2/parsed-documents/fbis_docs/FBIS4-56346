[applause] They symbolize all the workers and progressive forces that are mobilizing around the world to support our resistance, condemn the blockade, and defend their own hope in Cuba. Our most sincere thanks, esteemed brothers. Before this session, Comrade Fidel showed us the path to walk. To his political view and his trust in the masses we owe the idea of the workers' parliaments, which were held with great success. In thousands of assemblies, workers expressed with profound feeling their appreciation to the commander in chief for giving them the opportunity to discuss the country's economic problems freely and openly. Thanks to that suggestion by Comrade Fidel in December, today we have a vast arsenal of ideas and proposals. We have discovered and put to work an important productive reserve; above all, we have reached a level of information and comprehension never before achieved on the nature of the problems we face, the conquests we should preserve, and which are our main alternatives to overcome the crisis. The recent extended plenum of our National Committee of the CTC, during which we held an extensive exchange with the commander in chief on the results of the workers' parliaments, concluded that there is already a true national consensus upon which we can begin to build. For the Cuban labor movement, this process has also been an injection of energy and the discovery of methods that should serve to perfect our work further. We are sure that we now have the resources to reach the best conditions and to apply -- gradually and intelligently, but with determination and firmness -- the measures of restructuring and order that the people await: those that may emanate from this assembly and those that are already being carried out in tens of thousands of work centers with the understanding that only through more work and with an inevitable quota of sacrifice will we be able to overcome this exceptionally difficult situation. The sacrifice is not what could intimidate us, because our people sacrifice themselves day after day. What can scare us is the possibility of losing our fatherland, which is finally free; the Revolution that brought work, justice, and dignity for all Cubans; and the socialism that transformed us into a people of comrades and brothers. For that reason, let us not vacillate in making the decisions that the country needs, in the certainty that no sacrifice will be too great if we preserve the historic conquests of the Revolution, and that nothing can break a people with no other vision than victory. Viva International Workers Day! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva our glorious, invincible Revolution! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Viva Fidel! [crowd shouts: Viva!] Socialism or death, fatherland or death, we will win!
