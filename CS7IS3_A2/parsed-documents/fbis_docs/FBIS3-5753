Results of the poll show that 84 percent of those surveyed said the government's economic stimulation measures were inadequate while only 4 percent said the measures were adequate. Asked what they expected the government to do to stimulate the economy, 32 percent said the government should expand public works projects, and 22 percent said taxes should be cut. Asked about the first Hosokawa cabinet budget bill for fiscal 1944, 38 percent said it contained no characteristics of the Hosokawa cabinet because it had no economic stimulation plan and had been compiled by bureaucrats; while 22 percent it did have Hosokawa cabinet characteristics in that it planned to increase funding for public works projects to stimulate the economy and attached importance to consumers. The government has decided to cut 6 trillion yen in taxes for one year in 1994, and to draw a conclusion within this year on post-1994 tax cuts and ways to secure financial resources to compensate for the shortfall incurred through tax cuts. Asked about this plan, 44 percent said they thought highly of it, while 45 percent said they had no strong feelings for or against it. This showed a clear division of support for the tax-cut plan. Asked how they would use the extra income from the proposed tax cuts, 35 percent said they would spend more on consumer goods and tourism, while 32 percent said they would save the money. Asked to comment on the national welfare tax that was scrapped soon after Prime Minister Hosokawa announced it, 54 percent opposed it, saying it was merely a replacement for the consumption tax, that it had been abruptly announced without full debate, and that the existing tax rate was already high. However, 29 percent expressed support, saying the new tax system was needed to support an aging society, to ensure financial resources to compensate for the planned tax cuts, and to improve the people's welfare. Asked about the relationship between the level of social security and burden on society of senior citizens, 63 percent said the present social security system should be maintained even if the people's burden increased a little, while 20 percent said Japan should build itself a high-level social security system even if it greatly increased the tax burden on the people. Asked about foreign rice imported after Japan suffered a shortage, 75 percent said they felt uneasy or very uneasy about eating it, while 23 percent said they felt quite happy about eating it. Asked about government measures for farmers following its decision to partially open the Japanese rice market, 33 percent said the government should reduce protection for them and that the farmers should strengthen their management through free competition. Meanwhile 28 percent said government funds should be used to consolidate the foundation of agriculture, while 19 percent advocated the need for the government to subsidize losses in farmers' incomes.
