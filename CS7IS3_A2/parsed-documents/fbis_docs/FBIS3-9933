FSLN candidate (Evelyn Watler) was beaten up, and a window in a station wagon owned by Victor Espinoza, FSLN political secretary in Puerto Cabezas, was smashed. Brooklyn Rivera, YATAMA's top leader and currently director of INDERA [Nicaraguan Institute for the Development of the Autonomous Regions of the Atlantic Coast], headed the attack. Alfonso Smith, governor of the North Atlantic Autonomous Region, Kenneth Bush, the Government Ministry's delegate, and other YATAMA activists also lead the criminal action.
