The demonstrators were demanding a solution to the national land situation. According to Ricupero, the riot was incomprehensible because the Finance Ministry has nothing to do with agrarian reform. "Personally, I am in favor of agrarian reform. At least on this point the peasants and I agree, because we both oppose the UDR [Rural Democratic Union]. The peasants should demonstrate against the UDR, against Caiado (meaning former UDR president and former Deputy Ronaldo Caiado). On 13 May, the CUT [Sole Workers Central] secretary general said during an interview that the intention is to defeat the government stability plan. What is the real intention behind that," the minister asked. Ricupero on 13 May visited Belo Horizonte to explain the economic stabilization plan to Minas Gerais business people. In the totally full assembly hall of the Minas Gerais Business Federation, he paused during his explanations to speak again about the incidents in Brasilia. He referred to agrarian reform and asserted that sooner or later this problem will have to be solved in Brazil. "With apologies to the people close to the UDR, but agrarian reform is necessary in this country," he said. In his opinion, the government acted correctly by ordering the Army to intervene in the Federal Police problem. According to him, the government cannot allow this kind of abuse. He believes that the federal policemen on strike have demonstrated narrowmindedness by harming the population: "The people end up by siding against the strikers." [passage omitted]
