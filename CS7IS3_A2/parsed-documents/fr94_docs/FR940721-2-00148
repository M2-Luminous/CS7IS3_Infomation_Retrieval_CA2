SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Introduction and Purpose The purpose of this program announcement is to announce the anticipated availability of fiscal year 1995 funds, authorized under the Native American Programs Act (Act), as amended, to promote the goal of social and economic self-sufficiency for American Indians, Alaska Natives, Native Hawaiians, and Native American Pacific Islanders in four competitive areas. In order to streamline the application process for eligible Native American applicants, ANA is issuing one program announcement announcing fiscal year 1995 funds. Therefore, information regarding ANA's mission, policy, goals, application requirements, review criteria and closing dates for each competitive area is now in one comprehensive announcement. In previous years, the Administration for Native Americans promoted the goal of self-sufficiency in Native American communities primarily through Social and Economic Development Strategies (SEDS) projects. Amendments to the Native American Programs Act have expanded ANA's granting authority to establish two additional programs for (1) environmental regulatory enhancement, and (2) Native American languages preservation and enhancement. Projects are awarded funds under sections 803(a), 803(d) and 803C of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended (Public Law 93&hyph;644, 88 Stat. 2324, 42 U.S.C. 2991b). The Indian Environmental Regulatory Enhancement Act of 1990 (Public Law 101&hyph;408) authorizes financial assistance for projects to address environmental regulatory concerns (Section 803(d) of the Native American Programs Act of 1974, as amended).
