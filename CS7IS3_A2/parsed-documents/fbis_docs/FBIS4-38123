U.S. President Clinton continues to order Fahd's regime to conclude deals with U.S. firms involving billions of dollars! Following the conclusion of the $6 billion airliner deal with U.S. companies, which the Saudi regime had to pay through loans from a consortium of local and U.S. banks, there are now reports that Clinton has ordered the Saudi regime to grant a $4 billion deal to the American Telecommunications Company despite the fact that other international non-American companies have made attractive bids which are far below the bid of the American company! Although the Saudi regime is going through the worst deficit in its history and has been forced to cut its expenditures in the 1994 budget by 20 percent after spending all the surpluses it made in the eighties during the past four years, the U.S. administration is still pressuring that regime in order to extract its last penny. Otherwise, what is the meaning of Clinton's personal intervention in favor of American firms as in the airliner deal and now the deal to set up 500,000 telephone lines. At any rate, this is not all the Saudi rulers are disposing of from the oil revenues with such utter insolence and recklessness. There are also the bribes given by the agent regime in order to prolong the blockade on Iraq, and the vast sums which are spent on corrupting news media and those working in them. More than that, there are the sums which are assigned for plots and aggressions against everything nationalist, progressive, and honest in the Arab homeland. No doubt, U.S. milking of Fahd's regime will not stop at the telephone deal. From time to time the Saudi regime, or the Americans themselves, will invent new deals and projects in billions of dollars. Yesterday it was the airliner deal, today the telephone deal, and tomorrow it could be a submarine deal! Yes, a Saudi official has announced that "Saudi Arabia" is considering the purchase of submarines to guarantee its security in the Gulf and the Red Sea. Naturally, the Saudi regime will need U.S. submarines for that! The main thing is to boost the depressed U.S. economy and create job opportunities for unemployed Americans. Above all, what is important is to please the American master even if the Saudi regime has to spend its last penny.
