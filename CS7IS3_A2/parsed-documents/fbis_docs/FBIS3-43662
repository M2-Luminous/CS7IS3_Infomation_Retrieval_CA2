Fighting broke out between the police, hurling teargas, and the opposition leaders' bodyguards after the security forces, "without explanation," stopped the politicians from boarding their flight here late Tuesday, the spokesman said. A delegation of seven people, including four men who ran against President Omar Bongo in elections that returned him to office last December, turned up at the airport to carry out a briefing tour to France and the United States, the spokesman said. The four were Jules-Aristide Bourdes-Ogouliguende, Alexandre Sambat, Jean-Pierre Lemboumba and Pierre-Claver Maganga-Moussavou. The incident was the first of its kind since the December 5 poll, sources said. In recent weeks, several leaders of the opposition in the West African country have travelled abroad, notably to Paris.
