Standing in a brisk wind alongside Prime Minister Li Peng, Edouard Balladur had time to contemplate the historic esplanade of Beijing which was deserted. He probably thought about the cynicism of realpolitik which meant that, less than five years after the repression of the Chinese democratic movement, firmly condemned at the time by France, he was standing next to Li Peng, who is held responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Beijing's citizens on this same Tienanmen Square. This was one of the prices to be paid for this four-day visit by the French Government chief to China, which enabled the Chinese television commentator to stress yesterday evening that "relations between France and China have entered a phase of complete normalization," expressing the hope that these relations "will be stabilized in a long-term view." The element which would have made it possible to finally close the Tienanmen chapter -- an invitation to Li Peng to visit France, for which the Chinese were hoping -- did not come. "We did not specifically discuss that question," Chinese spokesman Wu Jianmin said, although he pointed out that "the two countries decided to step up the rate of high-level visits." Indeed, the French Government does not want the Chinese prime minister to make an official visit during the presidential campaign and hopes to find a diplomatic means of inviting President Jiang Zemin instead or at least of only issuing the Chinese with an invitation in theory, without any specific name or date. The question of human rights in China and Tibet was nonetheless the subject of a "select committee" meeting, at French initiative, which brought together Li Peng and Edouard Balladur, and Qian Qichen and Alain Juppe, the two foreign ministers. No detail had filtered through yesterday evening on this four-man meeting, which lasted around 20 minutes at the end of the general meeting, which had been attended by around 30 participants. In particular, it was impossible to ascertain whether or not Edouard Balladur handed over a list of political prisoners and raised the case of Wei Jingsheng, the main Chinese dissident who was again arrested on Tuesday. Wei had been released last September after spending more than 14 years in Chinese prisons for having called for democracy back in 1979. Four Nobel Prize winners and around 40 prominent French people asked Edouard Balladur to intervene on the dissident's behalf. Yesterday, the Chinese spokesman described Wei Jingsheng as a "fringe element, cut off from the real Chinese situation," and expressed appreciation of the fact that "France does not intend to interfere in Chinese internal affairs" -- the customary expression when human rights is under discussion. During the general meeting which took place "in a very constructive atmosphere," to cite French spokesman Bernard Brigouleix, the two sides discussed economic questions more than expected. Li Peng accepted the idea that the French presence in Canton "should be strengthened" in a form yet to be defined. The Chinese authorities had ordered the closure of the French consulate in Canton in January 1993, thus punishing Paris following the sale of French fighter planes to Taiwan. China also announced that the second phase of work on the Daya Bay nuclear power station will be carried out "in cooperation with France." Purchases of wheat, a dam on the Yellow River, and projects in the energy sphere (especially oil) and telecommunications sphere were also mentioned. Other projects were to be discussed by French Trade Minister Gerard Longuet who is due to return to Beijing before the summer at the head of a large delegation of industrialists, the two sides announced. "French enterprises are not competitive with regard to prices or quality," the Chinese spokesman nonetheless said in a statement reported by Beijing television. This remark stresses that the "success" of the visit is not yet certain, notably because of France's failure to issue an invitation to Li Peng.
