The city closes the curtains at 1800. "It is the curfew of fear!" we were told by one young Tiaret resident who can no longer bear to live in a region whose residents easily give way to panic and lose their heads at the slightest rumor. "You would think we had no more men in Tiaret," he added, seemingly disgusted by the passive attitude of the citizens and especially the laxness of the local authorities, who do nothing to reassure people and provide them with a climate of confidence. Reports from Tiaret give one the impression that there is no more state presence in that city, since it seems to have been abandoned to the fundamentalist terror that is continuing its insidious undermining work. Objective: to subject the citizens to the diktat of the terrorists so as to prove that the latter are stronger than the state. Here, too, the "words of command" that one hears are the same as those heard just about everywhere else: the veil must be worn, hairdressing shops for women, video stores, and the few bars still open must be closed, and parabolic antennas must be taken down. The fundamentalists operate by means of large-scale propaganda, the arrogant presence of bearded men, racketeers, and death threats sent by letter and addressed collectively or individually. Besides that climate of terror being maintained by "henchmen" working at various levels, we were told of the existence of fake mobile roadblocks being set up by terrorists on the roads leading to Tiaret from Theniet El-Had, Frenda, and Zemmoura. "The terrorists have taken over Tiaret, and I can tell you that former prisoners from Ain M'Guel are their main henchmen for terror. They move around the city with an arrogance that is effective," we were told by another young man from Tiaret. According to another source, the fundamentalists hold frequent meetings in mosques. They inventory the property of the rich with a view to expropriating it. That news has reportedly caused many of the city's notables to flee. The fundamentalists are able to build their pressure because of submission by the citizens. The more afraid Tiaret's residents become, the more they give ground to the "bearded ones" who want to rule over the life of the city with their prohibitions. That is what interests them the most about the "hogra" [scorn, contempt] of women. So is the situation desperate? "Not at all," comes the answer, "because there are still many citizens who resist and reject the lifestyle the fundamentalists are trying to impose on them." In that connection, the demonstration held on the day of the funeral of the DEC [expansion not given], who was killed in his office in cowardly fashion, was a popular demonstration of that rejection. The man was highly regarded, and Tiaret's residents, both men and women, wanted to shout their anger at a gang of criminals that lives on murder and sabotage. The citizens say: "The city must wake up and get back to its normal life. People have had enough of this terror and are ready to fight, but for them to do that, the authorities must not let them down."
