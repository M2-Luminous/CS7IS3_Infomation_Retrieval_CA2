FBIS4-16911 "drsov076_a_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-076 Daily Report 19 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Urges `Forceful Measures' To Resolve Conflict Urges `Forceful Measures' To Resolve Conflict LD1904222394 Belgrade TANJUG in English 2207 GMT 19 Apr 94 LD1904222394 Belgrade TANJUG English BFN [Text] Moscow, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin assessed on Tuesday evening that forceful measures should be taken towards the resolving of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina and again suggested a top-level meeting between the United States and the European Union, with the participation of the United Nations. Yeltsin said that the meeting should be well-prepared and that instructions in that sense had been given to the Foreign Ministry in Moscow. Yeltsin assessed that the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina was facing a dangerous escalation and that the strong measures taken by Russia together with some other countries and the U.N. had not been helpful. He underscored that the Bosnian Serb leadership had to fulfill their obligations given to Russia, to cease combat activities and withdraw from the area of Gorazde, which has been declared a safe area. Conditions must also be created for the arrival of U.N. troops to Gorazde and the U.N. staff in Bosnia-Herzegovina must be allowed freedom of movement, the Russian president said. Moslem and Serb forces have been fighting around Gorazde, a Moslem enclave in southeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, for three weeks. Instead of demilitarization, more than 10,000 Moslem troops concentrated in this enclave, from where they launched a heavy offensive on Serb territories in late March. Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic on Sunday agreed an immediate ceasefire around Gorazde with UNPROFOR head Yasushi Akashi, but Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic rejected the agreement. The Bosnian Serb army announced that Moslem forces from Gorazde on Tuesday continued heavy attacks on Serb positions in order to cause larger-scale conflicts for which the Serb side would then be blamed and a foreign intervention provoked. NATO-assigned U.S. planes on Sunday and Monday bombed Bosnian Serb positions around Gorazde, allegedly to protect UNPROFOR members who were actually British special units in charge of guiding the NATO planes to the Serb targets. The Bosnian Serb army also on Tuesday pointed out that Moslem forces were using buildings where representatives of the U.N. and international humanitarian organizations were housed for their attacks. Karadzic underscored on Tuesday that he was receiving hourly reports on the situation in Gorazde and that they showed that the Moslem forces would not cease fire and were attacking Serbs on the right bank of the Drina in boat landing operations. Bosnian Serbs could have entered Gorazde, Karadzic said, but wished to make a safe area of the town. It must be demilitarized and UNPROFOR members should be deployed along a 3-km belt on the left bank of the Drina, where the Moslem part is, Karadzic said, adding that this could be realized immediately as far as the Serb side was concerned.
