However sad it may be, Georgia has compiled its own statistics for this day: Sixteen persons infected with the virus, 11 of whom are citizens of the republic. This figure is, as yet, not high, a fact that was made public at the recent European regional convention of persons coordinating the AIDS problem that was held under the aegis of the World Health Organization in Berne, Switzerland. During the work of the conference, doctors came to the conclusion that the main obstacle to the spread of AIDS in our republic (and, incidentally, this is characteristic of almost all the republics of the former Soviet Union) was the highly effective work of the epidemic surveillance service; it has not been possible to achieve this in the United States or in other foreign countries where the number of AIDS cases is huge. The compulsory screening of persons infected with the virus and those who have been in contact with them is viewed as a violation of human rights in these countries and, consequently, in the struggle against the disease, emphasis is given in the main to large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda. "In our country, the screening and control of those carrying the virus are also not compulsory," said Tengiz Tsertsvadze, senior doctor at the Republican AIDS and Immunodeficiency Center, who represented Georgia at the conference in Berne. "While their number is still not high, we manage to maintain close contact with them and convince them of the expediency of undergoing individual screening, though on a voluntary basis." "In general, we consider the present practice abroad to be too liberal and feel that it could do more harm than good. In spite of the extremely unfavorable working conditions, we are, at the moment, succeeding in preventing the occurrence of new cases and in maintaining the epidemic at a comparatively low level." "Nevertheless, all this does not mean that we should be complacent and do nothing more. The forecast given by experts is very alarming: Unless radical measures are taken immediately in the struggle against AIDS in Georgia, the number of cases will reach 20,000 by 2000 and several hundred thousand by 2010." "There are two principal factors that will contribute to the spread of the disease in this country: Drug addiction, which is already acquiring terrifying proportions, and the dire shortage of disposable syringes and other medical instruments and the means to sterilize them." "Speaking of radical measures, I mean by this, first and foremost, the creation of a material and technical base and necessary conditions for normalizing the work of anti-AIDS services, in particular our center, which is, at the moment, the only one in Georgia that is concerned with this problem. It is essential that we have here, in the center, all those specialists who can take care of precisely those persons who have the AIDS virus." "If, in 1990, we were able to screen 400,000 persons, this year, we have managed to screen only 105,000 on account of the fact that there has been no money to purchase test kits. We hardly have enough even for blood donors. Correspondingly, it is probable that the figure for the number of persons infected with the AIDS virus is inaccurate and there are more than those who have been registered." "We should copy the experience of the West regarding large-scale anti-AIDS propaganda and public health education among the population. Those powerful [publicity] campaigns, which are conducted there in all the mass media and which are supported by sponsors, charitable organizations, and public figures, including those carrying the AIDS virus, are shaping social awareness and thereby creating a big barrier to the spread of the disease." "We hope that our mass media will help us, particularly television. Meanwhile, in this respect, the one thing that we have been able to create ourselves in our center is a department for preventive measures against AIDS that will be in contact with the mass media."
