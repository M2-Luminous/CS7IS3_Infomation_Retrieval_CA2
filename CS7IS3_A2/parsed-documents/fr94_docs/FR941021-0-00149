FR941021-0-00149 FR941021-0-00022 II. Background 6. As described in the Notice , 11 this proceeding was initiated in late 1990, when Ellipsat Corporation (Ellipsat) 12 and Motorola Satellite Communications, Inc. (Motorola) filed applications to construct LEO satellite systems in the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands and the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band, respectively. 13 At the time these applications were filed, there was no frequency allocation in these bands for MSS. The banks were allocated to, among other services, the radiodetermination satellite service (RDSS), which encompasses satellite radionavigation and radiolocation services. 14 The Motorola and Ellipsat systems were intended to provide voice and data MSS in addition to RDSS. Both applicants requested waivers of the U.S. Table of Frequency Allocations, 47 CFR §2.1, to permit non-conforming MSS operations in the bands. 15 11 See Notice, note 2, supra, at paras. 5&hyph;9. 12 Ellipsat is now doing business as Mobile Communications Holdings, Inc. Because it has participated throughout this proceeding as Ellipsat, we will continue to refer to it as Ellipsat in this Report and Order. 13 Ellipsat proposed the 1.6 GHz band for Earth-to-space transmissions and the 2.4 GHz band for space-to-Earth transmissions. Motorola proposed to use the 1.6 GHz band for bidirectional transmissions. Motorola later modified its application to request the 1616&hyph;1626.5 MHz band only. See Minor Amendment filed by Motorola (Aug. 14, 1992). 14 Portions of the banks are also allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS), the radioastronomy service, the terrestrial fixed-service and for use by industrial, scientific, and medical equipment. See paras. 98&hyph;162, infra, for a complete discussion of sharing between MSS and other allocated services. 15 These waiver requests have become moot in light of the subsequent domestic and international MSS allocation in these bands. See note 1, supra. 7. The Commission placed the Ellipsat and Motorola proposals on public notice and established a June 3, 1991 cut-off date for filing applications to be considered concurrently with them. 16 In response, Constellation Communications, Inc. (Constellation), Loral Cellular Systems Corp., now doing business as Loral Qualcomm Partnership (LQP), TRW, Inc. (TRW), and AMSC Subsidiary Corporation (AMSC) filed applications. Constellation, LQP, and TRW proposed to construct LEO satellite systems. AMSC proposed to add additional frequencies onto its authorized geostationary satelliteorbit (GSO) system. 17 The LEO applicants proposed two basic LEO system architectures. TRW, LQP, Ellipsat, and Constellation proposed a code division multiple access (CDMA) architecture. CDMA systems can share the same frequencies when operating under certain technical constraints. 18 Motorola proposed a time division multiple access/frequency division multiple access (TDMA/FDMA) architecture. TDMA/FDMA systems must operate on separate dedicated frequencies. 19 AMSC's proposed GSO system could use either CDMA or narrowband FDMA techniques. 16 Public Notice, Report No. DS&hyph;1068, 6 FCC Rcd 2083 (1991). 17 AMSC requested authority to modify its authorized upper L-band (1545&hyph;1559/1646.5&hyph;1600.5 MHz) MSS system to include the 1616.5&hyph;1626.5 MHZ frequency bands. 18 Spread spectrum CDMA is a digital transmission technique in which the signal occupies a bandwidth larger than that needed to contain the information being transmitted. Because the signal is spread over a wide bandwidth, the power is dispersed and interference potential is reduced. The spreading is accomplished by modulating the signal by a code that is independent of the information data. A synchronized code in the receiver is used to de-spread the signal and recover the information. The spreading and the variation in the code permit a number of users to operate on the same frequency simultaneously without causing harmful interference. 19 TDMA is a transmission technique in which the same frequency band is used by both uplink and downlink transmissions in alternating time slots. FDMA provides multiple discrete channels with different center frequencies. 8. The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC&hyph;92), allocated frequencies for MSS in February 1992. 20 Specifically, the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band was allocated on a co-primary basis with other radio services for MSS Earth-to-space operations and the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band was allocated on a co-primary basis for space-to-Earth operations. 21 In addition, a secondary allocation was made for MSS space-to-Earth operations in the 1613.8&hyph;1626.5 MHz segment of the 1.6 GHz band. Shortly thereafter, the Commission proposed an identical domestic allocation and subsequently adopted that allocation in December 1993. 22 20 See note 1, supra. 21 ``Primary'' services have equal rights to operate in particular frequencies. Stations operating in primary services are protected against interference from stations of ``secondary'' services. Moreover, stations operating in a secondary service cannot claim protection from harmful interference from stations of a primary service. See 47 CFR §§2.104(d) and 2.105(c). 22 See note 1, supra. 9. The Commission conducted a negotiated rulemaking from January through April 1993 to assist it in developing technical rules for the MSS Above 1 GHz service. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee's (the Committee's) work included technical matters relating to compatibility among the proposed MMS systems (inter-system sharing issues), compatibility between MSS and other services in the band or in adjacent bands (inter-service sharing issues), and the operations of MSS feeder links and intersatellite links. The Committee reached consensus on many issues, but did not reach a consensus regarding a technical method by which all proposed systems could be accommodated within the 1610&hyph;1626.5/2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz bands. 23 23 See Report of the MSS Above 1 GHz Negotiated Rulemaking Committee (Apr. 6, 1993). The Committee included two independent attachments discussing this issue in the Report. One was supported by AMSC, Celsat, Inc., Constellation, Ellipsat, LQP and TRW. The other was supported by Motorola. Since the end of the Negotiated Rulemaking, the LEO applicants have submitted several partial settlement proposals. See Joint Filed Comments, submitted by Motorola and LQP (Oct. 7. 1993); Joint Spectrum Sharing Proposal, submitted by Constellation, Ellipsat and TRW (Oct. 8, 1993). Joint Proposal and Supplemental Comments submitted by Constellation, Ellipsat, Motorola, and TRW (Sept. 9, 1994). See also letter from LQP to FCC (Sept. 13, 1994).
