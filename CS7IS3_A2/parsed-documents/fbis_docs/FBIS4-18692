He added that the Greek measures will be lifted if and when the Skopjean Government gives tangible proof of the goodwill signs to which repeated references have been made. The spokesman described the European Commission's decision yesterday [to refer Greece to the European Court of Justice] as inappropriate and contradictory and said he hopes the Commission will finally change its view. He said: If this does not happen, we will have the chance to present our strong judicial arguments in court. The spokesman noted that the European Commission should have considered the UN secretary general's recent report to the Security Council, which notes that the continuing dispute between Greece and Skopje causes international tension and endangers peace in the region. Venizelos said U.S. Special Presidential Envoy Ambassador Matthew Nimetz's initiative remains open and that Greek Ambassador in Washington Khristos Zakharakis will meet UN mediator Cyrus Vance. The spokesman stressed that yesterday's decision violates the rule of communal solidarity. Commenting on yesterday's developments in the Skopje issue, Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and New Democracy Chairman Miltiadhis Evert stressed that the national front must remain united. Papoulias and Evert met at noon today at Evert's request. Afterward Papoulias appeared pessimistic about developments in the national issue but stressed that during Zakharakis' meeting with Vance in New York on 11 April, the Greek side would mainly be concerned with breaking the deadlock. He added that the Greek people stand firm in the battle that Greece is waging following recent developments. Asked about Political Spring Chairman Andonios Samaras' request that the government take additional measures against Skopje, Papoulias indirectly rejected Samaras' proposals, saying the government is now preparing for the new phase that has been created. Asked about the differences between the new Vance plan and what was agreed in the United Nations during the New Democracy's term, Papoulias said the difference lies in the separation of the name issue from the confidence-building measures, adding that the international mediator's views coincide with the Greek views.
