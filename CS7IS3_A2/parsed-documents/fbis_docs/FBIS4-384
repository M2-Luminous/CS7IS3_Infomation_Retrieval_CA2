The corpses lying around on the ground are being picked up in vans and buried in common graves. Alongside these ghastly events, there has been fierce fighting on the outskirts of Kigali between the army and the Patriotic Front. Jean Helene is there: [Begin Helene recording] Firing started close to the Meridien Hotel, 200 meters from the frontline -- or at least the one in Kigali. Government sources speak of three other combat zones in the north. In the capital, the troops of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] are still fighting around the former parliament building against the Presidential Guard, which is probably supported by units of the Rwandan Armed Forces. After a calm morning, heavy artillery could be heard throughout the afternoon, and violent shelling shook the town for 20 minutes this evening. The RPF reinforcements that have been announced are still awaited. Evidently they have been slowed down in their advance toward Kigali. UNAMIR [UN Mission in Rwanda] soldiers are making forays every day from the Meridien, where stray bullets burst from time to time: They are going to fetch expatriate families scattered around the districts affected by the fighting. There are nearly 500 expatriates in the Meridien today, waiting for evacuation, which can only be done when there is calm. [end recording]
