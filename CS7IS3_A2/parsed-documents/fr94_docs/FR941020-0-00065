FR941020-0-00065 FR941020-0-00023 II. Discussion of Final Rule and Comments After consideration of the Administrative Record of these regulations; as well as the legislative history of the Act; the August 30, 1990 decision in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; other opinions of the court; and in light of current technical information on impoundment design, construction, and inspection, OSM is making the following revisions to its permanent regulatory program. Consistent with its findings when it promulgated the 1979, 1983, and 1988 rules, OSM has not identified any differences between impoundments for surface and underground mines that would appear to necessitate different regulatory provisions under this final rulemaking. Therefore, the permitting rule applicable to impoundments for surface mining activities at 30 CFR 780.25 and the rule for underground mining activities at 30 CFR 784.16 are identical Similarly, the performance rules for surface mining activities at 30 CFR 816.46 and 816.49 are identical to the final rules for underground mining activities at 30 CFR 817.46 and 817.49, respectively. On March 6, 1992 (57 FR 8102), OSM published a notice of decision denying the petition for rulemaking. In OSM's decision, the Director stated that the issues raised in the petitioners' letter would be discussed concurrently with the comments to the proposed rule published on June 28, 1991 (56 FR 29774). This preamble contains that discussion. General Comments In addition to comments received on specific provisions of the June 28, 1991, proposed rule, OSM received several general comments. One commenter supported the proposed rule because the SCS publications TR&hyph;60 and Practice Standard 378 are widely used in the design profession and the adoption of these by reference will lead to better construction and performance of impoundments. Two commenters supported the proposed rule because it required more stringent standards for plans, designs, and construction for impoundments meeting the SCS Class B and C hazard criteria; and made the regulations consistent with section 515(b)(8) of the Act. OSM appreciates these comments, which in part, constitute the support for this rule. Three commenters were concerned that most of the sedimentation ponds in the West would have to be reconstructed. They noted that according to TR&hyph;60 (Table 2&hyph;5, footnote 2) Class A (low hazard) dams containing industrial water are to be designed to the more stringent criteria required for Class B dams. The commenters feared that all Class A ponds used in surface coal mining operations would have to be reconstructed to meet Class B design and performance criteria. OSM wishes to alleviate the commenters' concerns. OSM intends the dam classifications to be based solely on the hazard potential of the structure and its location which is independent of the purpose for which impoundment was constructed. Therefore, there need not be any wholesale reconstruction of Class A ponds used in surface coal mining operations to meet Class B design and performance criteria simply because the pond is used to contain industrial water. Two commenters requested that OSM incorporate a distinction between temporary and permanent impoundments because they believed it is contrary to SMCRA section 515(b)(8) which refers specifically to permanent impoundments. Also, during the comment period for the proposed rule, the NCA/AMC petitioned OSM to amend its rules to incorporate a ``statutory'' distinction between temporary and permanent impoundments when applying SCS criteria and regulations. Three commenters supported the petition and reinforced the petitioners' position that OSM should recognize the significant differences between temporary and permanent impoundments. OSM has defined the terms ``permanent impoundment'' and ``temporary impoundment'' in prior rulemakings and both definitions appear in 30 CFR 701.5. These definitions recognize the difference between temporary and permanent impoundments in terms of whether or not the impoundment is designed to remain as a postmining land use feature. For instance, under OSM's definition, impoundments that may be used for at least several years (probably more) during mining, reclamation, and which could be retained until shortly before bond release, would be classified as ``temporary.'' From an engineering perspective, the term ``temporary'' is also used to represent an impoundment constructed to last for the relatively short time period while ``permanent'' structures are being built. Regardless of these distinctions, OSM has determined that the key criteria to use in determining the construction standards to be followed by operators constructing impoundments is the structure's hazard potential_regardless of whether it is to be used as a temporary or permanent impoundment. Therefore requiring ``temporary impoundments'' [in OSM's sense of the word, i.e., to be removed following completion or surface mining activities] to meet SCS hazard criteria is appropriate because typically these impoundments will be used for the life of the mining operation and are not constructed as a precursor to a permanent structure. Thus, while certain impoundments may be built to different standards, the key distinction is not whether the impoundments are temporary or permanent, but rather whether or not the impoundments meet the SCS B or C hazard classification or the MSHA size criteria. Application of these performance standards to temporary impoundments is not new policy. OSM is continuing to follow the policy discussed in the preamble for the October 27, 1988, rules (53 FR 43589). In that preamble, OSM concluded that in view of the broad mandate of section 102(a) of the Act, ``to protect society and the environment,'' OSM has adopted a rule that is based on the hazard classifications established by the SCS, yet incorporates the more stringent MSHA criteria when their size criteria applies. Section 515 of SMCRA establishes minimum general performance standards for surface coal mining and reclamation operations. In this instance, the Secretary has concluded that the standards imposed by this rule are warranted because of the hazard potential in the event of failure. Application of this rule to temporary impoundments in supported by section 515(b)(8)(B) which may be construed to cover impoundments that will be retained for a period of years over the life of the mine, as well as the broad rulemaking authority of sections 201(b)(2) and 501. One commenter requested that if OSM finalizes these rules without distinctions between temporary and permanent impoundments, then existing temporary structures presently meeting performance standards should be grandfathered and not be required to be reconstructed. OSM does not agree. All impoundments must be evaluated by operators and regulatory authorities and reconstructed where necessary as determined by the impoundment's current hazard classification. Impoundments currently constructed to meet the standards for SCS Class B or C hazard criteria or the MSHA size criteria need not be reconstructed. Similarly, impoundments not meeting such criteria need not be reconstructed. Those which upon evaluation are determined to meet the size or SCS Class B or C classifications but do not currently meet the standards will need to be reconstructed. However, since the rules finalized today clarify the 1988 rules which applied SCS dam classifications to impoundments, changes should not be required to the extent changes have been implemented in State or Federal programs.
