How should Japanese foreign policy develop in the Asia Pacific regions, which includes Asian countries, North America, and Australia? Diversity of Asia Recently there have been attempts to reconsider Asia as one unified area sharing common "traditions" and "values." Strange terms, such as "identity" of Asia, are often being used. As the background to this trend, we can point out the recent remarkable economic development in some nations in eastern Asia, and the confidence these nations have begun to possess in their ability to build a nation. This attempt to positively understand Asia's characteristics should be welcomed, and we should not get upset about it. If indeed a common culture and value can be found throughout Asia and this helps Asia to be unified, there is no argument against it. The people who attempt to do this, for example, list as the characteristics of Asian nations--it seems that they are talking about Eastern Asia--people's diligence and labor ethics, which are based on the cultures influenced by Confucianism, decorum and norms, such as benevolence and justice, frugal spirit, high rate of savings, and inclination to accept Japanese-style management. They say that some of these common cultures and values contribute to the fact that Asia's economy has the highest growth rate in the world. These arguments make me think that they are in too much of a hurry to come to a conclusion and are trying to find Asia as one united region. I feel that there are two pitfalls which they may fall into in this approach. One is that they may completely ignore the Asian region's diversity, and escape to the ideal land of the simplified "Asia is one." The other pitfall is that by viewing Asia from the standpoint of "Asia versus non-Asia," the relationship between Asia and the other regions tends to be viewed as a competition. Thailand, where I had worked until a year and a half ago, is located on the Indochina peninsula. Their culture, including their religion (Jozabu Buddhism) and dancing, came from India. However, the Chinese who immigrated later planted their roots in Thai society, and they interbred with the Thai. Today, the word "kakyo (overseas Chinese)" has lost its original meaning. In today's Thailand, because things that were originally from India or China have been completely absorbed into Thai society, it is almost meaningless to search for things Indian or things Chinese. Though influenced by both India and China, as the word "Indochina" suggests, this country has succeeded in creating its own culture and value system which cannot be called anything other than Thai through their unique language. Therefore, reasoning such as "the Thai people's work ethic has been influenced by the Chinese who brought Confucianism, which values diligence," does not explain Thailand's high economic growth of today. Instead, in order to explain the recent economic prosperity of Thailand, we need to look for the causes of success in the areas of the stable political situation, high-quality bureaucracy, consistent policy of installing foreign capital, and quality labor. In Vietnam, which is also located on the Indochina peninsula, the leaders are getting ready to devote themselves to "nation-building" after the end of the Cambodian conflict. Vietnam had been completely left behind by the ASEAN countries, such as Thailand, in economic development. While being strongly influenced by the Chinese culture historically, Vietnam has repeatedly experienced militaristic conflicts with China. This nation has had a love-hate relationship with China. In Vietnam, which embraces Mahayanist Buddhism and belongs to the "cultural area of chopsticks," it is possible to find the influence of Confucianism in their diligence and their work ethics. At any rate, the prospect is bright concerning their nation-building. Very few people predicted the position of today's Myanmar [Burma] located to the west of Thailand. Burma is settling for being a "developing country." For the people in this country, who are pious Buddhists, political stability, liberation, and democratization seem to be the first problems to be dealt with, before discussing economic development. The reason why I have taken these three countries in Indochina as examples was merely to describe the diversity of Asia. The diversity will be even more evident if I mention the cultures, religions, and societies of Cambodia and Laos. While being located on or close to the Indochina peninsula, the religions, traditions, and cultures differ greatly. And in some countries, colonization by foreign countries has further increased the difference. There exists a big cultural and religious gap even among the nations in Indochina, which seem to be homogeneous. It is not easy to discuss traditional cultures and values as something shared in common throughout Asia. Before we discuss Asia's common identity, we, including myself, need to ask ourselves how much we understand the real situations of other Asian countries. Also, by stressing too much Asia's common characteristics and values, there is a tendency to view Asia's relationship with the rest of the world in terms of "Asia versus non-Asia"--you may call this Asianism. We need to be careful about this. It would be too short-sighted to think that Japan should value its relationship with Asian countries rather than its relationship with the United States or Europe, faced with the movement in the United States and Europe to integrate regional economies (formation of EC, NAFTA [North American Free Trade Agreement], etc.) Cooperation in the Asia-Pacific Region I do recognize the importance of Asia in our country's foreign policy. And I do not deny the significance of regional cooperation based on one region. But in achieving this, it would be more appropriate to view Northeast Asia, Southeast Asia, North America, and Australia as one Asia-Pacific region (in the future, Southwest Asia may be included in this cooperative framework), instead of viewing Asia as one fixed unit. The reason for this is that more and more countries of the Asia Pacific are recognizing that they do share some of the same problems and goals. Suppose that Asian countries would form some type of group by themselves. It should be the kind of organization that would support and reinforce the existing global framework or the whole Asia-Pacific framework. Narrow-minded "Asianism" may be interpreted as the solidarity and interests of nonwhite nations, and will not be desirable in light of Japan's relationship with other Asian countries in World War II. Thus Japan's policy toward Asia should not be considered separately from its U.S. and European policy, as if we were to choose between the two. It should be discussed as a part of the policy toward the Asia-Pacific region, and in relation to growing global interdependence. There are many opportunities for dialogue and cooperation for the countries of the Asia Pacific, and in recent years, the importance of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is increasing. APEC is a still young organization, started in 1989 by Australia's proposal. However, it has held five annual minister-level conferences, and has been discussing the region's deregulation of trade/investment, and economic trends. Last November, APEC's informal summit meeting was held on the Blake Island off the coast of Seattle. For the first time, 14 leaders from the Asia-Pacific region gathered for this historic meeting and discussed the economic trend of this region and the world and trade investment issues, and voted for the declaration concerning this region's economic prospect. This year, APEC's second summit meeting is planned in Indonesia. As an attempt at regional economic cooperation by Asian countries, there is an idea for EAEC (East Asia Economic Caucus) advocated by Prime Minister Mahathir of Malaysia. When this plan was first proposed, it was called EAEG (East Asia Economic Group). Back then the object of the plan was supposed to be to create opportunities for conference (discussion) among the nations of East Asia, and as the next step, to form a new organization to reinforce the trade and economic links between these countries. When this plan was proposed, the Uruguay Round negotiations were stalled, and some thought that this plan was to establish an "economic bloc" by Eastern Asia alone. At the same time, several countries pointed out that the contents of this plan were not clear enough. The Bush administration of the United States strongly opposed the plan, saying that "there is a possibility that this plan may divide the Pacific." Since then, there have been repeated discussions within ASEAN, and the EAEC plan seems to have changed substantially in its characteristics. Nowadays, EAEC is basically a place for participants to discuss whatever subject they are interested in and is one conference group in the framework of APEC. Japan has been cautious about EAEC, because the purpose of the organization and the detail of its concrete mechanism were not clear. However, as I mentioned before, the recent agreement in the Uruguay Round, the formation of NAFTA, realization of APEC's conference in Seattle, in addition to the progress of discussion within ASEAN, the situation concerning EAEC is definitely changing. Under these circumstances, it is time for Japan to reconsider EAEC, including whether to participate in it or not. However, the following will be the prerequisites: 1) EAEC will not lead to formation of an economic bloc, and its purpose will be "open cooperation" in accordance with the principles of GATT; 2) its relationship with APEC will be clarified, and its activities should be easily understood by the members of APEC; 3) it will not interfere with the U.S. participation (influence) in the Asia Pacific, and will give careful consideration to Australia's position. Security and Japan-U.S.-China Relationship The environment concerning the security of the Asia Pacific is diverse and complex. Each country in this region has a different threat. Therefore, traditionally, their interests in security have been on a subregional basis, such as that of the Korean peninsula and Cambodia. This is why there has not been establishment of an organization encompassing the whole region as in Europe. However, since the end of the cold war, there has been finally an increasing interest in discussing the security of the whole region. The "ASEAN Regional Forum" starting this year, which is a meeting held for the whole region, will include all the main players in the region, such as the United States, China, Russia, Japan, ASEAN, Australia, Korea, and Vietnam. The following are Japan's main policies concerning the security issue in the Asia-Pacific region. 1. To maintain the presence of the U.S. military, which is the primary factor for the region's stabilization. And to maintain the Japan-U.S. security system, which is pivotal to the presence of the U.S. military. 2. To devise a solution concerning individual conflicts, such as the ones in the Korean peninsula, Cambodia, and the South China Sea, through the framework of the countries concerned. Today, the problem of North Korea's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) suspected development of nuclear weapons, is the greatest cause of instability in the Asia-Pacific region. 3. To promote political and security talks for the whole region, in order to increase the sense of security and understanding of the policies between the nations. It is a welcome development that the talks on politics and security have begun to take place in the ASEAN expanded foreign ministers conference, and the "ASEAN Regional Forum" is starting this year, both according to Japan's suggestion. 4. To invest in improvement of the security environment by promoting economic development of each country. The common issues shared by the countries of the Asia Pacific concerning security after the end of the cold war can be summarized as follows: 1) How will the U.S. military presence affect in the future? 2) What direction will China's military capacity take? 3) What role will Japan play in this area in the future? And the countries in the region are closely watching how the relationship of Japan, the United States, and China will progress. Many think that "the relationship of Japan, the United States, and China is so-called zero-sum." These people think that if the U.S.-China relationship takes a favorable turn, Japan-U.S. relationship will cool off, and if the former cools off, then the latter will take a favorable turn. It is true that until the end of the cold war, such an aspect existed in the relationship of these three countries. However, looking back at the hundred-year history of the relationship of the three countries, it is also true that the recent 20 years have been the only period in which the relationship between Japan and China was basically good. The recent relationship of the three countries is an unprecedented situation, and I personally think that we should not look at this relationship as "zero-sum." In other words, when the Japan-China relationship is basically good, the United States can develop its relationship with each of the two at the same time, and this will be profitable for the United States. Thus, it seems that it is an important task for the three nations to make their relationship "positive-sum." At present, Japan and the United States share basic values, such as freedom, democracy, and a market economy system, and maintain an alliance relationship in security and a strong interdependent economic relationship. Most countries in the Asia Pacific strongly desire that this favorable relationship between Japan and the United States be maintained for the sake of their own security and prosperity. On the other hand, concerning Japan-China relations, both countries are aiming to establish a more mature relationship. The relationship between the two has been generally good since the normalization of diplomatic relations. For Japan, maintaining and developing our friendship with China is a key point in its foreign policy. Japan has been cooperating as much as possible to China's modernization, according to its belief that China's continued reform and open-door policies will help the region's security and prosperity. Also, Japan thinks that it is important for China to deal constructively with the frameworks of multiple countries (for example, NPT [nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty], MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] and GATT). Furthermore, Japan strongly hopes that the objectives and contents of China's policies concerning its military modernization will become clearer. Continued discussion on security between Japan and China and China's participation in the "ASEAN Regional Forum" to discuss politics and security in the whole region will contribute greatly to building trust and a sense of security among the countries of this region. As for the U.S.-China relationship, both countries have been trying to improve the relationship since the Tiananmen Square incident, each recognizing the importance of the other. However, problems remain to be dealt with, such as China's human rights policy, the nonproliferation issue, and the trade imbalance between the two countries. Among these issues, the greatest pending problem is the human rights issue. Improvement of the U.S.-China relationship will benefit Asia-Pacific countries, including Japan, and Japan should not withhold its effort in helping them better their relationship. Here, too, Japan's course should not be "choosing between the two," the United States or Asia--in this case, China. Human Rights and Japan's Asian Policy In the Asia Pacific, the interests and policies of the developed countries, such as the United States and Australia, and those of the developing countries do not always agree. Reaction to the human rights issue is a typical example. Japan often finds itself "caught in between" the developed nations and the developing nations concerning the human rights issue in Asia. However, that's a matter of opinion. Viewed from another angle, in this very type of issue, Japan, which places itself in the category of developed industrial and democratic nations, while being a member in the Asian community, may be able to play a unique diplomatic role. In the human rights argument, developed nations insist on the universal human rights protection of individuals, regardless of the degree of economic development. On the other hand, the developing nations generally insist on considering each country's political/social situations and degree of economic development in protecting human rights. Also, the developing nations' position is that the human rights issue is a domestic issue which concerns sovereignty. The summary of Japan's basic opinion is as follows: 1) Human rights is not a value that only the Western nations possess. It is universal. Therefore, human rights is an important factor in diplomacy. 2) However, concerning diplomatic effort in protection and expansion of human rights, it is appropriate to take the most practical and realistic approach, through understanding individual countries' situations, and the confronting approach may not always be effective. With this point of view, Japan has had its own unique policies toward China after the Tienanmen Square incident, Indonesia after the East Timor incident in 1992, and the current Burma. (The approaches the countries of the West take do not always agree either.) These policies do not mean that Japan sides with some of the developing countries that insist that human rights is a domestic issue which concerns each country's sovereignty. Neither do they mean that Japan agrees to the argument that the "rights" of political stability and economic development should have priority over civil and political rights. While Japan understands to a certain degree why there are such opinions as these, our position is that ceaseless effort is necessary to improve these situations, and fixation of the current situation or regression should not be allowed. However, at the same time, in discussing the human rights issue in the developing nations, we must carefully consider social and political factors of these countries, such as whether there exists a large middle class, whether economic stability and development are maintained, and whether there exist political groups which protect freedom of speech and human rights. Considering that it took a long time in the Western nations for these factors to be achieved, it may not be very realistic to demand and pressure the developing countries to have the same degree of human rights protection as in the developed countries. Problem Concerning the Past When discussing Japan's Asian policy, we cannot avoid our "problem of the past" concerning Japan's actions before World War II. Unfortunately, there still are some countries in Asia which suspect that Japan has not fully repented of its past actions. Prime Minister Hosokawa called World War II "a war of aggression," and he also stated that "we regret it deeply and apologize from the bottom of our heart" referring to Japan's colonization of Korea in the past. Asian countries, including Korea, responded favorably, saying that his statement showed that Japan was looking at its past truthfully. On the other hand, the series of prime minister's statements stirred up discussions about Japan's postwar conduct. However, Japan has fulfilled its responsibilities, such as reparation, constantly and sincerely despite the difficult situation after the war, according to the San Francisco Peace Treaty and related bilateral treaties, and except for special cases, such as Taiwan and North Korea, Japan has settled the "postwar conduct issue" with each involved government. As for the comfort women issue, the Japanese Government is seriously discussing how to express our feelings about it because of the uniqueness of the problem in which "women's honor and dignity were injured." In order for Japan to put "past" problems behind and to develop relationships with our neighboring countries with prospect for the future, there are two things that are especially important for Japanese people. One is that some measures should be taken in order to help the younger Japanese generation to better know and understand history. In recent years, there has been substantial improvement in the contents of school textbooks. However, to see this in an actual classroom environment, there should be more improvement in textbook content, such allocating more time to modern history. At the same time, I hope that these improvements in Japan will be understood and explained in foreign countries, including Asian countries. The other is that we need to express our resolution not to repeat the same mistakes, not just by words, but by concrete actions. In relation to this, dispatch of Japan's Self-Defense Forces for PKO [UN peacekeeping operations] activities in Cambodia was an epochal event in Japan's foreign policy. The bill for this deployment met strong criticism domestically, and some Asian countries criticized and feared that it might move Japan toward becoming a militaristic giant. However, the fact that Japanese PKO personnel truly contributed to Cambodia's peacekeeping despite many difficulties and at the sacrifice of lives, was enough to wipe away these criticisms and fear. These days, all Asian countries without exception understand that Japan's PKO activities in Cambodia were that of a responsible member of international society, and value them highly. Thus, in order to wipe away the "past problem" image, Japan must show concrete actions one by one. This is a very time-consuming process. However, in order to overcome the negative inheritance of the past, there is no other way. However, we should not hate ourselves for our past problem. The Asian countries' view of Japan is definitely changing with time. At the same time, the hope these countries have in Japan is only expanding. There is no sign of its decreasing. The most critical issue for the relationship between Japan and the rest of Asia is how Japan will respond positively to meet their expectations. The role Japanese economy played in the recent economic development of East Asia, the effect Japanese economic cooperation (ODA [official development assistance] grants) is having on these countries in improvement of infrastructure and public welfare, Japan's positive diplomatic participation and its role in political security (especially activities concerning peacekeeping in Cambodia and the situation in the Korean peninsula), the role the Japan-U.S. mutual security structure still plays in the stability of the Asia Pacific, etc., are major examples of Japan's positive involvement and its role. And the most effective way for Japan to meet the expectation of the Asian countries would be to deepen and expand these involvements and roles.
