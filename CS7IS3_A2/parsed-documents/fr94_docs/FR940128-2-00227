FR940128-2-00227 FR940128-2-00144 If questions arise concerning the precise relationship of specific properties to noise exposure contours depicted on a noise exposure map submitted under section 103 of the Act, it should be noted that the FAA is not involved in any way in determining the relative locations of specific properties with regard to the depicted noise contours, or in interpreting the noise exposure maps to resolve questions concerning, for example, which properties should be covered by the provisions of section 107 of the Act. These functions are inseparable from the ultimate land use control and planning responsibilities of local government. These local responsibilities are not changed in any way under part 150 or through FAA's review of noise exposure maps. Therefore, the responsibility for the detailed overlaying of noise exposure contours onto the map depicting properties on the surface rests exclusively with the airport operator which submitted those maps, or with those public agencies and planning agencies with which consultation is required under section 103 of the Act. The FAA has relied on the certification by the airport operator, under ยง150.21 of FAR part 150, that the statutorily required consultation has been accomplished. The FAA has formally received the noise compatibility program for Kissimmee Municipal Airport, also effective on January 11, 1994. Preliminary review of the submitted material indicates that it conforms to the requirements for the submittal of noise compatibility programs, but that further review will be necessary prior to approval or disapproval of the program. The formal review period, limited by law to a maximum of 180 days, will be completed on or before July 10, 1994. The FAA's detailed evaluation will be conducted under the provisions of 14 CFR part 150, ยง150.33. The primary considerations in the evaluation process are whether the proposed measures may reduce the level of aviation safety, create an undue burden on interstate or foreign commerce, or be reasonably consistent with obtaining the goal of reducing existing noncompatible land uses and preventing the introduction of additional noncompatible land uses. Interested persons are invited to comment on the proposed program with specific reference to these factors. All comments, other than those properly addressed to local land use authorities, will be considered by the FAA to the extent practicable. Copies of the noise exposure maps, the FAA's evaluation of the maps, and the proposed noise compatibility program are available for examination at the following locations: Federal Aviation Administration, Orlando Airports District Office, 9677 Tradeport Drive, suite 130, Orlando, Florida 32827&hyph;5397. Office of the Director of Aviation, Kissimmee Municipal Airport, 301 N. Dyer Boulevard, suite 101, Kissimmee, Florida 34741&hyph;4613. Questions may be directed to the individual named above under the heading, FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Issued in Orlando, Florida on January 11, 1994. Charles E. Blair, Manager, Orlando Airports District Office. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1930 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4910&hyph;13&hyph;M
