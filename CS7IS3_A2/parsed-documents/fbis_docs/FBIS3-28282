FBIS3-28282 "dreas024__a94016" FBIS-EAS-94-024-A Document Type:Daily Report 4 February 1994 ANNEX Japan * Ichiro Ozawa's Brain Trust Examined 942B0032A Tokyo SEIKAI in Japanese Nov 93 pp 24-29--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0032A Tokyo SEIKAI Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Article by Takuro Naka, journalist: "`Reason' and `Emotion' Entwined Ozawa's Glittering Human Connections"] [Text] He Had Begged: "I Would Appreciate Your Cooperation, Mr. Yamagishi" The words, "praise and criticism," seem to exist for Ichiro Ozawa. From the breakup of the Takeshita faction of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] in 1992 to the birth of the non-LDP coalition cabinet, the entire political world was divided into the "pro- and anti-Ozawa" groups. Questioned on whether to accept or reject the "Ozawa-style politics," it has gone through a sieve and moved forward to restructuring. Political reporters, who also act as political movers, were divided into two camps as well. A copy desk editor at a national newspaper says, "Depending on whether the politician to be interviewed was for or against Ozawa, our people at the political desk were clearly divided into two groups. We had heated arguments every day on how to evaluate Ozawa's speech and action." Here lie Ozawa's unique connections with people and the strong awareness of his existence as a politician. A bureaucrat who is considered as a close associate of Ozawa looks at the praise and criticism of Ozawa: "Members of the LDP criticize his aggressive methods for being undemocratic. But that misses the point because no one speaks as straightforwardly as Mr. Ozawa. For example, he even tells us bureaucrats that one government is enough, and that he will eventually have to fight with us for political reform. If you want to follow Mr. Ozawa, you will have to accept what he says, and if not, you will oppose him completely." Notwithstanding his straightforwardness, Ozawa sometimes assumes an extremely reverent posture toward his seniors, especially those whom he respects. Although he talks haughtily to the politicians and newspaper reporters who are junior to him, more often than not he addresses his seniors politely as "Mr. so and so," even if they are Dietmen of the ranks lower than him. There is a famous anecdote. Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, who had been arrested by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office in 1976 in conjunction with the Lockheed payoff scandal, was released on bail and staying at home in Mejirodai, with nothing to do. During that time, a young Dietman visited Tanaka almost every day to play his favorite game of Japanese chess. That was Ozawa; he was 34 then. Ozawa was born in 1942, the same year as Tanaka's eldest son, who died at a young age. Tanaka entered the political world when he was 26 and took care of Ozawa dearly from the time he joined the Tanaka faction. He even thought of marrying his eldest daughter, Makiko, to Ozawa, who was two years older than she. It's not difficult to imagine how fondly he thought of Ozawa, who came every day to play Japanese chess quietly with him, now an accused in the criminal case. Capturing Tanaka's heart was the beginning of Ozawa's human networking, both in terms of quality and quantity. Soon afterward, Ozawa began to distinguish himself quickly within the Tanaka faction and the LDP. Then, after leaving Tanaka and forming the Takeshita faction, he became favored by the new don, Shin Kanemaru. He captured the number-three position under Noboru Takeshita, the head of the faction, and Kanemaru. Ozawa began his own political career, surrounded by his colleagues in the Diet, secretaries, and supporters, all of whom were his seniors. His "charming the elders" method, which was used on Tanaka and Kanemaru, is his learned way of success in life. He has also used this method in developing strong connections outside the political world. In the spring of 1993, Ozawa had a meeting with Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Rengo [National Confederation of Trade Unions]. Reportedly, he sat formerly on the tatami floor and then lowered his head reverently over his hands placed on the floor in front of him, saying, "Mr. Yamagishi, I would appreciate your cooperation" in political reform and restructuring of the political world. Impressed by this gesture, Yamagishi, who had been suspicious of Ozawa's tactics, became an Ozawa sympathizer. Then, after the election for the House of Representatives in July, he kept his promise by exercising his influence in having the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] join the coalition government. Mobilizing Money and People in the Business, Labor, and Religious Circles In the business world, he is also well trusted by Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of Keidanren, and Masaya Miyoshi, its secretary general. The reason for Keidanren's curtailment of political contributions to the LDP seems to rest not only on the public criticism against the corruptive relationship between politicians and industries, such as in the case of general contractors, but also on leading businessmen's expectations for Ozawa on restructuring of the political world. Furthermore, in the religious world, Ozawa is reported to have a strong connection with Taisaku Ikeda, honorary chairman of Soka Gakkai. Originally, according to some sources, Ikeda had connections in the political world through Noboru Takeshita. However, Ozawa approached Ikeda, reportedly through a leading member of Soka Gakkai who acts as a pipeline between his organization and Komeito. Ozawa has Komeito involved in the movement for political restructuring; he even made Komeito's general secretary (Yuichi Ichikawa) say, "I don't even mind losing our party's identity." This is not only because Ozawa has a good relationship with Ichikawa, but also because he has already obtained Ikeda's virtual approval. By developing close relationships with Tanaka and Kanemaru, the former dons of the political world, as well as with the leading figures in the business, labor, and religious worlds who can mobilize a large amount of money and people, Ozawa has created the man he is today. Also in the mass media, he was favored by the late Osamu Togawa, who was quite influential in the political world. He used this connection to build his network in various circles. Ozawa served once as minister of home affairs, his only experience as a cabinet member. But, as he was a central figure within the LDP, serving as its secretary general and was a deputy cabinet secretary for the Takeshita administration, he has a wide array of connections in the ministries and agencies in Kasumigaseki. There are many "Ozawa sympathizers" among the bureaucrats in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs [MOFA], especially because he was involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks when he was a deputy cabinet secretary, and also as a secretary general of the LDP, he was involved in formulating Japan's response to the Gulf war and in drawing up the UN Peacekeeping Cooperation Law. He seems to have cultivated these human contacts through "reason," while he used "emotion" to get hold of the hearts of Yamagishi and other leading figures in various circles. His leading protege [within MOFA] is Minoru Tanba, the current director of the Treaties Bureau. During the Kaifu administration, he was promoted to director of the UN Bureau, replacing the former director who had made a series of mistakes in replying to interpellation in the Diet on an international peacekeeping cooperation bill (rejected). Since then, he worked as Ozawa's right-hand man in drafting the UN Peacekeeping Cooperation Bill. He is considered to be MOFA's most persuasive speaker and is also an adviser to Ozawa. Another leading protege is Michihiko Kunihiro, the current ambassador to China, who headed a cabinet-level committee on foreign affairs when Ozawa was deputy cabinet secretary, and was involved in the Japan-U.S. construction talks along with Ozawa. He joined the MOFA in the same year as Hisashi Owada, who retired from his position as vice minister. Although he lost the battle with Owada in becoming a MOFA vice minister, he successively held such important posts as counselor on foreign affairs, ambassador to Indonesia, and ambassador to China. He is also a member of Ozawa's brain trust. There are also some young MOFA bureaucrats who are devoted to Ozawa and are willing to volunteer as interpreters whenever Ozawa receives prominent individuals from foreign countries. Also, Yukio Okamoto -- who resigned from MOFA when he was head of the First Section of North American Affairs and is currently a consultant on foreign affairs -- is considered as a close associate of Ozawa. Another individual is Nobuo Matsunaga, the don of MOFA and former ambassador to the United States, who is now an adviser to MOFA. He is close to Yasuhiro Nakasone and thus is not considered quite a member of Ozawa's brain trust. However, he serves as chairman of the "John Manjiro Historical Group" of which Ozawa is the de facto sponsor. The group's purpose is to promote friendly relations between Japan and the United States in memory of Manjiro Nakahama, who went to the United States as a castaway toward the end of the Edo period and devoted much labor to serve as a mediator between Japan and the United States in the Meiji period. The one who played a most active part in creating the group was Sadao Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors, who is from Kochi Prefecture as was Manjiro and is considered to be Ozawa's most trusted friend. The group was "created to expand Mr. Ozawa's horizon and people contacts" (per a member of the group). In fact, Ozawa has been cultivating his contacts through this group. For example, the group's directors include Takaya Sugiura, chairman of All Nippon Airways; Hitoshi Kojima, president of NTT; and Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi Corporation. Ozawa seems to have regular meetings with them. Moreover, he is "on good terms" with Michael Armacost, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Bush administration; he has had a number of meetings with him every month since he was LDP general secretary. Also, Richard Chaney, the former defense secretary, and Walter Mondale, the current U.S. ambassador to Japan, are scheduled to speak at a meeting of the "John Manjiro Historical Group," which is to be held in Tokyo in the near future. They also seem to have strong relationships with Ozawa. His Book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan, and Brains Behind It Additionally, in the political world he has Nobuo Ishihara, the deputy cabinet secretary (for administration), who reigns over the bureaucratic organizations. He was the vice minister at the Ministry of Home Affairs when Ozawa was the minister. When the Takeshita administration took power in 1987, Ozawa became deputy cabinet secretary (for political affairs) and installed Ishihara as deputy cabinet secretary for administration. Since then, Ishihara has served five successive prime ministers -- Takeshita, Uno, Kaifu, Miyazawa, and Hosokawa. Although Ishihara tries to maintain a neutral stance on political affairs, he is hawkish like Ozawa, upholding his principles. Therefore, former prime ministers Kaifu and Miyazawa disliked his Ozawa-like qualities, and tried to get rid of him by making him governor of Tokyo or changing his post. However, as Ishihara is a capable public servant who knows the bureaucratic structure well, and can't be replaced by anyone, he has been a deputy cabinet secretary for the longest period of time in history. He plays the role of Ozawa's outpost within the cabinet. Norihiko Narita, who is known as an expert on political reform, especially on electoral systems, left his post as section chief at the National Diet Library to become the head secretary (on political affairs) for Prime Minister Hosokawa. He has also become a member of Ozawa's brain trust through Hirano on the political reform issue. A system of single-seat constituency and proportional representation was based on Narita's idea -- in the midst of debate on political reform during the ordinary session of the Diet, it was proposed by the Private Political Reform Promotion Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform) as a compromise between the leading and opposition parties' proposals. Some people stipulate that Prime Minister Miyazawa and the LDP members didn't want to support the proposal readily because they felt that Ozawa was behind it. Now, let's look at organized labor, which played a major role in forming the coalition government. Here, as mentioned earlier, the main driving force has been Akira Yamagishi, the don of organized labor, who became an Ozawa sympathizer. But even before him, some young labor leaders--including Etsuya Washio, chairman of the Japanese Federation of Iron and Steel Workers' Unions; Teruhito Enomoto, chairman of the Confederation of Japan Automobile Workers' Unions; and Hisaji Sonoki, vice chairman of Rengo--have been involved in political reform through their participation in the Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform. They also had several meetings with Ozawa and are in agreement with his stance on political reform. A unique individual in Ozawa's connections in organized labor is Masamitsu Shirojima (chairman of the labor union at Ajinomoto), chairman of the Council of the Food Industry Workers' Unions. He is known to be conducting his own political activities; he formed a fraternal organization for new labor leaders called "Shunju-kai" and has been actively cultivating relationships with Dietmen from Komeito. He met Ozawa through Yoshihisa Inoue, former Dietman in the House of Representatives, and other members of Komeito. He is now like a brain for Ozawa in the organized labor sector, inviting the people close to Ozawa in the mass media to speak at various gatherings of corporate executives in the food industry. In the business world, in addition to such aforementioned people as Hiraiwa, Miyoshi, and the members of the "John Manjiro Historical Group," Ozawa seems to be well connected to the top executives of the Mitsubishi group and the Toyota group companies, including Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corporation. Aside from these politically charged connections, Ozawa is rumored to have a group of intellectuals on his side. The rumor came about because of his best-selling book, Blueprint for Building a New Japan [Nihon Kaizo Keikaku], which has been reviewed quite favorably. A scholar on foreign affairs says, "At least on the issue of foreign affairs, the content of the book has enough substance for us to read. As I heard, the book was written mostly by Mr. Ozawa, but it seems to me a summary of discussions from some research studies. He must have a group of scholars [who helped him write the book] although I'm not one of them." In fact, the book has been talked about a lot lately in the academic world. Ozawa doesn't disclose the existence of such a group of scholars, probably to protect their status in the academic world. According to the consensus of opinion, however, the chief scholar is Shinichi Kitaoka, professor at Rikkyo University, who is building his popularity recently as a political scientist. According to some people (in the academic world), "Mr. Ozawa seems to have a desire to develop this kind of young scholar." Takeshi Sasaki, professor of political science at Tokyo University, who appears frequently on TV, also often exchanges opinions with Ozawa on the issue of political reform. Regarding the issue of the Constitution, Setsu Kobayashi, professor at Keio University, who supports constitutional reform, served as an advisor to Ozawa and spoke at a meeting of the "Research Committee on Japan's Role in the International Community" (the so-called Ozawa Committee), which was established within the LDP in 1991. Kenichi Ito, professor at Aoyama Gakuin University, also seems to have some contact with Ozawa in the area of political reform and foreign policy issues, although he can't be considered as a member of Ozawa's brain trust. In the mass media, Ikki Kasuya , chief editor of GAIKO FORUM, is supposedly acting as a coordinator between Ozawa and these scholars. Also, Kenzo Uchida, professor at Tokai University and former editor in chief at KYODO News, and commentator Taro Okuyama, have the same line of thinking as Ozawa in promoting political reform. Foreign Minister Hata Is Ozawa's Close Friend Let's now turn to the political world, Ozawa's home ground. Ozawa entered the political world when he was 26, soon after the death of his father, Saeki Ozawa, who had served as construction minister, among others. Saeki was a member of the Fujiyama faction of the LDP, and one of his colleagues in the faction was Masumi Ezaki, former vice premier, who just retired at the time of election for the House of Representatives in July. Ezaki, who had left the Fujiyama faction and joined the Tanaka faction, acted like a legal guardian for Ozawa. As if to return favors he received in the past, Ozawa had Ezaki's fourth son, Tetsuma, run for election as a candidate from his own party, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]. Toshihiro Nikai, who entered the political world after having served as Ezaki's secretary, also joined Shinseito and has become one of Ozawa's trusted young associates. Ezaki is an important connection for Ozawa although he chose a separate way when the Takeshita faction was formed. It is a well-known fact that Ozawa's wife, Kazuko, is a daughter of the president of Fukuda-gumi in Niigata, who was a financial supporter of Kakuei Tanaka. Through this marriage, Ozawa not only strengthened his relationship with Tanaka, but also formed a new bond with Noboru Takeshita -- they became distant relatives when a sister of Ozawa's wife was married to Takeshita's brother, Meguru. Second-generation Dietmen are also important among Ozawa's political associates. Soon after he was elected as a Dietman for the first time, Ozawa began to cultivate friendships with those young Dietmen who are second- generation politicians as he is. He probably felt close to them because they were in the same age group and hadn't been affected by local politicking. These Dietmen include Tsutomu Hata, Ryutaro Hashimoto, and Keizo Obuchi, all from the Tanaka faction, and Toshio Yamaguchi and Koichi Kato from other factions. Hata is a contemporary of Ozawa; Hashimoto and Obuchi are two terms senior; Yamaguchi is one term senior; and Kato is one term junior to Ozawa. Hata, Hashimoto, and Obuchi were Ozawa's "comrades" when the Takeshita faction was formed from the Tanaka faction. At the time of the breakup of the Takeshita faction at the end of 1992, Ozawa acted together with Hata, but fought and parted with Hashimoto and Obuchi. Hata and Ozawa won their first election campaign in 1992 and became cabinet members for the first time in the same year. Although they are rivals, they are close friends, calling each other as "It-chan" and "Tsutomu-chan." Yamaguchi formed the Shinjiyu Club [New Liberal Club], and had been distant from Ozawa and the others. But suddenly, he became close to Ozawa again when Ozawa was secretary general of the LDP. At some point, he used to frequent and stay in the secretary general's office. Then, during the vote of no-confidence in the Miyazawa cabinet during a plenary session of the House of Representatives that prompted Ozawa and others to form Shinseito, he voted for no-confidence and left the LDP. Although he doesn't belong to any political party at present, rumors strongly suggest that he will join Shinseito in the near future. On the other hand, Kato and Ozawa used to be good friends until a few years ago, writing each other's name in the friendship column of a political news magazine. But they parted with each other because Kato became a member of the anti-political reform and anti-Takeshita faction group in order to back Miyazawa. At one point, Ozawa even tried to approach Yohei Kono, who was Kato's rival within the Miyazawa faction. Aside from the second-generation Dietmen, Ozawa is on good terms with three of the so-called seven magistrates of the Takeshita faction -- Seiroku Kajiyama, Kozo Watanabe, and Keiwa Okuda. Although he joined the effort to form the Takeshita faction rather late, Okuda quickly became close to Kanemaru and Ozawa. Since then, he was one of the first to advocate restructuring of the political world, and when Shinseito was formed in July he spoke up strongly for leaving the LDP and joining Shinseito. He is the foremost supporter of the Ozawa line in the party. Watanabe has also been an Ozawa sympathizer for a long time. He and Ozawa share the same birthday, with a 10-year difference in age, and have thrown a joint birthday party every year. Among the young Dietmen from Shinseito, four individuals -- Hajime Funada, Keisuke Nakanishi, Hiroshi Kumagai, and Toshiro Nikai -- are highly regarded as Ozawa's close associates. Funada served as the director of the Ozawa Committee. Since then, he has been close to Ozawa and frequently appears on TV as a substitute for Ozawa. Upholding His Principle for Human Relations Nakanishi and Kumagai play the roles of "Suke-san and Kaku-san" [trusted assistants who served Lord Komon Mito during the Edo period]. Having served as deputy secretary general under LDP secretary general Ozawa, Nakanishi is like a leader of Ozawa's action corps. Kumagai, a former bureaucrat at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, has been acting as Ozawa's right-hand man in foreign affairs, accompanying Ozawa on his trips to the former Soviet Union and other countries or preparing for his visits beforehand in these countries. A close associate of Ozawa worth special mention here is Sadao Hirano, a Dietman in the House of Councilors. He served as secretary to Shigesaburo Maeo, former speaker of the House of Representatives, and as a house committee chairman. He has been a friend of Ozawa since Ozawa was chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration. He is said to be well informed of stories behind the stories in the political world as well as political machinations, and as such he is the best source of information for Ozawa on everything from how to handle legislative proposals to political reform. As mentioned earlier, he is the one who created the "John Manjiro Historical Group." One of the main characteristics of Ozawa's human relations is that he has many strong sympathizers outside his own political party and faction. Especially famous is his close friendship with Yuichi Ichikawa, secretary general of Komeito, and Takeshi Yonezawa, general secretary of the Democratic Socialist Party. They not only play pivotal roles in the coalition government, but also form the center of the stormy movement toward political restructuring--they are trying to develop a group of unified candidates to create a new New Party. Ozawa's friendship with Ichikawa and Yonezawa originates in spring 1992 when they had heated discussions night after night on the issue of additional financial aid in the amount of $9 billion for the Gulf war -- they eventually materialized this additional aid. They are good friends, enjoying singing occasionally at Karaoke bars. This is a typical example of Ozawa's way of developing human relations -- mixing "reason" and "emotion." There were also some young Dietmen in the SDPJ who sympathized with Ozawa on the political reform issue. They are Nobutaka Tsutsui, Yoshito Sengoku, and Shuo Matsubara, all of whom lost in the last election due to the waning popularity of the SDPJ. Matsubara, however, decided to leave the SDPJ and is planning to run in the next election as a candidate from the Shinseito. Finally, let's examine the flaws and weaknesses in Ozawa's people connections. As mentioned at the beginning of this article, when Ozawa believes he is right, he tends to cut people off, saying, "If you don't agree with me, you don't have to stay with me." This creates animosity toward Ozawa and drives his once close associates to leave him at once. Koichi Kato is a good example. Also, Kishiro Nakamura and Kenzo Muraoka, who had been considered as Ozawa's close associates along with Nakanishi during their years in the Takeshita faction, became strongly against Ozawa when the Takeshita faction broke up in 1992. This is a danger that is always present in Ozawa politics. However, one young Dietmen from Shinseito says, "Mr. Ozawa is not the type of person who will bend his principle for the sake of human relations. Even if he goes into pieces in terms of his human relations, he will have to go forward. The question is how many people will be able to follow him then."
