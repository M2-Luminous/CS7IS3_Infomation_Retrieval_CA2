Today, the State Environmental Protection Bureau set up a Chang Jiang and Three Gorges ecological environment monitoring network in Chongqing in order to more intensively and effectively monitor and manage the ecological environment along the Chang Jiang and in the Three Gorges area. Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the State Environmental Protection Bureau, said at today's inauguration meeting that the establishment of such a monitoring network is a major step toward increasing and intensifying environmental monitoring in the Chang Jiang valley as a whole. The network will enable us to closely trace the ecological and environmental changes in the Chang Jiang valley while the Three Gorges project is under construction and after it has been completed and put into operation. It will promote the implementation of the measures for preventing ecological destruction and environmental pollution and will promote the restoration of the benign ecological environment. At present, China's environmental protection institutions have set up more than 150 environmental monitoring stations along the trunk stream and tributaries of the Chang Jiang to monitor the atmospheric quality, acid rain levels, water quality, soil quality, and biological and ecological conditions. The Chang Jiang and Three Gorges ecological environment monitoring network will be developed on the basis of these existing monitoring stations. The first group of members of the network will be composed of 25 environmental monitoring stations in Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, and Shanghai.
