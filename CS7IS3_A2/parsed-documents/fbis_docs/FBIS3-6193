Hwang Chang-yop, North Korean Workers' Party secretary in charge of international affairs, visited Vietnam from March 7-10 to find out how Hanoi improved relations with Washington in resuming economic cooperation. Vietnam's example in enhancing relations with the United States may have served as a valuable case study for North Korea, an official at the National Unification Board (NUB) said. Hwang met with senior officials from the Vietnamese Communist Party to discuss the issue of returning the remains of U.S. soldiers killed during the Korean war (1950-53). After visiting Vietnam, Hwang stopped over in Laos on March 11 to negotiate North Korean purchases of Laotian rice. The NUB official said, "we are taking note that Hwang, who is a mastermind of North Korean diplomacy, visited these countries shortly before the meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly is to be held." The Assembly usually meets to deal with party reorganization and the budget and to make decisions on important matters.
