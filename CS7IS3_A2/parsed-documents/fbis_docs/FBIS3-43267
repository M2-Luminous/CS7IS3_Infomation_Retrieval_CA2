The war continues, carrying in its midst destruction, grief, misery, and suffering to millions of Angolans. Nonetheless, I believe the situation will soon be overcome because our people have always been able to resolve their problems by themselves, however big the obstacles and the difficulties they face. On this occasion, which should be one of joy for all, I would like to convey a message of comfort and hope to all those who have been forced to leave their homes or live in locations and provinces occupied by National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] troops. I refer in particular to the war orphans. I would also like to salute Angolan and international organizations for everything they have done to relieve the suffering of those Angolans. We are all aware that for legitimate reasons, the government has not been able to fully implement the program of action of the party that won the September 1992 elections. In practice, that program has been replaced by specific measures of an emergency nature designed to minimize major shortcomings. Although one still sees a degree of slackness on the part of certain government officials over the implementation of urgent tasks that have been planned, I am confident that the situation will be overcome, and that the government will be more efficient to ensure a better performance of the country's political and socioeconomic sectors. It is imperative that our government continues to ensure the functioning of democratic institutions, self-defense operations against UNITA's military forces, and to promote effective productive measures, giving priority to those sectors that cater for the basic social requirements of the people. In addition to other parties and political forces, the government has the great responsibility of organizing, encouraging, and mobilizing citizens for productive work as a precondition for the effective enhancement of their salaries, and improvement of their living conditions. To achieve that, we need capable and active cadres because the successful implementation of the socioeconomic development program for 1994 depends on them. This program calls for effective work and the socioeconomic enhancement of Angola as a whole, particularly the areas of greater potential. The implementation of that program is linked to the strengthening of the state's democratic authority, the structural adjustment of the economy, and the integration of Angolans into the national economy which is now market orientated. In so doing, Angolans will be assured of their social and economic upliftment, thus promoting real growth for the stability of the country. In that context, agriculture will be the basis of food security and economic growth. Petroleum and mining will finance development, and education and health will be the conduit for professional training and social participation of citizens in the development process. This is a challenge that the government ought to be able to accomplish as soon as possible. Other issues like the privatization of property, land utilization, housing, and construction and related materials will also require the government's great attention so that the policies to be adopted and the tasks to be accomplished suit the strategic interests of the state and the needs of the people. The process of economic transformation will continue with a view to favoring private initiative. That, however, does not mean that the state should withdraw completely from the productive economic sector. The state ought to be capable of either replacing or complementing private initiative when the latter shows no interest in less attractive activities, but which are essential for development. Obviously, the scope and complexity of those and other tasks call for an efficient, operational, and sound government, as well as an efficient public administration. It is, therefore, imperative to redefine the policy on cadres and salaries, while continuing to introduce indispensable changes to overcome stagnation and indiscipline. In tandem with the implementation of the socioeconomic development program and other urgent measures covering the various sectors, the organization of the armed forces and of the security and internal order services ought to be stepped up. It is only in an atmosphere of calm and social peace that the government can continue to implement the emergency measures designed to halt the worsening of the situation and to create conditions to reactivate economic development on a short-term basis. Over the past year the police general command made a praiseworthy effort to purge its ranks of undesirable and pernicious elements. Despite material shortcomings and the difficult living conditions of many of the command's staff members, I urge it to continue with the purging of such elements from the police ranks. The people want an organized, loyal, disciplined, and vigilant police that ensure tranquility of citizens, and see to it that social and private property is protected. The new Angolan armed forces have brilliantly accomplished their mission. I am convinced that they will continue to defend our people by holding on firmly to their positions on the ground and preventing further advances by UNITA's military forces. The Ministry of Defense and the General Staff of the Armed Forces should, therefore, continue with their efforts to organize and discipline the Angolan Armed Forces, seeing to it that their equipment and personnel are better controlled, and that the National Assembly approves the legislation required for the strengthening of their role. Excellencies, there can be no lasting solutions to the current crisis unless they are followed by the creation of an atmosphere of peace and national reconciliation. That is the ultimate goal of the ongoing Lusaka talks. In its strategic agenda for the resolution of the postelectoral crisis, the government still believes that the Bicesse Accord is the legal and political framework, and the relevant UN Security Council resolutions the international legal and political basis of the Angolan peace process. So, I feel that only the demilitarization of UNITA, the fulfillment of outstanding aspects of the Bicesse Accord, and, as a consequence, national reconciliation are the fundamental premises that guarantee peace and the country's stability. In addition to that, there ought to be adherence to the principle of respect for democracy by acknowledging the power of law as legitimized by the people's verdict during the 29-30 September 1992 elections. These have resulted in power being legally in the hands of the majority, with the rights of the minority being respected. That experience has taught us that the factors leading to the collapse of the Bicesse Accord included, in addition to UNITA's bad faith, the profound mistrusts between the sides, the extremely short timetables for the execution of essential tasks, the lack of a budget to cover expenditure, the lack of resources to finance all the operations, and the inadequate personnel of the UN Angola Verification Mission-2. New efforts should be made to avoid the same situation once the Bicesse Accord is revived and implemented. So, it is indispensable that we define realistic timetables for the planning and execution of organizational, political, and material tasks to be carried out by the government, the United Nations, and the international community to ensure the implementation of the future political commitments to be made by the government and UNITA. The international community ought to be aware of the costs and logistical difficulties posed by every aspect of a peace operation in Angola and should take steps to give its contribution. Obviously, the government will not evade its responsibilities. In its plan of action, the government will try to consider every aspect of promoting stability and harmony in the country. I think that the Angolan people will also give their support when the time comes. The great political awareness that the majority of our people have already shown will once again permit them to distinguish between fair solutions and measures that are useless and serve only to promote chaos and anarchy. We will continue our efforts to find a fair and lasting solution to the Angolan dispute, but while that does not come about, I urge you to be vigilant, to be even more committed to the upholding of democracy, freedom, and the interests of the Angolan people. Let us put aside all the artificial factors that have led to misunderstanding and mistrust and begin the new year, bearing always in mind the sacred values of national unity and love for the fatherland. United, our people will win. United, our people will fulfill their dream of peace and prosperity. A happy new year. [applause]
