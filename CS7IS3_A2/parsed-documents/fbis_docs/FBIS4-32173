Speaking at a press conference after a meeting with his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec, Kukan said there existed positive signs that the treaty would be concluded. The key points of the treaty are recognition of the existing border and guarantees of ethnic minorities. The treaty has been under preparation for a long time now, but the minority policy of the former government of Vladimir Meciar and some stands on the same question of the previous Hungarian government had not allowed its signature. "We have already been preparing the text of the treaty and I believe that talks on it will start immediately after the (new) Hungarian government starts functioning," Kukan said. Kukan and Zieleniec today signed an addendum to the October 29, 1992 Czech-Slovak agreement abolishing the visa duty. The addendum brings the border and customs regime on the Czech- Slovak border closer to European standards. It allows citizens from third countries to cross the Czech-Slovak border at specified crossings which is to allow better control of migration. Kukan also met today Chairman of the Czech parliament Milan Uhde.
