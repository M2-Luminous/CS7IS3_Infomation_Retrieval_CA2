A U.S. delegation led by assistant trade representative Dorothy Dwoskin will arrive in Beijing on February 20 to pay a four-day visit to China at the invitation of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC). During their stay in Beijing, Dorothy and her party will talk with a Chinese delegation headed by Gu Yongjiang, vice minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation, on the restoration of China's signatory party status in GATT. This will be the first round of talks between the two countries on the issue after the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT. An official with MOFTEC said that China attached great importance to this round of talks, and will exchange views with the U.S. delegation on issues of common concern as well as how to accelerate China's re-entry into GATT. The official added that the two-day talks will also make preparation for the 16th meeting of the China working party on GATT scheduled to be launched in March in Geneva. The first round of Sino-U.S. talks on China's re-entry into GATT was held in November, 1986.
