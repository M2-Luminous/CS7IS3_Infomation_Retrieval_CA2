It was decided last week to increase these almost threefold. One of the main reasons was Moldova's chronic indebtedness for fuels imported from Russia and other CIS countries. The republican federation of independent trade unions sharply criticized the price rises, with the federation's leaders threatening to organize mass demonstrations. Trade union leaders say that the majority of the population today cannot pay for housing and services even at the old prices, and can hardly make ends meet because of growing unemployment and low wages. Within the next 10 days a government commission hopes to find a way out of the situation, though this very day the government informed citizens that Moldova owes the Russian Federation Gasprom joint-stock company about 200 billion rubles for gas alone.
