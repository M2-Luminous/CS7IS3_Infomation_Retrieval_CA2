Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo said that North Korea's decision will considerably diffuse tension in the Korean peninsula and ease the concerns of the countries in the region. Romulo said North Korea's move may have nipped U.S.-led efforts to push for sanctions against the communist state; this is, if it continues to refuse inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency.
