FR940302-2-00077 FR940302-2-00057 Immigration and Naturalization Service [INS No. 1400LI&hyph;94; AG Order No. 1854&hyph;94] [RIN 1115&hyph;AC30] Extension of Designation of Liberia Under Temporary Protected Status Program AGENCY: Immigration and Naturalization Service, Justice. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice extends, until March 28, 1995, the Attorney General's designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected Status program provided for in section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (Act). Accordingly, eligible aliens who are nationals of Liberia, or who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in Liberia, may re-register for Temporary Protected Status and extension of employment authorization. This re-registration is limited to persons who already registered for the initial period of Temporary Protected Status, which ended on March 27, 1992. In addition during the extension period, some aliens may be eligible for late initial registration pursuant to 8 CFR 240.2(f)(2). EFFECTIVE DATES: This designation is effective on March 29, 1994, and will remain in effect until March 28, 1995. Re-registration procedures become effective on March 3, 1994, and will remain in effect until April 4, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ronald Chirlin, Senior Immigration Examiner, Immigration and Naturalization Service, room 7123, 425 I Street, NW., Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514&hyph;5014. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under section 244A of the Act, as amended by section 302(a) of Public Law 101&hyph;649 and section 304(b) of Public Law 102&hyph;232 (8 U.S.C. 1254a), the Attorney General is authorized to grant Temporary Protected Status in the United States to eligible aliens who are nationals of a foreign state designated by the Attorney General, or who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in that state. The Attorney General so designates a state, or a part thereof, upon finding that the state is experiencing ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or certain other extraordinary and temporary conditions that prevent nationals or residents of the country from returning in safety. Effective on March 27, 1991, the Attorney General designated Liberia for Temporary Protected Status for a period of 12 months, 56 FR 12746. The Attorney General extended the designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected Status program for additional 12-month periods until March 28, 1993, 57 FR 2932, and until March 28, 1994, 58 FR 7898. This notice extends the designation of Liberia under the Temporary Protected Status program for an additional 12 months, in accordance with sections 244A(b)(3) (A) and (C) of the Act. This notice also describes the procedures with which eligible aliens who are nationals of Liberia, or who have no nationality and who last habitually resided in Liberia, must comply in applying for continuation of Temporary Protected Status. In addition to timely re-registrations and late re-registrations authorized by this notice's extension of Liberia's Temporary Protected Status designation, late initial registrations are possible for some Liberians as the result of addition of 8 CFR 240.2(f)(2) under the interim rule published in the Federal Register on November 5, 1993, at 58 FR 58935&hyph;58938. Such late initial registrants must still meet the initial presence requirement for all Liberians and the status requirements contained in the November 5, 1993, interim rule. Notice of Extension of Designation of Liberia Under Temporary Protected Status Program By the authority vested in me as Attorney General under section 244A of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and pursuant to sections 244A(b)(3) (A) and (C) of the Act, I have determined that, as a result of the ongoing civil unrest in that country, there still exist extraordinary and temporary conditions in Liberia that prevent aliens who are nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, from returning to Liberia in safety. I have further determined that permitting nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, to remain temporarily in the United States, is not contrary to the national interest of the United States. Accordingly, it is ordered as follows: (1) The designation of Liberia under section 244A(b) of the Act is extended for an additional 12-month period from March 29, 1994, to March 28, 1995. (2) I estimate that there are approximately 4000 nationals of Liberia, and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia, who have been granted Temporary Protected Status and who are eligible for re-registration.
