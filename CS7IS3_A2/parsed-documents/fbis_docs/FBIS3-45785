Under a decree of the State Council, membership of the CAS is the highest academic title in China, representing the highest scientific honor and supreme academic authority of the country. "The CAS members are now completely on an equal footing with academicians of other countries," a spokesman for the CAS said. The spokesman said that the academician system will promote China's scientific and technological exchanges with other countries and is consonant with the country's reform and opening endeavors. It also indicates China's ever-increasing academic strength and burgeoning of talent, he said. The CAS, which was founded in November 1949, now has 545 members, or academicians as they are officially called now.
