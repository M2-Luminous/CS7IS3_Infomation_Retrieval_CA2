He is due to take part in the meeting of the heads of state and government of the member countries of the European Union which is to be held on the island of Corfu. The Russian president is expected to sign an agreement on partnership and cooperation between Russia and the European Union. For the first time in the history of the European Union, a Russian president will attend its summit, take part in its work and sign an agreement which is designed to bring closer the countries of the once-split European continent. Boris Yeltsin will also be present at the state dinner which Greek Prime-Minister Andreas Papandreou will give in honour of the heads of state and government of the countries-members of the European Union. The signing of an agreement with the European Union does not mean for Russia an automatic membership of this prestigious club, Boris Yeltsin said at a press conference in the Kremlin ahead of his trip to Corfu. But it will certainly mark the first step made by the European Community since the fall of the Iron Curtain towards the recognition of Russia as a full-fledged partner in the political and economic spheres. The signing of the agreement provides for free trade between the European Union and Russia from 1998, if Russia fulfills a number of obligations before its partners. The European Union will grant Russia the benefits now enjoyed by its member countries under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Russia's way towards cooperation with the European Union was and remains far from smooth. Russia was granted the right to sign an accord with the European Union a short time ago after France lifted its objections to the sale of Russian uranium on the external market and President Yeltsin signed a decree allowing foreign banks into Russia. Many more barriers will have to be cleared before Russia becomes a full-fledged participant in the club.
