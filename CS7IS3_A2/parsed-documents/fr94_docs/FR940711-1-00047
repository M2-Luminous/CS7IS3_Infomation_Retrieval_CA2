FR940711-1-00047 FR940711-1-00012 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 49 CFR Part 571 [Docket No. 94&hyph;56; Notice 1] RIN 2127&hyph;AF01 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Air Over Hydraulic Brake Systems AGENCY: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Department of Transportation. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This notice responds to a petition submitted by John Kourik. The notice proposes to amend the requirements in Standard No. 121, Air Brake Systems, to include a definition of air-over-hydraulic brake subsystems. The agency believes that this proposed definition would clarify the classification of vehicles equipped with these subsystems and thus eliminate the need for manufacturers to request, and the agency to respond to, interpretations about them. DATES: Comments. Comments must be received on or before September 9, 1994. Proposed Effective Date. The proposed amendments in this notice would become effective 30 days after publication of a final rule in the Federal Register . ADDRESSES: Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbers above and be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590. Docket hours are 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Chris Tinto, Office of Vehicle Safety Standards, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590 (202&hyph;366&hyph;5229). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Air-over-hydraulic brake systems typically consist of an air brake system from the treadle valve to an air brake chamber that provides the mechanical force to actuate a hydraulic-operated master cylinder. In turn, the hydraulic master cylinder actuates the brake shoes or pads. The air brake chamber unit combined with the hydraulic-operated master cylinder is called the ``power cluster'' and generally serves as the separating point between the air- and hydraulic-actuated portions of the air-over-hydraulic brake system. Air-over-hydraulic brake systems are installed on about one percent of medium and heavy trucks sold in the United States. This percentage represents about 2,000 vehicles, most of which are Class 6 vehicles with gross vehicle weight ratings (GVWRs) between 19,501 and 26,000 pounds.
