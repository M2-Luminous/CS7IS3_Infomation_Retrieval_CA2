The practically simultaneous announcements made by the president and the speaker on the need for such a step makes one think of the classic question--"To whose advantage is that"? From the viewpoint of common sense, the need to form a cabinet with the unclear chances of the current president in the elections appears sufficiently doubtful. It is understandable that Leonid Kravchuk is specifically the one standing to lose the least of all from the possible consequences of such a step. His actions fit ideally within the scheme of the pre-election struggle--the president is so certain of himself that he is already forming a government with which he will work in the future. In case of victory this will serve to enhance his popularity, while if he comes in last there is nothing to lose. The only miscalculation by the president is his recognition of the Supreme Council. Up to now Leonid Makarovich has practically ignored the parliament. Kravchuk's answer to a question from a deputy--"Why didn't you congratulate us on our election?" is quite indicative. The president allowed himself a joke in the Odessa style: "If that would help you with your work I would be congratulating you three times every day." Since Leonid Kravchuk is proposing a candidate for premier to the Supreme Council, he consequently recognizes the fact of its existence and the role it is called upon to play. That is an insignificant miscalculation--should Leonid Kravchuk become president once again he will have to deal with parliament in one way or another anyway. The advantages that will be gained by the Supreme Council and concretely by Aleksandr Moroz are quite doubtful. Moroz, of course, could have made such announcements on purely propagandistic grounds--you see, despite everything, we are insisting on decisive actions, the first of which is replacement of the government. By the way, it is possible to delay such activity, since two weeks in "big politics" mean nothing. If the government is selected before the presidential elections, the Supreme Council will find itself in a difficult situation--it bears responsibility for the government. All the presidential candidates, including Leonid Makarovich, would be very happy with such a turn of events. The fact that a government exists affords the possibility of getting a rest from pre-election battles and marshalling strength for the coming struggle. At the same time everything that is taking place in the country can be calmly written off to the government and the parliament that has joined it. Moreover, the existence of a "people's" government simply condemns the future president to a struggle with parliament (with the exception of the case when Moroz himself becomes president, which is unlikely). The result of that struggle is known beforehand--executive power always wins in the struggle between authorities inasmuch as it has greater mobility. It is also necessary to take into account our own specifics, which are that it is practically impossible to have the president resign. It is possible to allow that Aleksandr Aleksandrovich's goal is to discredit Leonid Makarovich yet again, rejecting all his nominees for the post of premier. But in reality Kravchuk only stands to gain from such a biathlon--everyone already knows of his "decisiveness" and "desire to work," while those who doubt this will also take the side of the president inasmuch as psychologically the position of the proposing side is the winning one. In addition to that, the speaker must be interested in such an active struggle with the president, that is, he must have a certain understanding with the other proposed candidate--Leonid Kuchma. For Kuchma, in turn, the stake in such a game may be nothing less than his loyalty to the Supreme Council, while any gain is quite insignificant, if it exists at all.
