He stressed that we should regard raising economic efficiency as our central task to enhance progress. He said: To accelerate progress, we must uphold the principle of seeking truth from facts and proceed to perform all our tasks in a down-to-earth manner. We definitely cannot blindly compete for rates of progress. After integrating speed, efficiency, quality, and the market in accordance with the actual conditions of various trades and localities, we should strive to raise efficiency in an effort to accomplish rapid progress within our reach. China's Industrial Economy Society is a national mass organization voluntarily formed by representatives from large and medium state industrial enterprises and industrial enterprises under other ownerships; scientific research and designing units; industrial economic research groups; relevant state departments; and renowned figures from industrial and economic circles. In the five years since its establishment, it has achieved enormous accomplishments in providing two-way services for the government and grass-roots units. The purpose of the national congress and the second national executive meeting is to summarize past work and study concepts for future tasks. In his speech at the meeting, Bo Yibo stressed two issues: 1. The necessity of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control; and 2. correctly handling the relationship between speed and efficiency. Addressing the first issue, Bo Yibo said: Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress in 1993, China reported rapid economic progress, reform was carried out in an all-around manner, and the overall economy progressed favorably. In an effort to resolve acute contradictions and problems since the beginning of last summer, the party Central Committee and State Council promptly deepened reform and have taken mainly economic measures to strengthen macroeconomic regulation and control. We have attained positive results. While fully affirming the results, we should also soberly notice: We have yet to thoroughly resolve many deep-seated problems in economic work, and many macroeconomic regulatory and control measures are merely temporary solutions that do not effect a permanent cure. Our ultimate goal is to reform the economic structure thoroughly and to establish a socialist market economic structure. What merits our attention today is the continued pressure of inflation and strains on the macroeconomy as a result of the overextended or evergrowing investment scale of fixed assets and high price hikes in the markets. Such a phenomenon is unavoidable in the process of establishing a socialist market economy in China. Experience shows that the pace of marketization must be commensurate with the ability of macroeconomic regulation and control. A greater ability in macroeconomic regulation and control can reduce problems and make their solution easier. At the present, macroeconomic regulation and control should be focused on strictly controlling the investment scale of fixed assets. We should leave some margin in our construction scale, which must be compatible with our national strength. We should not rely on excessive issuance of money to "keep up" with the evergrowing construction scale. We must implement to the letter and in all economic sectors and all fields of work the series of macroeconomic regulatory and control policy measures which have been meticulously drawn up by the party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, for thoroughly reforming the economic structure. It is absolutely not allowed to continue the practice of "getting around the central authorities' policies with countermeasures," and to ignore the order and do things one's own way. We must consider the overall interests and safeguard the party central committee's authority. Discussing the question of how to correctly handle the relationship between speed and efficiency, Bo Yibo pointed out: Growth rate and economic efficiency must be organically combined because development is the essential criterion. Since we have stressed efficiency and quality, we must strive to develop the export-oriented economy at a faster pace. This is Comrade Deng Xiaoping's consistent thought. To accurately and comprehensively understand this thought to ensure the organic combination of growth rate and economic efficiency is crucial for maintaining a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. In view of the already high national economic growth rate and of the rising enthusiasm in all sectors, it is necessary to emphasize the need to focus attention on raising economic efficiency. Compared with the developed countries, we do not see much change in our low industrial economic efficiency as reflected in such problems as seeking unduly high output value to the negligence of quality; blindly turning out what one can produce without considering market sales and demands; focusing attention only on expanding production scale while failing to optimizing economic structure; and competing with others for funds to launch construction projects without giving a thought to our national strength and financial and material resources. These problems, which actually reflect the maladies of the production-oriented economy and traditional planned economic structure over the years, have almost become chronic and stubborn diseases in some enterprises and localities, and have brought about serious consequences for the progress of our undertakings. With the development of a socialist market economy, we should say now is the time to wake up to reality. We must correctly and unmistakably understand the central committee's emphasis on seizing the opportunity and accelerating development, and should not one-sidedly understand it as a go-ahead signal to ignore the law on economic development and to seek an unduly high growth rate. The central committee's 8-9 percent targeted growth rate for the Eighth Five-Year Plan is both positive and prudent. We must see to it that the focus of economic work is truly shifted to the orbit centering on improved economic efficiency. If we develop the economy in this manner, even a 10 percent growth rate will still be solid and sound. An overextended scale of capital construction beyond the limit of our national strength will inevitably lead to readjustment of the growth rate, and will ultimately deprive us of the opportunity of development and delay the progress of our socialist modernization drive. Bo Yibo pointed out: To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency, it is imperative to implement the state's industrial policy by improving industrial structure, product mix, and organizational setup of enterprises. As far as industrial development is concerned, we should energetically solve problems such as basic industries -- energy and transportation in particular -- lagging behind the processing industry, overdeveloped and underdeveloped sectors in the processing industry, and low standards of specialization and socialization of enterprises, so as to bring about a marked improvement in the economic structure and to continually raise efficiency through optimizing structure. To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency, it is essential to promote scientific and technological progress and improve the quality of the work force. It is crucial that we rely on science and technology to educate and train a new generation of people who have ideals, general knowledge, and a sense of morality and discipline. We must be innovative in applying science and technology, and must gradually develop our own technology instead of relying mainly on imports so as to reduce our gap in science and technology with the developed countries. To ensure the organic combination of speed and efficiency, it is necessary to strengthen the management and operation of enterprises and strive to lower production costs. Commodities have no national boundaries, and the key to opening up export markets lies in improved quality. To this end, it is imperative to set up a modern enterprise management system and practice strict scientific management. It is also necessary to set eyes on the internal management of enterprises, economize, and raise labor productivity. In a sense, effective management can lead to improved efficiency. Bo Yibo emphasized: The road of development centering around improved economic efficiency is an arduous and complicated systems engineering project which requires our persistent efforts, continuous exploration in the course of practice, and summation of experiences in good time. Lu Dong, chairman of the China Industrial Economy Society, made a speech, entitled "Work Hard To Open Up a New Situation in Society's Work." Dong Shaohua, executive vice chairman of the society, delivered a work report on behalf of the society's Council. Today's meeting was attended by Duan Junyi, as well as officials from relevant departments under the State Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission. Ye Qing, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission, chaired today's meeting.
