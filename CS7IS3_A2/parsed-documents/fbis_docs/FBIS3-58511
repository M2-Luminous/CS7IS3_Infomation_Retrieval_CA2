The prime minister opted Britain out of EU [European Union] decision-making on social matters like workers' rights. But Greek Social Affairs Minister Vangelis Giannopoulos [name as received] has told British socialist Euro MPs that he would be pressing for decisions by the other 11 member states if necessary. The other states have been reluctant to invoke a social policy without Britain, on the grounds that it would lead to a damaging rift within the Community. But Mr. Giannopoulos, who will be chairing EU meetings on social issues for the next six months while Greece holds the EU Presidency, said: "It is difficult to move away from the system of unanimity. But I will bring these things forward and get a decision even if that means just 11." He told Euro-socialists in Athens: "I hope I will be successful. Perhaps the British Labour Party will come into government and Britain will rejoin the ranks." Labour Euro MP David Martin said: "The Major government has blocked and frustrated attempts to create a genuine European social policy. "It is time for the other 11 governments to say loud and clear that they will no longer tolerate the UK preventing the Community from making progress on rights of temporary and part-time workers, protection of young workers, fair pay and parental leave."
