FBIS3-48250 "dreas016__a94008" FBIS-EAS-94-016-A Document Type:Daily Report 25 January 1994 ANNEX Japan Diet Members Surveyed on Parties' Plans OW2001003994 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 17 Jan 94 Morning Edition p 2 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW2001003994 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] A recent YOMIURI SHIMBUN survey of Diet members finds that Shinseito, Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP] hope to establish a "two-party system" by unifying the current coalition parties into a new-new party, while the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] and Sakigake [Harbinger Party] want to establish a "moderate multiparty system." The survey thus indicates that the intracoalition view on regrouping the political parties is divided. Fifty percent of the Diet members responding to the survey predict either the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the SDPJ -- which hold the key to regrouping the political parties -- will split, indicating they feel the second stage of the political realignment is drawing near. Possible Structure of the Future Political World Asked what is the most desirable structure for the future political world, 17.6 percent of the respondents said they hope the current coalition parties will be unified into a new-new party, followed by 9.1 percent who hope to see the current ruling coalition divided into two groups -- a "Shinseito-Komeito" group and a "SDPJ-Japan New Party [JNP]-Sakigake" group. Most of the responding members belonging to Shinseito, Komeito, and the DSP said they hope to establish a "two-party" system -- the ruling parties versus the LDP. Particularly, this view was supported by nearly 60 percent of Komeito and over 40 percent of DSP respondents. Meanwhile, most of the responding members who belong to the SDPJ and Sakigake said they hope to establish a new party composed of the SDPJ, Sakigake, and the JNP, followed by establishment of a "moderate multiple-party system." The survey thus shows that views on the regrouping of the political parties are clearly divided. Such a division of views is particularly seen among lower house members who belong to the ruling parties. The survey shows that responding members belonging to the JNP are also divided into advocates of a "two-party system" and advocates of a "multiple-party system." As far as the LDP is concerned, most of the responding members said they hope to see the ruling parties split into three groups -- the SDPJ, Shinseito-Komeito, and Sakigake-JNP. As to how the actual structure of the political world should be, the respondents' answers varied, differing with their desired structure for the political world. Most of the responding members belonging to Shinseito predict the LDP and SDPJ would split and eventually link up with Shinseito and Komeito respectively. A prevailing prediction within Komeito responding members is that the ruling parties would break in two -- the SDPJ and another group. However, among all respondents the percentage of those who "refused to answer" the question on the realignment of the political parties totalled over 50 percent. In particular, the percentage of SDPJ respondents who refused to answer totalled 69.9 percent, indicating they still do not have clear prospects of the future political world because the possibility of passing the political reform-related bills remains uncertain. Possible Split of the LDP and SDPJ As regards the possible split of the LDP and SDPJ, which has played a central role in politics since 1955, the percentage of those who feel either or both of the parties will split totalled about 50 percent. As far as upper house members who responded to the survey are concerned, 40.8 percent said they predict the split of the LDP or SDPJ. Such a percentage totalled 55.3 percent among lower house members, who will have to campaign under the single-seat constituency system combined with proportional representation if the political reform bills are passed. Thus, the survey results indicate that possible reform of the electoral system will have an impact on the Diet members' prospects of the future political situation. Among all respondents, 20.6 percent said both the LDP and SDPJ would split, 5.9 percent said only the LDP would split, and 23.6 percent said only the SDPJ would split. Particularly among responding members belonging to Shinseito, the JNP, and Sakigake, the percentage of those predicting that either or both the LDP and SDPJ would split totalled about 70 percent. Among respondents belonging to Shinseito and the JNP, the percentage of those predicting "both the LDP and SDPJ would split" totalled over 40 percent, thus reflecting their hope to expand their influence over the move to regroup the political parties. Among respondents belonging to the SDPJ -- whose serious intraparty discord over its own position within the coalition government was revealed at a recent party convention -- one out of five respondents said a party split is inevitable. This proves the party is in serious condition. Many respondents belonging to other parties also predict the split of the SDPJ rather than the LDP.
