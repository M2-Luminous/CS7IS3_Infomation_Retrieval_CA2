What about you? [Rossel] We foresaw this turn of events. Although, in campaigning for a real regional policy, we acted strictly within the framework of the then-Constitution and were aware that this would meet with opposition from certain people and political structures at the center. What is the result? A quite successful Oblast Soviet was dissolved. The population was disappointed. And this disappointment resulted in just 49 percent of the oblast's inhabitants turning up at polling stations in December. [Tsukanova] How do you explain the president's decision? [Rossel] I think that the president has not hitherto been given any logical and complete information about our initiatives and actions. We have even encountered a situation where officials who came along to investigate acted in accordance with the well-known principle: "We have not read your constitution, but we condemn it." But, to be serious, I am convinced that there are people who were very interested in capturing Sverdlovsk Oblast from the president. And they attained their objective.... [Tsukanova] Why did you decide to stand for the Federation Council? [Rossel] I supported the idea that leaders of the executive should not be part of the legislature. We have already endured that situation and nothing good came of it. And, after I was removed, I decided to take part in the elections in order to bring the idea of regional autonomy to its conclusion via the Federation Council. It is not only a matter of our oblast, it is a question of all 68 Russian oblasts, which still have even fewer rights than the republics. That must not be, just as there should not be loved and unloved children in a family. [Tsukanova] For various reasons public opinion is now more occupied with the situation in the State Duma. The Federation Council is somewhat in the background. How do you see the work of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly? [Rossel] The Federation Council is not politicized and that really counterbalances the Duma. It includes people from the localities who are not so much skilled speakers as responsible for the fate of the regions. People confronted with the territories' specific problems. They come face to face with all manner of obstacles and lack of laws, making it impossible to organize normal activity. I think that the Federation Council will have a sobering effect on the Duma deputies if the laws they formulate are adopted to suit the short-term political situation or if they fail to take regional interests into consideration. The Federation Council's standing orders and the organization of its apparatus are important (the apparatus does not now make provision for a structure tackling regional policy), what we need is a scheme for cooperating with the Duma, the president, and the government. All this has to be worked out. Standing orders should envisage total autonomy for the Federation Council. I am opposed to the Federation Council forming a bloc with the Duma, the government, etc. I think that everything that the Supreme Soviet did must be analyzed as a matter of urgency and the priorities determined -- which draft laws should be tackled first. The question of the Constitution, adopted in breach of the existing law on the referendum, will inevitably come up. It will either be necessary to adopt amendments to the law or seek another solution to the situation. Other matters of urgency include the laws on the fight against crime and precisely targeted social security for the population. These are laws necessary to ensure tranquillity in the country and stability in the state. [Tsukanova] You mentioned the autonomy of the Federation Council. However, many State Duma deputies think differently; they want to cooperate as actively as possible with their colleagues in the Federation Council or seek a common field of activity. In particular, as far as regional interests are concerned. Especially since a considerable proportion of Duma deputies have been elected by the territories. Do you intend, say, to cooperate with your Duma colleagues who were elected by Sverdlovsk Oblast? [Rossel] I don't see any difficulties or conflict in doing this. Not only do I intend to do so, but we have already begun to cooperate: We have founded the Ural deputies' assembly and intend to register it with the Ministry of Justice. This assembly is to comprise both Federation Council and State Duma deputies. We will have our parliamentary center equipped with its own computer system: Given that each deputy may have one or two assistants, we will select specialists. And the entire Ural region will know that that it can submit proposals and plans in need of legislative confirmation. This will be a center for public discussion of the draft laws being prepared by the parliament, a feedback mechanism. This kind of work is far more effective than hovering around microphones. There is sufficient intellectual potential in the Urals to provide legislators with effective aid. [Tsukanova] Moscow is always -- particularly now -- accused of focusing on elitist political problems and showing little interest in provincial life. What is life like now for the "rest" of Russia? What does it expect from deputies first and foremost? [Rossel] I would say that in terms of its political behavior Moscow has itself become a province. In terms of their view of economic reform and reform of the political authority the regions are now ahead. Not to mention their understanding of the crux of regional policy. There are simply not the people in Moscow to tackle this. Incidentally, Boris Yeltsin said this at an enlarged session of the Council of Ministers in November. There is nothing surprising in components of the Federation trying to change their status -- that is the result of government omissions in the regional sphere. What is life like for the provinces? As a candidate deputy I met a lot of people. The number-one question was social security. The weakest people -- and there are plenty of them in our country -- must not feel abandoned. Question number-two is how are we going to escape from the economic crisis. I am certain that we initially adopted the wrong way of reforming the economy. We took the political rather than the economic road, across the board. But I also know that we cannot interfere now and make any drastic changes. The worst thing would be for us to now start sharply twitching to the left, right, and backwards. Because we have taken this route, we must see it through to the end. Privatization cannot be halted. The efforts to stabilize the ruble must continue. The economy must be demonopolized and small and middling business developed: The steps now being taken to do this are patently inadequate. As for stabilizing decisions, I repeat, the first thing is to provide precisely targeted social security and then invest in individual capital construction, i.e., in housing. This must be done immediately. We must undoubtedly think over the state program for food safety. And the state security program as a whole: It is necessary to have it out with the Army and all the relevant structures. [Tsukanova] Do you think that society can count on the parliament's working fruitfully? If you had a chance to appeal to your deputy colleagues, what would you say to them? [Rossel] I would urge them to abandon politics and tackle the real problems facing society today. I would urge that there be no confrontations. We now have a legislative vacuum. We must tackle in earnest laws that would make it possible to advance economic and political reforms. It is this legislative work that will bear real fruit. [Rossel ends] Our Information: The Oblast Soviet was disbanded 10 November 1993 by edict of President Yeltsin shortly after the Oblast Soviet adopted the constitution of the Ural Republic, the constitution was revoked, and the governor of the nonexistent republic -- officially head of the Sverdlovsk Oblast administration -- Eduard Rossel, removed from his post. A routine planning session of the economic association of the Ural region that met the following day elected Rossel its president. He was previously the voluntary head of the association. And on 12 December, 61 percent of the oblast's population who turned out to vote elected the former head of the administration as their representative to the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly -- the Federation Council.
