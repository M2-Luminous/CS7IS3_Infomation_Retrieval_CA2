Mulino added that a pledged word "is written in stone," even if it is misinterpreted later. Mulino said that groundless reports on this subject have been spread because, when Panama offered to support the Costa Rican Government, Colombian President Cesar Gaviria's candidacy was anything but decided. Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin de Rubio visited Panama for a few hours to promote Gaviria's candidacy to this position, but Panama had already pledged its word for Costa Rica. According to Mulino, the U.S. position in promoting Gaviria's candidacy cannot be interpreted as "blackmail. Whether we like it or not, the United States is a country on our continent with the full right to vote for whichever candidate it chooses," Mulino said finally.
