FR940106-0-00050 FR940106-0-00016 42 CFR part 421 is amended as set forth below: PART 421_INTERMEDIARIES AND CARRIERS 1. The authority citation for part 421 continues to read as follows: Authority: Secs. 1102, 1815, 1816, 1833, 1834(a) and (h), 1842, 1861(u), 1871, 1874, and 1875 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395g, 1395h, 1395l, 1395m(a) and (h), 1395u, 1395x(u), 1395hh, 1395kk, and 1395ll), and 42 U.S.C. 1395b-1. 2. Section 421.3 is revised to read as follows: §421.3 Definitions. Intermediary means an entity that has a contract with HCFA to determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B benefits payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective Payment System for hospitals) and to perform other related functions. For purposes of designating regional or alternative regional intermediaries for home health agencies and of designating intermediaries for hospices under §421.117 as well as for applying the performance criteria in §421.120 and the performance standards in §421.122 and any adverse action resulting from such application, the term intermediary also means a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract approved by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to perform intermediary functions. §421.112 [Amended] 3. In §421.112(b), ``statistical standards'' is revised to read ``performance standards''. §421.118 [Amended] 4. In §421.118(b) ``statistical standards'' is revised to read ``performance standards''. 5. Section 421.122 is revised to read as follows: §421.122 Performance standards. (a) Development of standards. In addition to the performance criteria (§421.120), HCFA develops detailed performance standards for use in evaluating intermediary performance which may be based on historical performance, application of acceptable statistical measures of variation to nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, or changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are also developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or criterion. (b) Factors beyond intermediary's control. To identify measurable factors that significantly affect an intermediary's performance, but that are not within the intermediary's control, HCFA will_ (1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base period, and (2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing performance standards. (c) Publication of standards. The development and revision of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal fiscal year period of October 1&hyph;September 30, HCFA publishes the performance standards as part of the Federal Register notice describing the performance criteria issued under §421.120(c). HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new criteria and standards begins after the publication of the notice. 6. Section 421.124 is revised to read as follows: §421.124 Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and effectively. (a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in §§421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the Secretary or by HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with respect to a specific provider or class of providers, HCFA may reassign that provider or class of providers to another intermediary in accordance with §421.114. (b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the intermediary to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the amount which HCFA finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for adverse action. 7. In subpart C a new §421.201 is added to read as follows: §421.201 Performance criteria and standards. (a) Application of performance criteria and standards. As part of the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of the Act, HCFA periodically assesses the performance of carriers in their Medicare operations using performance criteria and standards. (1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of functional responsibilities such as_ (i) Accurate and timely payment determinations; (ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier concerns; and
