He pointed out that being on reinforced duty means reinforced security at a number of troop facilities to prevent seizures of weapons and hardware. "No concentration of forces from the other regions in Moscow is contemplated," the commander underlined. In his words, internal troops would be enlisted during the May Day celebrations to help the militia "as a reserve at the point of permanent deployment, as well as in separate regions in Moscow."
