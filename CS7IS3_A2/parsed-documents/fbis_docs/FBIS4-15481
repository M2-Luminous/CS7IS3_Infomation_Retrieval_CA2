"We harshly condemn this terrorist act, which led to human victims and express our condolences to the families of those killed," the head of the information and press department of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Grigory Karasin, told a briefing in Moscow Thursday. Karasin said "the event again raises the need to immediately carry out the measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories agreed on at the Palestinian-Israeli talks." "Russia proceeds from the fact that this terrorist act should not distract Palestinians and Israelis from their main goal, this being to continue negotiations on the temporary introduction of Palestinian self-government on the occupied territories in accordance with the Declaration of Principles," Karasin was quoted as saying. "Once again, we call on both sides to show the maximum restraint, self-control and political will to achieve mutually acceptable agreements within the framework of the Middle East peace process."
