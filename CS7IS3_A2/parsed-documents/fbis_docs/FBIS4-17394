He has stressed in an interview with INTERFAX that Russia could end the civil war in Tajikistan within a month, if it wished to. He did not rule out that the opposition might put pressure on the authorities in Dushanbe to speed up negotiations between the various Tajik factions. In his words, he has made this known to Albert Tchernyshev, a Russian foreign minister's assistant. He noted that Moscow, on which the fate of Tajikistan depended in many ways, belittle the significance and role of the opposition. "We do not want war and bloodshed, even though we are quite strong even in Dushanbe," he stressed. To prevent the talks between the various Tajik factions from being as protracted as the Georgian-Abkhazi negotiations, he suggested that they should involve the Kulyab clan, which is represented in all the power ministries in Tajikistan. He wished that Tajikistan would be a democracy, where the church be separated from the state. In his words, the opposition does not intend to advance Tajikistan theocratically on the threshold of the 21 century. He believes that Islamic traditions in the republic could be restored only "by people's will through referendums." "Even if we come to power through elections, we will not change such basic constitutional norms as the freedom of speech or alter the functioning of any parties", he said. "We cannot understand why Russians are scared by the revival of Islamic fundamentalism in Tajikistan. That does not correspond to reality," Turajonzod declared.
