This was announced by Julius Brocka, minister of labor, social affairs, and the family, in the course of yesterday's consultative meeting of economic ministers. The aim of wage regulation is not to freeze wages at their current level. As Minister Brocka stressed, under the proposed limit for wage growth [smerny rast], even companies that will be subject to the decree will be able to retain the real value of their employees' earnings. This means that, because an overall 17-percent growth of consumer prices is expected this year, even in wage-regulated organizations wages will be permitted to rise 17 percent. Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova specified, however, that the upper limit will be between 15 and 17 percent, so as to utilize the motivating nature of the restriction for labor productivity improvements. In compliance with the demands of social partners laid down in the General Agreement, the government decree will not apply to organizations that operate at a profit. Equally, it will have no impact on already transformed entities--that is, entities in which the stake of the state and of shareholders from coupon privatization is lower than 50 percent as well as entities in which foreign capital has an ownership stake in excess of 30 percent. There is one exception, however. Even profitable organizations in banking, the energy sector, and the water economy will not be permitted to exceed the set limit for wage growth because, as Julius Brocka said, the development of wages in these branches has broken loose.
