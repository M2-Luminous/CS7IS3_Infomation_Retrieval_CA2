The latest surge of the yen is chilling the sentiment of managers at small companies at a time when the Japanese economy is showing signs of picking up, the leaders of the four groups told International Trade and Industry Minister Eijiro Hata, the official said. The four groups, including the National Federation of Small Business Associations, made the request during a breakfast meeting with Hata and other top officials at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI). The groups called for strong dollar-buying market intervention by Japan and other major countries as one way to help arrest the yen's upswing, the MITI official told reporters. Hata told the business leaders he is gravely concerned about possible serious effects of the strong yen on small companies. MITI will do its best to help small firms tide over the strong yen, Hata was quoted as saying.
