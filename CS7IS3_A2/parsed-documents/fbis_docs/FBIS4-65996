Stressing that developments in Russia should be carefully evaluated, he said that although the Soviet Union has disintegrated and the Warsaw Pact split up, the Russian Federation has not lost its importance in the view of security. "The alliance should think of more practical ways to bring up responsible ties with this country," Golhan said. Golhan also stressed the importance of inciting the Central Asian republics to join a Partnership for Peace agreement set up by NATO and former East-bloc countries, saying the joining of Russia to this agreement is a satisfactory development. Defense ministers from allied countries on Tuesday welcomed a statement by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev that Russia would sign up for Partnership for Peace without setting special conditions. Golhan also said that Turkey has close historic and cultural ties with Balkan countries, stressing the importance it gives to Bosnia-Herzegovina's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. He expressed Turkey's concern over a potential risk which results from the spreading of weapons of mass destruction, such as biological and chemical weapons, in its neighboring regions. Golhan also said that during the NATO meetings all kinds of international terrorism activities were condemned and called for an effective antiterrorism fight which constitutes a threat to international relations.
