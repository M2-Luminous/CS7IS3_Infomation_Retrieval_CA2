But the Arab position changed a great deal after most states signed the agreement. How can this be explained? [Al-Hudayri] The Arab states were subjected to pressures from Western states, especially the United States, to force them to join the agreement banning chemical and biological weapons. The agreed Arab position was to sign the agreement provided so-called "Israel" joins the agreement banning nuclear weapons. Because it is unimaginable that the Arab states would sign the agreement on chemical weapons while an entity in the region has mass-destruction weapons. [Al-Faqiyy] How do you explain the UN absence from the peace process in the Middle East, especially as the resolutions adopted by the Security Council are the basis of the peace process? [Al-Hudayri] Regrettably, Arab weakness and the lack of a real vision enabling the Arabs to confront Western and Zionist pressures have enabled the Western side to achieve victories, especially in the so-called "Declaration of Principles agreement," which was intended to approve the Gaza-Jericho agreement, which does not achieve peace. The problem has never been Gaza or Jericho. The problem lies basically in the Zionist occupation of the Arab territories, the settlements, and the annihilation campaign to which the Arab people in the occupied territories are exposed. As for so-called Gaza-Jericho agreement, it is no more than throwing dust in the eyes. How can peace be established while all current talks are obstructed by major disagreements among the negotiators over the crossing points and controlling them, and while these talks also do not lead to a sovereign, independent Palestinian state? What is happening is a Western joke at the Arabs' expense. Some naive people have accepted these arrangements for other reasons which I cannot reveal. What the Arab side accepted in the Gaza-Jericho agreement is much less than what had originally been on offer. And I am certain that if the Arab peoples realize the truth of the matter, they will have a correct view that will be able to change the course. All Arab states, including Libya, are for peace. But Libya believes that peace should be based on justice and the recovering of the Palestinian and Arab people's legitimate rights in the Golan, the West Bank, and Lebanon. [Al-Faqiyy] Do you have reservations about the Arab states' positions on the implementation of Security Council resolutions on Libya since the Lockerbie crisis began? [Al-Hudayri] The pretext mentioned by some Arab states is compliance with so-called international legitimacy, which has been misused in an illegitimate manner. Despite the harm inflicted on Arab interests and the Security Council resolution's failure to take account of internal law, the Arab states tend always to find the justification in that they do not want to violate international legitimacy. Libya is completely aware of the pressures to which the Arab states are exposed. They find themselves in a weak position, and so cannot resist or refuse to comply. The recent Security Council resolution, that is Resolution 883, is considered interference in the Arab states' internal affairs. Some Arab states have realized that, and attempts are being made to stop encroachment on Arab sovereignty. [Al-Faqiyy] What is your opinion of French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe's saying that Libya is talking a lot but offering nothing tangible in reality regarding the Lockerbie crisis? [Al-Hudayri] Libya has always expressed its intention of resolving the Lockerbie issue, especially as the Libyan people are the one harmed most as a result of the sanctions imposed since 15 April 1992. It is not in Libya's interests for these sanctions to continue. We are eager to solve this problem as soon as possible. We have offered numerous positive solutions which, had they been accepted by the United States, Britain, and France, would have helped to secure a solution. But lack of desire on the Western states' part prevented that. If they were serious, they would have accepted some of the proposals made by Libya, which are based on respect for international legitimacy and Libyan sovereignty, demand a fair trial for the suspects, and refuse to allow the Libyan people to stand trial for no crime they have committed. [Al-Faqiyy] What new can Libya offer to find a solution? [Al-Hudayri] Despite the clear injustice to which the Libyan people are exposed as a result of the embargo imposed on them, we will try with the three Western states to being an end to this case. We are convinced that they do not want a solution, as they have turned the Lockerbie case into a political issue. [Al-Faqiyy] Do you believe that the Lockerbie case is intended to change the entire Libyan regime? [Al-Hudayri] The Libyan regime cannot be destroyed, because it is not based on one or two figures who can be destroyed and that would be the end of it. To do that, the Libyan people have to be destroyed. It is the Libyan people alone who are entitled to retain or replace the regime. [Al-Faqiyy] Is there any link between former Libyan Foreign Minister Mansur al-Kikhya's disappearance in Cairo and the Lockerbie case? [Al-Hudayri] I have nothing to say in that connection.
