Will the new rules of openness not cause the Commission to lose power? [Deus Pinheiro] No. What openness will do is to put an end to the false or illegitimate power held by those who, possessing information which they are not entitled to, use it in order to wield improper power. This is often the case with bureaucracies. Openness will help people understand better the significance of the Commission's decisions and avert arbitrariness. [EXPRESSO] Do you believe that the Portuguese Government should follow the same rules? [Deus Pinheiro] I can see no objective reason why it should not do so. It is a widespread trend. Even France, where the Napoleonic traditions and codes were strongest, has been increasing the openness of its administration. [EXPRESSO] With a complex decisionmaking process, the EU [European Union] has a limited ability to respond, because it is very protracted. Is this not a shortcoming? [Deus Pinheiro] It is an extremely grave shortcoming. For instance, as regards the trade defense machinery, it could have disastrous consequences and make it virtually ineffective. While in the United States, that kind of machinery for retaliation in international trade can be set in motion in weeks, in the EU it takes 18 months. It is a concern of ours -- and mine in particular -- to reduce the too extensive bureaucratic circulation of some documents. [EXPRESSO] The Commission will never be effective with so slow a response. [Deus Pinheiro] Of course there is machinery which must be safeguarded. The democratic nature of the process must not be diminished in favor of efficiency, but this matter has never been considered in a more pragmatic way. For instance, documents continue to be transmitted mostly by the traditional methods, when today electronic mail is a reality. Only now is the Commission -- under pressure from me -- moving ahead with its computer automation to a more advanced stage. [EXPRESSO] The Commission is criticized for holding great power without being elected.... [Deus Pinheiro] That power is not as great as people believe. Of course it has one considerable power -- that of initiative. The form of a decision is determined at the outset, but it must necessarily be approved by the Council, in many cases also by the European Parliament and in others by the national parliaments as well. There is another power -- that of implementation. But the Commission is overseen by the European Parliament, and increasingly by the Council -- and, in some cases, by the national parliaments. [EXPRESSO] Would it not make sense to increase the European Parliament's powers? [Deus Pinheiro] They have been increasing. What should have been increased is the national parliaments' powers. We can only be close to citizens if the national institutions take part more actively. [EXPRESSO] Does that not not impair the ability to respond even more? [Deus Pinheiro] The lack of ability to respond which I mentioned is more in the implementation than in the decisionmaking, which must necessarily be slow. We are in a novel organizational situation. Democratic procedure at this stage must be the top priority. Citizens are now afraid of the Community, following the debates on Maastricht. Without attention to this, we will have a set of Europeans opposed to the EU -- not because of its policies but because of its practices. [EXPRESSO] With the EU's enlargement, are we moving toward an "a la carte" Europe? [Deus Pinheiro] This can only be answered speculatively. As the EU expands, the tendency is for it to be less solid. What some people argue is that a hard core of those who accept all the deepenings could emerge within a Community enlarged to over 20 countries. Countries such as Portugal -- on the periphery and with a certain economic backwardness but with a good political tradition, a history, and a heritage in Europe and the world -- should be very mindful of this fact in order not to find themselves suddenly in a situation of inferiority. [EXPRESSO] What does being mindful mean? [Deus Pinheiro] Carefully following all tendencies in the direction of deepening and considering whether they suit us; for instance, matters such as the European defense pillar, which is taking shape with NATO's approval and the blessing of the United States. We must ponder the costs, explain them to our population, debate them in our parliament, and make a decision -- preferably sooner rather than later. [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that Portuguese troops could go and fight for the Balkans, for instance? [Deus Pinheiro] Common defense is one thing; it is another when that defense includes the possibility of attacking third parties. Here all countries must reserve for themselves the right to decide on a case-by-case basis. [EXPRESSO] The Portuguese population feel that their living standard remains very far from the European average. [Deus Pinheiro] The money which comes from the EC makes it possible to create infrastructures, but that is not a sufficient condition in itself. That depends on boosting the economy and creating an entrepreneurial spirit -- a sphere in which the EC, while being able to provide a frame of reference, no longer interferes in the governments' policies. [EXPRESSO] There is bewilderment in Portugal because traditional sectors such as agriculture are casualties of joining the EU. People are wondering what fate Brussels has in store for Portugal. [Deus Pinheiro] Community policy aims are no longer the same. There was the matter of surpluses, that of prices, the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, and, last, GATT. What was true in 1983 is untrue in 1994. Since Portugal was already trying to adjust to one framework and now must adjust to another, this confuses people and hampers governments' activity enormously. The situation is relatively stabilized. I know that the government is concerned about this, but I do not know what policies it is proposing for adjusting to the new environment. [EXPRESSO] This proves that there is uncertainty about the country's future. [Deus Pinheiro] Uncertainty, no. Portugal has unique conditions for success. What we must not believe is that we will succeed through the EU's assistance or through government resolve. Those bodies may be important, but it will be through the Portuguese people's work, our employers' resolve and boldness, and through our finally realizing that our thinking must not be provincial. In Portugal, the periphery and provincialism must be eradicated from people's minds and parochialism from debate. [EXPRESSO] When do you advocate the East European countries' entry? [Deus Pinheiro] Very rapidly. The instability in East Europe is persisting, and the only anchor of stability is the EU. If you ask me whether the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Poland are fit to join, I do not believe so, but perhaps they could now join pillars two and three. It would be a way to help them join, even if the economic stage had to be left until later. [EXPRESSO] Will that not weaken Portugal's position in the EU? [Deus Pinheiro] We must not only consider the narrow context of East Europe but also look at other areas, such as the south. The gulf in development, capitation [as published], and living conditions existing between the southern shore of the Mediterranean and Europe is such as to create an increasing source of tension with not only a political and economic basis but also a cultural basis, which could be extremely difficult to resolve. In that event, Portugal could find itself in the front line, and then it will need support -- the more supportive countries the better. [EXPRESSO] In your opinion, is the audiovisual sector primarily industry or culture? [Deus Pinheiro] Both. Until a year ago, it was essentially culture, but as I have delved into the issue, I have realized that the audiovisual sector is totally different what it was 10 years ago. It has become one of the industries with the greatest economic importance and development potential. [EXPRESSO] So are you handling the issue from an economic viewpoint? [Deus Pinheiro] No, always from a cultural viewpoint. This was clear in the GATT discussions. All the countries wish to safeguard the use of that powerful medium, based primarily on their language, but also on their culture, tradition, and heritage. [EXPRESSO] But how are they to respond to U.S. competition with so great a diversity of cultures and with necessarily small markets? [Deus Pinheiro] It is a great challenge for the Europeans: In cultural terms, to safeguard these values, and, in industrial terms, to seize an opportunity, with the changes forecast in the near future -- this, together with the creation of an information-based society in Europe, the so-called information superhighways, which are not unconnected with the audiovisual sector. [EXPRESSO] But there will have to be state support.... [Deus Pinheiro] Yes. A whole world which existed in Europe, linked to production and financing, has been depleted. Recreating that atmosphere will take time. [EXPRESSO] Will Europe have a kind of Hollywood? [Deus Pinheiro] Europe should necessarily have several Hollywoods. [EXPRESSO] Your portfolio does not seem to have characteristics as political as you wished and even announced. [Deus Pinheiro] It does, indisputably, in political analysis, in relations with the European Parliament, and even in information and communication. Even the audiovisual sector has political aspects, which only a commissioner can handle. [EXPRESSO] So are you not disappointed with the portfolio? [Deus Pinheiro] By no means. In the most visible aspects -- information and the audiovisual sector -- we leave work accomplished. As far as administering those guidelines is concerned, I no longer know whether I would have the patience do so for five years. [EXPRESSO] Do you mean that when there is a redistribution of portfolios, you are not interested in keeping the same post? [Deus Pinheiro] No. The major changes have been made or will be made by the end of my term. After that, I feel no vocation for day-to-day administration. [EXPRESSO] So do you intend to stay on as commissioner beyond this year? [Deus Pinheiro] I have not yet decided. I will only examine this matter with the prime minister in the summer. [EXPRESSO] Would you like to stay on? [Deus Pinheiro] This job has fascinating aspects and unique moments. It has others when the struggle against bureaucracy, routine, and certain established practices make you wonder whether the despair at not seeing things progress is worthwhile. [EXPRESSO] So you have moments of dejection? [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly, especially when I feel that the reasons why things are not progressing more quickly have nothing to do with their substance but rather with the system's inefficiencies, with petty personal envy, with established petty fiefdoms. [EXPRESSO] If you stay on, what would you like to do? [Deus Pinheiro] There are four or five portfolios which could be interesting, but I have not considered this matter, either. [EXPRESSO] What are those portfolios? [Deus Pinheiro] I will not enter into speculation, but it must be borne in mind that there will be more commissioners, and hence a reorganization of the portfolios. [EXPRESSO] There seem to be many federalists in the European structures who, for political reasons, do not acknowledge themselves as such. Is that the case with you? [Deus Pinheiro] I have never acknowledged myself and do not acknowledge myself as a federalist. I do not at all see the possibility -- and decreasingly so -- of the European states merging in any way into a single political entity. [EXPRESSO] But is not federalism the only way for Europe to survive? [Deus Pinheiro] No. There will be policies on which we must have a single voice. I have never minded this. In these matters our yardstick must be: Is what is wanted good or bad for Portugal? If it is good, it should be supported; if it is bad, it should be rejected, irrespective of the label placed on it. [EXPRESSO] So do you not believe in a United States of Europe? [Deus Pinheiro] Certainly not. Not even in my grandchildren's time. [EXPRESSO] How do you view the Portuguese parties' line in the elections to the European parliament, in which there is a clear retreat from the European ideals? [Deus Pinheiro] Unfortunately, I have heard a great deal of nonsense, even from politicians with senior posts in the parties. What must be considered, much more than potential concepts, dangers, or ideas which may exist, is the reality and knowing what the priorities are in Portugal. If they are our advancement in the world, our economic growth, trying to reach the Community average, the policies followed by the EU today are good for Portugal. [EXPRESSO] What about your own party's line of returning to the traditional values of fatherland and family? [Deus Pinheiro] Fatherland and family are essential concepts in our society, but they must be used not in a backward-looking perspective of nostalgia but one of progress. Otherwise, they will have a markedly conservative, not dynamic, content. [EXPRESSO] Whom does Portugal back as Delors' successor? [Deus Pinheiro] I have only exchanged views superficially and informally with the prime minister. It is not yet clear who the candidates are.
