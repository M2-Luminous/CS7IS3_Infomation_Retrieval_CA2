Jufelschulte and P. Miller: "Wanted: Mole; Intrigues or High Treason? Nerves Are Raw in the Federal Intelligence Service"] [Text] The employees of the secret service suspected clever intrigue, even treason. They needed the evidence to back it up, though. Otherwise quite successful at spying and information gathering, top officials in the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) were at a loss for a clear answer. Minister of State Bernd Schmidbauer wanted a concrete answer last Tuesday [25 January] in the Federal Chancellery; just who is running all over the BND? Just who is the troublemaker? In Pullach near Munich, headquarters of the spy agency, with approximately 7,000 employees deployed domestically and abroad, morale is currently at a low point. "Our nerves," one BND insider revealed to FOCUS, "are completely raw." Worst case ever of double agent activity among Germany's most silent officials: An official from the administrative level, so goes the gossip among Pullach subordinates, is supposed to have removed secret materials from the office over a period of years. The materials--without his knowledge--traveled over hazardous routes, eventually ending up in the GDR Ministry for State Security. A "super GAU" [district] for the BND. The top official was defended immediately. "We have no prior knowledge of this," emphasized Secret Service Coordinator Schmidbauer. Joachim Lampe, attorney for the Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, who was informed immediately of the charges, also made a placating statement: "At this time we have no case against this man." Nevertheless, the Office of the Federal Attorney is currently conducting an investigation in a case of espionage that would not have been conceivable without direct BND participation. And just as certain: The unknown remover of highly confidential analyses and papers has not yet been exposed. The BND is searching for its mole. One of those implicated in this espionage affair today sits embittered in his house in Munich and has, at the age of 81, only one last wish: "I want to spit in the face of this blackguard from the Stasi." Dr. Gerhard B., once editor in chief for the West German technical journal SOLDAT IM VOLK, still finds it hard to grasp just how badly the floppy-hat members of GDR State Security crucified him. The Background. Dr. B., who always had access to internal circles of the Bundeswehr and the West German Secret Services, was recruited under a "foreign flag" during the fifties. In other words: At that time he began meeting with men who--although they were Germans--claimed to be working for the French intelligence service. Dr. B. experienced no pangs of conscience. The Frenchmen, he truly believed, were surely loyal allies in the effort to create a strong Europe. The alleged agents of the French secret service were in reality "patrons" of the Leipzig Stasi-district government, who were passing the information they received immediately to the espionage headquarters on Normanen Street in East Berlin. Federal Supreme Court Attorney Lampe is currently examining whether B. actually was unaware of the true identity of his handlers, and whether he unknowingly got mixed up with Mielke's men. The journalist Dr. Gerhard B., known by the Stasi under the cover name "Schwarz," was apparently a top source. Until 1988, over a period of 30 years, he is suspected of having reported willingly on military policy conferences and training courses held at Bundeswehr training facilities. The people from Leipzig, among them agents whose cover names were Tratmann and Veit, also learned as much as they could about the Bavarian Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the CSU [Christian Social Union]. The Leipzig former Stasi Colonel B., according to the legend "resident of the French office for the German-speaking area," was able to get ahead using the achievements of his inofficial employee from Munich. "Schwarz" is also supposed to have supplied them with informational reports, situation reports, and security analyses over the years, which originated from BND headquarters. A jackpot for the Stasi. It remains unclear today exactly how this secret procurement in Pullach could have occurred. Federal Supreme Court Attorney Lampe is currently not investigating this point, however he sees a legitimate interest in the "clarification of this issue." Dr. Gerhard B., interviewed by FOCUS, admitted that he quite often received "several items" from his "good old friend" Dr. Kurt W., a former BND director. The Stasi knew this and even gave the "good friend" Dr. Kurt W. a cover name--"Berater" [adviser]. "Berater" was once a sparkling figure in the West German Secret Service. The former head of Department 1, chief of all BND agents around the world, is supposed to have taken part in the creation of a secret service within the Secret Service, out of frustration over the social liberal coalition in Bonn--the unlawful operation was conducted under the code name "Operation Eva." Dr. Kurt W., alias "Berater," also maintained very close contact with the Pullach circles even after his retirement. Through one of his former colleagues, according to BND employees, Kurt W. is supposed to have gotten hold of official documents. With this action the top BND official would have at the very least committed betrayal state secrecy laws. The subsequent stages in the floppy-hat sequence: Kurt W. is supposed to have passed papers and other information on by mouth to Gerhard B. alias "Schwarz." He did this allegedly without suspecting that he would further pass the information--knowingly or unknowingly--on to the Stasi. Ex-BND Director Kurt W. can today no longer be questioned on these events. After suffering a severe stroke he is now considered in no condition to be questioned. With their IM [unofficial agent] "Schwarz," the Stasi, disguised as the French intelligence service, played a crazy foreign agent game to the very end. On Gerhard B.'s 75th birthday, 19 September 1987, something unusual happened to Colonel B. from Leipzig. On the basis of his great services paid to France, "Schwarz" was supposed to be dubbed "knight of the Legion of Honor," which is comparable in Germany to the Federal Service Cross. The solemn ceremony was held in the "blue room" of the elegant Schloss Hotel in Igls near Innsbruck. The Stasi was already thinking ahead. Via Gerhard B. they attempted to approach a BND employee, to whom, as a precaution, the cover name "Zange" [tongs] was given. At this point it remains unclear whether the recruitment was a success. Volker Foertsch, who has been left out in the cold in the wrangling for a position of influence in the BND, may be looking into this question immediately. Foertsch, head of Department 1 (operative training) since 1989, has been now been assigned to handle security and counterespionage. Department 5, within the BND, serves as the traditional stronghold for service intrigues. Foertsch's successor after February is Dr. Rudolf Werner, alias Dr. Kempe, up to now BND resident in Washington. Insiders are wondering whether the American friends from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) will give Werner, who will be departing his post as BND governor, a small going-away gift. As is generally known, the filmed data on Stasi foreign espionage, which up to now have been presented to German protectors of the Constitution only in abridged form, lie in the CIA archives (FOCUS 48/1993). Maybe with a little luck and some good intentions these could help to expose IM Zange....
