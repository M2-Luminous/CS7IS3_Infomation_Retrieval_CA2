He also said that there is a real danger that the accident rate will go up. By a miracle an accident with the most modern MiG-29 aircraft was avoided last night at Ravnets Airport. The reasons for the near miss -- the lack of pilot training and the shortage of spare parts, fuel, and lubricants, Mikho Mikhov said. The ratio of aviation resources vis-a-vis our neighbors is 1 to 1.6 and even 2.6 to Bulgaria's disadvantage. The combat readiness aircraft are of the second, third, and fourth generations. Only 8 percent of the total number of aircraft are modern aircraft. In neighboring countries the corresponding percentage is 45-50 percent, Gen. Mikhov said. Scheduled repairs were not carried out at the end of 1993 because of a shortage of spare parts. Some 31 percent of the airplanes and 46 percent of the helicopters are faulty. If the envisaged budget does not provide the Air Force with funds for technical supples, by the end of 1994 some 80 percent of the aircraft will be defective. The Air Force needs a minimum of 4 billion leva. More than 1 billion leva are needed to maintain the missile and antiaircraft troops.
