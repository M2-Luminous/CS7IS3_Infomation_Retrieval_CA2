Katyal] [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 4--The recent episode of the Pakistan High Commissioner, Mr. Riaz Khokhar, not being allowed to go to Calcutta because of insufficient notice to the authorities has brought to light the treatment of Indian and Pakistani diplomats in each other's capital and the need to remove the current restrictions altogether both here and in Islamabad. The restrictive regime was first introduced by Pakistan when it prescribed a seven-day notice by the Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad for going out of the city. The then envoy there, Mr. S.K. Singh, was the first to feel the pinch of the restraint--when he wanted to go to Peshawar to see the ailing Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan (regarded in India as one of the architects of Independence). Two years later, New Delhi slapped similar restrictions on a reciprocal basis. In practice, there have been instances of the two Governments waiving the requirement, but the restriction remained--and was intended to apply to various categories of diplomats (and, perhaps, their spouses also). Recently, Mr. Khokhar sought permission to go to Calcutta but it was turned down on the ground that he had [not] given five days' notice. The authorities in the Home Ministry, responsible for processing such cases, could have taken a lenient view--as they had done in the case of Mrs. Khokhar earlier. They, however, stuck to the norms of reciprocity. Such cases are bound to arise as long as the restrictive regime is in place. Why should there be curbs on Indians in Islamabad or Pakistanis in New Delhi, when the rest of the diplomatic corps in the two capitals is free to move about in the entire length and breadth of their host countries after a simple intimation? These curbs are not the only irritants, there being frequent complaints of shadowing by the minions of security agencies. It was to rectify this situation that, in August 1992, the foreign secretaries of the two countries, Mr. J.N. Dixit and Mr. Shahryar Khan, agreed on a code of conduct, laying down do's and don'ts for the treatment of one country's diplomats in the other's capital. The immediate provocation was provided by an unpleasant episode in Islamabad where a senior Indian diplomat was beaten up by the intelligence personnel. The code committed the two sides to avoiding "intrusive surveillance" and other forms of harassment of diplomats. It enjoined upon the concerned agencies to spare the families of the diplomatic and consular personnel. It sought to ensure the safety of the staff and their families and respect for the rights of the diplomats to receive guests. The two sides reaffirmed their faith in the Vienna Conventions of 1961 and 1963, committing themselves to respecting the dignity of the diplomatic personnel and inviolability of official vehicles. The code was expected to create a new climate and make unsavoury cases things of the past. It was not destined to be that way. Not long after, Pakistan drastically pruned the staff of the Indian consulate in Karachi, as the press campaign referred to it as a nest of espionage. New Delhi paid Islamabad back in kind. Indo-Pakistan ties are far from normal but their missions could be used as vehicles for bringing about improvements. If the diplomatic channels get clogged, efforts at other levels to establish reasonably smooth working relationship would be doomed to failure.
