They considered bilateral relations and a range of international problems. Mr. Kinkel familiarized Mr. Daskalov with the European Union's efforts to put an end to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. They also discussed the situation in Russia and Bulgarian-Russian relations. "I had the opportunity to emphasize the importance we attach to Bulgaria and our willingness to help it solve its problems, ensuing mainly from the disintegration of the ex-Soviet market and the Yugo-embargo, "Mr. Kinkel told the media later. The sides discussed Bulgaria's foreign debt, a problem which Mr. Kinkel believes has been recently settled. Mr. Kinkel and Mr. Daskalov made a review of Bulgaria's relations with a number of international organizations, such as the European Union, the Western European Union, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade organization, NATO, and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, and its desire to get integrated with them. "Bulgaria can rely on Germany's support in this respect," Minister Kinkel stressed. "Klaus Kinkel's message is that Germany has supported Bulgaria and always will but, naturally, to become more attractive we should accelerate the reform," the Bulgarian foreign minister said after the meeting. "Our bilateral relations are not purely bilateral because they are maintained through the European Union in part," Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov said. At the talks with his German counterpart, Minister Daskalov raised the visa problem. Bulgaria expects that Germany will relax its visa regulations. However, the Bulgarian foreign minister told the media that this was a delicate issue and resolving it would take time. The Bulgarian side raised the question of considering the possibilities for more active German investments in Bulgaria. It requested assistance for the promotion of relations with the organization which would succeed Cocom [Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls] and for the allocation of more funds to Bulgaria within the framework of the Operation PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for Poland and Hungary] Programme. Asked what the German side insisted on, Minister Daskalov said that it requested "to continue reforms in Bulgaria despite the difficulties and pursue a foreign policy that will create no problems." "Bulgaria's debt to the former German Democratic Republic has not been discussed," Minister Daskalov said in reply to a reporter's question. "Experts will continue, on a bilateral basis, the talks opened in 1991 and I hope that we will be able to find some compromising solution to the problem," Mr. Daskalov said. Bulgaria is indebted to the former GDR, but the German side has unilaterally cancelled a number of transactions concluded with this country. Describing the dispute as quite serious, he said that both Bulgaria and Germany should show flexibility.
