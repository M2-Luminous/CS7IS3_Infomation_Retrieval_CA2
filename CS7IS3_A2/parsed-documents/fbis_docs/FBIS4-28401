Vietnam has a long coastal line and large territorial waters and it has always attached importance to the sea issue. Over the past years Vietnam also directly took part in, and made certain contributions to, the building of the convention. The UN Convention on Sea Law will serve as an international legal basis for the state and people of Vietnam to defend their sovereignty and territorial integrity at present and in future, thus contributing to promoting peace, stability, friendship, cooperation and development in the region and over the world as a whole. On behalf of the government, Vice Prime Minister Tran Duc Luong also made recommendations to the National Assembly for ratifying the UN Convention on Sea Law. He also asked the N.A. to assign the N.A Standing Committee and the government to amend the national laws to suit to the stipulations of the convention, and allow the government to take appropriate measures to strengthen the defence and management of the territorial waters and continental shelf of Vietnam.
