This is the underlying theme of a series of meetings that Germany and Italy are conducting with the European Commissions. As a result of these meetings, a letter has been sent from the European Aerospace Industry Council to the vice presidents of the European Commissions. This issue of AIR PRESS refers to the aforementioned letter. A Text that is Worse than the Last In particular, it has been pointed out that despite the fact that the aeronautical sector is of strategic importance, the Fourth Framework Program has continued to privilege computer science, telecommunications, and information systems. Our AIA (Association of Aerospace Industries) has also underlined this fact in memoranda that have been delivered, after meetings in Brussels, to Vice Presidents Antonio Ruberti and Vanni D'Archirafi, to the plenipotentiary minister and deputy permanent representative Rocco Antonio Cangelosi, to Ambassador Enzo Perlot, who is Italy's permanent representative to the European Community. These three sectors absorb 36 percent of the ECU10.9 billion in funding budgeted under the so-called "first action." ECU1.8 billion have been set aside for industrial technologies listed in descending order of priority. However, while it is true that under this item there is a section dedicated to advanced propulsion technologies that could also have some aeronautical interest, there also seems to be very little space dedicated to activities and research that are not closely tied to propulsion. It would be very fragmentary for the aeronautical industries to carry out research programs that were dedicated solely to propulsion, as emerges now from the original test produced by the Commission. The Fourth Framework Program could also involve the aeronautical sector, although it does not do so specifically. Not only is there no section entitled "Aerospace," but as the AIA pointed out during their meetings in Brussels, as far as they are concerned the text of the fourth program is even worse than that of the Third Framework Program. This must be considered within the context that Europe is spending almost two percent of its gross internal product on research, whilst the United States and Japan are spending three percent. What, basically, is being asked for? Approval of structural community funding is being requested to maintain and develop capacities, both in the high technology areas and for the "dual use" technologies and production methods. This is not all. These funds could also contribute to the improvement and reinforcement of the structure of the aeronautical industry, supporting such initiatives as the definitive integration of the EC reconversion program (Konver) with funding during the coming years. At the same time, the provisions that have been made to improve the technological level and to create adequate infrastructures and training, should not be forgotten. Increased collaboration between the national aerospace research bodies of the nations forming the European Community was called for at Aerodays, the meeting held in conjunction with the EC conference on aeronautical research held in Naples at the beginning of October. The structural funds should also provide an incentive for this increased collaboration. The goal should be a single European body aiming to exploit aeronautical research, a sort of "European NASA" that could work alongside, or even become part of, the European Space Agency without excluding a possible unification that would also involve the technical certification bodies and the air traffic control authorities. The European certification norms (JAR), were mentioned during the meetings and in the Brussels memorandum, as a good example of coordinated EC action and as a hopeful symbol for further movement toward a single European authority that would avoid the useless duplication of costs for construction companies. Industries that are above a national level are nothing new. For example Italy is involved in the Tornado, ATR, and EFA [European Fighter Aircraft] programs. These have provided an experience that has been consolidated and can serve as an intermediate step to programs that will promote EC technologies. The nucleus of industrial restructuring and of research at a European level, could be based on these, making it easier to breech the gap between basic research and development activities. All this should be regarded as a response to the technological challenges of the near future that will come primarily from across the Atlantic. And Us? From Europe to Italy. How does Italian industry present itself in this context, and what possibilities does it have in Europe at this time when it is fighting for its own survival? Still on the subject of the Brussels meetings, it is to be noted that, no plans have yet been put forward for the revision of the funding mechanism for research. On the contrary, for example, such revision has already been started in France, where there has been a noteworthy increase in the funding for research. The problem of the exportation of military materials, that is serious for Italy, could be resolved by the EEC. The effective results of the automatisms of Law No. 185 of 1990, which regulates the exportation of defense products, seem to have been greater than were intended by the legislator, and have placed Italy in a position of net disadvantage when compared with other democratic countries, starting with those of Europe. Here is an opportunity to adopt export restrictions based on decisions that have not been taken nationally, but at a community level, with reference to Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the extension of the regulations that the EEC is applying to the exportation of "dual use" materials, to all defense products, would give Italian industry the same support that the other European nations have.
