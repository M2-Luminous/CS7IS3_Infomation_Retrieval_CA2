Today, the negotiating team of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] met with Faustino Muteka's delegation to study methods to be used in discussing the topic of dealing with the second round of presidential elections. The parties had to move to this topic because of the intransigence and arrogance demonstrated by the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party.

Faced with an impasse, Alioune Blondin Beye, special representative of the UN secretary general in Angola, decided to move on to the electoral issue, which appears to be less polemical.
