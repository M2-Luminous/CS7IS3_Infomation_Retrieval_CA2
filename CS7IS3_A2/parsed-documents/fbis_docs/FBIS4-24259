This morning it's premier of the Northern Cape, Mr. Manne Dipico, and he is in our Bloemfontein studio. [passage omitted] Let's of course give you a little bit of background on Manne Dipico. A Kimberley boy, and his mother brought him up. She was a domestic worker at the local Kimberley hospital. He started working in the diamond mines and became politicized. He was fired from De Beers and went to Fort Hare University, and went a pretty predictable political course -- the National Union of Mineworkers and so on, and stood for the Northern Cape for the ANC and won by a relatively narrow margin. Let's see if we can now get Mr. Dipico on the line again. Good morning, Mr. Dipico, can you hear me now? [passage omitted] Mr. Dipico, with your rising up through the ranks of the National Union of Mineworkers, and being so much involved in that particular area, is this still an area of significance for you in terms of mining in the Northern Cape region? Is this going to be one of the big challenges? [Dipico] It will definitely be one of the big challenges, because when we look at the Northern Cape, we realize through the breadth and length of this province, mining in Namaqualand, mining in Kuruman area, mining in Kimberley, former strong economic base and backbone for all these years; and you realize that it absorbs a lot of labor. Workers within the province, really, you find them at the mining industry. [Hall-Green] A number of the papers are this morning running the story of the laying off of something over 5,000 workers from a regional mine. Is this particularly significant, you think? Do you think this is a sign of things to come generally? [Dipico] These are things to come. I've gone through painful experiences where I had to sit with mining bosses who were laying off workers, thousands and thousands of them. As we realize within the Northern Cape most of the mining houses came and actually benefited from the mines. They never looked at alternatives, because they knew that at a particular time the minerals will be exhausted, workers will have to be contained, but nothing of this sort really was considered. That is a very serious state of affairs, and that we will call upon the provincial leadership, the new government to try and look at alternatives: How do we remedy the situation in the future? [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, if you had to give a list of priorities that you would like to see changed in the Northern Cape -- we have touched on one, the mining industry, so far -- what else would you like to see changed there? [Dipico] The other important thing that I believe is of significance in our province is to change the whole scenario where the economy has been based primarily on primary sector in the mining industry and in the agricultural area. In the agricultural area most of the raw materials taken and be processed somewhere else. [sentence as heard] We've got cattle, we've got sheep, we've got all the goods, fruit and so on. But all this is being processed somewhere else, and we need to change that whole scenario to move into a secondary manufacturing industry that is light and medium industry, and move into tertiary type of industries, which we believe will give us more scope and more potential to be able to jumpstart the whole economy of our province because it has been neglected for many, many years. [Hall-Green] You talk about tertiary industry, Mr. Dipico. Could you be a bit more explicit and give a few examples of some of the industries which you would envisage in this category? [Dipico] We are looking at tourism, which we believe could attract a lot of investors, and a lot of people from the world to come and look at Northern Cape. We have been looking at how best we can develop the area of Namaqualand, and be able to move in such a way that it generates a lot of funding. Within the Northern Cape we are looking at Kimberley itself as a historic place -- but it has never been used profitably -- to move into a lot of other important things which I think are viable for the economy of the province. [Hinds] Mr. Dipico, coming back to yourself as the youngest premier so far -- have you come up against a lot of apprehension, maybe? [Dipico] Yes, but fortunately, one has gone through a process where one can stomach, one is in a position to face the challenges of the future. I knew that it's not going to be easy. When I was elected, a lot of people were saying that you are very young, you don't know what you are going to look at, but I've met people through the length and breadth of our province who are prepared to cooperate, who are prepared to give assistance and be able to give the strength and the leadership to be able to overcome the problems of this province. [Hall-Green] Our first caller is on the line. Sir, it's Charles Mannenberg, appropriately from your seat of power, and that of course is Kimberley. Good morning to you, Charles. [Mannenberg] Good morning. Tell me, Mr. Dipico, with Kimberley being dominated by the mining enterprise and the conglomerate situation there, and the municipality tax has been awfully high -- and Kimberley has been awfully deprived of recreational facilities and sporting facilities for the last 100 years by such enterprises -- what are you going to do about the situation to encourage youth to stay away from criminal elements, and leaving school at very early ages. How are you going to encourage them to uplift the situation in Kimberley itself? [Dipico] What we are fortunate about Kimberley is that we are unanimous as a provincial legislature to accept Kimberley as a capital, and we've gone out to sell Kimberley as a capital of this province. That in itself brings confidence to the local investors, and confidence in the foreign investors to come into Kimberley and really to give it another picture, which is a positive one. And we are also looking at the mining industry, which is really going down. To look at new challenges and new other avenues which we believe can actually give Kimberley a new shape and a new future. This is going to go around the whole tourist industry, and the whole secondary industries which we believe will be able to absorb most of the mineworkers who have been retrenched. Coming to the youth, within my own office of the premier we have set up a youth commission, and also we have a minister without portfolio who is dealing with youth affairs. We are looking at job-creation areas which we believe would be able to absorb the youth which is running amuck, and also looking at capacity building, and looking at other institutions which we believe will be able to bring programs into play which will give interests to our youth in our province, so they can be going out not to molest people, but to engage themselves in youth programs which we believe will be constructive for the province. [Hinds] We have George van Tonder from Carnarvon, and we say good morning. [Van Tonder] Premier Dipico, I would like to know what you are going to do about the transport services. The railway service has been suspended by the National Party in our remote towns, also the bus services. [passage omitted] [Dipico] What we want to say is that we have suffered a lot in our province. Transport industry has really contributed to the neglect of our province. We have identified that we've got only two national roads running into our province, and that is very bad if you are going to link up the whole industry of our province. The railway area, we believe, has been a source of income generation. The railway....[pauses] We have been having a meeting. We had a meeting two weeks back with Transnet [Transportation Network] to look how can we give life to the railway lines which were linking up most of the areas. When you look into Kimberley, go into Carnarvon, you don't really have public transport. When we have to go to Upington or Springbok, there is really no transport at all. And we believe that the railway needs to be given life so that we can link up our more important key areas, coindustrial areas, and be able to have roads. There is no road running from Kimberley as a capital to Springbok. And we believe that the taxi industry, given better roads, is in a position to move from one place to another. Moving from Calvinia to Upington will be a much better road to travel if we can prepare the roads. [passage omitted] [Hall-Green] We have Mr. Vic Pienaar from Delportshoop. Good morning. [Pienaar] Good morning, Mr. Dipico. I first want to thank you for everything that you are planning to do for us in the region. As a diamond digger in the Barkley West area -- Delportshoop, Barkley, Winterton area -- we are fairly big job creators for people in the area, but we are sitting with a very big mineral rights problem. We must try to survive on old, exhausted diggings -- proclaimed state diggings. Then there are people and companies who have mineral rights, who are not interested in using them because they are too small for them perhaps, or difficult. What is the possibility of this business being addressed, and will a change come about regarding this mineral rights issue? [Dipico] What I want to tell you is that the whole approach of the big mining houses, which have been exploiting the minerals of our province -- we have realized that it is not in the interest of the majority of our people in the province because they just took the minerals and did not plow it back. We need to [word indistinct] they need to be processed within our province. But coming to the point is that small mine diggers around Kimberley and around Namaqualand have suffered a lot. Others have been around, but they could not mine those diamonds because companies like De Beers own the mineral rights. We had a summit a month ago where we brought all the small diggers together to look at the proposals how do we beat, and how do we move in to correct the situation. The proposals came to the fore saying that we need to meet De Beers and other big companies to actually bring it to their attention that small diggers need to be given the right also to dig. That will create jobs for our people in Delportshoop, Gonggong, Barkley West, and surrounding areas, and even in Namaqualand and so on. We believe that is a source for revenue which our province is in a position to gain. These diamonds will be brought and be cut in Kimberley -- processed, polished and be sent as a complete product which has been processed already. We believe that it's a source generation for us, and we are going to have a serious meeting with the big mining houses to try to give an opportunity to the mineworkers, because they themselves are not interested really to mine these small areas. [passage omitted] [Hinds] We've got another caller, Lourens Estherhysen from the Strand. Good morning. [Estherhysen] Mr. Premier, I know there's a lot of work to be done, and the ANC government as such promised a lot of development here, and I know there's a lot going on, and I know you have done a lot already, but can you tell me or the man in the street -- can you tell the man in the street why is there no physical evidence of anything going on? It's still exactly the same as in the old government, and most of the people in this area are Afrikaans-speaking. I'd like you to address them in Afrikaans, please. [Dipico] Lourens, I would like to speak Afrikaans, my brother. I was born in the Northern Cape, I tried Afrikaans, but unfortunately I cannot do it -- at this moment. I try, but my tongue gets tied. I will get better; you must just give me a chance. I'll try to address you today in English, which is also one of the official languages of our province. I think you will have to please pardon me with that one. We in this province have been inundated with calls from our various areas to say that what are the visible things we can see from the promises you have made during the campaign as the ANC -- ourselves, Manne Dipico, and the leadership from Mandela? I have been going out with my team to explain to our people what the process is. We are still committed to those promises, and we are going to fulfill these promises. We said that there is a timeframe to everything. We know that people are impatient, but we believe for Kimberley, and for Northern Cape, we are worse off in a sense that we don't have a building for the administration of running the province. We have never had a bureaucracy which is there in Cape Town, which is there in Pretoria, which is there in other provinces, even in the Free State. We have to go through a process of building that administration first and foremost. We are busy with the process; things are moving very fast. We hope that with an efficient and effective administration at the provincial level, we are in a position to carry out the mandate for the millions of our people, and in particular in our province. And we are hopeful. As we are interacting, that is the result of the election of our people, we hope that they will be able to participate effectively, and involve themselves in programs of the government which are geared to address their own problems. We have been sitting this weekend in a general council of the ANC to see how best we can accelerate the program, how best can we attain the goals which we have set ourselves during the election. That process, we believe, is going to be accelerated in terms of the proposals which came forward. And I know that people are impatient, but it is best to be able to inform them how the procedure will go, how we are going to assist, and they themselves how they are going to participate and assist us to reach and accelerate that process. I know they want to see visible things, but I hope that in the near future, before the end of this year, they will be able to see something happening, and something visible in their little towns. Thank you. [passage omitted] Hall-Green] Thank you, Mr. Dipico, and we wish you great success with your revitalization program of the Northern Cape, and great strength to you, and we thank you for being with us via our Bloemfontein studio this morning.
