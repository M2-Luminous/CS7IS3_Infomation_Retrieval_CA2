FR940902-0-00018 FR940902-0-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 85 [FRL&hyph;5064&hyph;4] Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses; Status of Equipment Certified and Emissions Levels To Be Used by Operators Using Option 2 AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of availability. SUMMARY: In the final rule regarding retrofit/rebuild requirements for 1993 and earlier model year urban buses (58 FR 21359, April 21, 1993), EPA stated that it would review retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1994 and publish the post-rebuild particulate matter emission levels for urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild levels are to be used by operators for calculating their fleet emission levels under Option 2. This Federal Register document fulfills that commitment. As of July 1, 1994, no equipment had been certified for the Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program. Operators choosing to comply with Option 2 during 1995 and 1996 must use the PM levels as specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild PM level'' in the table provided at 40 CFR ยง85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A). EFFECTIVE DATE: The information of this notice is effective as of September 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: This notice, as well as other materials relevant to the final rule, is contained in Public Docket A&hyph;91&hyph;28. This docket is located in room M&hyph;1500, Waterside Mall (ground floor), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460. Dockets may be inspected from 8:00 am until 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday. As provided in 40 CFR Part 2, a reasonable fee may be charged by the Agency for copying docket materials.

Telephone: (202) 233&hyph;9297. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 219(d) of the Clean Air Act requires EPA to promulgate regulations that require certain 1993 and earlier model year urban buses having engines, which are replaced or rebuilt after January 1, 1995, comply with an emission standard or control technology reflecting the best retrofit technology and maintenance practices reasonably achievable. On April 21, 1993, EPA published final Retrofit/Rebuild Requirements for 1993 and Earlier Model Year Urban Buses (58 FR 21359). The Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program requires affected operators of urban buses to choose between two compliance options. Option 1 establishes particulate matter (PM) emissions requirements for each urban bus in an operator's fleet whose engine is rebuilt or replaced. Option 2 is a fleet averaging program that sets out specific annual target levels for average PM emissions from urban buses in an operator's fleet. In the final rule, EPA stated that it would review the retrofit/rebuild equipment that was certified by July 1, 1994, and publish the post-rebuild PM emission levels for urban bus engines affected by the program. These post-rebuild levels are to be used by operators choosing to comply with Option 2 for calculating their fleet emission levels. This Federal Register document fulfills that commitment. No equipment had been certified as of July 1, 1994. This notice therefore confirms that the default provisions of the final rule that are designed to assure emissions reduction for the program shall be effective for the first two years of the program, 1995 and 1996. Emission levels that are to be used in the event that no equipment is certified by July 1994 are set forth in the table provided at 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) of the regulations promulgated in the April 1993 final rule. The preamble to the April 21, 1993 final rulemaking stated that EPA intended to publish in this notice a table indicating required post-rebuild PM emission levels for all affected urban buses. EPA also stated that it would append its determination regarding post-rebuild emission levels to the CFR as an appendix to part 85 subpart O (the subpart of the CFR containing the urban bus retrofit/rebuild regulations). However, because no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994, the default post-rebuild emission levels, which are already contained in the regulation, will apply. Thus, EPA believes that there is no need to add an appendix to subpart O at this time. In July 1996, EPA will review the retrofit/rebuild equipment certified by July 1, 1996 and publish the emission levels which must be used by operators using Option 2 for calendar years 1997 and thereafter. II. Review of Certified Equipment and Program Requirements As noted above, no equipment was certified by July 1, 1994 as meeting the emissions and cost requirements for the urban bus retrofit/rebuild program. Therefore, pursuant to 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(B)(5), operators choosing to comply with Option 2 must use the PM levels specified in the columns labeled ``Pre-rebuild PM level'' and ``Post-rebuild PM level'' in the table provided at ยง85.1403(c)(1)(iii)(A) for calculating the target level for their fleet (TLF). The determination of whether to use the pre-rebuild emission level or the post-rebuild emission level must be made in accordance with 40 CFR 85.1403(c)(1)(iv). An urban bus operator choosing Option 2 must be able to demonstrate that its fleet level attained (FLA) is equal to or less than its TLF. In general, an operator choosing Option 2 has the following strategies available to comply with this requirement:
