FR940324-0-00032 FR940324-0-00012 40 CFR Part 52 [AK&hyph;4&hyph;2&hyph;6299; FRL&hyph;4850&hyph;3] Approval and Promulgation of State Implementation Plans: Alaska AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: EPA is approving the State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) for the purpose of bringing about the attainment of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to a nominal 10 micrometers (PM 10 ). The SIP revision was submitted to EPA by ADEC on June 22, 1993 to satisfy certain Federal Clean Air Act requirements for an approvable moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP for Mendenhall Valley, Alaska. EPA is also approving the contingency measures submitted by the state of Alaska for the Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas. This action to approve this plan has the effect of making requirements adopted by the ADEC federally enforceable by EPA. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 25, 1994.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Mendenhall Valley, Alaska area was designated nonattainment for PM 10 and classified as moderate under sections 107(d)(4)(B) and 188(a) of the Clean Air Act, upon enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. 1 See 56 FR 56694 (November 6, 1991). The air quality planning requirements for moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas are set out in subparts 1 and 4 of part D, title I of the Act. 2 EPA has issued a ``General Preamble'' describing EPA's preliminary views on how EPA intends to review SIP's and SIP revisions submitted under title I of the Act, including those state submittals containing moderate PM 10 nonattainment area SIP requirements. See generally 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992); see also 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992). 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Public Law No. 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein are to the Clean Air Act, as amended (``the Act''). The Clean Air Act is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Subpart 1 contains provisions applicable to nonattainment areas generally and subpart 4 contains provisions specifically applicable to PM 10 nonattainment areas. At times, subpart 1 and subpart 4 overlap or conflict. EPA has attempted to clarify the relationship among these provisions in the ``General Preamble'' and, as appropriate, in this action and supporting information On December 22, 1993 EPA announced its proposed approval of the moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP for Mendenhall Valley, Alaska and the contingency measures submitted for Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River Alaska (58 FR 13572&hyph;13575). In that rulemaking action, EPA described its interpretations of title 1 and its rationale for proposing to approve the PM 10 SIP revisions, taking into consideration the specific factual issues presented. Those states containing initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas (those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B)) were required to submit, among other things, the following provisions by November 15, 1991: 1. Provisions to assure that reasonably available control measures (RACM) (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology (RACT)) shall be implemented no later than December 10, 1993; 2. Either a demonstration (including air quality modeling) that the plan will provide for attainment as expeditiously as practicable but no later than December 31, 1994, or a demonstration that attainment by that date is impracticable; 3. Quantitative milestones which are to be achieved every three years and which demonstrate reasonable further progress (RFP) toward attainment by December 31, 1994; and 4. Provisions to assure that the control requirements applicable to major stationary sources of PM 10 also apply to major stationary sources of PM 10 precursors except where the Administrator determines that such sources do not contribute significantly to PM 10 levels which exceed the NAAQS in the area. See sections 172(c), 188, and 189 of the Act. Some provisions were due at a later date. States with initial moderate PM 10 nonattainment areas were required to submit contingency measures by November 15, 1993 which became effective without further action by the state or EPA, upon a determination by EPA that the area has failed to achieve RFP or to attain the PM 10 NAAQS by the applicable statutory deadline (see section 172(c)(9) and 57 FR 13543&hyph;13544). II. Response To Comments EPA received no comments on its December 22, 1993 (58 FR 67754&hyph;67759) Federal Register proposal to approve the Mendenhall Valley moderate nonattainment area PM 10 SIP and contingency measures for Mendenhall Valley and Eagle River as revisions. III. This Action Section 110(k) of the Act sets out provisions governing EPA's review and processing of SIP submittals (see 57 FR 13565&hyph;13566). In this action, EPA is approving the plan submitted to EPA on June 22, 1993 which contains the Mendenhall Valley contingency measures, and the Eagle River contingency measures submitted to EPA on January 13, 1992. EPA has determined that the submittals meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act. Among other things, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation has demonstrated the Mendenhall Valley moderate PM 10 nonattainment area will attain the PM 10 NAAQS by December 31, 1994. IV. Administrative Review This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. A future document will inform the general public of these tables. On January 6, 1989 the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any state implementation plan. Each request for revision to the state implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit May 23, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
