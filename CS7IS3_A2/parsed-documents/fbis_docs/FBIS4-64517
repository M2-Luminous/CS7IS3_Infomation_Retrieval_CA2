Those who know the history of Cyprus have not been surprised by that. After all, the UN organization has maintained its approach since 1964. 1. The package of proposals that UN representative Galo Plaza submitted in 1964 urged the Turkish Cypriots to "agree to enosis [union of Cyprus with Greece] in return for minority rights." We resisted the UN representative's ridiculous proposals and rejected them even when we were confronted with the threat of destruction. 2. The UN organization adopted a resolution to recognize the bloodthirsty and occupying Greek Cypriot administration as the legitimate government. We refused to accept that resolution at the time, that is, during the dark era in which bloodshed took place and Turkish Cypriots were killed throughout the island. 3. The UN organization failed to obstruct the Greek Cypriot attacks in 1963. It also failed to obstruct the attacks on Erenkoy [Kokkina] in 1964 and Gecitkale [Lefkoniko] and Bogazici [Lapathos] in 1967, the massacre of Turkish Cypriots in Turkeli [Ayios Vasilios], Taskent [Vouno], Atlilar [Aloa], Murataga [Maratha], and Sandallar [Sandalaris], the landing of 20,000 Greek troops in Cyprus, the occupation of 97 percent of the island by them, and the fascist Greek junta administration's military coup on 15 July 1974, which aimed to achieve enosis. But the UN organization adopted a resolution condemning Turkey for the action it took on 20 July 1974 to obstruct enosis and the Greek Cypriot acts of massacre and ethnic cleansing operations against the Turkish Cypriots. It called on the Turkish troops to immediately withdraw from Cyprus. We did not accept those resolutions at the time, that is, when we were in a weaker position and when confusion existed in Cyprus. We ignored them and moved in the direction we decided to go in. 4. The UN organization adopted several baseless resolutions after we declared our independence on 15 November 1983, resolutions that conflicted with international law. It called on us to withdraw our decision on independence and urged foreign countries not to recognize the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus [TRNC]. It threatened the Turkish Cypriot people and tried to blackmail them. But we advanced in the direction we chose to go, believing that the clock could not be put back and that we would continue to exist even if the state we established was not recognized. We maintained our position and reached the point we are at now... 5. It has been 10 years since we established our independent republic... 6. Our glorious flag, which is the symbol of our sovereignty, has remained hoisted... 7. We live in security and without fear and look to the future in hope... We owe our today to our resistance of the unjust resolutions that were adopted by the guided organizations, such as the United Nations and other similar establishments, which have assumed the form of a Christian club and try to realize the expansionist objectives of the neocrusaders under the guise of "peace initiatives." The staff officer of the neocrusaders, who heads the UN General Secretariat, has moved to threaten the Turkish Cypriots and to direct pressure on them again through the UN Security Council, which has been converted into the headquarters of the crusaders. We will maintain our resistance. We must. We have no alternative. We must resist injustice and remain steadfast. Instead of concerning itself with Cyprus, which has enjoyed peace during the past 20 years, the UN organization should wage a struggle against the criminal Serbs, who are killing the Islamic people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Instead of waging a struggle against the Turkish Cypriots, who have been deprived of their rights, subjected to an embargo, belittled, and isolated during the past 30 years, the UN organization should take steps to deal with the occupying Armenian terrorists, who have killed hundreds of thousands of innocent Azerbaijani people and forced 1 million Azerbaijani citizens to become refugees in Daghlyk Karabakh... Instead of moving against Turkey, which established peace, democracy, security, and prosperity in Cyprus in three days, the UN organization should take measures against the aggressive Zionists, who shed blood and torture people in Palestine daily... We know of Europe's plans to have Turkey besieged by the forces of the Orthodox religion. We also know of the plan to realize enosis through the UN organization. But we will not yield. We will maintain our resistance against those who have failed to halt the bloodshed in Bosnia, Azerbaijan, and Palestine and who secretly cooperate with the occupiers and murderers. Regardless of the resolutions the United Nations may adopt against the Turkish Cypriot people, we are determined to maintain the TRNC's existence and refuse to accept the sovereignty of our sworn enemies. UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the UN Security Council must realize that...
