The TEC said the government should deploy the defense force in this area to ensure a free and fair election. [passage omitted] There was also heated debate following a resolution that the TEC [Transitional Executive Council] said must be relayed to the president and be entered in the Constitution of the country to ensure that people residing in Bophuthatswana and other areas are able to vote freely. It was proposed that security forces be deployed in these areas and ballot boxes be placed at polling places on the Bophuthatswana border so that voters do not have to travel long distances to cast their vote, as the people of Bophuthatswana resumed their South African citizenship legally on 1 January 1994, including public servants, the police and the defense force. [Begin Cyril Ramaphosa recording, in English] To allow all our people in Bophuthatswana, and we have up to 2 million of them, to go and vote knowing that they exercise their vote freely and fairly, and that they will be protected by South African security forces, if the Bophuthatswana Defense Force ever seeks to do anything. But this resolution goes further, Mr. Chairman. It calls on the civil servants in Bophuthatswana, the soldiers, policemen, nurses, judges and magistrates and everyone else to know that they are not going to be left in the lurch when the rationalization process takes place. So it calls on them to have full confidence in what we are doing. Already there is unrest in Bophuthatswana. Civil servants are up in arms and they are up in arms because they have deep uncertainties of what the future holds for them. [end recording] [passage omitted]
