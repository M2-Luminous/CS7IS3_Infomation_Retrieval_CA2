He defines himself as just another citizen of this land that has been traversed from one end to the other by nationalist, anti-interventionist, and frequently fratricidal wars throughout its history; in which the leaders of gangs in parallel situations have led and sometimes still lead the peasant masses into total slaughter. And there are those who say that he is not innocent in connection with all of this. He went into exile during the period of the Sandinist revolutionary government and was a member of the leadership structure of the resistance movement. His role while abroad was above all diplomatic in nature, involving negotiations, mainly with Washington, and the solicitation of funds amounting to millions to finance the war against Nicaragua. There are also those who believe that it is not entirely clear where all of this money went. Calero Portocarrero is a tall man with a rough voice and totally white hair. Despite his involvement in politics, and thus the recent history of the country, he has not evidenced much of the intellectual legacy of his father, the well-known writer Adolfo Calero Orozco. He was one of the precursors of the body of Nicaraguan short stories and the author of the book "Sangre Santa" ["Sacred Blood"], among others. "I am very proud of both my father and my mother, Mrs. Maria Portocarrero," he is forthright in saying. He began his political life in the Conservative Party. He says this affiliation is in his blood, since one of his grandfathers, his father, and his mother were conservatives as well. After returning from Europe at the end of the last century, his maternal grandfather, Bernabe Portocarrero, became a liberal, imbued with liberal ideas. Calero Portocarrero's first political activity was as a member of the Conservative Youth in about 1957. He recently turned 62. [Solorzano] How would you define your political career? [Calero Portocarrero] I have progressed in a straight line, with no inconstancy. I have always sought the achievement of freedom, democracy, and a social market economy, aware of the obligation borne by those of us who have some education to share our knowledge, ideas, ideals, and achievements with the rest of the people. I feel very profoundly Nicaraguan. This was something inculcated in me by my father. [Solorzano] What role did you play during the Somoza era and during the decade of the Sandinist government? [Calero Portocarrero] When I returned to Nicaragua from the United States in the 1950's, I never had a choice, in the sense that there was a dictatorship in power, and there was one opposition party--the Conservative Party. Thus I chose to be a member of the opposition from the beginning, and I continued to oppose Somoza until the dynasty came to an end. Then came the Sandinists, in whom the people of Nicaragua placed the highest hopes. But they were totally disappointed. I remained in Nicaragua in opposition to the Sandinist movement until I was refused permission to leave the country in 1982. I did leave, legally, and they then put obstacles in the way of my return in January of 1983. Given those circumstances, I had no alternative to staying abroad. I was not going to remain at their mercy. Nor did I accept the position they offered me in Ecuador, if I would forget about politics. But I did choose and agree to join the Nicaraguan Democratic Force (FDN). I had been in contact with Enrique Bermudez even before my departure from Nicaragua, and he had urged me to join the FDN. I joined in January of 1983. That same year, I was elected to serve as its president, and I held that position until the Nicaraguan resistance, made up of the various groups working against the Sandinist movement, was formed. [Solorzano] Why did these groups suddenly decide to join together? [Calero Portocarrero] This union, which included more than 90 percent of the belligerent forces, was forged by the circumstances in the United States. It was necessary to appeal to the Congress there, to present a broader front, and to obtain from that country the economic aid essential for the task of continuing the struggle. [Solorzano] What difference do you see between the nature of the Sandinist movement when it was in power and now that it is out of power? [Calero Portocarrero] The Sandinist movement was clandestine when it began. Once it had won power, its preference for dictatorial command, for absolute, arbitrary control, became clear. Later, due to circumstances and the pressure exerted by the rebel forces (and even international pressure), the Sandinists found themselves forced to hold elections, which they lost. Then, once they were out of power, they were never willing to recognize that this was the situation. Instead, they continued to wield power from below, as Mr. Ortega has put it. Little by little, however, I have been seeing a change. [Solorzano] What kind of change? [Calero Portocarrero] A relatively secret one. [Solorzano] To what do you attribute this behavior? [Calero Portocarrero] It looks as if the Sandinists have not been able to overcome this preference for secrecy that characterized the beginnings of the movement. And so we find that we are dealing with an apparently divided movement with different factions, one moderate and one radical. [Solorzano] Based on your analysis, what is the reason for this situation? [Calero Portocarrero] I think that there is no ideal in the Sandinist movement that would provide the ranks with cohesion. The Sandinists are confused. It was very difficult for them to make the transition from guerrilla warfare to government power, and then from government power to life in the countryside. Thus the Sandinist movement has become the victim of its own errors, its own failures, and it will be very hard for it to find a direction. The Sandinists will have to deal with many contradictions. Only they themselves can strip the movement down and straighten it out, once they know who they are. [Solorzano] Who are those you believe can give direction to the Sandinist movement? [Calero Portocarrero] Well, I would say that it is now possible to discern some innovative forces that merit respect and should be taken into account. [Solorzano] What do you think of this internal debate in the movement? [Calero Portocarrero] All of the parties here in Nicaragua tend to have internal divisions. And since we see that there are several conservative and liberal parties, it would not be surprising to see several Sandinist Fronts. [Solorzano] What was your role in the 1990 elections? [Calero Portocarrero] I was not permitted to return to Nicaragua during that period--not until after Mrs. Chamorro had taken office. I did not participate in the electoral campaign and I did not proselytize. I even wrote an article for the MIAMI HERALD in which I predicted that Dona Violeta would win, based on the Gueguense [Nicaraguan folklore character]. Now then, my party--the National Conservative Party--nominated Enrique Bolanos as its candidate. In the end, I favored the United Nicaraguan Opposition (UNO) and Dona Violeta's candidacy. [Solorzano] Why, at this point, does the National Conservative Party continue to believe in the UNO and to call for a constituent assembly? [Calero Portocarrero] We believe, with the greatest conviction and in all sincerity, that simply patching up or repairing the present political problem in Nicaragua by means of partial reforms is not the solution. I even doubt that such reforms could be carried out, because there are forces in the National Assembly that have entirely different interests. And so I believe that the solution to the problem of reorganizing the powers of the state can be found only in a new constitution. In order for this to become a reality, it is necessary to go back to the people, to take back the initiative, and to clarify the ideas of the people so that it will be they who choose. [Solorzano] My attention is drawn to the fact that while all of the parties making up the UNO are calling for a constituent assembly, their members have resumed their parliamentary seats. How can these two things be reconciled? [Calero Portocarrero] I believe it was a very great mistake for the UNO to withdraw from the assembly in protest against the election of the board of officers headed by Dr. Gustavo Tablada. The UNO deputies should have stayed, opposed what they needed to oppose, and voted "yes" when they believed it necessary. The UNO lost the majority, whether this was due to mistakes or conflicts. One can never hope that an elected congress will remain united if it has no cohesive factor. Now then, I think the fact that the UNO deputies returned to their seats is a healthy thing, although we are opposed to any partial reform of the Constitution. But it must be remembered that there are other laws that are very important, and the deputies can do nothing from outside the assembly. It is perfectly possible for them to occupy their assembly seats while favoring a constituent assembly. Let us remember that it is these same deputies--those in both the UNO and the Front--who will cast the votes. [Solorzano] How can the UNO position be explained when, on the one hand, it is calling for a constituent assembly, while, on the other, a UNO commission met with the Sandinist Front to seek out common ground with a view to partial reforms? [Calero Portocarrero] The National Conservative Party did not approve of the holding of these talks. We had already decided to wage the struggle for a constituent assembly. We have never had faith in partial reforms, but as members of the UNO, we halted our campaign for a constituent assembly and waited to see what the results would be. They proved to be what we had expected since nothing was achieved. The articles that are of principal importance to both the Sandinist Front and the UNO were not discussed. And so, then, I think we must look to reality, coexistence, peace, and mutual respect, so that we can all live in an ideal country. This can be achieved only through a constituent assembly. [Solorzano] One of the things the UNO proposed as a condition for supporting partial reforms was a change in the board of officers of the National Assembly. Engineer Alfredo Cesar even publicly recognized the election of Dr. Luis Humberto Guzman. Why then do you continue to insist on a constituent assembly? [Calero Portocarrero] In my opinion, the UNO has clung to arguments that were not so important. I did not agree with the UNO, but since our party is a member of the coalition, we respected the decision of the majority. But I reiterate that I did not approve of the withdrawal of the UNO deputies from the assembly solely because a board of officers that deprived them of control of the National Assembly had been elected. It is hard for me to understand Cesar's position in the parliament. [Solorzano] Does the National Conservative Party regard the present board of officers as legal? [Calero Portocarrero] My party has made no statement on the matter. [Solorzano] Doesn't the participation of the UNO deputies in the assembly perhaps give it legal status? [Calero Portocarrero] Well, you see, the UNO deputies either did not appear at the assembly sessions or presented themselves but then withdrew. However, they did accept their salaries. I believe that this was illogical. It was inconsistent for them to question the legal status of an officer of the assembly, denying it by withdrawing from that body, and then subsequently to recognize the validity of his signature on their checks. [Solorzano] Originally--in 1989, the UNO was made up of 14 parties, while now there are only seven. Do you believe the UNO is headed toward disappearance? [Calero Portocarrero] In 1989, there were 14 parties that belonged to the Coordinadora [Coordination Council]. I believe the UNO was formed with fewer parties, and that it was a coalition organized with a view to the 1990 elections. It contained no force that would keep it united. When the catalyst for the formation of these coalitions disappears, they tend to disintegrate. It is true that the UNO has a government program to oversee, and that is the only thing that is sustaining it. Moreover, the UNO will not be a factor in the 1996 elections, since new alliances will be formed. It seems likely to me that even the Sandinist Front will seek alliances with other parties that are sympathetic to the new ideology allegedly professed by some Sandinists. [Solorzano] Do you believe that no single party will be able to rally the votes needed to win the elections in 1996? [Calero Portocarrero] Very frequently, this depends on who the leader of a given party is. Here in Nicaragua, there is a tendency to vote for the individual, and not necessarily for the party. However, anyone who aspires to the presidency must have a party behind him. For this reason, I think this is important when the time comes to choose people. And therefore alliances will have to be formed. [Solorzano] What is the National Conservative Party thinking where the 1996 elections are concerned? [Calero Portocarrero] We are engaged in a process of consolidation, modernization, and dynamic action. We are working on a data bank with a view to drafting a program, and we will operate as if we were going to proceed alone. It is possible that we will participate in alliances.
