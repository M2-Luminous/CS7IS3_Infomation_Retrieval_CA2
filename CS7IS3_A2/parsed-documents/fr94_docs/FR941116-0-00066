FR941116-0-00066 FR941116-0-00012 Interested persons may send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission). III. Background On October 22, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) about market-based rates for oil pipelines. 5 In the NOI, the Commission first inquired whether it should continue to permit oil pipelines to seek market-based rates on a showing that they do not have significant market power in the relevant markets. The Commission also inquired about how it should make a market power determination and, in that connection, raised a number of substantive and procedural issues. 5 Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Inquiry, 58 FR 58814 (November 4, 1993), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. Notices ¶ 35,527 (October 22, 1993). On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) in response to the NOI and the comments to the NOI. 6 In the NOPR, the Commission concluded that oil pipelines may continue to seek market-based rates upon a showing that they do not have significant market power in the relevant markets. In addition, the Commission concluded that no consensus existed on the substantive standards to be used in determining whether an oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets and that, therefore, the appropriate course of action is to develop oil pipeline precedents on a case-by-case basis. Accordingly, the Commission did not propose in the NOPR any substantive rules about market power determinations. However, the Commission did propose in the NOPR appropriate procedural rules to govern applications by oil pipelines for a market-power determination that could lead to market-based rates. The Commission has received comments on the NOPR from eleven commenters. 7 In brief, after analyzing those comments as discussed below, the Commission is adopting the procedural rules proposed in the NOPR with minor modifications and some clarifications. 6 Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 59 FR 39985 (August 5, 1994), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. Proposed Regulations ¶ 32,508 (July 28, 1994). 7 Comments were filed by: ARCO Pipe Line Company and Four Corners Pipe Line Company (ARCO), the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL), Marathon Pipeline Company (Marathon), Buckeye Pipe Line Company, L.P. (Buckeye), Kaneb Pipe Line Operating Partnership, L.P. (Kaneb), Glenn E. Davis (Davis), Total Petroleum, Inc. (Total), Alberta Department of Energy (Alberta), Petrochemical Energy Group (Petrochemical), Natural Council of Farmer Cooperatives (Farmers), and Sinclair Oil Corporation, Crysen Refining, Inc., Frontier Refining Company, and Lion Oil Company (Sinclair). IV. The Continuation of Market-Based Rates As in the NOPR, the Commission concludes that oil pipelines may continue to seek market-based rates on a showing that they do not possess significant market power in the relevant markets. Most of the commenters support or do not oppose the continuation of market-based rates. Only Sinclair and the Farmers oppose the continuation of market-based rates. Sinclair maintains that there is no need for a market-based methodology in light of the indexation approach adopted by the Commission in Order No. 561, coupled with the cost-of-service alternative. The Farmers argue that market-based ratemaking is not needed in that the Order No. 561 ratemaking options provide pipelines with ample flexibility in obtaining just and reasonable rates and that market-based ratemaking will create an unnecessary potential for abuse of market power. The Commission believes that it is appropriate for oil pipelines to continue to be able to seek market-based rates because this approach comports with the spirit of the Act of 1992 by retaining a light-handed regulatory method to complement the indexing approach adopted as the generally applicable ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines. In addition, as the Commission has previously stated, a market-based approach is clearly within the Commission's authority under the ICA. 8 Further, the Commission believes that the market-based approach will be of use in circumstances where the oil pipeline needs the flexibility to compete provided by market-based rates, rather than other approaches. Under the market-based approach, the oil pipeline will be able to engage in competitive pricing in order to react to changes in market conditions, such as increased demand for its service. This can result in pricing that is both efficient and just and reasonable. As the court stated in Tejas Power Corp. v. FERC: 8 Order No. 561, III FERC Stats. & Regs. ¶ 30,985 at p. 30,958; Cf. Elizabethtown Gas Co. v. FERC, 10 F.3d 866 (D.C. Cir. 1993). In a competitive market, where neither buyer nor seller has significant market power, it is rational to assume that the terms of their voluntary exchange are reasonable, and specifically to infer that the price is close to marginal cost, such that the seller makes only a normal return on its investment. 9 9 908 F.2d 998, 1004 (D.C. Cir. 1990). Traditional regulatory ratemaking is based on historic accounting cost. But rates based on historic cost do not function well to signal individuals how to efficiently respond to changes in market conditions. 10 Historic cost-based rates, even if indexed for past inflation, do not perform this function well, which generally requires one price to change relative to another. Therefore, where appropriate, it is reasonable to permit a market pricing option. 10 The classic statement on the informational role of prices is F. Hayek, ``The Use of Knowledge in Society,'' American Economic Review, XXXV(4) 519&hyph;30 (September, 1945). On the natural gas shortage and its relation to historic cost of service ratemaking see Stephen Breyer and Paul McAvoy, Energy Regulation by the Federal Power Commission, Brookings 56&hyph;88 (1974). The Commission is confident that the information provided to it by the procedural requirements adopted in this rule will permit the Commission to make informed decisions about market power and prevent the possibility of abuses of market power. In that vein, both Sinclair and the Farmers in general support the rules proposed in the NOPR. Those rules will enable the Commission to comply with Farmers Union by not permitting market-based rates until there is an affirmative showing that the oil pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant markets. 11 Such a showing will assure the Commission that the oil pipeline's prices are just and reasonable. 12 11 Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1984). 12 Elizabethtown Gas Co. v. FERC, 10 F.3d 866, 870 (D.C. Cir. 1993), citing Tejas Power Corp. v. FERC, 908 F.2d 998, 1004 (D.C. Cir. 1990) and Farmers Union Central Exchange, Inc. v. FERC, 734 F.2d 1486, 1510 (D.C. Cir. 1984). V. Legal Basis The oil pipelines raise several legal objections to the proposed regulations. In brief, they maintain that the Commission has acted outside of its authority under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA) 13 and has contravened the mandate of Section 1802 of the Act of 1992 by not adopting streamlined procedures for market-based filings. 13 49 U.S.C. app. 1 (1988).
