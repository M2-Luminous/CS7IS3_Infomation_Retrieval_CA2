There are two options. According to the first one, Russian counterintelligence will be renamed the Federal Directorate of Investigations and will be part of the Justice Ministry, as in America. The second option calls for the transfer of the former KGB under the control of the president. In both cases Russian counterintelligence may lose its status as an independent federal body and may simply become a subdivision of either one or the other state directorate. Some analysts see in the proposed reform an attempt by interested parties, including foreign ones, to finally lower the status of Russia's state security structures. According to the source, the appointment of the head of the Federal Service of Counterintelligence, who will most probably be Sergey Stepashin, will be announced at the same time as a decree about the reorganization of the former KGB.
