Comrade Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, and officers and men and military officers of the KPA welcomed the guests. During the meeting, the military attache of the Russian Embassy Georgiy Mariyasov, who is the head of the military attaches corps, said that he sends warm military greetings to all the officers and men of the KPA who are welcoming the 62d anniversary of its founding. He also continued: The KPA that has a glorious history of 62 years overcame all difficulties and reliably defended the fatherland's security and the country's sovereign rights. The KPA founded by the respected and beloved leader not only achieved a great victory in the anti-Japanese armed struggle, but it was all the more developed into a strong regular armed force. Today the KPA is highly upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il, who is a great man [widaehan pun], as its supreme commander. We are glad over the fact that the Korean people and soldiers of the People's Army are able to uphold two great leaders [widaehan tubunui yongdoja]. On the anniversary of the KPA, we give our sincere greetings to those great leaders. Currently, the imperialists are strengthening pressure and maneuvers of isolation toward the DPRK. We actively support all the just steps taken by your country against the imperialists' unreasonable maneuvers. We hope that there will be greater results in the Korean people's struggle to strengthen socialist construction and the country's defense capabilities, and to reunify the fatherland.
