According to Romualdas Ozolas, Chairman of the Center Union and member of the Lithuanian Seimas, amid all this apparent confusion a common trend can be traced. [Ozolas] In a nutshell this can be described as follows: fight for property. There are the left-wingers and there are the right-wingers, both sides are interested in grabbing as much as possible. This is carried out by using all means available -- those which are permitted and those which are not. Therefore the racket which is kicked up around it quite often amounts to demagogue, intrigue, and plain deception. I think that this all should disperse after the distribution of property has been completed, after the state property has been transferred into the hands of individual persons. This is natural, only the trouble is that in the meantime, lawlessness and disrespect to state institutions reign. [passage omitted] [Reporter] Do you agree that the distribution of property will be completed by 1996, namely by the time when the term of the members of the current parliament runs out. Then, as Prime Minister Adolfas Slezevicius pledged, the law on declaration of income and property by the state officials will come into operation. [Ozolas] I think that in principle this is what is being planned: to introduce the declaration on income and property around 1996. At that time, the current top-ranking state officials and those who rank below them and yet are capable of grabbing something will no longer have to worry about their reputation and especially about their political reputation. Whether they are re-elected or not, this would be of no further importance. Therefore the government will make efforts to stay in power until the end of term and then as God wills. There is a possibility that the current left-wing government would have to step down earlier. It is possible that this could be beneficial, however, if the right-wingers propose a similar policy, which is to support large capital -- only then, I would not see any difference whether Lithuania is ruled by rich left-wingers or by rich right-wingers. [passage omitted] I am very much concerned that the law on income and property declaration by the most senior state officials has not been introduced. I hope that we will push this law through although it will be somewhat spoiled, but then it would be better than nothing. It is simply annoying to hear about human rights violations in this matter when we know that this law is the basic means for the introduction of law and order in the financial life of the country. [passage omitted] [Reporter] At today's news conference, you also spoke about international affairs and you mentioned that the forthcoming visit by the Ukrainian president may become one of the most important events of early 1994. [Ozolas] The Ukraine is the most important neighbor and a possible ally of Lithuania in Central Europe. There will practically be no Eastern Europe without the Ukraine and the Baltic countries. There would be fragments and pieces of it, such as the Vyshegrad group or the Baltic states without it. The appearance of the sovereign Ukraine in Europe, and I say this believing that the Ukraine will continue to proceed towards her absolute independence from Russia... [pauses] If she fails to do this then our cooperation would be very much restricted. [passage omitted] However, if the Ukraine gets more and more independent, than I think both Lithuania and the Ukraine would have something to say concerning setting to right the life in Europe. [Reporter] The Ukraine and Lithuania can cooperate not only in the economic sphere. You also attach great importance to the military union. [Ozolas] To speak about a union would be too bold. So far there is no need to start designing such a union. However, if NATO continues to act as it has until now, then the countries of central and Eastern Europe would have to look for a way out of this situation and to set up their own security by their own efforts. Who else apart from the Ukraine can help Lithuania in such a situation and take care of the independence and security? In a political sense the Ukraine is neutral enough towards Lithuania and the Baltic states and the Ukraine has a great interest in Central Europe which cannot exist without Lithuania and the Baltic states. [passage omitted] These are mutual interests to put Europe in good order which would guarantee our independent life and peace in Europe. The Russian aggressiveness which is being manifested every day would inevitably influence Western Europe and I think that Western Europe will react to it by making similar steps. In this respect Central Europe has great possibilities for setting up a balance in Europe. [Reporter] At the same time you said that NATO is at present not interested in cooperation with Eastern and central European countries. [Ozolas] I would like to put it differently. It is interested not in pushing aside Russia which, feeling this interest of the United States as the main ally of Western Europe, endeavors to exert influence on Western Europe and the United States to be helpful. [sentence as heard]. This means the restoration of the former Soviet Union's expanse, and thus Russia mentions with exceptional ferocity the Baltic states. NATO responded to all this with silence. Clinton, our dear young president, also preferred to be silent. He even said that he himself would talk to the Baltic states about not insulting the Russian speaking people. This is confusion by the U.S. president and much criticism has been levelled at him about this in his own country. I think that his telephone call to Latvia's president was an attempt to correct his behavior. But this is a very significant fact that a big state will always better understand another big state than a small one. Therefore we say that we must pin our hopes on NATO, but mostly we must depend on our strength, incidentally, also with regard to our possible allies who live close by.
