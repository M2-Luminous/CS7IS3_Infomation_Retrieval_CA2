Chen Jian stated: With the changing of the international situation and the continuous expansion of UN membership, growing calls have been heard from the vast number of UN members, and from developing countries in particular, for enlarging the Security Council, an important UN body. China favors the expansion of the Security Council at the appropriate time. He pointed out: Expansion of the Security Council should be done under the guidance of the UN Charter and in a manner which provides full consideration to the principle of equitable distribution so the Security Council will be more representative, more efficient, and more capable of dealing with major international issues in a positive, balanced, equitable, and efficient manner. He added: Expansion of the Security Council involves the interests of all quarters. Balancing these diverse interests is a very complicated issue. Therefore, we should consider this issue from all sides, especially taking into account the fact that the developing nations make up a majority of the UN membership, so as to strike a balance between developed and developing nations as well as between various regions. Moreover, it is also important for the regions to reach a consensus. Chen Jian also said: It is necessary to give full play to democracy by extensively enlisting the views of the member nations, medium and small nations in particular; by conducting comprehensive, in-depth, and full consultations; and by finding a rational formula acceptable to all through negotiation and consensus-building.
