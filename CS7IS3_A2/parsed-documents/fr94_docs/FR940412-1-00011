FR940412-1-00011 FR940412-1-00003 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;05&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives: Univair Aircraft Corporation Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to Univair Aircraft Corporation (Univair) Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes. The proposed action would require installing inspection openings in the outer wing panels, inspecting (one-time) the wing outer panel structure for corrosion, and repairing any corrosion found. Several reports of corrosion in the outer wing panels of the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure. DATES: Comments must be received on or before June 24, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;05&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.
