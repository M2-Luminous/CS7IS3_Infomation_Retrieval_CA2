All economic and trade commissions and departments, foreign trade bureaus, and relevant units should abide by the requirements of this ministry on halting the infringement of trademark rights; act in light of local conditions in their own localities and units; organize relevant export enterprises, and especially the leaders of these enterprises, to study conscientiously the circulars of the State Council and the Supreme People's Court on dealing relentless blows to the production and sale of fake commodities; and enhance their legal awareness of trademarks. 2. All economic and trade commissions and departments, foreign trade bureaus, chambers of commerce, and head offices should take responsibility and organize export enterprises in their own localities or under their industries and trades to conduct overall inspections of the possible manufacture and sale of commodities using already-registered trademarks (including accepting trademarks designated by foreign clients). Immediate action must be taken to redress errors as soon as they are uncovered. 3. No foreign trade enterprise is allowed to make use of sales promotion activities -- such as trade fairs, advertisements, and propaganda activities of any kind -- to provide conveniences to factories engaged in the production of counterfeit goods, including purchasing, exhibiting, publicizing, and acting as agents for export commodities bearing trademarks registered by others. 4. All localities should regard the use of trademarks as part of their appraisal of the accomplishments of foreign trade enterprises and their leaders. Enterprises that have seriously violated trademark rules and regulations in their daily operations will be deprived of their right to participate in the annual appraisal and selection of outstanding enterprises. 5. All economic and trade commissions and departments, foreign trade bureaus, chambers of import and export trade, and head offices should report to this ministry promptly any case in which an export enterprise is punished by judicial or industrial and commercial departments for manufacturing and selling commodities using the registered trademarks of others, as well as for other law-breaking activities concerning trademarks. 6. Once export enterprises holding export permits are certified guilty of producing and selling quota-administered commodities using trademarks registered by others, MOFERT will notify the relevant permit-issuing departments to suspend the issuance of export and quota permits to such enterprises. According to the seriousness of each case, this ministry will suspend or annul the enterprise's autonomy in the export of relevant commodities, or even terminate its right to handle imports and exports. It is a long-term task to eliminate counterfeit commodities and halt trademark infringement. All economic and trade administrative departments, as well as all relevant units, should adopt feasible measures, work in close coordination with the departments in charge, reinforce efforts to supervise and guide export enterprises, and halt counterfeiting and law-breaking activities in foreign trade according to the law. This ministry will investigate and affix the responsibility on leaders of competent administrative departments for failure to take effective measures, for serious dereliction of duty, for repeated infringements of rights, and for other serious problems.
