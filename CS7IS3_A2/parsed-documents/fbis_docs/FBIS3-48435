Mun Ik-hwan. The director of the Kim Chong-tae General Electric Locomotive Works, Pak Su-pom, branded the act of the Kim Yong-sam clique as an inhuman act of fascist hooligans who take no account of the beautiful manners and customs handed down through generations and elementary civility and morality. He said: "The South Korean puppet clique mumbled about the `nuclear issue' and `an organization profiting the enemy.' It is really a far-fetched argument and an expression of a vicious scheme to dampen the nation's fervor of reunification, delay the country's reunification and finally break off the ties of the nation". He warned that a sledge-hammer blow will be dealt at the Kim Yong-sam clique, the enemy with whom our nation cannot live under the same sky. Yi Song-pong, chief pastor of the Pongsu Church, Pyongyang, said: "By not allowing delegates of the North to go to Seoul to mourn the deceased, the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique stripped themselves bare as a group of barbarians ignoring human morality." He said Rev. Mun Ik-hwan was a patriotic champion of reunification who devotedly struggled for the reunification of the country and democratization of society in South Korea for many years. He pointed out that the "civilian" signboard hung out by the Kim Yong-sam clique was false and it was a group of traitors who did not want national reconciliation and reunification. "I join the religious men in declaring to the world that the Kim Yong-sam fascist clique is a group of truculent, despicable traitors who must no longer be left in this world where only love, harmony and trust must prevail and, on this land of our nation," he added.
