FR940516-2-00103 FR940516-2-00071 [Release No. 34&hyph;34025; File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;60] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc., Relating to Permanent Approval of the Pilot Program Involving Debit Put Spreads in Broad-Based Indexes With European-Style Exercise May 9, 1994. On December 27, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), pursuant to section 19(b)(10 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 proposed rule change seeking permanent approval of Exchange Rule 24.11A, ``Debit Put Spread Cash Account Transactions,'' which establishes a pilot program allowing approved public customers with qualified portfolios (``spread exemption customers'') to effect and maintain in cash accounts debit put spread transactions in broad-based index options with European-style exercise. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 Initially, the Commission approved the pilot program on a one-year basis through November 25, 1992. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 29992 (November 26, 1991), 56 FR 63526 (order approving File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;91&hyph;14 and SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;91&hyph;17) (``Debit Put Spread Approval Order''). Subsequently, both the CBOE and the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'') amended the definition of ``debit put spread'' to provide that the strike price of the long leg of the spread must exceed, not equal, the strike price of the short leg. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 30267 (January 21, 1992), 57 FR 3234 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;91&hyph;50) and 30419 (February 26, 1992), 57 FR 7825 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;92&hyph;07). On June 30, 1993, the Commission approved an extension of the pilot program through December 31, 1993. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 32556 (June 30, 1993), 58 FR 32556 (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;13) (``Pilot Extension Order''). Most recently, the Commission approved a proposal extending the pilot program through December 31, 1994. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33407 (December 30, 1993), 59 FR 1041 (notice of filing and order granting partial accelerated approval of File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;93&hyph;60) (``1994 Extension Order''). The proposed rule change was published in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33407 (December 30, 1993), 59 FR 1041. No comments were received on the proposed rule change. Currently, ยง220.8 of Regulation T under the Act precludes customers from effecting spread transactions in cash accounts. Specifically, ยง220.8(a)(3)(ii) of Regulation T includes in permissible cash account transactions a creditor's issue, endorsement or guarantee of a put option for a customer if the creditor obtains cash in an amount equal to the exercise price of the option or holds in the account any of the following instruments with a current market value at least equal to the exercise price of the option and with one year or less to maturity: U.S. government securities, negotiable bank certificates of deposit, or bankers acceptance issued by a U.S. bank and payable in the United States. Because offsetting option positions fail to satisfy these criteria, spreads are not included in permissible cash account transactions and therefore must be effected in margin accounts. On November 26, 1991, the Commission approved proposals submitted by the CBOE and the Amex which established one year pilot programs allowing approved public customers 4 with qualified portfolios of stock to effect and maintain in cash accounts debit put spread transactions in broad-based index options with European-style exercise. 5 The Commission approved proposals extending the CBOE's pilot program through December 31, 1993, and, most recently, through December 31, 1994. 6 4 For purposes of its pilot program, a public customer is a customer whose orders are eligible to be placed on a CBOE limit order book under Exchange Rule 7.4(a). 5 See Debit Put Spread Approval Order, supra note 3. 6 See Pilot Extension Order and 1994 Extension Order, supra note 3. The pilot program defines a ``debit put spread'' as ``a long put position coupled with a short put position overlying the same broad-based index and having an equivalent underlying aggregate index value, where the short put(s) expires with the long put(s), and the strike price of the long put(s) exceeds the strike price of the short put(s).'' Under the terms of the pilot, only public customers approved by the CBOE are permitted to participate in the pilot program. To obtain the CBOE's approval, customers are required, among other things, to hold a qualified stock portfolio or its equivalent that is composed of net long positions in common stocks in at least four industry groups and that contains at least twenty stocks, none of which accounts for more than fifteen percent of the value of the portfolio. A portfolio must meet these standards at all times, regardless of trading activity in the stocks. In addition, the debit put spread positions must be carried in an account with an Exchange member organization and the qualified portfolio must be maintained with either an Exchange member organization, another broker-dealer, a bank, or a securities depository. In conjunction with the creation of the pilot program, the Commission staff also issued no-action letters to the Amex and the CBOE stating the staff would not recommend enforcement action against the Amex and the CBOE due to the operation of the pilot program, namely the maintenance of spread positions in a cash account. 7 The staff of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board'') also informed the Commission staff that Board staff would not object to the Commission staff's issuance of these no-action positions in connection with the pilot programs. 8 Most recently, Board staff indicated that it would not raise objections to permanent approval of the pilot program. 9 7 See Letter from Howard L.
