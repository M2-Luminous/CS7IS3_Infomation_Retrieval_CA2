Speaking on the telephone to the people of Jericho celebrating the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Fatah Movement and the intifadah entering its seventh year, brother Abu-'Ammar said that no one could erase the Palestinian people from the annals of history or the region's geographical and political map. He added: We have decided to make peace with our enemy, but they are trying to prevaricate and say that deadlines are not sacred. I am saying: No, deadlines are sacred, and he who signs something must respect it. I am telling them that prevarications cannot affect the determination of the Palestinian people, because this people's determination comes from God; God wills what His soldiers want. Yes, they will not be able to undermine our determination and will not be able to outmaneuver us. We have signed an agreement and they must respect it. The conference sponsors, Russia and America, signed with us under the auspices of the President of the United States and under the patronage, before the eyes, and with the blessing of the whole world. I am saying this so that it will be clear to those who are near by and those who are far away. Brother Abu-'Ammar said: By signing the Declaration of Principles between the PLO and Israel, we brought our people to a new and decisive historical era. This agreement, inclusive of its contents from the start of the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area, absolutely did not mean redeployment. Withdrawal means withdrawal. But there is redeployment in other areas, in addition to the establishment of national authority under the leadership of the PLO in implementation of our Palestinian National Council's decision in 1974, which stipulated the establishment of national authority on any part of the Palestinian soil being liberated or from which the Israelis withdrew. Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that Holy Jerusalem was in our hearts and eyes and we would not compromise on it. On the issue of the refugees and the settlements, Brother Abu-'Ammar pointed out that the issue of the emigres was entrusted to a committee from our Jordanian and Egyptian brothers, Israel, and the PLO to arrange for their return. The fate of the refugees would be determined in a period not exceeding three years, that the same applies to the settlements and their removal, and the final borders of the state of Palestine. Brother Abu-'Ammar affirmed that we will not live in homelands or ghettos, and nobody can ever humiliate the Palestinian people. If Rabin thinks that he can humiliate the Palestinian people, he is mistaken. He can continue occupying the land, but he is incapable of humiliating a Palestinian child, woman, man, or youth. 'Arafat said that with this agreement we have firmly established the Palestinian people on the geographical and political map of the Middle East. He said: Do not forget that the Zionists said at the first Zionist Congress in Basel, Switzerland in 1897: A Land Without a People for a People Without a Land. No, this land has the Palestinian people in it, and we are planted in the Palestinian land like Palestinian oak trees; our ancestors and their bones are in it, we are in it, and our children will be in it. At the end of his address Abu-'Ammar urged the audience and all Palestinians to unite. He said: Unity, unity, unity for all the sons of Palestine, for all the generals of Palestine, and all the organizations of Palestine. Together we will make the homeland and together we will build this homeland; a homeland for all freemen and the honorable regardless of their affiliations, parties, or identities. We have a rendezvous with dawn; we have a rendezvous with victory.
