In Luanda today, the Russian Embassy denied the involvement of private Russian citizens in the alleged assistance to UNITA. In an exclusive interview with Radio Nacional de Angola, (Anatoliy Korunov), minister counselor at the Russian Embassy in Angola, said such involvement is absurd, but admitted the possibility of Russian aircraft leased by certain South African companies having been used for other goals. [(Korunov)] We have heard that two Antonovs have been impounded in Namibia. One was an An-26 with a Russian crew, seized on 5 March. Yet, it has been confirmed that the aircraft was not carrying anything for UNITA. Moreover, no complaint has been made to us. The second aircraft had a foreign crew. Obviously, we know nothing about it. Unfortunately, we lack information to take action against such violations. [Correspondent] Are you saying that Russian aircraft can be leased for a variety of purposes? [(Korunov)] I think so. [Correspondent] Even if it may compromise Russia's integrity? [(Korunov)] Undoubtedly, that can happen. The Russian diplomat said if it is confirmed that Russian aircraft are being used to supply UNITA in southern Angola, his government will take stern action against the culprits because they would be violating international and Russian law. [(Korunov)] As far as we know, no Russian aircraft has carried (?weapons) for UNITA because that would be in violation of international and Russian laws. We will take stern action if we have concrete evidence. The Russian diplomat reiterated that Moscow adheres scrupulously to sanctions adopted by the UN Security Council on UNITA. [(Korunov)] There is a UN Security Council resolution on sanctions against UNITA. The Russian Government has approved special legislation on the violation of sanctions. It makes it compulsory for every Russian to adhere to the sanctions.
