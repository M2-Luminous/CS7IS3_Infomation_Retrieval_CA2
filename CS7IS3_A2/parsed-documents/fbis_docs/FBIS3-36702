Gazprom warned Ukraine again that the supplies might be stopped on February 9 unless the debt, 1.2 trillion rubles as of February 1, is paid. According to Belei, Yefio Bvyagilsky, acting prime minister, had informed experts on an agreement reached with the Russian Government to the effect that Ukrainian supplies to Russia would be regarded as payment of the debt. On the other hand, Stepan Yalovega, the spokesman for the Ukrainian State Oil and Gas Committee, told Interfax-Ukraine that the size of the debt mentioned in the Gazprom message came as a surprise. Vasily Razgonyuk, chief engineer of the Ukrgazprom concern, said that it was up to the government to comment on the situation. In his words, the concern provided what amounted to an interest-free credit to all Ukrainian industries by supplying gas without demanding prepayment. "The industries have not paid us for last year's supplies," he said and added that the consumers owed Ukrgazprom over 10 trillion karbovantsi as of February 1.
