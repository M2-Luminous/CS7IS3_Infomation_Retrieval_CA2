According to a communique from the bank, the measure is aimed at proportionately distributing among agents the amount of dollars at a carefully calculated average price. The announcement also specifies that the amount of U.S. currency requested by agents must not exceed 10 percent of the amount sold the previous day. Banks and other operators may sell this foreign currency to the public for a profit that must not exceed the amount of 20 cents above the original purchase price. Although the demand for dollars continued on Tuesday at a frenetic pace, the comparative level of the foreign currency's current price decreased. In fact, the dollar's price closed at 128.50 bolivares in the banks and at 129.50 in the foreign exchange houses. Meanwhile, the Central Bank of Venezuela continued to supply foreign currency to enable financial organizations to meet public demand. According to business groups, the increase in the dollar's price will be reflected in product prices over the next few months. According to the Jose Bouza Izquierdo, chairman of the National Banking Council, citizens should not get nervous and make purchases that encourage an increase in the dollar's exchange rate, because the exchange market situation is beginning to stabilize.
