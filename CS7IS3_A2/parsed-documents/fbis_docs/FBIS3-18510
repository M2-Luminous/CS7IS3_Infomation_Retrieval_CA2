But the Government made clear it was awaiting a commitment from the United States and other countries before agreeing. The Prime Minister said the Government would consider providing more troops, but only as part of a wider international effort. And Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind emphasised the Government's concern that it is already doing its fair share in Bosnia, with 2,500 troops on the ground. He was replying to the appeal for 10,650 more soldiers by Yasushi Akashi, UN special envoy for former Yugoslavia, who warned that fragile ceasefires would otherwise collapse. Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, warned his troops were operating "on a wing and a prayer," well outside normal sensible limits. "If I can give an example -- a week ago there were only four Warrior vehicles left to try and control one of the most hotly-contested crossing points across the line of conflict in central Bosnia and that was in Gorni Vakuf," he said. Mr Rifkind, in a clear reference to the United States, said the Government had always said its view would be influenced by whether other UN members, including those with "highly-trained, highly-professional forces," were ready to contribute. "Britain is already the second largest contributor and therefore it is not unreasonable to say that if there was a burden to be met, it should be spread properly and widely amongst the relevant countries," he said. But he insisted: "We have not ruled out the question of more troops." Government sources said ministers were "not reluctant" to do more but felt strongly that pressure must now be placed on other nations, notably the United States, which has only 15 troops in Bosnia, to play a much bigger role. General Jean Cot, UN commander in former Yugoslavia, stepped up pressure on Washington saying the American refusal to send troops until an enforceable peace treaty is signed was "a strange and not very courageous idea." "The better idea is to send troops when they're needed -- to enforce the coming of a peace," added. "I would be very keen for U.S. troops to be on the ground tomorrow." And in an unusually blunt news conference with Gen Cot, Mr Akashi hit out: "We are profoundly disturbed by the lukewarm and negative response to date." There was anger in the British military that deployment of extra troops to Bosnia could be jeopardised by reports of a looming clash with the Cabinet. As rapidly developing peace initiatives give a glimmer of hope that an end to the bitter ethnic fighting could be in sight, the Government faces tough decisions. The Cabinet rejected the view by the four Service chiefs last month that Britain should send a second infantry battalion, after the urgent request from General Rose for up to 3,000 reinforcements when the Serbs agreed to pull back their heavy weapons around Sarajevo or place them in UN control. The Service chiefs argued it was crucial to be seen to back the British general and to support the peace process boosted by Nato's tough new approach. But they were overruled by the Cabinet as ministers again stressed Britain was already doing its bit. "Emotionally the people in uniform inevitably feel we should have done more," said a MoD source. "But the chiefs know they are in a political arena and are quite content with the decision. There is no split." There are fears that reports -- fiercely denied by MoD and military sources -- that the chiefs are squaring up for a major row with Cabinet ministers over new deployments could put plans at risk. The Army is adamant that nothing smaller than a self-sufficient battalion group could be sent. "Anything smaller would be disastrous," said one officer. But a military source said: "These reports have made it more difficult to send. Senior ministers could well dig in their heels." UN troops are already stretched far and thin across Bosnia and there are growing risks that they could be isolated and attacked. Lord Bramall, former Chief of the General Staff, urged the Government to send a battalion of troops. "Quite frankly, a British battalion -- expert in this sort of thing -- is worth two or three of some others from other places," he added. A company of about 150 Coldstream Guards sent to help to police the peace in Sarajevo are living in the back of their Warrior armoured fighting vehicles on the side of a mountain in heavy snow. "You can only maintain that sort of existence for a short period before morale begins to fall," said another officer. There are contingency plans to send a further 2,000 troops to Bosnia in a crisis to support the force already there. The Army has two infantry battalions equipped with Saxon lightly-armoured personnel carriers already painted in UN white colours, which would be ideal for peacekeeping operations. Either the Green Howards or the Duke of Wellington's Regiment could be sent quickly to Bosnia with their 64 Saxons and logistics back-up by sea and air. As the RAF's C-130 Hercules transport aircraft can each carry two Saxons together with men and logistics support, lead elements could be in Bosnia within days.
