FR941021-1-00039 FR941021-1-00009 Accordingly, the FAA specifically asked the committee of consultants assembled by the AMA to review the cardiovascular standards in light of recent advances and current concepts in cardiovascular medicine. Further, the FAA asked the physicians to develop suggestions for inclusion of diagnostic and prognostic techniques in the standards, if appropriate and feasible. The final AMA Report, however, indicates that the group could not establish, in the standards, qualifications for medical certification. Instead, the AMA Report suggests general retention of the current cardiovascular standards and format with additions to further improve their utility for ensuring aviation safety. In the presence of known cardiovascular disease, certification decisions still would require professional evaluation of multiple medical factors rather than verification of the results of a test specified in the published standards. The individual airman who fails to meet the published standards would continue to be considered in accordance with the discretionary special issuance provisions. The AMA Report does recommend a number of changes. Additional cardiac conditions are suggested for inclusion in the standards as rendering an airman unqualified for certification; revised standards for acceptable blood pressure are given; maximum levels of blood cholesterol are proposed for some commercial airmen; and routine periodic electrocardiography for all airmen is recommended. Rather than changes to the standards, the AMA Report emphasizes the need for careful evaluation of all applicants prior to certification. Where individuals are found either to have cardiovascular disease or to have factors or findings indicative of increased risk, more exhaustive evaluations are suggested before certification can be granted and before periodic renewal of certification. Recommendations for these evaluations are included in the AMA Report and are generally consistent with long-standing FAA practice. Coronary Heart Disease The FAA proposes that the present standards pertaining to coronary heart disease and its manifestations remain unchanged. As amended in 1982, these standards are clear and have provided a firm medical basis for denying airman privileges to individuals with significant, active coronary heart disease who might endanger public safety. This condition precludes routine airman medical certification because it is a documented cause of in-flight pilot incapacitation, and it is progressive in nature. The FAA will continue to evaluate airmen who fail to meet this standard to determine their eligibility for a discretionary special issuance of medical certification. Certification will be based upon acceptable evidence that the individual has recovered and that his or her anatomic and physiologic cardiac status would justify the subsequent exercise of airman privileges. Appropriate functional limitations of airman privileges may be applied, and periodic follow-up medical reevaluations may be required to detect any relapse or progression of disease. This procedure protects the public while providing a means of relief for those individuals whose heart disease has stabilized sufficiently to pose an acceptable risk. Since adoption of the amendments in 1982, an increasing number of airmen have been found eligible and granted certification. Additional Standards for Disqualification The FAA also proposes additions to the standards in proposed paragraphs (a) (4), (5), and (6) of §§67.111, 67.211, and 67.311, providing that a history or clinical diagnosis of cardiac valve replacement, implantation of a permanent cardiac pacemaker, or heart replacement would make the subject person unqualified for certification under the standards. These amendments are consistent with the AMA Report and the opinions of agency consultants and reflect the serious nature of each of the conditions. Among the agency's concerns are failure of prosthetic heart valves, pacemaker malfunction or progression of underlying disease that has required artificial cardiac pacing, organ rejection, or the complications of immunosuppression. While the FAA may determine that an airman with a history or clinical diagnosis of any of these conditions may be granted a discretionary special issuance of certification, such history would preclude certification until specialized medical evaluation confirms adequate recovery and function and the absence of significant risk in terms of the aviation environment. Where special issuance of certification is granted, the regulations will provide for periodic medical reevaluations, if appropriate, for subsequent certification. Under the proposed medical standards, a small number of airmen, who currently hold certificates as a result of an order of the NTSB, would become disqualified from further medical certification because of the addition of specifically disqualifying medical conditions. These airmen had been denied medical certification by the FAA under a current general medical standard. Under the general medical standards, an individual is denied certification by the FAA when he or she has a condition which the Federal Air Surgeon finds may reasonably be expected to make the individual unable to safely perform pilot duties. For example, the FAA has denied certification to airmen who have had cardiac valve replacement and the NTSB has ordered certification in some of these cases. Under the proposed standards a medical history of cardiac valve replacement would be specifically disqualifying and those airmen would no longer be entitled to certification. It is expected, however, that the possible certification of such individuals would be reviewed under the Federal Air Surgeon's special issuance authority once the FAA evaluates the case and is satisfied with the airman's condition since the NTSB ordered certification. Such a disposition of these cases would be consistent with the FAA's practice after the 1982 amendment of the cardiovascular standards rendered several airmen disqualified whose certification under the old medical standards had been ordered by the NTSB.
