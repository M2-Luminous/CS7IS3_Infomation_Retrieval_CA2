Document Type:FBIS TRENDS-4FEB94-CHINA Beijing Seeks To Cool Economy, Control Inflation SUMMARY Reflecting increasing Chinese leadership concern over mounting inflation, Politburo standing committee member and central bank governor Zhu Rongji recently introduced a potentially controversial package of tough anti-inflation measures, which includes a plan for tight new controls over credit. END SUMMARY Zhu announced the new measures at the closing session of a national conference on financial work held from 12 to 15 January. While calling for continued implementation of key policies from the austerity program instituted last July to address the chaotic behavior in the financial sector, Zhu also unveiled a new hardline policy on credit expansion (Xinhua, 19 January). Ordering financial authorities to "strictly control" the "total credit supply," Zhu said that the "planned total credit line" must not be exceeded "even by one yuan" and that "investigation" will be carried out to ensure compliance. He went on to back up his statement in warning against unauthorized bank lending. Underscoring the importance the leadership appears to attach to the new program, the State Council immediately reinforced Zhu's demands, releasing a circular on 29 January calling for tight central control over investment (Xinhua, 29 January). Echoing Zhu's speech, the circular stated that "in principle, no more new projects will be approved this year" in an effort to prevent "reckless and redundant" construction. The circular also ordered tighter controls over the "sources of capital," urging further action against illicit fund-raising schemes employed at local levels. Seeking to reassert strong central control over new investment projects, the circular went on to establish restrictive requirements for authorization and demanded strict screening and tight management of the approval process. Investments in real estate development and construction, in particular, it said must be "incorporated" into the state investment plan or they will lose their eligibility for loans. Guarantees for Priority Projects Perhaps still sensitive to criticism that his anti-inflationary economic policies last year shut off funding to important enterprises and projects, Zhu sought to reassure potential critics of the stringent credit controls of the leadership's standing commitment to a "soft landing" for the economy. For example, he implied that loans for projects in "infrastructure and basic industry" would not be cut off, stating that they would be managed by a new "state development bank" in charge of policy- related lending. Seeking to give added authority to his instructions, Zhu urged financial cadres to follow paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's instruction to avoid making the bank a "locked safe," just as it also should not be run "like a currency issuance company." The 29 January State Council circular further reinforced Zhu's message, stipulating that the "needs of priority projects" should be "ensured" by "pooling together" financial resources. It called on all regions and departments to "give priority" to completing major projects approved last year, including, for example, improvements in China's housing stock. Similarly, a 24 January article in the PRC weekly journal Liaowang by commentator "Bao Xin"--a forum frequently used by the leadership to illuminate its pronouncements--stated that the new restriction on the overall scale of investment "does not mean" that "no new investment" will be made in capital construction. "Necessary" capital construction, according to the commentator, is a "major means" of sustaining the "lasting momentum" of economic development. The commentator went on to reaffirm that "priority" should be given to basic industries and infrastructure projects, while the scale of other projects, including real estate, office buildings, and hotels, must be "resolutely cut down." Motives The need to check rising inflation appears to have made it politically possible for Beijing to call for the potentially painful economic measures. In his speech, Zhu attributed the introduction of the new policies to the danger that "inflationary pressure could build up at any time." PRC media had already served notice that inflation had begun to rise late last year. Judging from media reports citing State Statistical Bureau figures on cost of living increases in 35 Chinese cities, the urban inflation rate in December jumped 3.9 percent over the previous month's rate (Xinhua, 17 December; Zhongguo Xinwen She, 20 January). Adding to the leadership's worries were dramatic increases in the prices of grain, cooking oil, and other essential commodities beginning in November, which prompted an important State Council meeting on 25 December and calls for price controls on these products (Xinhua, 27 December 1993). Implications Beijing's introduction of tough new economic measures serves to underscore the party leadership's concern over inflation. However, the campaign faces a rough road ahead as it is likely to run up against stiff opposition, ranging from state enterprise advocates and provincial and local officials with a vested interest in investment-led growth to radical reformers promoting rapid growth. Beijing's apparent inability to strictly enforce earlier central directives to cool investment also threatens to be a liability. The political tug-of-war over inflation and investment is unlikely to end until Beijing makes good on its promise to establish a more independent banking system able to exercise sound economic judgment in allocating capital.
