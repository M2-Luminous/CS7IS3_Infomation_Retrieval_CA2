One of the most significant things to take place within the past few weeks is that the issue of the barrier around the island is slowly gaining new attention in the U.S. Congress, and this time, it is being opposed. Not long ago, as you may recall, several committees within the House of Representatives discussed a bill presented by Congressman Charles Rangel. The bill called for a complete end to the trade embargo. Now, the House Subcommittee on Agriculture [as received] implicitly addressed the matter from a similar position. This subcommittee held public hearings on 19 May under the title: Review of the Implications of Trade Relations With Cuba on U.S. Agriculture. Several panels comprising members of Congress, experts, businessmen, and representatives of organizations related to agricultural production companies participated in the hearings. According to several people with whom I spoke and who witnessed these proceedings, this time the conclusions moved away from the negative conclusions usually voiced at such hearings staged by extreme right-wingers from Florida and their allies on Capitol Hill. Except for the presentations made by two well-known advocates of this negative trend -- Lincoln Diaz Balart and Robert Menendez -- all other participants focused their opinions and questions on the business opportunities offered by the island. The meeting was very technical and focused on economic and commercial matters, and it was presided over by Representative Timothy Penny, the chairman of the House subcommittee. Incidentally, Penny was forced to call Republican Congressman Diaz Balart to order when he began listing the virtues of a draft law about a Cuba without a revolutionary government. Keeping his composure, Penny made it clear to the speaker that the objective of the hearing was to discuss and learn more about the possibility of reestablishing trade relations with Cuba, and not to discuss or defend any law in particular. As you may also recall, several House committees held hearings a few weeks ago to examine Charles Rangel's bill against the blockade. This is the first time the U.S. Congress has addressed the matter. In addition, for the first time at such meetings, businessmen expressed their disapproval of the isolation policy against the island, and they went on to defend their right to do business with Havana. If we compare the final results of these congressional hearings and the results of the hearings held by the House Subcommittee on Agriculture, we can see that the new "no" we are beginning to hear shows that, although Capitol Hill, for the most part, supports the trade embargo against Cuba, there is an interesting and positive change taking place on this issue, which is beginning to roll like a small snowball all across the United States.
