Around the Lunar New Year, prices of basic necessities including grain, edible oil, and so on rose and fluctuated by 20 to 30 percent in various localities across the country, which elicited pessimistic sentiments about the economic prospects for 1994 and a premonition of uneasiness among mainland people. The phenomenon of panic purchasing, which has seldom been seen in recent years, suddenly emerged again. Given the emergency measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy and the temporary stability of commodity prices, the dark economic shadow cast on people's minds by the earlier fluctuations cannot be removed. Moreover, the "Decisions Concerning Several Issues on the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee last year were partially put into practice at the start of this year. However, mainland people are still unfamiliar with most of the contents of the "Decisions." In various localities, people were resentful or felt puzzled to varying degrees about the policies made according to the "Decisions." Some local officials in the economically developed regions or provinces are dissatisfied with the value-added tax and revenue-sharing systems and think that these policies, which are aimed at intensifying the controlling ability of the central authorities and weakening the financial powers and resources of localities, will substantially retard their economic development speed. In many areas, people once again started an investment craze by taking the opportunity of relaxed macroeconomic regulation and control by the central authorities to seek more loans to expand local economic development, which has intensified inflationary pressures on the mainland considerably. Furthermore, millions of workers and staff members throughout the country who work in large and medium state enterprises, two-thirds of which are bogged down in the predicament of open or hidden losses, feel uneasy and greatly dissatisfied in the face of soaring prices. Since the end of last year, social security conditions on the mainland have deteriorated again, with the proportion of serious cases increasing and the phenomena of organized crime worsening.... The CPC hierarchy is very worried about the above situation. For this reason, while stressing the importance of intensifying social security, cracking down on various criminal activities, stabilizing commodity prices, and properly arranging the masses' lives, it recently decided to reiterate those policies and measures practiced by the central government since last June to stabilize the economy, rectify the monetary order, strictly control the total amount of credit, reinforce supervision and management of finance, and intensify central macroeconomic regulation and control. In addition, it particularly stressed the need to "continue exercising strict management by mandatory planning in granting loans for investment in fixed assets." The CPC Recently Put Forth a "20-Character Principle" Additionally, the CPC hierarchy also held an unprecedentedly large-scale national propaganda and ideological work meeting in the second half of January to make "work arrangements" for controlling social opinion and preventing the media from engendering social disturbances. It is thus obvious that the work focus of the CPC hierarchy has now been put entirely on "stability." The guiding policy ideology of "accelerating both reform and development" has faded. Apart from retaining the former wording of "sustained, rapid, and healthy" economic development, it has lately put forth a "20-character principle:" "Seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open the door wider, promote development, and maintain stability." This is the overall requirement for work this year, so various tasks should be carried out to serve and meet this requirement. Meanwhile, authoritative personalities in economic circles feel that basic stability should be maintained in five areas--prices, speed, agriculture, money, and society. Since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji, State Council vice premier and concurrently president of the People's Bank of China, has been widely criticized and complained about by local officials because of the measures he adopted to stabilize the economy and intensify central macroeconomic regulation and control. However, he has broken silence and become very active recently, and his position and views have been highlighted again. Models of Decentralization and Centralization Originated From Third Plenary Session Within the CPC hierarchy, there is generally no divergence of views on the issue of "whether or not the central capability in macroeconomic regulation and control should be augmented and whether or not the central committee should have powerful authority." The CPC hierarchy has been deeply worried about this issue over the past few years. During the last 10 years or so, every upsurge of economic development on the mainland has been generated from the practice of various policies and measures to repeatedly decentralize or delegate power to the lower levels, and every standstill or slowdown in economic reform and development has been caused by centralizing or withdrawing power from the lower levels. As a matter of fact, all such moves, decentralization, centralization, and the delegation or withdrawal of power, no matter how they are looked upon, comprise the basic content of reforms, anti-reforms, development, and stagnation on the mainland over the past 10 years or so. The problem is: the centralization, decentralization, and the withdrawal and delegation of power were all carried out under the precondition that the political and economic structures generally remained unchanged, so that decentralization and the delegation of power to the lower levels became a special means to mitigate crises in the old structures and to display their structural functions, while centralization and the withdrawal of power became an act of intensifying and supporting the old structure by amassing achievements scored through decentralization and the delegation of power to the lower levels. The "mutually complementary" effect which was unexpectedly obtained from these two opposite and contradictory actions in the old structure caused interest groups in the CPC and its administrative officials at various levels to expand. This has enabled them to form "common interests" on a greater scale and caused their motive of relying on the old structure to gain more interests through decentralization. As a result, the old structure has been able to maintain its existence for a long period of time. However, within the original structural framework of decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and withdrawal of powers, the mainland's economic development has been unable to avoid and overcome the malpractice of big fluctuations, haphazard expansion, and rigid uniformity. The major development of factors of a market economy obtained from the decentralization of power cannot be transformed into any wealth in the old structure through the centralization and withdrawal of power from the lower levels, nor can it continue to form factors for healthy economic development under the model of decentralization and the delegation of powers to the lower levels. Therefore, a model of combined decentralization and centralization emerged in the "Decisions" passed by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. Starting from the overall transformation of the economic structure, the CPC attempted to create and provide a brand new structural framework for the mainland's economic development. Under this framework, a modern enterprise system would be instituted as a supporting point, which would be propped up by a market system, taxation, finance, state macroeconomic regulation and control, and a social insurance system; the administrative division of power would be determined by the scale of assets comprising the market; and a new power structure would be established under the conditions of a market economy. Zhu Rongji Braves Wind and Waves Therefore, when we assess economic reform on the mainland today, we can no longer use criteria such as whether it is decentralization, centralization, and the delegation and withdrawal of powers. Instead, we should have our eyes on whether or not it is beneficial to fostering the main body of activities in a market economy and effectively allocates resources in accordance with the laws governing the market economy. Judging from these new criteria, the decentralization and delegation of power to the lower levels is not necessarily tantamount to reform, and the centralization and withdrawal of power from the lower levels is not necessarily tantamount to anti-reform either. In fact, the withdrawal of powers in unrestrained and arbitrary fund-raising, the arbitrary establishment of projects, and arbitrary investments, which concentrates energy on several infrastructure facilities which have a significant bearing on the national economy and the people's livelihood, may even be more conducive to the establishment of a market economy structure. Of course, powers withdrawn from the lower levels should not be held in the hands of the relevant government departments as they were in the past under the planned economy. Rather, they should be concentrated in the hands of enterprise organizations which are responsible for activities, such as state investment and development banks, and so on. In short, it will not do to follow the beaten track of seeking interests through the decentralization of powers on the strength of the old structure to spur economic development. However, the complexity of the issue lies in the fact that, under the situation where the current market economy system on the mainland is unsolid and the institutions of the market economy are relatively weak, in order to achieve comparatively rapid economic growth, the administrative decentralization of power is still regarded by most provinces, cities, and localities as the only effective measure to choose. Therefore, since the second half of last year, Zhu Rongji has adopted a series of policies to rectify the monetary order and intensify macroeconomic regulation and control. As he has totally blocked financial resources obtained by localities before, he was universally criticized and resented. Moreover, the new taxation system proposed in the "Decisions" has also considerably reduced the local revenues of many localities. This evoked the dissatisfaction of local governments even more intensely so that Zhu Rongji was condemned for "taking the old path of the planned economy" and "retrogressing in reform." At present, government departments in various localities are still the principal planners and organizers of local economic activities, and are still handicapped by the "decentralization of powers is equal to reform" model. They do not understand very well the complete series of new measures for the establishment of a market economic structure put forward in the "Decisions," and, therefore, are not very enthusiastic about the above policies. At present, when the CPC hierarchy is reiterating such measures as "continuing to rectify the monetary order and reinforcing management of investment in fixed assets by mandatory planning," they inevitably sharpen conflicts between the central and local authorities, and Zhu Rongji is precisely braving the wind and waves in these conflicts. If conflict continues to grow, economic and political turbulence on the mainland is unavoidable, and the person running the greatest risk is none other than Zhu Rongji. CPC Bedeviled by Large Numbers of Unemployed Personnel in State-Owned Enterprises Increased inflationary pressure is regarded by the CPC hierarchy as the most important factor affecting stability, and several dozen million staff and workers in the vast number of state-owned enterprises on the mainland are the people who are most seriously victimized by inflation. Because two-thirds of state-owned enterprises have had production suspended or semi-suspended due to known or hidden losses, the vast number of staff and workers are in low spirits and resentful as they have lost wage income and have found no way of becoming rich, thus becoming the most unstable social force in mainland society at present. Since the CPC's rectification of the monetary order and the intensification of macroeconomic regulation and control last year, loss-making enterprises and the vast number of workers in them were the first to be adversely affected. The shortage of circulating funds has caused more than half of the mainland's large and medium state enterprises to land in the predicament of being tied up by enormous "debt chains" amounting to 370 billion yuan, and several dozen million enterprise staff and workers are receiving less than a half of their original wages to live on. With the price surges facing the mainland at present, staff and workers in these enterprises are almost unable to support their families. The CPC hierarchy is worried about inflation, but in fact it is worried that workers from these loss-making enterprise workers in the cities may take to the streets to create trouble. If workers adopt an antagonistic attitude toward the government, this will become one of the most acute contradictions on the mainland now. Corruption Deepens Misunderstanding Between Officials, Civilians Naturally, economic problems should be resolved through economic measures. However, under the present circumstances where there are still no effective policies to resolve economic contradictions rapidly, the use of political means is indispensable. However, it is precisely in this aspect that many measures adopted by the CPC hierarchy have been barely satisfactory. Since the second half of last year, various fields of endeavor, including the anticorruption campaign, controls on the press, emphasis on building spiritual civilization, the crack down on criminal activities in society, and so on have all been political measures taken by the CPC to coordinate with stabilizing the economy and eliminating unstable social factors. Judging from their current actual effects, however, these political measures have not had marked results. This is manifested by the lack of good relations of mutual trust, understanding, and support between the government and the people like in the past. For this reason, the government is bent on preventing the people from "creating trouble," and the people regard government cadres as "corrupt officials" who are "degenerate and incompetent," "imperious and despotic," and "scrambling for power and profit." There are a lot of barriers between officials and civilians but very few channels for straightening out misunderstandings between them, with grievances constantly accumulating and their removal becoming increasingly difeels deeply that it has limited advantageous resources to tap and exploit while using political means to alleviate contradictions in economic development. One of the barriers between mainland officials and civilians is the corruption among quite a number of officials. Although the CPC hierarchy has conducted an anticorruption campaign on a grand scale since the second half of last year, and has really exposed and handled a number of cases involving government officials who took bribes and perverted the law, it has failed to win more faith and understanding from the masses. This is due to a lack of transparency in the course of handling cases. As the results are not publicized (in most cases), and adjudication according to the law is not strictly conducted, the way cases are handled has been castigated by the public. People ask: "How many cases involving corrupt acts by officials have there been after all? How senior are the officials involved in corrupt deals? How many option struggle should be waged, but a certain yardstick should be applied to avoid causing harmful social effects which indicate `the overall decay of the Communist Party and its cadres.'" These stipulations did not come up to the masses' expectations of the anticorruption struggle, so they have not won more understanding, trust, and support from the masses. This being the case, the reform propositions and programs introduced by the CPC and its appeal to the masses to maintain social stability do not have adequate basic social conditions, and its call on the masses to participate in the building of spiritual civilization has become a mere formality of making empty talk. Officials, Civilians Have No Channels for Mutual Understanding, Exchanging Views Another barrier between officials and civilians is the lack of channels for mutual understanding and the exchange of views. The mainland's press and propaganda media are under direct official control so they can only "give lectures," "instill the party's views," and "provide guidance" to the masses; more often than not, the "reflection of the people's voices" is restricted to giving support and endorsement to the policy decisions of the ruling party and government, while the substantial volume of divergent voices and views from the masses representing different interest groups are rejected. Officials and civilians cannot exchange views and reach consensus through the public opinion media, hence the masses can only build up an opinion atmosphere centering around matters with which they are concerned in a covert sphere, which runs counter to the opinions of the ruling party and government. Then, the authorities only conduct "self-propaganda and self-performance" without any audience or spectators in a public arena for public opinion. In this way, they have lost an effective means to eliminate unstable social factors in a timely manner. As viewed from the mainland's political structure, the organizations of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] and so-called "multi-party cooperation" are at most a number of "CPPCC branches" of the ruling party. They have no unique political program, sound organizational system, and political function of running for elections, voting, and directly engaging in administrative affairs. The composition of aging personalities has long lost its ability to "participate in the deliberation and administration of state affairs," and the social strata they previously represented have been unable to conduct an effective flow of political views with the ruling party through them. As for the people's congress being the "fundamental political system" directly controlled and "led" by the ruling party, the election of deputies is subject to strict official selection. Hence, deputies do not represent the electorate, and the level of their participation in the deliberation and administration of state affairs is low. At ordinary times, they can "keep in step with the central authorities," but when a major political event takes place, they can simply do nothing. Around the time of the 4 June incident in Beijing in 1989, the insignificance and impotence of the people's congress system fully proved that it could not be a political organization capable of ensuring social stability on the mainland, and that the people's will cannot really form harmonious unity with that of the ruling party through this organization. Politburo Standing Committee Broke Rule To Fete Party Organ Officials To sum up, the only measure the CPC hierarchy can choose to surmount the predicament of social instability encountered by the mainland's economy and development at present is to mobilize all traditional means to strive to "provide against possible trouble." A source on familiar terms with the CPC hierarchy disclosed a few days ago that the phrase, "birds startled by the mere twang of a bow-string," is the most accurate expression used to describe the general mood of the mainland people and senior personalities in the CPC. In the case of the people, the "frightened birds" are worried about inflation and price surges this year, and the "frightened birds" among senior CPC personalities fear that the masses will stir up large-scale turmoil and social unrest. Against this background, the CPC hierarchy recently decided to continue practicing the policy of "rectifying the monetary order and stabilizing the economy" introduced in the second half of last year, appropriately slow down the pace of large-scale economic structural reform, curb ever-expanding investment in fixed assets, conduct some basic work and break through monetary structural reform first, and, at the same time, allocate large amounts of funds to properly arrange the lives of staff and workers in urban loss-making state enterprises so that they can have a happy Spring Festival. At the national propaganda and ideological work meeting held in the second half of January, the CPC hierarchy promulgated various policies to control media opinion, intensify the management of the cultural market, and called for press circle to "closely center around the themes and avoid making noises, engaging in controversies, or committing mistakes to do a good job of maintaining social stability." Before the above meeting began, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specially summoned the leading cadres from RENMIN RIBAO for a talk, and broke the rules by laying on a banquet for them. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin greeted them by cupping one hand in the other and saying: "Would you be kind enough to do propaganda work well this year? When public opinion work is properly performed, we can set our minds at ease in resolving reform and development issues. This is what the central authorities are most concerned about and have heeded seriously." This remark is regarded as "words uttered at a moment of desperation." According to the latest analysis by a mainland economist, the CPC hierarchy is now caught in a dilemma: The economy must be stabilized at the expense of the growth rate, which will evoke universal dissatisfaction from local government officials and which will affect the CPC's authority. However, the encouragement of growth and the relaxation of macroeconomic regulation and control will trigger off higher inflation, thereby infringing upon the people's immediate interests and engendering social unrest. To tackle this dilemma, the CPC hierarchy lacks advantageous political capital to handle various contradictions, so it can only intensify the functions of the traditional political structure. As a result, the contradiction where political structural reform lags behind economic structural reform will become ever more conspicuous. In this regard, people should not be blindly optimistic about the situation on the mainland this year.
