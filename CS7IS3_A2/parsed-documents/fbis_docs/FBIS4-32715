At a press conference held at Ferihegy Airport, Goncz said he informed his American negotiating partners, including President Clinton, on the results of Hungary's general elections. "I assured the American politicians of the constancy of priorities in Hungarian foreign policy, and encouraged them to increase their investments in Hungary," Goncz said. At U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with the Hungarian and Slovak presidents, Goncz assured him that democratic trends are certain to continue in Hungary, and the two main priorities of the country's foreign policy will remain the same in the future: maintenance of peace and advancing reform processes in the region. Hungary intends to improve its relations with neighboring countries, Goncz told Clinton, who -- in Goncz's words -- "gave his blessing" to this. At the Office of Overseas Private Investments, established to promote U.S. investments abroad, Goncz suggested that the officials send a delegation to Hungary to survey investment options, particularly in the energy, environmental, infrastructure, food, and information technology sectors. Goncz was very optimistic about his talks with Michal Kovac. He voiced his hope that Hungary may be able to sign a basic treaty with Slovakia before the next Slovak general elections. Once the basic treaty has been signed, links between the two states can take a pronounced turn towards a tight and friendly relationship, the Hungarian president said. Goncz also told the press that he accepted Kovac's invitation to the anniversary celebrations of the Slovak Banska Bysrtica uprising, and the Slovak president might visit Hungary during the summer.
