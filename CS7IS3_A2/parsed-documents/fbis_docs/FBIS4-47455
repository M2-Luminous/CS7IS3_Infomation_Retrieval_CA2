Continuing their search among tetrazole derivatives for new radiation protectors the authors obtained 27 different (2)-aminoalkyl-5-substituted- aryltetrazoles identified as I-XXVII. Their properties are presented. Also presented are toxic and radiation protection properties for N[.sub]2[/] isomers and their salts. Nine derivatives exhibited a 40-80% radiation effect under an LD[.sub]05-99/30[/] exposure. A relationship between their structure and action was observed. The most detailed study of radiation protection properties was conducted for compound XIV. It maintains its protection properties for 3 hours after exposure. Chemical and biological experiments were performed. The obtained data indicate that tetrazole class is promising in a search for radiation protectors. Tables 4, references 9.
