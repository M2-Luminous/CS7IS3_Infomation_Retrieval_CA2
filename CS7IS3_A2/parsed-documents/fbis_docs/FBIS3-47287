"All the journalists and editors in the Northern half of Korea will wield the pen more vigorously to implement the policy," he stressed. Saying that the women should do their share in achieving the unity of the nation under the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, Secretary Kang Kwan-son ardently appealed to the Korean women in the North, South and overseas to turn out as one in the nationwide struggle for national reunification.
