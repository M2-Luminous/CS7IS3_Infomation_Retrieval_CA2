[Martic] So far I would say that everything is going according to the agreement. Separation has to a large extent been completed. The UN forces are entering the area between the two forces, this area of 2 km on each side. As envisaged by the agreement, they have the right to carry out inspections up to 20 km inside the territory, where the heavy weapons are stored. As I said, everything is going according to the plan. There have been no major disagreements. There are some small, minor details that need to be solved and they are being solved in Western Slavonia, where UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] duties are obviously not properly understood, but we are working on it. There will be no problems with that. [Vojvodic] How are the army and the people of Krajina, whose supreme commander you are, accepting this agreement, and what is their primary objective at present? [Martic] They are accepting it very well. There have been no problems or provocations from the Croatian side in the past few days, which is understood to mean that they will, after all, adhere to the agreement. However, the army has its objectives and cannot fall asleep. We must think in terms of the possibility of being attacked tomorrow and we must prepare ourselves for a normal existence. [Vojvodic] In any case, we have observed over the past few days, and we know that you personally, and the people of this region, are in favor of peace, but not at any cost. Could you tell us when the new Krajina government will finally be formed and what its first task will be? [Martic] The new Krajina government will be formed on 20 April. This government should be a government of national unity, a government of experts. As we have said, we plan to appoint people who can indeed deal with every task, people who can implement in the best possible way what we have emphasized in the program. In other words, they will be able to start the production process. Actually, they should address the six points emphasized in our program. The first, of course, is defense. This had to be placed in first place, then the legal system, the revitalization of the economy and environment, the social program, more aggressive diplomatic activities, especially that in which we are most interested, the unification of Serbian lands. The biggest problem facing the government is the regulation of the legal system and revitalizing production. [Vojvodic] There are rumors in [word indistinct] and Krajina that some agreements on this program have been reached with members of almost all parties. [Martic] [Words indistinct] we have held talks with the majority of people who make decisions in the different parties and found a common language. What I am pleased about is that we are overcoming the small crisis that existed. I think that this will be thrill the entire nation.
