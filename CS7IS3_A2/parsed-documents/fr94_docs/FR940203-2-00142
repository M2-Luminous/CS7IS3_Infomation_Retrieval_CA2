FR940203-2-00142 FR940203-2-00068 This criterion also encourages States to describe State and local performance standards that lead to statewide systemic reform of secondary education. The ``Local Programs'' criterion is intended to elicit a detailed description of the School-to-Work Opportunities system to be implemented at the local level. The Secretaries expect that, combined, these criteria will result in applicants submitting descriptions of State plans that provide for fundamental statewide restructuring of existing education and training programs. Changes: None. Comment: One commenter who believed that community-based organizations and the human services sectors are currently under-utilized, suggested that a question be added under the selection criterion ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' to read: ``Does the plan describe methods to ensure high school completion by participants such as graduation assistance programs targeting low-achieving and at-risk youth or offering human services in coordination with education and job training?'' One commenter was concerned that occupational and career information and career guidance and counseling be provided and suggested adding a question to read: ``Has the State incorporated into the Statewide plan provisions for the presentation of occupational and career information and career development assistance to all students in all parts of the State?'' Discussion: The Secretaries agree with the commenter that in response to this notice applicants should describe the methods that they have selected to ensure high school completion. The criterion ``Student Participation'', therefore, focuses on providing ``all students'', including low-achieving students, the opportunity to participate in School-to-Work Opportunities programs. The ``Local Programs'' criterion emphasizes that plans must include programs that result in the award of high school diplomas, as is otherwise required in the notice. With respect to the commenter's suggestion that statewide plans provide for the presentation of occupational and career information and career development assistance, one of the ``General Program Requirements'' already contained in the priority, is that the school-based learning component of any School-to-Work program include career exploration and counseling. Changes: None. Selection Criteria_Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners Comment: One commenter suggested adding State officials responsible for special education, vocational rehabilitation, and other transition services, to the list of State level officials with whom applicants are encouraged to collaborate in implementing statewide School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Other commenters suggested adding a variety of entities to the list of key parties to be involved in the implementation of States' School-to-Work Opportunities systems. Specifically, commenters suggested adding vocational and comprehensive high schools, local vocational education agencies, private industry councils established under the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA), related services personnel, State Occupational Information Coordinating Committees and other occupational information providers, human services agencies, JTPA operators and educational programs serving farmworkers. One commenter was of the opinion that the involvement of other parties cannot serve as a substitute for the involvement of students, parents, teachers, and area residents in State and local decision-making. The commenter also felt that the statewide system should include as many as possible of the interested parties listed under the criterion ``Involvement by Key Parties.'' Discussion: The lists of entities under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of the selection criterion ``Collaboration and Involvement of Key Partners'' are not intended to be exhaustive, but, rather, are intended to provide examples of entities that should be involved in developing and implementing a successful School-to-Work Opportunities system. It is likely that the other entities suggested by the commenters also would contribute to the success of State and local School-to-Work Opportunities activities and it would be appropriate for State and local agencies to seek their involvement. In accordance with these criteria, as well as with paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of the priority, the Secretaries strongly encourage the involvement of all groups and entities that can perform useful and productive functions in the implementation of State School-to-Work Opportunities programs. Changes: None.
