He said, "There were certain misunderstandings between us, but we have deepened our understanding (through the talks)." He stressed that the talks resolved misunderstandings and were beneficial. With regard to the Japanese and U.S. positions on "objective criteria," which constituted the greatest point of disagreement at the Japanese-U.S. economic framework talks, Hata said, "We have come to understand fully what the other side thinks." He further stated that he has come to understand that the United States is not obsessed with the so-called "numerical targets" -- such as market shares.
