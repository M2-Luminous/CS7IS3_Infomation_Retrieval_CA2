Narayan Swamy] [Text] New Delhi, June 27 (AFP) -- Defence cooperation will be high on the agenda when Indian Premier P.V. Narasimha Rao travels to Russia on Wednesday [29 June] on a trip aimed at reviving the formerly close relations between New Delhi and Moscow. Indian officials and diplomats said much of the focus of Rao's discussions with Russian leaders, including a one-to-one with President Boris Yeltsin, will be on matters relating to armaments. The 74-year-old Rao, who holds the defence portfolio, is being accompanied by a high-powered delegation that includes Defence Secretary K.A. Nambiar. "India has been quite dependent on Russia for defence materiel. It will be an occasion to discuss spare parts that India needs urgently," said Minister of State for External Affairs R.L. Bhatia, who will accompany Rao. "This visit is aimed at strengthening relations with Russia," Bhatia told AFP. "India had very good relations with the former Soviet Union. But in between Russia became interested in the West. "Now there is a feeling among Russians that they should also look to the East. As such, Rao and Yeltsin will have an opportunity to discuss bilateral and international issues." Yeltsin received a warm welcome during a January 1993 visit to India. But the bonhomie that was building up was dealt a setback when Moscow, under US pressure, reneged on its promise to supply cryogenic rocket engines to India. Although the Russians eventually agreed to provide the engines but not the technology, the issue left a bitter taste among Indians long used to Soviet generosity. Bhatia said Rao, who went to the United States last month, will also discuss cryogenic technology with Yeltsin during his June 29 to July 2 trip. India was hit by an acute shortage of spare parts for its gigantic, mostly Soviet-equipped armed forces after the breakup of the communist superpower. Although shipments have resumed, the Indians want delivery speeded up. They are also eyeing a variety of Soviet weapons systems that they feel are cheaper than those in the West. These include self-propelled guns, air defence systems, the deep strike SU-30 aircraft, and a Soviet aircraft carrier. Moscow is also ready to fit state-of-the-art avionics and missiles on India's MiG-21s. "The visit will give the necessary impetus to political, trade, economic, scientific, military and technical cooperation between the two countries," said a Russian diplomat here. "We hope the visit will prove that Russia conducts a balanced foreign policy paying equal attention to the West and the East." Rao, who will stay in the Kremlin, will preside over the signing of half-a-dozen documents on a variety of subjects including atomic energy, Indian officials said. "Rao's trip is very significant," said Devendra Kaushik, an Indian expert on Russia who was in Moscow last month. "In defence, we are crucial for each other. Our vested interests lie in their strength and vice versa. Collaboration in defence will be a serious input in restoring this strategic interest," he said. India was the Soviet Union's closest non-communist ally, a relationship which clouded New Delhi's ties with the United States until the end of the Cold War but helped it cushion perceived Western pressures. Russia wants India, which exploded a nuclear device in 1974, to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). But Bhatia said Yeltsin will be told firmly that the NPT discriminates between nuclear haves and have-nots. Bilateral trade, which once stood at seven billion dollars, has plummeted to less than one billion dollars. Russia now insists on hard currency unlike in the past when the rupee was welcome. A Russian proposal to auction part of India's debt to the former Soviet Union and offer it at a discount to private trading institutions has led to irritants ahead of Rao's departure. Kaushik said not everyone around Yeltsin was euphoric about India. "So it is time we concentrated on building a (pro-India) lobby there," he said, "both in the government and in opposition. "It is time we take initiatives to build bridges with the emerging political forces in Russia. [no ending quote as received]
