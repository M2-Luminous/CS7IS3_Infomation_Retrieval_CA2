FR940725-1-00058 FR940725-1-00010 Section 23.75␣Landing Distance This proposal would revise the heading, reorganize §23.75 for harmonization with the JAR, add the landing reference speed, V REF , and move the portion on brake pressures to §23.735, Brakes. The introductory paragraph of this section would be revised to delete the reference to the AFM because part 23, subpart B, is generally used to specify what must be determined during flight test and part 23, subpart G, is generally used to specify what must be placed in the AFM. The introductory paragraph would also be revised to require landing distances to be determined at standard temperature for each weight and altitude. Service experience has shown that landing distances are not sensitive to temperatures. The use of standard temperature is consistent with WAT requirements and the increased level of safety introduced in this NPRM. The revised introductory paragraph deletes the reference to ``approximately 3 knots'' for seaplanes and amphibians because this information will be moved to advisory material on acceptable methods of compliance. Revised §23.75(a) adds V REF and requires its use. (See proposal for §23.73.) The text of the current §23.75(b) is deleted because proposed §23.45 would specify these general requirements. Proposed new §23.75(b) clarifies that a constant configuration must be maintained throughout the maneuver. Revised §23.75(d) would continue the current requirement for showing that a safe transition to the balked landing conditions can be made and specify the weight that must be considered for the transition to the balked landing conditions. This proposed new requirement reflects current industry practice. Proposed new §23.75(e) is a general requirement to ensure the reliability of the brakes and tires. Proposed §23.75(f) is revised by changing the first use of the word ``means'' to ``retardation means,'' and by deleting paragraph (f)(3). Paragraph (f)(3) requires that no more than average skill shall be required to control the airplane. This topic is covered in proposed §23.45(f). Section §23.75(h) is deleted because the introductory paragraph of proposed §23.75 would contain commuter category requirements and proposed §23.1587 would require landing distance correction factors. Section 23.77␣Balked Landing This section would be revised to include additional WAT requirements and to make editorial changes. Proposed revisions to §23.77 (a) and (b) would differentiate between WAT and non-WAT; and, in paragraph (b), would include the more stringent WAT limited airplane requirements. (See proposal for §23.45.) Section 23.77(a)(4) adds a new climb speed requirement to ensure that acceleration is not required during the transition from landing to balked landing. The climb gradient of §23.77(b) was selected to be slightly less than the non-WAT airplane sea level requirement as a tradeoff for a balked landing climb capability at all altitudes and temperatures. The commuter category climb gradient of 3.3 percent specified in §23.77(c) changes to 3.2 percent for consistency with part 25. Additional editorial changes and deletions are proposed for §23.77(c) because the general requirements would be covered in the proposed §23.45. Section 23.143␣General Proposed §23.143(a) would be revised to add the phrase ``during all flight phases'' to the lead-in of the paragraph. ``Go-around'' would be added to the list of flight phases. The JAA/FAA decided, during FAR/JAR Harmonization meetings, that the term ``go-around'' included the all engine balked landings of §23.77, various all engine and one-engine-inoperative aborted landings specified in the AFM, and the commuter category discontinued approach of §23.67(c)(4). In this NPRM, balked landing refers only to the all engine balked landing of §23.77. The table in paragraph (c) would be changed to show a change in two-hand roll force from 60 to 50 pounds, which is consistent with JAR 25. The table also would be changed to show a one-hand on the rim roll force of 25 pounds. This is a JAA/FAA harmonized value. Section 23.145␣Longitudinal Control Proposed §23.145 would be revised by changing the speed ranges applicable to the takeoff, enroute, and landing configurations. In proposing paragraph (b)(2) the requirement for ``altering and maintaining, as a minimum, the speed used to show compliance with §23.77'' would be changed ``to allow the airspeed to transition from 1.3 V S0 to 1.3 V S1 .'' In proposed paragraph (b)(5) for landing configuration, the speed reference would be changed from 1.4 V S0 to V REF .
