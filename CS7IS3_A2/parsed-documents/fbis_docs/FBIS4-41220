According to information at the disposal of the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], various international criminal organizations are using our country's territory to get their people into other states. This was reported yesterday at a news conference in the Russian Federation MVD. Militia Lieutenant General Vladimir Kolesnikov, Russia's chief detective, said that Moscow is becoming a main center where such "refugees" gather from all over the world. Illegal immigrants come to us mainly from Vietnam, Taiwan, and China. Moreover they do not turn to the Russian authorities for assistance but register directly with the UN mission in Moscow -- after which it is very difficult to expel them from Russia. For information: Whereas 530 crimes committed by foreign citizens were recorded in 1992, more than 15,000 were recorded in 1993.
