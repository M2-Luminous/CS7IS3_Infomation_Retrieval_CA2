Again, many CPPCC members were dissatisfied with the contents of the report on work done by the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee and leveled many criticisms at it. The economic group is a new group set up by the Eighth National CPPCC Congress and also a dynamic group. The economic group held two wonderful discussions at the Beijing Jingfeng Guest House yesterday. When commenting on the role of CPPCC members, Xu Qingxiong, board-of-directors chairman of the Shanghai Wanguo Stock Company, said: "CPPCC members should not be content with discussing state affairs. However, they are not entitled to participate in shaping policy decisions and can only express their views when the policies have been published." He added: "For example, in foreign countries tax reform is decided on after lengthy debate. But in China, CPPCC members had no idea about it until the tax reform program was published." Zhao Weichen, convener of the economic group, responded: "Opinions of CPPCC members should be solicited before any decisions are made." CPPCC members can presently participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs but enjoy no right to vote in formulating policies and bills. In his speech, Wei Yuming, CPPCC member and former deputy minister of foreign economic relations and trade, pressed for the right to vote for CPPCC members. He said that the government work report as well as important policy decisions should be presented to the CPPCC for discussions before rather than after they are published. Wei said that CPPCC members are not representatives because "they are appointed by the authorities." He believed that CPPCC members' right to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs should be given legal status. He further pointed out: "Abroad, CPPCC delegation usually call on the upper house or the senate. But the upper house has the right to vote while the CPPCC has not. I explained the CPPCC's role whenever upper house members asked me about it, but they did not understand what I said despite my earnest efforts. To participate in the administration of state affairs, the CPPCC must enjoy the right to vote. The CPPCC should have the same power and functions as those enjoyed by upper houses in foreign countries under the new historical situation." In his report on the work done by the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee, the vice chairman of the committee Ye Xuanping said that CPPCC members "should fulfill their duties without overstepping their authority." This statement evoked dissatisfaction from many CPPCC members. Tian Yinong, CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee member and former deputy finance minister, said he does not understand what is meant by overstepping authority. Another CPPCC member Lu Zhongmin, board-of-directors chairman of the First Luoyang Tractor Plant, said: "There would be no problem of `overstepping the authority' if the rules and regulations were strictly observed. Such problems, if any, should not have been raised in the report on work done by the CPPCC National Committee Standing Committee."
