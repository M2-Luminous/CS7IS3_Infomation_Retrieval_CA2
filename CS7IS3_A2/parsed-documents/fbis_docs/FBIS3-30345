Gen. Mercier told the press that, thanks to financial support of Islamic countries, Bosnian Muslims continue to arm themselves because arms and ammuntion, even a certain number of rockets, can reach them across borders of the former Yugoslavia despite the U.N. embargo on arms deliveries to the former Yugoslavia. This is the first time in France that a high military official openly spoke about the amply arming of the Bosnian Muslims and the aid they were receiving from Islamic countries. French military sources assessed that Muslim forces loyal to Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic numbered around 85,000 troops, possessed between 20 to 30 tanks, around 350 cannons and a score of helicopters and airplanes. Gen. Mercier confirmed reports that "several units" of the Croatian Army were in Bosnia-Herzegovina helping Bosnian Croats in the fighting against Muslims in central Bosnia-Herzegovina. French sources claim that the forthcoming meeting of the European Union foreign ministers, to be held in Brussels on February 7, will discuss the possible imposing of economic sanctions against Croatia due to its direct military involvement in the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
