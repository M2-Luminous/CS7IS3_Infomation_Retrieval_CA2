Its press service said in a statement on Tuesday that only 10 lawmakers of the upper chamber were categorically against the document, while 82 were in favour of it. "The overwhelming majority voted to create... a conciliatory commission jointly with Duma members and edit certain articles of the document", the statement said. "Such a principled position of the Federation Council is more important for the state than an automatic adoption of all lawbills submitted to the upper chamber without their thorough study", the document reads.
