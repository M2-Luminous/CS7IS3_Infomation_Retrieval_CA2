FR940516-1-00051 FR940516-1-00003 1. Revise §250.1, Documents incorporated by reference, to incorporate API's Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for Electrical Installation at Petroleum Facilities, First Edition, June 1, 1991 (API RP 500), into the regulations. This document replaces API RP 500B, Recommended Practice for Classification of Areas for Electrical Installations at Drilling Rigs and Production Facilities on Land and on Marine Fixed and Mobile Platforms, Second Edition, with Supplement. API RP 500 combined API RP 500A, 500B, and 500C into a single document to provide guidelines for classifying locations at petroleum facilities for the selection and installation of electrical equipment. API RP 500 contains essentially the same information contained in API RP 500B. API RP 500 is referenced in §250.51(i) to classify fuel and other flammable liquid storage locations. Also, references to API RP 500 replace API RP 500B in §§250.53(b), 250.122(e)(4)(i), 250.123(b)(9)(i), 250.291(b)(3) and (d)(4)(i), and 250.292(b)(4)(i). 2. Add a new §250.27, Safety of operations communication, that requires operators of offshore production platforms to notify incoming or new personnel arriving on the platform of the status of repairs of process equipment, safety systems, or other systems that are out of service. The new regulation also requires operators to maintain records of all communications. 3. Revise §250.51, General requirements, to include requirements for fuel storage on offshore facilities. 4. Revise §250.123, Additional production system requirements, to be more specific on identifying and deactivating process equipment and controls when safety systems are out of service and maintaining records. 5. Add a new paragraph, §250.153(a)(5), that requires operators to protect horizontal sections of pipeline risers from damage by falling objects. 6. Revise §250.154 to require pipeline shutdown valves to be located below the lowest production deck on all new pipelines entering and departing OCS platforms. This rule also applies to all pipelines under the jurisdiction of MMS, including production flow lines, gathering lines, sulphur pipelines, fuel lines, bidirectional lines, and crossing pipelines. For existing platforms and pipelines, the rule requires installation or relocation of valves when significant riser repairs or maintenance is performed. 7. Revise §250.158 to give the Regional Supervisor authority to require operators to submit written pipeline repair procedures for approval. The preparation and approval of written plans ensure that an operator adequately considers the repair activity. Author The principal authors of this proposed rule are Elmer P. Danenberger, Chief, Engineering and Technology Division, and Paul Schneider, Technology Assessment and Research Branch. Regulatory Flexibility Act The DOI has also determined that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities because, in general, the entities that engage in activities offshore are not considered small due to the technical complexities and level of financial resources necessary to safely conduct such activities. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule adds new information collection requirements to subparts A and J. The information collection requirements contained in this rule have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval as required by the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.). The collection of this information will not be required until it has been approved by OMB. Public reporting burdens for the new information collection requirements contained in subparts A and J are estimated to average 8 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspects of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer; Minerals Management Service; Mail Stop 2053, 381 Elden Street; Herndon, Virginia 22070&hyph;4817, and the Office of Management and Budget; Paperwork Reduction Project (1010&hyph;0030) for subpart A and (1010&hyph;0050) for subpart J; Washington, DC 20503, telephone (202) 395&hyph;7340. Takings Implication Assessment The DOI certifies that the proposed rule does not represent a governmental action capable of interference with constitutionally protected property rights. Thus, a Takings Implication Assessment need not be prepared pursuant to E.O. 12630, Government Action and Interference with Constitutionally Protection Property Rights.
