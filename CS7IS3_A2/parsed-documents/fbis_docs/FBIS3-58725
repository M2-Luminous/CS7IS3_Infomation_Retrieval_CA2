He replied that the administration had been undecided between a Russian-centred and a German-centred approach. Should Washington be more concerned about a revival of Russian nationalism or about binding Germany and Central Europe into West Europe? For the moment, Western fears about Russia have predominated. The American-inspired Partnership for Peace, to be adopted by NATO leaders at their summit in Brussels, fudges the question of enlarging NATO to include Central European countries previously in the Warsaw Pact. The American priority is not to do anything which might undermine Boris Yeltsin, or which he says might undermine him. But the West could put at risk the gains from its victory in the Cold War. The liberation of the former Soviet satellites is the one big foreign policy success of the past decade. But NATO is now implicitly accepting that Moscow can retain a veto over the security arrangements not just of former Soviet republics but also of indisputably European states such as Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia (generally known as the Visegrad Four). President Clinton naturally denies any such intention. The President's speech in Brussels last night was full of reassurances that Europe, and its security, remains central to America's interests. But this is largely public relations blather to ensure that Mr Clinton's first visit to Europe as President is seen as a success. The leaders of the Visegrad countries have acquiesced in Partnership for Peace, but they have barely disguised their frustration. The current Western caution is in marked contrast with the formation of NATO in 1948-49. The founders of the Atlantic alliance were acutely aware of the Soviet threat to West Europe and bold in resisting it. The spread of communism was contained and peace assured. Similarly, after the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989, the Bush administration showed greater negotiating skill than has generally been recognised. It sponsored the talks on the future of Germany which secured the support of the then Soviet Union for unification. America was also firm in resisting initial Soviet opposition to a united Germany being in NATO. In both cases, there was a balance between recognising Moscow's power and advancing the interests of Americas allies. That balance is now absent. The Russia lobby is in the ascendant, particularly in the form of Strobe Talbott, Deputy Secretary of State designate and a close friend of Mr Clinton. As Robert Zoellick, architect of the Bush team's European initiatives, has argued, "there has been no strong counterbalancing force making the case for a European policy separate from Washington's Russian calculations." Warren Christopher and Tony Lake, the White House national security adviser, initially favoured expanding NATO's membership. But in talks last October, just after the suppression of the Russian parliamentary opposition, Mr Talbott successfully argued against enlargement. This, he feared, would draw a line across Europe and might strengthen nationalist forces and critics of reform within Russia. Apart from Germany, other NATO members were cautious. Douglas Hurd expressed British worries to Mr Christopher in late September. The broad policy was therefore set before the Russian elections a month ago though Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's success has intensified the West's predicament. But the American approach risks a repetition of its familiar error of concentrating too much on an individual leader, whether Mikhail Gorbachev or, now, Mr Yeltsin. No one, however, is urging immediate expansion. NATO only works as an integrated military alliance and the armed forces of former Warsaw Pact countries are in no position to join yet. There has to be a transitional period of growing co-operation, not least while these forces show they are under proper democratic control. Britain is also wary of extending security guarantees unless NATO is willing to implement them. The flaw in Partnership for Peace is that it risks creating a vacuum by failing to lay down a timetable and guidelines for membership. It offers co-operation in planning, training and exercises to almost anyone interested, including both Russia and Ukraine, but it makes no commitments about who might be allowed to join NATO and when. In Mr Christopher's slippery phrase, candidates for membership are being given "an opportunity to self- differentiate." But the invitation is so broad as to be largely meaningless, like the all-embracing and, in practice, ineffective Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. NATO will never be an open-ended club. The main new entrants for the foreseeable future are likely to be the Visegrad Four countries. Offering them explicit hope of membership, in parallel with their closer links with the European Union, would not only allay some of their security fears but should also strengthen the hand of internal pressures in favour of democracy and reform. That could be linked to a formal agreement to reassure Russia that it is not being isolated by a hostile West. The danger at present is that insecurity and instability will be increased, not reduced. The proposed policy may not only make no difference to events within Russia--no Western initiatives really ever have--but it could also, yet again, let down the West's friends in Central Europe. A stable Germany and Central Europe are an attainable goal for America and its NATO allies. A democratic and free-market Russia is a dream beyond our influence. In seeking the latter NATO could jeopardise the former.
