However, the paper adds, Serb reinforcements and reserves massed in the vicinity of Tuzla (for example around Bijeljina) and Srebrenica (where the so-called Drina Corps with six brigades is operating) are sufficient to continue to hinder the deblocking of both Srebrenica and Dubrava. NATO would then certainly have to repeat and expand the air strikes to the Bosnian Serbs' "remaining strategic centers." The action would have to be on at least the scale of the several consecutive, mass attacks on Iraq in the first half of last year, the paper notes, adding that the Serbs believe that they would be able to survive the "first, selective attack from the sky, and then, while they still have the upper hand on the land, they would begin conducting what they have been announcing for a long time: an all-out war against all UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina, combining the experience of the Vietnam guerrillas with the tactics that the Blue Helmets have already felt themselves in Somalia."
