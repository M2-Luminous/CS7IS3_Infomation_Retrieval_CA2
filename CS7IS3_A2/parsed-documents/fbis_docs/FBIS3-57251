Today, the main task for the Republic is actual security of economic and political independence of Latvia, said Ivars Kezbers, the fund's adviser on external relations. According to the conception, concrete events will be executed in order that juridical institutions daily and actually take care of security of Latvia's population and guarantee people human rights and freedoms. According to the conception, all structures fighting against crimes should be united in the institution of state police. In correspondence to the conception, only one department of counterintelligence and one department of intelligence service are necessary in Latvia. These two services should not be split into various other state institutions, as it is at present. In addition, one more special service is necessary in the Latvian Ministry of Defense. This service will deal with military counterintelligence.
