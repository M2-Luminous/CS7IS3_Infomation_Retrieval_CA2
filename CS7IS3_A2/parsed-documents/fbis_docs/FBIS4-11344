Nikolai Zaitzev, a Russian trade official in Mexico, has invited the Monterrey businessmen who attended the 33d Regular Assembly of the National Council of Foreign Trade of the Northeast to invest or trade with his country. The Russian diplomat said Mexico had exported to Russia during 1993 between $45 million to $50 million, an amount he considered as low. "Besides, the majority of these exports reached Russia via third nations, such as Belgium," he said. Among the Mexican exports to Russia are steel pipes and cigars, a product which the Monterrey company Cigarrera La Moderna exported last year for $5 million. "Mexico only exports between $5 million and $7 million, a figure which is very low," Zaitzev said. [passage omitted].
