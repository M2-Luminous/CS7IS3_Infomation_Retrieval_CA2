FR940525-2-00206 FR940525-2-00118 Priority Under 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3) the Secretary gives an absolute preference to applications that meet the following priority. The Secretary funds under this competition only applications that meet this absolute priority: Projects that_ (1) Design, develop, implement, test, evaluate, demonstrate, and disseminate a national training model for overcoming national skill shortages in the application of new technologies to the manufacturing process within the American machine tool industry; (2) Focus on critical technologies needed for sustained economic growth, industrial productivity, and high-wage jobs within the American machine tool industry, either by developing a new model, refining an existing model, or using any portion of a model or combination of more than one model; and (3) Address the problems of high unemployment and training needs among young adults and out-of-school youth, particularly minorities and women, in high-poverty, low-income major urban areas with major labor surpluses. Project Requirements Projects funded under this absolute priority must_ (a) Design, develop, implement, test, and evaluate a national training model that defines the training and educational components necessary to train and educate manufacturing technicians in critical technologies related to the American machine tool industry; (b) Demonstrate the effectiveness of the model developed by the project to a variety of businesses, industries, and educational providers through demonstration activities that take place either on the premises of a postsecondary training institution or on the premises of manufacturing companies that are training their workforces in advanced technologies. Demonstration activities may be provided either directly or via satellite or other electronic linkage; (c) Disseminate information nationally, and provide technical assistance to manufacturing companies and education and training institutions, about the model developed by the project and its application to the manufacturing process, as well as the teaching and learning methodologies and the curricular modules developed for training manufacturing technicians, in order to facilitate the application of new technologies to the manufacturing process; (d) Involve an education-business partnership consisting of (1) one or more postsecondary education or training institutions; and (2) one or more companies within the manufacturing industry. Consistent with their expertise, all partners must participate in the design, development, implementation, evaluation, demonstration, and dissemination of the training model for the education and training of manufacturing technicians; (e) In developing the training model_ (1) Identify and validate the occupational skill standards and related task lists needed for the manufacturing occupations that are included in the project, utilizing, to the extent practicable_ (i) Validated common standards that have been developed by trade and professional associations, such as the National Occupational Competency Testing Institute (NOCTI) and the Vocational-Technical Education Consortium of States (V-TECS), or other standards that are being utilized in current training programs; and (ii) The skill standards that are currently being developed by organizations under contract with the Departments of Education and Labor; and (2) Develop the curriculum, content, resources, and methodology necessary to conduct the educational program, including the following elements: (i) Occupational training in areas of national skill shortages in the American machine tool industry, including cross-training in integral manufacturing trades. (ii) Academic learning integrated with hands-on skill development. (iii) Curriculum and instructional processes that integrate practical experience and theoretical knowledge and that provide out-of-school youth and other young adults, particularly minorities and women, with the skills needed to make the transition from school to productive employment or to further technical training. (iv) Advanced manufacturing training and academic learning, within a production setting, needed to educate manufacturing technicians at advanced world-competitive levels and to provide them with a portable skill certificate requiring less than a baccalaureate degree. (v) Print and non-print materials (video mail, on-line education software and databases, computer-aided instruction, laser discs, etc.) that encompass best-of-class knowledge sources and delivery systems and enable manufacturers to make comparisons among alternative technologies and training practices.
