FR941021-2-00031 FR941021-2-00024 [Docket No. PL95&hyph;1&hyph;000] Ratemaking Treatment of Emission Allowances; Notice of Filing October 14, 1994. Take notice that on October 14, 1994, Edison Electric Institute (``EEI''), on behalf of its member electric utilities and pursuant to Section 207 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, petitioned the Commission to issue a Statement of Policy on the ratemaking treatment of the costs associated with sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) emission allowances required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. EEI's request is limited to coordination transactions. EEI also requests, among other things, that the Commission find that neither the sale nor purchase of emission allowances require authorization under section 203 of the Federal Power Act, and find that the sale of emission allowances does not constitute a wholesale power sale and therefore is not jurisdictional under section 205 of the Federal Power Act. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before November 14, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary.
