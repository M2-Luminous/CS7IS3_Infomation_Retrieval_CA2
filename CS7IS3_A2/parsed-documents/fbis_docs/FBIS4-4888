Recalling that Yi Ki-taek expressed more than once his wish to visit Pyongyang, the spokesman said: "Should he visit Pyongyang and discuss the outstanding issues of the nation including the problem of national reunification and jointly seek a solution, a new progress will, no doubt, be made in the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the development of the North-South relations. "The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, however, are blocking the Pyongyang trip of the opposition political figure, arguing that he `might fall a prey to the strategy of the North.' This is a very improper act." The spokesman expressed the belief that Yi Ki-taek would visit Pyongyang in a short time and do a good work for the nation.
