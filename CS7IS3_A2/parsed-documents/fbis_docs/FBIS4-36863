[Ghawshah] Preparations are continuing for the arrival of brother Abu-'Ammar and members of the Palestinian leadership and PNA in the homeland in the Jericho area and the Gaza Strip to assume their duties, embark on a new phase in the reconstruction process, and continue the negotiations for Israel's withdrawal from all the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967, including the city of Jerusalem. We hope that the Palestinian leaders will arrive in the homeland in the next few days. [Al-Jundi] Have enough security measures been taken to ensure Abu-'Ammar's arrival in the self-rule areas, especially following recent threats by Israeli elements? [Ghawshah] We believe that these statements aim to create confusion and to prevent implementation of the agreement. But we are confident that our people will foil all the settlers' attempts to disrupt the implementation of the agreement. The PLO, backed by our people, will undoubtedly put an end to all the plots and the plans to endanger the lives of our people and leaders. [Al-Jundi] The issue of Palestinian establishments in Jerusalem has recently been raised. Is there is an intention to let these establishments continue their work or will they be moved to the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho? [Ghawshah] The whole world, including the United Nations and international legitimacy, have issued several resolutions stressing that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian and Arab territories occupied during the June 1967 war. Therefore, we are holding on to all our national establishments in Jerusalem. On the other hand, we believe that the Declaration of Principles agreement has stipulated that no changes or alterations should be made on the status of Jerusalem and that this issue will be discussed when the negotiations over the final phase begin. [Al-Jundi] It was recently announced that secret talks were held between Palestinian and Israeli officials on the Jerusalem issue. How true are these reports? [Ghawshah] I have no information about any secret talks. Our stance on Jerusalem is firm and well-known, namely that it is part of the Palestinian territories occupied in 1967. [Al-Jundi] The development process in the Gaza Strip and Jericho undoubtedly requires a serious commitment from the donor countries. The Palestinian side expressed satisfaction with the recent meeting in Paris of the committee coordinating aid to the Palestinians. [Ghawshah] The aid and support we are talking about is partial because the reality facing us is this: Our homeland was occupied by Israel for 27 years during which the infrastructure was completely destroyed, its economy damaged, and its establishments hit. Therefore, we regard any aid to be partial. Of course, we are grateful to all those who have given aid, regardless of the amount. But this is just the beginning and it is part of much bigger needs. Our people's efforts and resources will provide the major share of what we need. We believe that the partial aid given so far is necessary for beginning our work. But we stress that these sums are not enough. Therefore, all Palestinian resources must be mobilized while welcoming every Arab and international effort and backing to continue the process of establishing our national authority toward the goal of creating our Palestinian independent state with Jerusalem as its capital. [Al-Jundi] Is there a specific strategy for Palestinian action in the coming stage on the comprehensive development process that the Palestinian self-rule area in Gaza and Jericho requires? [Ghawshah] The PNA members are preparing a draft plan on all the requirements of the development process to mobilize all resources and intensify all efforts to carry out a correct and sound building process and exploit every cent in the right way to alleviate our people's pain and build our homeland. [Al-Jundi] Dr. Samir Ghawshah, thank you from the Voice of the Arabs. [Ghawshah] You are welcome.
