The spokesman quoted Li Peng as saying that both the Chinese and U.S. sides elaborated their respective positions on the most-favored nation trade status, human rights and other issues during Christopher's four-day visit. The Chinese side held that the discussions were useful in helping to increase mutual understanding, Wu said. Thanking Li for the detailed and all-round briefing, Hosokawa held that it is somewhat unwise to impose the western concepts of democracy on other countries. Moreover, he said, he also fully understands Li's viewpoint and position on human rights, according to the spokesman. Hosokawa recalled that China had played an active role for the adoption of the Vienna Declaration on Human Rights during the World Conference on Human Rights last year. Japan deems that it is the duty of all countries to work for the materialization of the basic principles and guidelines of the declaration, Hosokawa said.
