FR940524-0-00037 FR940524-0-00009 Blue Bird stated its petition was precipitated by a letter that it received from NHTSA's Office of Vehicle Safety Compliance addressing an apparent non-compliance of school buses manufactured with stop signal arms equipped with strobe lamps. According to Blue Bird, the apparent non-compliance results from the fact that S6.2.2 sets forth restrictive design requirements based on the operating characteristics of incandescent lamps instead of more performance-oriented requirements based on visual effectiveness. The petitioner alleged that the requirement prevents the use of strobe lamps. Based on these allegations, Blue Bird stated that the apparent noncompliance results from a deficiency in the Standard and not a deficiency in its school buses. Blue Bird requested that the agency amend S6.2.2 to allow the use of strobe lamps, stating that this would be in the interests of safety and consistent with the Standard's intent. Blue Bird also stated that four states (Alaska, New Mexico, Washington, and West Virginia) as well as some local school districts require stop signal arms to be equipped with strobe lamps. This consideration prompted Blue Bird to request that this rulemaking take effect immediately, claiming that the production and delivery of school buses with strobe lamp equipped stop signal arms needs to continue without disruption. III. Agency's Decision NHTSA notes that, in establishing the flash rate requirements, it did not intend to prohibit stop signal arms from being equipped with strobe lamps. Instead, the flash rate requirements were intended to assure the conspicuity of stop signal arms. The absence of any intent to prohibit strobe lamps is evident from the preambles to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) and final rule. In the NPRM, the agency solicited comments about whether the Standard should require strobe lamps after discussing the potential benefits from them. (55 FR 3618, 3624, February 2, 1990) In the May 1991 final rule, the agency declined to mandate strobe lights on all new school buses, but suggested that they might be beneficial in areas prone to poor visibility. NHTSA further notes that the agency has attempted to make Standard No. 131 consistent with the SAE's Recommended Practice J1133, School Bus Stop Arms, within the parameters of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1381 et seq. ) As a result, in reviewing Blue Bird's petition, the agency has analyzed the changes made in the July 1989 revision to J1133, School Bus Stop Arms. The agency notes that the only significant change was one expressly made to accommodate strobe lamps and had the effect of allowing them to be installed on stop signal arms. NHTSA has determined that the current requirements, which are based upon incandescent or filament type lamps, cannot be met by strobe or gaseous discharge lamps. Filament type bulbs do not reach full brilliance until sufficient time has passed for the electrical current to heat up the filament wire in the light bulb. This is a function of the filament wire diameter and the supplied voltage which results in a time delay while the filament wire is being heated to produce light. As a result of the delay, an extended period of time must be specified before a filament light comes to complete brilliance. In contrast, strobe lamps are gaseous discharge type lamps that do not have a filament that emits light and thus do not require an extended time period to achieve complete brilliance. Gaseous discharge lamps emit light by charging a capacitor and discharging the capacitor through an ionized gas. As a result, the current ``on'' time duration is typically much shorter for a gaseous type lamp than a filament type lamp. Specifically, the relationship between the amount of time for a filament type bulb to come to full brilliance is a function of filament wire diameter, voltage, type of filament wire, and the gas surrounding the filament wire. Based on the above considerations, NHTSA has decided to issue this interim final rule changing the flash rate requirements for stop signal arms to remove design restrictive language that acts to prohibit strobe lamps. Specifically, the agency is amending S6.2.2 to modify the requirements addressing the ``current `on' time.'' As a result, School buses manufactured after the date of the interim final rule's issuance are permitted to be equipped with strobe lamps.
