Me'ir says his remarks are based on reliable sources from within the system, whose "conscience is bothered by the end-of-season sale the Israeli Government is holding these days on properties including Jerusalem." Me'ir claims that the committee is drawing lines and maps that will demarcate those areas within the city's current jurisdiction that are indisputably Arab, and that those areas will be handed over to the Palestinians when the permanent settlement is implemented in the city. He claims that this category includes Arab neighborhoods, such as Shu'fat and 'Isawiyah, in which no Jews reside. As stated, Me'ir refuses to disclose his sources, but he insists that these are trustworthy people who are unwilling to be accomplices in such a far-reaching move which, he believes, means partitioning the city. Me'ir is going to demand an urgent city council meeting. He plans to brief Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert on the matter and to convey his information to ministers and Knesset members. Reacting to Me'ir remarks, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin said yesterday that they can be summed up by one word: `Nonsense.' Me'ir further asserts that he has learned that in the recently signed Israel-Vatican agreement, Israel consented -- and this consent was not made public -- to granting extraterritorial status to Vatican churches and other Vatican properties in the city. [In a live telephone interview by reporter Hayim Zissowitz on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 10 January, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin says that Me'ir's remarks regarding extraterritorial status for Vatican properties are "sheer nonsense." Beilin adds that "nothing like that was ever agreed" and "the issue never came up." Asked whether Israel and the Vatican have signed an agreement on extraterritorial status, Beilin replies: "There is no such document, unless someone forged one."]
