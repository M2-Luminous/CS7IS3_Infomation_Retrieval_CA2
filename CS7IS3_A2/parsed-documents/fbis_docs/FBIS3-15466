From reliable sources it has become known that the Russian Federation's Ministry of Internal Affairs has sent a secret circular to the provinces which contains the instruction "to prepare for the suppression (!) of crime in conditions of a state of emergency." According to certain information, similar documents have been drafted in all power structures. Professional criminologists questioned by a KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent assure us that formulations like "suppression of crime" [podavleniye prestupnosti] have not been encountered in official papers since wartime. In the opinion of those people we talked with, the next fews days should see a number of legislative initiatives designed to provide a legal foundation for emergency measures.
