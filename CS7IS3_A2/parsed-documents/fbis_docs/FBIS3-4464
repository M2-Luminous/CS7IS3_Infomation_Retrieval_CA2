Chinese scientists are stepping up research into and manufacturing of large-capacity and long-life telecommunications and broadcasting satellites, versatile meteorological satellites and multi-purpose satellites. Among them, the "Dongfanghong No. 3" telecommunications satellite and "Fengyun No. 2" meteorological satellite will soon go into operation. The "Dongfanghong No.3" is equipped with 24 transponders and has a designed life of eight years. That means that the satellite will serve beyond the year 2000. The "Fengyun No. 2" is the first earth-synchronous remote meteorological satellite made in China. Research into the technology of making navigation satellites, disaster-forecasting satellites and satellite telecommunications systems for the finance industry is now under way. The country, now ranking among the most advanced in the world in the field, is also making efforts to improve and upgrade its "Long March" carrier rocket series so as to meet different needs of both domestic and overseas customers. Its "Long March-2B" heavy-thrust cluster carrier rocket now has a capacity of 4.8 tons and can lift objects to an earth-synchronous orbit. Its low-orbit carrying capacity is about 12 tons. The "Long March-1B" carrier rocket has raised its lift-off capacity greatly, and the "Long March-3A" carrier rocket has increased its carrying capacity for earth-synchronous orbit to 2.5 tons. The rapid progress in satellite technology has boosted the country's endeavors in telecommunications, broadcasting, education, meteorology, natural resources exploration, ocean utilization, map drawing, navigation, transportation, marine rescue and environmental supervision. With the aid of satellite technology, the country will build a nationwide mobile telecommunications system, data information system, accounting and taxation system, and salary-payment system.
