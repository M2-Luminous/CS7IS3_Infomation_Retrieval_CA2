It was unexpected because three ministers knew the draft proposal earlier and did not offer corrections to it. The ministers of industry, of agriculture, and of foreign economic cooperation emerged as opponents of the draft. The fact that this is not the first time the Alliance of the Democratic Left has failed to get support from the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) only adds color to the situation. But this is only one aspect of the affair, not its most important part. Three ministries would like to take control of privatization away from the Ministry of Property Transformations (MPW) or, at the very least, limit the privatization ministry to a minimum. Their proposal is that ministers who act as charterers of units would make decisions about property transformation in those units on their own. The minister of industry would thus become the most important figure in Polish privatization because the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is the largest owner of state firms. It fulfills the function of charterer for 764 public-sector firms, ahead of the Ministry of Transport and Naval Economy (553 firms), the Voivode of Katowice (230 firms), and the Voivode of Lodz (189 firms). The position of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Cooperation would seem to be minor because it controls only 18 firms; however, these are the great foreign trade bureaus! The Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry has only 47 firms left because 1,595 have been handed over to the State Treasury's Agency for Farm Property. Nearly all of the former State Farms are still held by the state, and these, of course, make up an important part of the PSL's unhappy electorate. The owner would thus privatize his own property. There is thus a question: If three ministers are to take advantage of this possibility, why not all? Would the minister of internal affairs, for example, be a good privatizer? That ministry is the charterer of one state firm, after all. One could equally well imagine the chief of the Physical Culture Office spreading privatization culture in his 22 state firms. Have we thus returned to a Poland divided by industrial sector? This is certainly one of the dangers but not the only one. The stakes are more than 5,000 state firms. Voivodes are the charterers of 3,400 of these; central organs control the other 1,800. There is general agreement to the fact that control of strategic areas of national interest should remain in the hands of the ministries. Examples are the energy industry, the arms industry, rails, and telecommunications. Many other firms could be handed over to voivodes--how many is a question about the scope of the decentralization of power. Authority over sole corporations of the state treasury (jssp) might remain attractive. The privatization ministry has transformed 522 state firms into such corporations, while the Ministry of Industry has transformed 118 firms into 58 jssp's. The MPW has privatized 100 corporations. These have not always been attractive finds. However, the MPW's power is also a result of its authority over the composition of supervisory boards. This has been much less satisfactory for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce; for example, seven jssp's were created out of 65 coal mines. The industry ministry thus carries the weight of restructuring in a very conflict-ridden sphere in our economy. The privatization ministry has not aspired to the role of privatizer of mining, which requires a costly and thorough restructuring. It is not therefore surprising that the organization of that process has been left to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Elimination also of authority over the composition of supervisory boards would in this conflict be illogical. If this were to be so, we could have some kind of repetition of the Borowski-Kawalec case--as we know, Deputy Prime Minister Kawalec had authority over the composition of supervisory boards in banks. One must also not ignore the act that the reservations about the privatization law draft were made at a time when there is no deputy prime minister for economic affairs. All of this does not mean, however, that one should defend the present scope of MPW authority. A decrease of that scope should occur through the aforementioned decentralization of ownership powers--the devolution of such powers on voivodes, including through the so-called communitization of state property. Should there be a Ministry of the Economy? I do not want to repeat the arguments from a discussion that recently appeared in ZYCIE GOSPODARCZE. The state domain is still so wide that such a resolution would seem to be premature, although it could lessen the interministry games. Some time ago, the discussion over state treasury trusteeships began. It was begun by the privatization ministry, even though such institutions would mean a lessening of its domain. The point is to bring to light certain scandals connected with the partial property rights in privatized corporations and with the property left over in the state domain after liquidations of public-sector firms. However, one should not confuse the idea behind the creation of a super state treasury. A new, huge state administrative organ would have to be created because it would have to control some 5,000 state firms. If such an institution is to be created, it will exercise ownership authority over a significantly diminished group of firms. The shrinkage of this group depends upon the pace of privatization. At the moment, the best solution would be to create such trusteeships. It would be quicker to reach agreements that would divide the flow of resources from the flow of revenue, and thus the empire from its domains. The income from privatization does not create a restructuring stream but, instead, serves constantly to patch up the budget because the hole in the budget is a drag on privatization. Such a divide of revenue could be accomplished within trusteeships. Meanwhile, we are witnessing a discussion not about the "map of privatization" but about its division into spheres of influence. This is not a debate over state treasury trusteeships but over the right to exercise ownership supervision in jssp's and in partially-privatized corporations. The right to influence over privatization can thus be divided in different ways--not only by industries or ministries. Every fight over privatization is thus a struggle for influence. Privatization itself is a game of interests that are often by nature at odds with one another. The problem is the quality of that game. The quality of society's understanding of privatization depends on the quality of the battles waged over it.
