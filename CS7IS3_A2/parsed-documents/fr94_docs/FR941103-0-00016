FR941103-0-00016 FR941103-0-00004 FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 12 CFR Part 211 [Regulation K; Docket No. R&hyph;0793] International Banking Operations AGENCY: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board or Federal Reserve) amends its Regulation K concerning the permissible activities of state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks. Section 202(a) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA or Act) provides that after December 19, 1992, a state-licensed branch or agency of a foreign bank may not engage in any activity that is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank unless the Board has determined that the activity is consistent with sound banking practice, and in the case of an insured branch, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has determined that the activity would pose no significant risk to the affected deposit insurance fund. This amendment to Regulation K sets forth the application procedures which state-licensed branches and agencies of foreign banks will be required to follow in order to request the Board's permission to engage in or continue to engage in an activity which is not permissible for a federal branch of a foreign bank and the requirements of divestiture and cessation plans. Insured branches are also required to seek the approval of the FDIC to engage in or to continue to engage in such an activity. The final rule also amends Regulation K to clarify that no application will be required in connection with the conversion by a foreign bank of its federally-licensed branch or agency into a state-licensed branch or agency. EFFECTIVE DATE: This regulation is effective on January 1, 1995, except for ยง211.21(e) which is effective December 5, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kathleen M.
