FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Ensign Stephen H. Ober, Office of Marine Safety, Security, and Environmental Protection, at the above address or phone number. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Notice of this meeting is provided in accordance with the consensus standard development approach outlined in the Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) published in the Federal Register on November 9, 1993 (58 FR 59420). If a standard is developed which provides a suitable basis for the regulation of inflatable PFDs for use in recreational boating, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), in which the Coast Guard discusses and proposes adoption of all or part of it, will be published in the Federal Register. The agenda for the March 7, 1994 meeting will include discussion of the following topics: (1) Issues identified after publication of the ANPRM, as they relate to the draft standard. (2) Inflation system status indicator needs/requirements. (3) Possible alternatives to an indicating inflation system. (4) Reliability testing of the inflation system. (5) User information needs and requirements. Notice of intent to participate in this meeting is requested from knowledgeable persons in the field, who are willing to volunteer to participate in the development of this standard. In order to determine what accommodations need to be arranged, this notification should occur by February 28, 1994. Interested persons are also invited to participate by providing written comments as requested in response to the ANPRM cited above. Dated: February 17, 1994. Joseph J.
