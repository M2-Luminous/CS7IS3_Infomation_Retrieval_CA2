Maybe Aldrich Ames Did Work for Moscow, but this Has Yet To Be Proved. During His Trial He Could Make Use of Rudolf Abel's Experience"] [Text] A spy-mania campaign is being launched in the United States . This is what a commentator of the old Soviet school would have written but, although times have now changed, nothing has changed in essence. The arrest of CIA officer Aldrich Ames and his wife on suspicion of having contacts with the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service [FIS] is a great coup for the FBI. Some of its officers have probably already made holes in their jackets for their medals. Until the trial begins, the U.S. Administration is completely controlling coverage of the case of Ames and his wife, releasing information in carefully measured doses and spreading rumors. In this way it is trying to form public opinion in the United States and other countries, specifically Russia. It is too early yet to guess whether it will be possible to influence the court's decision through the spy-mania campaign but, as regards the Americans, the propaganda machine has already backfired. Numerous television and radio talk-in programs are receiving calls from bewildered viewers and listeners who ask: Why has the White House gone into hysterics if the United States is itself engaging in espionage in Russia? As regards our country, Russians and most of the press have adopted a patriotic stance. As far as I can judge the degree of support has pleasantly surprised the FIS. Because of this whole fuss and game of big politics the fate of the arrestees themselves has receded into the background. Everything concerning them seems to be clear. In actual fact nothing is clear. The upcoming trial promises to be long and difficult -- difficult for both the prosecution and the defense. Because Ames has not admitted his guilt and has refused to cooperate with the authorities, and the U.S. legal system and good attorneys can turn any ostensibly clear-cut case into a whodunit with an unpredictable ending. This can be seen by reading material from the trial of Soviet intelligence officer and illegal Rudolf Abel, who was arrested in New York in 1957. Colonel Abel was facing life imprisonment or the death penalty but received 30 years, and having served four years was exchanged for U.S. spy pilot Francis Powers, who was shot down in the Sverdlovsk area. The intelligence game is full of contradictions. Professional intelligence officers are even respected by their opponents. In 1957 CIA Director Allen Dulles said: "I would like us to have three or four men like Abel in Moscow." But the agents an intelligence officer recruits or who are handed over to him to handle are his main tool. Agents betray their own country and as a rule ordinary people have contempt for them. Radio officer Kheykhanen, who gave Abel away to the FBI and who was also a Soviet intelligence officer, did not arouse the Americans' sympathy, although, objectively speaking, he protected U.S. national security. Kim Philby was a hero to the Soviet Union but remains a traitor to Britain. Ames is no Abel or Philby. He was possibly an agent (unlike Abel) who maybe worked for money (unlike Philby). Nevertheless it is in Russia's interests for the trial to end in his favor or, if he is found guilty and imprisoned, it is a matter of honor to us to support Ames and try to get him out of his prison cell. Because all current and potential Russian intelligence agents will follow the trial very closely. They will decide whether "to work or not to work for Russia" depending on the Kremlin's behavior in this situation. It should be counted as one of the U.S. intelligence services' greatest achievements that some years ago the White House succeeded in obtaining an amnesty for KGB officer Boris Yuzhin, who had cooperated with the CIA. How they contrived to do this is still a mystery. Let us return to Ames. Obviously the defense will devote priority attention to prosecution evidence and how it was obtained. Ames was not caught in the act of handing over secret documents to Russian officers. At the FBI's instigation the U.S. press has written that he chalked crosses to give signals to the Russians and used dead drops. This is hard to believe (see KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA of 25 February 1994 for our arguments) but let us suppose. What will his attorneys say? A possible line of defense is as follows: Ames recently worked in the CIA department which combats drug dealers. He could say that the crosses and dead drops were for his agents, members of the drugs mafia. Incidentally, his meetings with Russian intelligence officers could be explained in the same way. In this sense Abel's position was more difficult. According to attorney James Donovan's memoirs "a shortwave radio receiver with a schedule for receiving broadcasts, bolts, cuff links, tie clips, and other hollowed-out objects serving as `containers,' a code pad, encoded texts, a device for making microdots, and geographical maps of the United States with main defense areas marked on them" were found in his apartment, but the representatives of authority did not have an arrest and search warrant. They contravened the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the essence of which is "my home is my castle." Donovan tried to prove that all these ciphers, bolts, and tie clips could not be used to prove Abel's guilt, since they had been obtained illegally. When Donovan's appeal was heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, it was rejected by a margin of only one (!) vote. The next question is: Who is a witness? The chief witness could be the Russian intelligence officer who gave Ames away. But the point is that by no means every officer knows Ames. Information about such a high-level agent is concealed even from one's own people. The most experienced and the highest-ranking intelligence officers work with such people. As far as I know, lately there have been no defectors among the aces working throughout the United States. There is another possible scenario: The person who gave Ames away is still working in Russian intelligence. But this means that he will not be able to appear as a witness and that he does not have long left as a free man: He will be fingered all the same. Incidentally, in the opinion of professionals the Americans are very careless about looking after their agent network, often jeopardizing it for the sake of immediate political advantages. I have formed the impression that we are dealing with the second scenario. The FBI is stressing just a little too importunately that Ames was not living within his means and that he bought, for example, a nice house in the Washington suburbs, paying the whole sum in cash. U.S. officials want to make everyone believe that Ames was given away by envious neighbors and to divert attention away from the real source of information. According to information available to me, Ames' wife, who worked with him both in the CIA and for Russian intelligence, is cooperating with the investigation. If this is true, attorneys will try to discredit her as a witness and prove that she hates her husband or is jealous of him, that she wants to get her revenge on him, and that her evidence is not credible. The trial will get bogged down in an investigation into family mutual relations. It is interesting how Donovan tried to make the jury disbelieve Kheykhanen's evidence: He was engaged in espionage for Soviet Russia, arrived in the United States on a false documents, and "is in effect a professional liar." The same accusations were made against Abel but it did not matter: What mattered was the identity of the witness. The attorney had something else to add, stating that Kheykhanen was an alcoholic and bigamist. It will now be all the more interesting to follow the development of events. "The start of the trial is like a show. The curtain goes up and, in ideal conditions, the drama begins to unfold, a drama which the judge and jury are seeing for the first time. The tale is repeated several times, corroborated, confirmed, and refuted. The essence of the case is elicited in detail, point by point. First this is done by one side, then by the other. Every witness appearing on the stage is a new actor" -- this is what was written about Abel's trial by J. Donovan, his attorney. In Ames' case the drama could turn into a comedy if his guilt is not proved successfully. After all, U.S. President Bill Clinton himself intervened in the case. What genuine indignation was written all over his face when he was talking about the perfidious and ungrateful Russians! However, let us not forget that sometimes the current U.S. Administration is notable for its unprofessionalism.
