FBIS3-43301 "drafr002_c_94009" FBIS-AFR-94-002 Document Type:Daily Report 4 Jan 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Zulus Reportedly Training at `Secret Camps' MB0201154794 Johannesburg RAPPORT in Afrikaans 2 Jan 94 p 4 MB0201154794 Johannesburg RAPPORT Language: Afrikaans Article Type:BFN [Report by De Wet Potgieter] [Text] Zulu warriors have for some time already been undergoing military training on a large scale by right-wing instructors at secret training camps in the mountains of northern Natal and eastern Free State. The training in guerrilla warfare is in preparation for what right wingers describe as "the bloody war" expected between the African National Congress [ANC] and the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] in the run-up to the 27 April general election. The secret training is the first official confirmation of the close military cooperation which exists between far-right paramilitary organizations and the Zulus. These close ties are not limited to the nonaggression pact recently signed between the AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] and East Rand Zulus by Mr. Eugene Terreblanche and Mr. Mwesi Twala in Vereeniging. Military Intervention It appears that far-right underground organizations want to intervene militarily should the Transitional Executive Council [TEC] order the defense force to invade kwaZulu. It also appears that the far right will become involved in the bloody war between the ANC on the battlefields of Natal. This secret training is not part of the kwaZulu government's official training program for its so-called Community Protection Units [preceding three words in English], which is being handled by the kwaZulu Police. RAPPORT has established that the far right has a fairly effective intelligence network in place in northern Natal which works closely with the Zulus. Mr. Zanzi Sibanda, regional IFP organizer in northern Natal, confirmed to RAPPORT this week that "widespread training" of Zulus is taking place in the area. Massacred He claimed that his people are being massacred on a large scale by ANC supporters, and their houses burned down. He showed RAPPORT an ANC pamphlet which was distributed about a week ago by the Madadeni branch in Newcastle, in which a call is made for the ANC's "enemy" to be wiped out and their homes burned down. "Kill the enemy or we perish," the pamphlet says. Mr. Sibanda spoke to RAPPORT in the presence of the "Chief of Staff" of the Orde Boerevolk [Order of the Boer Nation], Mr. Leonard Veenendal, and referred to Mr. Veenendal as not merely an ally but "a good friend and brother." Mr. Sibanda said he is very worried about white MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the Nation; ANC military wing] commanders who are brought in from the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] region to establish ANC "self-defense units" in northern Natal. He named two houses in the Dannhauser District where the ANC is storing weapons, and which are regularly visited by ANC Natal Chairman Mr. Harry Gwala. War [subhead] "The ANC is preparing for full-scale war in Natal and the East Rand, in order to gain full control of these regions before the election," said Mr. Sibanda. "That is why I welcome help with the training of my people so that they can survive the struggle." He expressed his concern over the possibility that the TEC will persuade the government to send defense force units to "take over" kwaZulu, or that an ANC government would do the same as President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who sent the Fifth Brigade into Matabeleland to suppress the supporters of Mr. Joshua Nkomo. Mr. Veenendal told RAPPORT that the Zulus and the Boers have a common enemy, and that he had seen MK soldiers cold-bloodedly murdering innocent women and children in Natal and burning down their homes.
