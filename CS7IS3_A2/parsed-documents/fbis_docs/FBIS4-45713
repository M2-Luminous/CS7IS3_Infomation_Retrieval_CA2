The Regulations were laid before Parliament on Monday and will come into force on 6 May 1994. They supplement the provisions of the EC [European Commission] Waste Shipments Regulation, which comes into operation on the same date. In a written reply to a Parliamentary Question from Nigel Waterson MP [Member of Parliament] (Eastbourne), Mr. Atkins said: "The Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994, laid before Parliament on Monday, will come into force on 6 May when Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of waste within, into and out of the European Community (the "Waste Shipments Regulation") applies. The Waste Shipments Regulation implements the obligations of the Basel Convention which, together with the EC, the United Kingdom ratified on 7 February and to which it will become a Party on 8 May. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, but additional domestic legislation is required to give full effect to some of its provisions. For the UK, this additional legislation is contained in the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994. "The Regulations designate Waste Regulations Authorities in Great Britain and District Councils in Northern Ireland as the competent authorities of dispatch and destination, for imports and exports to and from the UK, and designate the Secretary of State as competent authority for transit shipments, and as `correspondent' for the purposes of the EC Regulation. Other provisions include conferring powers on customs officers to assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions by detaining shipments where appropriate; and specifying offences and penalties relating to compliance with the Regulation. The Regulations also provide for the preparation of a waste management plan (in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive). "Public consultations were carried out in March on a draft of the Regulations and of accompanying guidance. The Regulations have been modified to reflect the concerns and interests of industry, local authorities and the public in response to those consultations. The Government is satisfied that these Regulations will enable the UK to fulfil its obligations under the Basel Convention, and contribute significantly towards securing the environmentally sound management of waste movements to and from the UK." Notes to Editors The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal provides a framework for states to control movements of hazardous waste. Parties to the Convention may ban imports of waste, and shipments are not allowed between Parties and non-Parties without specific (bi-lateral or multi-lateral) agreements. Where shipments do occur, the Convention provides for a global system of environmental controls in which the onus is on the exporting state to ensure environmentally sound management of the wastes. The UK, together with the EC, ratified the Basel Convention on 7 February, and will become Parties to the Convention on 8 May. The EC Waste Shipments Regulation (259/93), which implements the obligations of the Basel Convention in the Community, will apply on 6 May. The new Regulation, which supersedes the existing EC Directive 84/631/EEC, as amended (implemented in the UK by the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1988), will enable the UK to exercise strict controls over imports and exports of waste. The EC Regulation is directly applicable, and therefore does not require transposition into national legislation, but some additional domestic legislation is required to give full effect to some of its provisions. These matters are covered in the Transfrontier Shipment of Waste Regulations 1994.The main provisions of the new Regulations are: --designation of competent authorities and "correspondent"; --discretionary powers for competent authorities of dispatch to require notifications of shipments of waste from their area to be routed through them; --enforcement powers for competent authorities to ensure, where appropriate, the return of waste to the UK, or to secure the environmentally sound disposal or recovery of waste; --to require a certificate relating to financial guarantees to be obtained prior to shipments into and out of the UK; --powers for customs officers to detain shipments in order to assist competent authorities in carrying out their functions; --provision for the preparation of a waste management plan (in accordance with the Waste Framework Directive); --offences and penalties; --powers for the Secretary of State to request information; and --various transitional provisions and revocations of superseded legislation.
