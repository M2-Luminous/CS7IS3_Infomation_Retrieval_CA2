On state's witnesses, the new minister stressed the need to strengthen the area of the law covering "the objective verification of their accusations aimed at guaranteeing (their) total reliability and, at the same time, avoiding tampering and discrediting." For this purpose, Biondi reported to the self-ruling body of the nation's judiciary that in cooperation with the Interior Ministry, a panel had been formed for work on "judiciary initiatives necessary so that state's witnesses know the consequences they are facing" if their testimony sidetracks investigations or is slanderous. In this connection, the minister said he intends to return to the Parliament a bill submitted to the Senate during the legislature just past for enhancing the defense of defendants facing criminal charges. This package includes new measures on the application of preventive custody and the use of the advisory warrant, sent out to formally notify the recipient that he or she is under investigation. The minister said he would like to avoid having the advisory warrant, "an essential judiciary safeguard instrument, become a source of serious prejudice against the person investigated." On the sensitive issue of attacking the mountain of pending corruption trials, without applying coats of whitewash, Biondi said, "The solution studied by my ministry is not a political solution, it is judiciary. This is a matter merely of expanding the concept of plea bargaining already provided for in our laws and already proposed by my predecessor, Giovanni Conso, in the preceding legislature." He explained that the measures under examination would be applied strictly at the time of trial and that plea bargaining would be available to all defendants, not only the politicians facing trial. "So, there would be no unequal treatment and no requests of constitutional illegitimacy." He said he had addressed himself to this issue in his statement to the CSM "to calm those who have shown worry about possible disparity of treatment of people." Moving on to what he said was of special concern to him, the new minister cited "excessive overcrowding in the prisons" in the nation with a prison population of some 56,000 in facilities designed to accommodate 30,000 prisoners. "The steep increase in the number of detainees is a complex phenomenon," he said and confirmed that it would be difficult to imagine a "spontaneous reversal of the trend" in the near future. "It is necessary, therefore, to act to curb this process and to make the structures of the penitentiaries administration adequate," he declared. He also disclosed the government is weighing such steps as "extending the application of measures on the expulsion of foreign nationals" and replacing "detention in prison with alternative punishment for minor crimes" and for short terms remaining of sentences which have been almost completely served. Biondi told the magistrates he intends to "strongly raise" in the cabinet the matter of a bigger budget for justice and will devote careful attention to the administration of civil justice. In this connection, he recalled that the colossal backlog of civil cases wending their slow ways through the courts has led to serious problems for Italy before the European Commission and the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Before the introduction of two changes pending, adding a new sector made up of justice of the peace and a revised civil law code, the minister said he intends to confer on the real prospects for the application of these reforms. For this purpose, he reported he will meet tomorrow with the National Association of Magistrates and the National Forensic Council. He also promised to carefully assess recommendations recently drafted by the CSM on the elimination of a number of "useless" offices within the nation's judiciary.
