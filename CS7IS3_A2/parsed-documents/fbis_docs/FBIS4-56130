Ruml said he believed that the result of the screening of General Rostislav Kotil, head of the South sector of the UNPROFOR forces in Croatia, would be the same. He was reacting to recent media allegations that both generals had failed the screening tests which must be taken by all persons in or entering high office to see if they had collaborated with or been an agent of the former communist secret police. These allegations were confirmed by Tomas Fejfar (ODS), deputy chairman of parliament's defense and security committee, on May 24, but Baudys does not agree. Ruml also confirmed that Baudys had taken an interest in the results of Pezl's test. He said it had not yet been shown that officers who failed their screening tests were working in the army. "I have ordered a new inspection of all the documents concerning the screening law to be carried out, and nothing like this has been shown yet," Ruml told CTK on May 24.
