FBIS3-29794 "dreas036_n_94014" FBIS-EAS-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 Vietnam Labor Ministry To Allow Strikes as Last Resort BK2102130594 Hong Kong AFP in English 0909 GMT 21 Feb 94 BK2102130594 Hong Kong AFP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] HANOI, Feb 21 (AFP) -- Vietnamese workers will be allowed to strike to defend their interests, but only as a last resort, a Ho Chi Minh City labor union newspaper cited the Labor Ministry as saying. The Labor and Social Affairs Ministry told provincial authorities Friday that workers would have the right to strike after all efforts at conciliation were exhausted, the union weekly, NGUOI LAO DONG, said in its latest edition. But it added that workers planning to strike would have to submit to management a written warning 15 days prior to any action. The ministry also called for the formation of conciliation and arbitration councils in local companies, in conjunction with regional state labor boards, to help resolve disputes between workers and their bosses, the newspaper said. If disputes were not resolved under the system, employees could strike two weeks after submitting a written warning. Negotiations would continue over the duration of a strike, the newspaper added. In the absence of a labor code, which the National Assembly is expected to be adopt in mid-June, the right to strike comes as social conflicts have multiplied in recent months, especially in the south. The Vietnamese press reported on three strikes that took place shortly before Tet -- the Lunar New Year -- at the beginning of the month in three major companies, one in Hanoi. The most drastic was at Ho Chi Minh City's Vitexco, where 500 workers stopped work, demanding a new year bonus increase and social security guarantees. Some 140 Ho Chi Minh City street sweepers also went on strike with the same demands. In the capital, 200 factory workers struck for 48 hours over low and inequitable salaries, the newspaper said.
