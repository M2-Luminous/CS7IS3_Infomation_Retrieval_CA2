FBIS4-28169 "dreas110_d_94009" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 8 Jun 1994 South Korea President Interviewed on DPRK Policy President Interviewed on DPRK Policy SK0806111194 Seoul YONHAP in English 1102 GMT 8 Jun 94 SK0806111194 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, June 8 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam said on Wednesday no sanction against North Korea is being mulled among South Korea and some of its allies outside the frame of the United Nations in connection with the nuclear question. "It is not proper to discuss any sanction outside the United Nations at this time when international negotiations are going on over the issue of sanctions," the president said. In an exclusive interview with the daily HANGUK ILBO on its 40th anniversary, Kim said the most important thing under the circumstances is to adopt sanctions against North Korea through the UN Security Council. The president said this is no time for South Korea and the United States to discuss ways to induce North Korea to come to a dialogue. "If North Korea is interested in dialogue, Pyongyang itself should advance an acceptable offer," Kim said. The president said he would have another telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill Clinton to discuss possible sanctions against North Korea. He also said he does not feel the need to modify the government's unification policy that rules out any unification by means of absorbing North Korea. "The government's firm policy is to promote unification step by step through consultations between the two Koreas," he said. The president further reaffirmed that during his presidency, there would be no constitutional change to revise the existing single five-year term of presidency or in favor of a parliamentary cabinet system. Asked if he plans to meet Kim Tae-chung, chairman of the Asia-Pacific Peace Foundation, President Kim said it would be unnatural for him to discuss political matters with a man who he said has retired from politics. "But, I believe there will be some opportunity to meet him open-heartedly," the president said.
