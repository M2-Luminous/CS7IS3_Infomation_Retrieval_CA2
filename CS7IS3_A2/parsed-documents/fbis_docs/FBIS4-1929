FBIS4-1929 "drchi065_v_94001" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 25 Mar 1994 TAIWAN Defense Minister on Troop Drawdown Defense Minister on Troop Drawdown OW0404162494 Taipei CHUNG YANG JIH PAO in Chinese 25 March 94 p 7 OW0404162494 Taipei CHUNG YANG JIH PAO Chinese BFN [Text] Defense Minister Sun Chen pointed out on 23 March that in accordance with the policy of reduction-in-strength, the troops of the republic's armed force will be reduced from the current 498,000 to 400,000 in the next 10 years. After the reduction, the current combat capacity will be maintained with better weaponry, more firepower, and greater mobility. He stressed that it is absolutely essential to maintain the minimum requirements of security defense strength. The portion of the National Defense Report 1993-94 released by the Ministry of National Defense [MND] on 23 March dealing with national defense troops notes that the number of troops has dropped from 503,000 to 498,000, a reduction of 5,000, in the past year. The 10-year reduction-in-strength plan that starts in 1994 projects that in 10 years the number of troops will be reduced to 400,000. The White Paper notes that troop draw-down will be accelerated in the next nine years. The number of males that can be drafted has been dropping steadily in recent years. The MND will use more civilian and women personnel in the future to reduce its dependence on enlistees. National Defense Minister Sun Chen said that in view of the aforementioned major changes in manpower, the armed forces will maintain its current level of combat readiness by upgrading its weaponry. To meet this need, we have made active efforts in the past two years to purchase such high-performance fighters as F-16's and Mirage 2000's. Sun Chen also emphasized that a nation's combat readiness is not determined by its armed forces alone. Rather, it is determined by the nation's overall resources. If too much manpower and resources are spent on national defense, it will have an adverse effect on the nation's economic development and will prove ill-advised in the long run. Therefore, it is necessary to strike a balance between the short and long terms and reduce the troops as a percentage of the whole population. Sun Chen said: The National Defense Report notes that the ratio of the troops as a percentage of the whole population will drop to 1.7. The defense budget will also drop as a percentage of the general budget of the central government, the budgets of governments at three levels, and the GNP. It is hoped that, in spite of the percentage drop, the absolute defense expenditure figure -- and the resources spent on the maintenance of national defense -- will continue to grow as a result of fast economic growth. We have our own standards for assessing the minimum requirements of national defense strength. The purpose of our military is to defend our country and our people's safety. We are not in an arms race against the Chinese Communists. However, we need to maintain the minimum needs of national defense as a guarantee for our safety.
