FR941017-2-00093 FR941017-2-00058 [Release No. 34&hyph;34818; File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change and Notice of Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3 to the Proposed Rule Change by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. Relating to Exercise Cut-Off Procedures for Expiring Equity Options October 11, 1994. Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``ACT''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 on March 23, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change relating to the exercise procedures for expiring equity option contracts. The proposal was published for comment in the Federal Register on May 18, 1994. 3 No comments were received on the proposed rule change. The NYSE filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposal on September 19, 1994, Amendment No. 2 on September 27, 1994, and Amendment No. 3 on October 7, 1994. 4 This order approves the proposed rule change, as amended. 5 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1993). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34050 (May 12, 1994), 59 FR 25978 (May 18, 1994). 4 In Amendment Nos. 1, 2, and 3, the NYSE proposes to make certain clarifying amendments to Rule 780, as discussed herein. See Letters from Hope Duffy, Director, Options and Special Products, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision (``OMS''), Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission, dated September 19, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''), dated September 27, 1994 (``Amendment No. 2''); and Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, OMS, Division, Commission, dated October 7, 1994 (``Amendment No. 3''). 5 The Commission notes that substantively similar proposals by the other options exchanges have been approved. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 34806 (October 7, 1994) (Order approving File No. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;93&hyph;37), 34807 (October 7, 1994) (order approving File No. SR&hyph;CBOE&hyph;94&hyph;06), 34808 (October 7, 1994) (approving File No. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;01), and 34810 (October 7, 1994) (approving File No. SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;12). Currently, with regard to expiring equity options, NYSE customers and member organizations 6 are required to indicate their exercise decisions to clearing members no later than 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (``E.S.T.'') on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date of the options (``Exercise Cut-Off Time''). 7 This is the latest time by which an exercise instruction 8 may be: (1) prepared by a clearing member for positions in its proprietary trading account; (2) accepted by a clearing member from an options specialist or competitive options trader for positions is its account or from a floor broker for positions in its error account; or (3) accepted by a member organization from any customer for positions in the customer's account. 9 The only exceptions to Rule 780 are: (1) to remedy mistakes or errors made in good faith (2) to take appropriate action as the result of a failure to reconcile unmatched Exchange option transactions; and (3) where exceptional circumstances relating to a customer's or member's ability to communicate exercise instructions to a member organization (or a member organization's ability to receive such exercise instructions) prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time warrant such action. 10 Member organizations are required to time stamp each exercise instruction at the time it is prepared. 6 As used herein, the term ``member organization'' also includes individual members of the Exchange. 7 See NYSE Rule 780. Generally, equity options may be traded until the close of business on the last business day before expiration, which is generally the third Friday of the expiration month (``Expiration Friday''). 8 For customers, an exercise instruction is a notice delivered to a member organization to exercise an option. For a clearing member, options specialist, or competitive options trader (as defined in NYSE rules), an exercise instruction is a notice to The Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised pursuant to the OCC's exercise-by-exercise procedure (``OCC Rule 805''), or not to exercise an option that otherwise would automatically be exercised pursuant to OCC Rule 805. See infra note 14. The OCC has separate rules regarding the cut-off time by which exercise notices must be delivered to the OCC by the clearing members. The proposed rule change does not in any way affect the rules of the OCC. 9 In most cases, exercise instructions are transmitted to Exchange clearing members electronically through the Clearing Management and Control System (``C/MACS''). 10 Rule 780 also does not apply to expiring index options. See NYSE Rule 780, Supplementary Material .10(c). Presently, it is a violation of Rule 780 for clearing members to accept instructions after the Exercise Cut-Off Time except in reliance on one of the above exceptions. Because exercise instructions are submitted to the clearing members and then to the OCC by the clearing members, without having the audit trail pass directly through the Exchange, it is difficult for the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780. 11 11 The Commission believes that the Exercise Cut-Off Time serves an important investor protection function. Specifically, the Exercise Cut-Off Time protects holders of short positions in equity options from unanticipated events occurring after the close of the market. As the Commission has previously stated, if expiring equity options were allowed to be exercised after the Exercise Cut-Off Time for reasons other than the exceptions set forth above, the Commission believes that options writers could be unfairly disadvantaged with respect to options holders by not having the same opportunity to react to such unanticipated events. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 19589 (March 10, 1983), 48 FR 11196 (March 16, 1983). In order to enhance the ability of the Exchange to surveil for violations of Rule 780 for expiring equity option, the proposed rule change would alter the existing exercise instruction procedures by requiring that final exercise decisions also be submitted to the Exchange. The clearing members would still be responsible for delivering exercise notices to the OCC, 12 however, the proposed rule change would allow the Exchange to accurately document when each exercise instruction was received by a member organization or clearing member, or delivered by a clearing member to the OCC. 13 The Exercise Cut-Off Time will still be 5:30 p.m. (E.S.T.) on the business day immediately prior to the expiration date. Pursuant to the proposal, however, there will be two means of exercising an expiring equity option: (1) take no action and allow exercise determinations to be made in accordance with OCC Rule 805; 14 or (2) the member organization may submit a contrary exercise advice ( i.e. , a notice committing an option holder either to exercise an option that would not otherwise be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805, or not exercise an option that otherwise would be exercised automatically pursuant to OCC Rule 805) (``Contrary Exercise Advice''). Contrary Exercise Advices would be submitted by a member organization either: (1) at a place designated for that purpose by any national options exchange of which the member organization is a member and where the option is listed; or (2) to the Exchange via the OCC in a format prescribed by the OCC. 15 In those instances where OCC Rule 80-5 has been waived by the OCC, 16 the proposal requires that a Contrary Exercise Advice be submitted prior to the Exercise Cut-Off Time by member organizations wishing to exercise an option that would not be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver, or not to exercise an option that would be automatically exercised in the absence of such a waiver. 17 The applicable price of the underlying security in such instances shall be the last sale price in the primary market for the underlying security, except as OCC Rule 805(l) otherwise provides. 18 12 Exercise instructions will still be submitted to clearing members, however, the requirements for this process will be determined by each clearing member, in accordance with the OCC's rules. This process will no longer be governed by the NYSE's rules. Pursuant to the OCC's rules, equity options expire at 12:00 a.m. on the third Saturday of the expiration month. As explained earlier, the OCC has its own rules as to the latest time by which clearing members must submit exercise notices to the OCC. These rules are separate from the Exchange's Exercise Cut-Off Time and are not affected by the proposed rule change. 13 The proposed rule change also makes it clear that reporting of final exercise decisions as contemplated by the revised rules does not serve to substitute as the effective exercise notice to OCC for the exercise or non-exercise of expiring options. 14 OCC Rule 805 provides for automatic exercise of in-the-money options at expiration without the submissions of an exercise notice to the OCC if the price of the security underlying the option is at or above a certain price (for calls) or at or below a certain price (for puts); and the non-exercise of an option at expiration if the price of the security underlying the option does not satisfy such price levels. See OCC Rule 805. 15 Even though this may be accomplished by submitting exercise decisions directly to the Exchange, the more likely manner of accomplishing this will be to submit the exercise decisions to the Exchange through C/MACS. Due to the burden that would be placed on members of having to manually process every exercise decision for delivery directly to the Exchange, the procedures and rules being approved herein will not be implemented by the NYSE until the OCC submits a written representation to the Commission that C/MACS has been modified as necessary, fully tested, and ready to go on-line, to allow members to submit exercise decisions to the Exchange through C/MACS. This process is expected to be completed in time for the November 1994 expirations. 16 This could happen where an underlying security is not traded on its primary market on the trading day immediately preceding an expiration date and, as a result, the OCC determines not to fix a closing price for that security. See OCC Rule 805(l). 17 When the OCC waives the exercise-by-exception procedure, the OCC's rules require submission of an affirmative exercise notice for all exercises even in circumstances where a Contrary Exercise Advice is not required to be submitted to the Exchange. See Amendment No. 3, supra note 4. 18 Id .
