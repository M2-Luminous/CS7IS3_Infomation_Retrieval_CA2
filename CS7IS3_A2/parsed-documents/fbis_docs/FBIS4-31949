We have had a preliminary look at the maps, but we are expecting some improvements, that is, corrections. If that happens, it will be create favorable conditions for the restoration of peace in Bosnia, Krajisnik said. He particularly stressed that the maps, which have been circulated, were causing concern and fears among the Serb people that they could be imposed on the Serbs in their current form. The maps considerably affect the vital interests of the Serb people and, in fact, they are destroying the achievements of our struggle for the homeland, which is impermissible. I do not want to pass any judgments on the maps. However, I am expecting reasonable proposals because we presented our objections and explained why we could not accept their proposals. We also invited the Muslims side to present their stances. We are awaiting a response with great interest. Our reaction to the response will in any event be in line with the proposals adopted by the Serb Republic People's Assembly at the last two sessions, Krajisnik said in conclusion.
