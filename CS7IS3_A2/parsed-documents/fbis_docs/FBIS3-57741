The removal of the fuel has been practically agreed upon and it should be completed between April and July, he said. Russia has decided to complete it without international aid, referring to state secrets, he added. The conference failed to agree on the guarantees of safety during the removal and transportation of the fuel rods, Olljum said, explaining that Russia's equipment either fails to meet the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] requirements or has been classified. Olljum added that Estonia may ban the removal operations in case of doubts in its safety, but such moves could be misunderstood. However, the process should be monitored by Estonian and foreign experts, the chancellor said. Most problems should be discussed at the next round of the Estonian-Russian negotiations, Olljum told the press. But he added that practically no progress had been made in the preparations of the intended Estonian-Russian summit meeting. The meeting would only be possible after the settling of the deadline for the Russian troops withdrawal, Olljum said.
