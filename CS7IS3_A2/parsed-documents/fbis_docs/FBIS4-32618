When asked what merit his government, which assumed office about three months ago, deserves for this, the prime minister said that he would not quantify it. "For us, it is important to strengthen even more the positive elements that are beginning to appear in the economy, and thus to improve the stability of our economic development as rapidly as possible. We have the prerequisites for this. We have made a firm decision to keep the state budget deficit and inflation at a certain acceptable level and to deal with unemployment with our development programs, particularly in those regions where unemployment is highest," he said. Asked in which areas his government wants to support the positive elements of economic development, the prime minister said that it would release additional funds from extra budgetary sources, particularly from the proceeds of privatization, to support, above all, construction activity, the completion of the comprehensive housing construction work, and small and medium-size enterprises, which are to become the engine of the Slovak economy, and also the construction of roads and other communication links and certain railroads. He said that the goal this year is to bring to a complete halt the decline in gross domestic product, cut inflation to 13 percent (from 23.1 percent last year), and to keep the budget deficit at 14 billion Slovak korunas. "We intend to continue our tight fiscal policy," he stressed. "Apart from some positive statistical data, we have the slightly negative signal that the volume of investment in the Slovak Republic has declined," he added and drew attention to the fact that Slovakia provides a number of comparative advantages for foreign investors--for instance, comparable qualified labor is 40 percent cheaper than in Poland, 25 percent cheaper than in Hungary, and 10 percent cheaper than in the Czech Republic. As regards the volume of investment in Slovakia, the Czech Republic is third, with its volume of 13 percent after Austria (23 percent) and Germany (21 percent). Jozef Moravcik commented: "I believe that this could be better, but this is a matter, above all, for Czech investors to consider." Regarding the report that the IMF is to provide a stabilization loan in July and to the question of whether this decision will also have political significance for his government in the preelection period, Moravcik said: "Above all, I attach economic importance to this credit. Its importance lies in the fact that Slovakia has been positively evaluated by this renowned financial institution and thereby has acquired better and more advantageous conditions in dealing with other financial institutions."
