FR940812-0-00017 FR940812-0-00008 The purpose of this rule is to implement section 2347 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;624) which amends Sec. 310B (f) through (h) (7U.S.C. 1932) of the CONACT. This statutory amendment created a new program for Rural Technology Grants. In FY 1993, $1 million was appropriated to this program as part of the Extension Service (ES) budget. Three proposals were selected for funding under ES administration. The program was transferred to RDA under a Memorandum of Understanding. ES received another appropriation in their budget in FY 1994 for $1.5 million. This amount has been transferred to RDA through an apportionment of funds. RDA is responsible for implementing this program for FY 1994. It has been determined that failure to implement the program will result in a substantial negative impact in the rural areas if grants from this program are not awarded from the appropriation for FY 1994. Because the appropriated funds for this program are not available past the end of FY 1994, it is essential that this authorization be implemented this year. RDA anticipates receiving a wide range of grant proposals as compared to the funding availability and expects the level of competition to be high. These regulations have a sunset provision of July 13, 1995. The economies of many rural areas have experienced significant stress as a result of relying primarily on the agricultural or natural resource-based industries to provide employment. As the result of improvements in efficiency and productivity or the decline in importance of those industries in certain areas, employment opportunities and the general economy of those areas have declined significantly. Therefore, immediate implementation of this program will provide $1.5 million for these needy areas. Since this is a new program, there is no historical data available to quantify benefits. However, the benefit to be derived from the program is the opportunity to create new investment and employment opportunities in rural areas based on new uses for agricultural or natural resources, thereby assisting in the diversification of rural economies, creating new employment opportunities, and simultaneously developing new markets for agricultural products and natural resources. The Interim Final Rule describes the procedures and practices for applying for and obtaining this grant assistance. The Agency, however, is providing for public comment in order for members of the public who wish to suggest alternative rule provisions or courses of action in implementing this program to have an opportunity to give RDA the benefit of their views. In the event that public comments are received, the Department will consider them, as appropriate, before further publishing of this rule. Program Description Grants awarded under the Rural Technology Development Grant (RTDG) program will be to nonprofit institutions and public bodies to establish and operate centers for rural technology or cooperative development. The term ``nonprofit institution'' is defined by the CONACT, Sec. 310B(f)(4)(A) to mean ``*␣*␣* any organization or institution, including an accredited institution of higher education, no part of the net earnings of which inures, or may lawfully inure, to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual.'' While this definition does not include public bodies, the reference to public bodies in Sec. 310B(f) of the CONACT does indicate congressional intent to make rural technology development grants available to public bodies. The term ``public body'' has been defined to mean any State, county, city, township, incorporated towns and villages, boroughs, authorities, districts, locally-based areawide economic development organizations, Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations, and other federally recognized Indian tribes in rural areas. Furthermore, the Agency believes public bodies should be eligible because they are eligible for other RDA programs and could reasonably be expected to operate such centers. The statute requires that these centers satisfy certain conditions in order to be eligible for grant funds. The primary objective of the program, established by CONACT Sec. 310B(f)(2)(B), is to improve the economic condition of rural areas by promoting the development (through technological innovation, cooperative development, and adaptation of existing technology) and commercialization of: (1) new services and products that can be produced or provided in rural areas, (2) new processes that can be utilized in the production of products in rural areas, and (3) new enterprises that can add value to on-farm production through processing or marketing. The intent of this law is to provide incentives to establish new businesses, implement advanced technologies for businesses presently in place, and create alternative agricultural enterprises to stimulate the farm economy in the rural areas. Definitions referenced in the interim rule generally are based on working definitions used by the Agency or other Federal agencies in similar grant programs and common usage of the terms. ``Cooperative development,'' however, was taken from the CONACT, Sec. 310B(f)(2)(B), and ``technology development'' was taken from the CONACT, Sec. 310B(f)(2)(C)(vi). ``Rural and rural area,'' ``urbanized area,'' and ``urbanizing area'' were taken from related RDA program regulations also under the authority of the CONACT, Sec. 310B. The term ``United States'' is defined in accordance with Sec. 310B(f)(4)(B) to mean the several States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the other territories and possessions of the United States. Eligibility RTDGs may be made to nonprofit institutions and public bodies serving rural areas. Rural area determinations will be made to ascertain the eligibility of the applicant's proposed serving area. The procedure established in this rule to determine eligible grant areas is based on density requirements used by RDA in other grant programs. In accordance with the CONACT, Sec. 310B(h), grants may be used to pay only up to 75 percent of the administrative costs. The Agency has further determined that to better utilize limited funds available under the program and to leverage those funds to bring in other sources of funding for the projects, the maximum grant amount for each proposed project will not be more than 75 percent of the project costs. This requirement is considered necessary to stimulate other funding participation in economic development activities and allow program grant funds to reach a broader range of rural economic development efforts. The applicant must contribute at least 25 percent to the cost of the project and administrative costs. The applicant's contribution may be in cash or third-party in-kind contributions in accordance with 7 CFR 3015, ``Uniform Federal Assistance Regulations,'' and 3016, ``Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State and Local Governments.'' Under 7 CFR 3015 and 3016, matching funds generally cannot come from another Federal grant program.
