FR940303-2-00111 FR940303-2-00065 INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION [Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;198 (Sub-No. 1)] Policy Statement on Motor Contract Requirements Under the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 AGENCY: Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). ACTION: Policy statement. SUMMARY: The ICC is issuing a policy statement (set forth below) explaining and interpreting new statutory requirements governing the form and minimum contents for transportation agreements executed by motor contract carriers. These new requirements are in section 6 of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;180) and apply to contracts entered into after March 3, 1994. The Commission does not plan to issue a further decision unless the comments expose issues that require additional clarification. DATES: This policy statement is effective on February 28, 1994. Comments are due on April 4, 1994. ADDRESSES: Send comments (an original and 10 copies), referring to Ex Parte No. MC&hyph;198 (Sub-No. 1), to: Office of the Secretary, Case Control Branch, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Felder (202) 927&hyph;6373. [TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 927&hyph;5721.] SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 6 of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 (NRA), added new statutory requirements governing the form, minimum contents, and retention period for transportation agreements executed by motor contract carriers, as well as regulatory auditing and enforcement by the Commission of contract carriage requirements. By this policy statement, we discuss these new requirements and explain how we interpret certain of the new provisions. Background The new requirements are similar to our prior regulations at 49 CFR 1053.1 (1991 ed.). They required contract carriers to enter into bilateral written contracts that ( inter alia ): (a) Named the particular shipper or shippers involved, and (b) covered a series of shipments during a stated period of time in contrast to separate contracts of carriage governing individual shipments. A number of defunct carriers have sought to disavow their own contract carriage agreements by alleging technical noncompliance with those regulations. 1 In an effort to prevent such a misuse of its regulations, the Commission repealed those regulations, in Contracts for Transportation of Property, 8 I.C.C.2d 520 (1992) ( Contracts ), app. pending sub nom. Central States Motor Freight Bureau, Inc. v. ICC, Nos. 92&hyph;1258 et al. (D.C. Cir. argued June 12, 1992; petitioners' motions to dismiss as moot pending). In section 6 of the NRA, Congress adopted the essential requirements of the repealed regulations. Congress' stated objective was ``to limit the potential for unwarranted future undercharge claims.''
