Critics say the rallies, which have been held in the name of the junta's new political front, the Union Solidarity and Development Association [USDA], are being manipulated by the regime to legitimize its control on politics. The report coincides with news that the second biggest rebel army is due in the capital, Rangoon, next month to sign a cease-fire agreement with the military government. Evan Williams says the deal was to end 30 years of insurgency by Kachin fighters in Burma's far north. [Begin Williams recording] Kachin mediators in the state capital say the delegation is due in Rangoon to ratify a cease-fire reached late last year. It is an important psychological victory for the junta on the brink of similar talks with all other major ethnic insurgent groups and it will be held up to a critical world as progress toward peace in Burma. Ethnic groups have been promised a role in drafting the new constitution and some economic and legislative autonomy, but both sides remain armed and critics warn the constitution is already being dominated by the junta's aim to retain power.
