The PvdA opposes this measure and, in turn, is pushing for cutbacks in areas including defense and road construction, which the VVD finds difficult to accept. The VVD regards cutbacks in the WAO [Law on Labor Disability] as unavoidable in order to find sufficient funds for a general reduction in tax levels. [VVD leader] Bolkestein suggested cutting back the level and duration of benefits. "We have gone through the central government budget in detail some three times now, and eventually you exhaust the possible ways of finding money there. That means that great emphasis has to be laid on social security. We are hoping to do that through quantitative measures, but if that is not successful, then we must reach for the ultimate weapon," he said. On Tuesday [14 June], PvdA leader Kok repeated once again that such social security cutbacks were not on the agenda as far as he was concerned. "That is not my preference. And I will fight to the bitter end," he said. But yesterday the negotiators succeeded in reducing their differences about how many extra billion guilders [G] of cuts still have to be found. On Monday, the VVD felt that another G2 or G3 billion should be saved on top of the G7 billion regarded necessary by PvdA leader Kok. But on Tuesday evening, VVD leader Bolkestein said: "If that were to be all, then I would say: That is totally inadequate. But Kok has explained that other elements must be included as well. Once again you can differ as to whether that is hard enough, but with it Kok clearly exceeds the G7 billion." Bolkestein referred to savings on the cost of civil servants as an example. The PvdA and D66 want to wait and see what will be yielded by the far-reaching cutbacks in the WAO, that were decided upon by the current cabinet. Initial calculations are based on a yield of G750 million. The VVD doubts whether that is enough. The liberals are prepared to wait a year to see how the WAO costs evolve, but are now demanding a guarantee from the PvdA and D66 that further cutbacks will not be ruled out. The Central Planning Bureau (CPB) has calculated that the provisional proposals of the "purple" coalition would produce only disappointing job gains. This has also put pressure on the negotiation process between the PvdA, the VVD, and D66. The job gain forecast by the CPB is so small that the negotiators regard the results as improbable. Therefore they have asked the CPB for a more detailed explanation. An example of one of these disappointing forecasts is the plan to allocate employers a fiscal deduction for workers employed on the minimum wage. This could increase employment opportunities for the unskilled. The intended coalition partners would allow the measure to cost G1.8 billion. According to the CPB's calculation models, the financial commitment in this specific wage cost subsidy would produce only 8,000 jobs. This result is all the more disappointing because the G1.8 billion represents nearly half of the G4.1 billion put aside by the three parties to improve employment opportunities for the unskilled. The party specialists had calculated an eventual job gain of 100,000. The CPB also estimated the job gain produced by other proposals would turn out far lower than the parties would like. The CPB would not give a forecast for some components, because the calculation model is not capable of doing so. CPB director Zalm has often called for the policy of imposing collective labor agreements on industrial sectors to be abandoned, on the grounds that this would increase jobs. The same applies to more flexible redundancy rules. However, the CPB has made no estimate of the job gain if the "purple" coalition were to put these proposals into practice. On Tuesday Zalm was not available for comment.
