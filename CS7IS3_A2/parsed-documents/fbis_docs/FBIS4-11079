Tariffs applied on international agriculture and industrial trade will drop, and world agriculture protectionism will also start to decrease. Both aspects are very important for the Argentine economy. A document disseminated by the Foreign Ministry contains a paragraph that has been annulled, but can still be read -- a suggestive fact -- which says: "This negotiation will require the introduction of important changes in current norms, and the adjustment of diverse economic activities." Developed countries will reduce their average tariffs on industrial products by 40 percent and their mean tariff on agriculture products by 36 percent. There will be a drop in internal subsidies and a reduction of subsidized exports. Access to markets will be facilitated through the conversion of all non-tariff obstacles (quotas, variable rates, etc.) into tariffs and the progressive reduction of all tariffs. The signing of the Sanitary and Plant Sanitation Agreement is important for Argentina because the country will now have a forum in which to complain when sanitary measures imposed on its exports are, in fact, non-tariff obstacles (a very frequent case). It is being forecast that as a consequence of these agreements, world incomes will increase by $230 billion and world trade by about $745 billion by 2005. According to the Foreign Ministry analysis, however, more important than the figures is the fact that the climate of trade war and unilateral measures that threatened the economy in the past few years has been overcome. In the area of tariffs, Argentina committed itself not to exceed certain protectionist ceilings. The situation does not change a thing, however, because the tariff system adopted by GATT is 35 percent, a full 10 percentage points above present tariff levels in Argentina and the common external tariff system that is being negotiated in the Mercosur [Common Market of the South]. The document offers some details on the issue of agriculture. It says that the United States offered the country quotas for peanuts, peanut butter, and cheese in exchange for an increase in tariffs on peanuts and by-products. Europe also compensated Argentina for damages caused by European subsidies on oil producing crops. Besides, the country will receive an additional quota of 11,000 tonnes of high quality beef and participation in the quota of 500,000 tonnes of corn for Portugal. Argentina also received substantial tariff concessions from the United States, Japan, and the European Union on grape must, leather, apples, pears, orange juice, and essential and vegetable oils. Argentina will receive another important benefit with the world commitment to reduce budget spending on export subsidies by 36 percent and the actual volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent. These benefits will come after a transitional period. But the greatest benefits will come through the Sanitary and Plant Sanitation Agreement, as it will permit negotiations for the export of products that are today banned from markets such as those of the United States, Japan, and Korea. A condition is the creation of a local information service that will answer all requests for information made by other countries regarding sanitary procedures in effect in our country. The agreement on customs valuation includes a clause that will favor Argentina, as it will allow it to request more information from importers when there are reasons to doubt the declared values are accurate.
