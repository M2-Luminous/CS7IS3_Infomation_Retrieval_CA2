It was approved by Congress, where the Democratic Party held the majority, only for a two-year period, 1989-90, because the then Republican administration was negative about invoking the provision, which calls for sanctions against unfair trade partners. Activation of the 301 provision is planned if negotiations by the U.S. Trade Representative, after it one-sidedly determines unfair trade partners and unfair areas of trade, fail to produce agreements. It is highly possible that the Super 301 provision is against the GATT, which prescribes international trade rules. President Clinton revived this ill-famed provision by issuing an executive order. During his presidential campaign two years ago, Clinton pledged that he would revive the provision. However, we have to say that the decision to enact the provision at this time is nothing but an act to apply pressure on, and to force Japan to, make compromises at the new Japan-U.S. economic talks, which are currently ruptured. The President might have decided to revive the Super 301 while considering U.S. congressional intentions and other matters. However, we cannot understand the bullish manner of threatening trade partners, saying that retaliation will be imposed if you do not compromise. It was a matter of course for the Japanese Government to file a strong protest against this decision. Nevertheless, the Japanese Government should not end this as a mere chorus of criticism against the United States. It seems that the United States does not want to develop this into a trade war. In addition to other measures he took, the President called Prime Minister Hosokawa and explained the circumstances. It is indispensable for the government to remain calm, to do whatever it has to do to improve the situation, while pointing out the unreasonableness of the United States. The government should exert its positive efforts to enrich contents of new market liberalization measures. We believe that it is important for the government to go back to the starting point and review the reasons why the new trade talks started. Discussions on whether or not an introduction of "numerical targets" is right, overshadowed the Japan-U.S. discussions, which have been held since September last year. However, we are certain that Japan pledged the following two points at a meeting held last July between former Prime Minister Miyazawa and President Clinton: 1) that, as a medium-range target, Japan will make a "quite significant reduction of it's trade surplus"; and 2) that Japan will introduce market-opening measures in several fields, including automobiles and auto parts, and to establish "objective criteria to measure outcomes of the market-opening measures. Speaking of reducing the trade surplus, it is viewed as a rough criteria to lower the trade surplus to about 2 percent of Japan's gross domestic product (GDP) in three or four years. The ratio grew to as high as 3.8 percent in the quarter between January and March last year. After that, it dropped to 3 percent during between July and September due to a rapid appreciation of the yen. As a matter of fact, the government, in its economic preview for fiscal 1994, predicted the rate to drop to 2.8 percent. What do we need to do to make this trend of decline take root? It is important to increase imports by stimulating domestic demands. However, we have no choice but to change the Japanese economic structure, which can survive only by exporting far more goods than it imports. We are of the opinion that the Hosokawa cabinet has to change the economic structure while accepting a strong yen, which is a product of the trade surplus, and to map out action plans with clear political intentions. It is worthwhile to study the possibility of launching policies -- such as spelling out future tax reductions to be introduced after next fiscal year, additional measures of the 10-year plan for public investments, and concrete deregulations measures -- which are easy to understand and will be highly assessed by international society. Regarding negotiations in individual fields, it is said that considerable progress has already been made in the fields of government procurement and insurance services. The auto industry has begun to prepare voluntary plans to expand its purchases of [foreign] auto parts. In a news conference after the Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton touched on the objective criteria issue and showed his flexible stance by clearly stating: "We are not asking for something like the Japan-U.S. semiconductor accord." We hope that both countries will show wisdom and put the negotiations back into orbit by making such a remark upon occasion to break the deadlock.
