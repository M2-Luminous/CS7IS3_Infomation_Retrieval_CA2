The consequences of this unprecedented disaster have directly or indirectly impacted on the destinies of entire nations and regions, millions of people, and natural systems, and will be felt for many decades to come in future generations. Therefore from the very inception and up until the present our scientists and specialists and their foreign colleagues have never ceased for a single day their work on analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster and the search for ways to overcome them. In the former USSR, this activity has been carried out by a number of governmental and non-governmental organizations, among which an important part has been played by the Commission of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on Examining the Causes of the Accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant and Evaluating the Actions of Officials in the Post-Accident Period. Working within this Commission has been a Standing Panel of Experts (SPE) including about 200 eminent specialists representing many fields of science and engineering in all three of the republics hardest hit by the disaster: Belarus, Ukraine and Russia. This group of scientists has done tremendous work on gathering, analyzing and generalizing a large body of materials, most of which were scattered throughout agencies and over territories, making access difficult. A lot of new information was also obtained directly at the locality of the events, including at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant itself. Although the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was dissolved in late 1991, the activity of the SPE nevertheless did not stop. SENMURV, a non- governmental international society for restoring the environment and safe habitation of man, has considered offering support to the panel of experts as its civil and moral obligation. Such cooperation proceeds from the logic of creation and activity of SENMURV, as reflected in its charter and name. How to reduce the detrimental impact of irrational human actions, how to protect Man, his health, the health of nations, how to restore our environment--these are the main problems that united scientists and businessmen of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine in the SENMURV International Society. Over the last two decades, especially in the eighties, the scales and depth of consequences of economic and other activity on the territory of Russia and other CIS nations for nature and society have reached the limit beyond which an ecological problem has grown into a problem of national security, survival of a nation in the long-term historical perspective. The global nature of ill-considered human activity in mining, carrying out large-scale power engineering projects, development of industry, transportation and the agroindustrial complex has resulted in an unpredictable ecological situation. Anthropogenic alterations of landscapes, demographic shifts, concentration of ecologically harmful production facilities on limited areas, and disregard for requirements of creating low-waste production facilities have given rise to totally new ecological factors that could lead to irreversible genetic changes in populations and communities. Besides the continual poisoning of nature and people with wastes of harmful substances of existing enterprises, the presence of a large number of burial sites of radioactive and chemical wastes, threatening gradual exhaustion of the ecological potential and gene pool of Russia, there has been an increase in the risk of technogenic disasters. Damage due to industrial accidents alone averages 1.2-1.5 percent of the GNP, and in the most severe accidents like the one at Chernobyl, it exceeds the given figures by nearly an order of magnitude. Last but not least, as a result of such extraordinary situations, and also because ecological requirements are not met in handling radioactive (and other toxic) wastes and the acquisition of uranium deposits, Russia and other CIS nations are now faced with just about the worst radioecological scenario in the world. Based on the urgency of its tasks, as well as on the professional orientation of its specialists, the SENMURV International Society is concentrating its activity on restoring the environment and safe habitation of man, combining international efforts of businessmen and scientists representing various fields of knowledge: biotechnology, physical chemistry, biology, biophysics, medicine, mathematics and systems analysis. Such an interdisciplinary approach is a guarantee of rapid advancement in problems of ecology, revealing new ways of solving them, and especially the Chernobyl problem. Within the framework of the SENMURV International Society, the aforementioned panel of experts has been transformed to a Joint Expert Committee (JEC), which can be treated as its successor. This committee has continued work on preparation of its chief document: the expert conclusion that is being presented in this publication. The expert conclusion consists of four volumes: Part 1. ``Direct Causes of Accident at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Plant. Radiation Monitoring. Protective Measures and Their Effectiveness.'' Part 2. ``Medical-Biological and Genetic Consequences of the Chernobyl Disaster.'' Part 3. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant for the Republic of Belarus.'' Part 4. ``Consequences of the Disaster at Chernobyl Nuclear Electric Power Plant for Ukraine and Russia.'' The following expert coordinators guided the team of authors in preparation of this expert conclusion: V. B. Nesterenko--professor, associate member of Belarus Academy of Sciences. Ye. B. Burlakova--professor, Chairwoman of Council on Radiobiology of Russian Academy of Sciences. Ye. A. Yakovlev--Academician of Ukrainian Ecological Academy of Sciences. V. A. Shevchenko--professor. N. A. Tsepalova--candidate of chemical sciences. D. S. Firsova--journalist, laureate of Lenin and State prizes of the USSR. A. G. Nazarov--professor, associate member of Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. B. N. Profiryev--professor, associate member of Russian Academy of Natural Sciences. D. P. Osanov--professor. G. S. Sakulin--professor. L. N. Shadrin--professor. While not all parts of this expert conclusion are of equal significance, all experts have endeavored to be maximally objective in analyzing events and documents, as well as in offering differing viewpoints. This has been aided by giving each expert creative freedom, the opportunity of setting up creative teams and formulating conclusions without hindrance. Considerable assistance was provided to the panel of experts on the first stage of its work by the ``Chernobyl-Pomoshch'' Non-Governmental International Humanitarian Organization. If this expert conclusion will attract the attention not just of specialists, economists and politicians, but simply the people living on contaminated territories and the public at large, we will feel that our labor has made its contribution to analysis of the causes and consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. We hope that the number of supporters of those who have devoted their activity and are giving their efforts and energy to restoring our environment will increase, and then the concepts of ``Man. Earth. Universe'' will become indivisible and everlasting. That man might live forever and dwell on a blossoming, beautiful earth, unique and inimitable in the universe.
