The nearly 100 trade union members also decided at a meeting in the afternoon that next Thursday they will protest against the dismissals which have been announced with a demonstration at the radio. The Independent Trade Union of Radio Employees also protested against the fact that the radio leadership, obviously for political reasons, has launched disciplinary procedure against Laszlo Gyori, chairman of the trade union and of the strike committee, and Peter Borenics, chairman of the Council of Public Employees. The Independent Trade Union of Radio Employees has confirmed its previous stance that the illegal measures of the radio bosses harm the listeners most of all, because such moves endanger objective information and the implementation of the radio's public service tasks.
