FR940822-1-00026 FR940822-1-00006 As noted in item 5, the EPA and NRC are working together closely in this rulemaking. Upon completion, the EPA will determine through a formal notice and comment rulemaking whether the NRC's rule provides adequate protection for public health and the environment. This should minimize the risk that in the future the EPA would require additional cleanup of a site which has been decommissioned in accordance with the criteria in this rule. 7. Community Involvement Comment. Many commenters recommended that the rulemaking should provide for and ensure local citizen group participation in overseeing the decommissioning of contaminated sites and the enforcement of requirements. Also, the role of tribal authorities should be addressed. Some commenters stated that the NRC should ensure citizen participation in decommissioning from the earliest stage of cleanup. Response. The NRC staff believes it is important for the public to not only be fully informed of the decommissioning actions at a particular site but also to be able to effectively participate in site decommissioning decisions. The proposed rule provides specific mechanisms for public participation in the decommissioning process, where participation is important to ensuring that the public is adequately informed about proposed decommissioning activities or that the public and environment are adequately protected in conjunction with reliance on institutional controls to restrict site access after license termination. These activities are in addition to whatever hearing opportunities are provided for a particular category of site by the Commission's existing requirements. Upon the receipt of a decommissioning plan from the licensee, or a proposal by the licensee for restricted release of a site, or whenever the Commission deems such a notice to be in the public interest, the Commission will: (1) Notify local and State governments in the vicinity of the site and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected by the decommissioning; (2) Publish a notice in the Federal Register as well as in other media, such as local newspapers, which are readily accessible to individuals in the vicinity of the site; and (3) Solicit public comment on the proposed decommissioning action. For decommissioning actions where the licensee proposes to request license termination with land use restrictions, the licensee will be required to convene a Site Specific Advisory Board (SSAB) for the purpose of obtaining advice from affected parties regarding the proposed decommissioning. The SSAB will function at the planning stages of decommissioning, at the time the licensee is developing the decommissioning plan for the facility. The purpose of the SSAB is to provide recommendations to the licensee on: (1) Whether there are ways to reduce residual radioactivity to the levels that will permit release for unrestricted use which are technically achievable, will not be prohibitively expensive, and will not result in net public or environmental harm; (2) Whether provisions for institutional controls proposed by the licensee will: (a) Provide reasonable assurance that the TEDE from residual radioactivity distinguishable from background to the average member of the Critical Group will not exceed 15 mrem (0.15 mSv) TEDE per year, (b) Be enforceable, (c) Impose undue burdens on the local community or other affected parties; and (3) Whether the licensee has provided sufficient financial assurance to enable an independent third party to assume and carry out responsibilities for any necessary control and maintenance of the site. The licensee will be responsible for establishing the SSAB and developing appropriate ground rules and operating procedures with the SSAB's advice. SSAB membership, to the extent that representatives are willing to participate, will have to: (1) Reflect the full range of interests in the affected community and region and be composed of individuals who could be directly affected by residual radioactivity at the decommissioned site, and (2) Include representatives from the licensee; local and State governments; workers; persons residing in the vicinity of the site; citizen, environmental, environmental justice, and other public interest groups; and Indian Nation or other indigenous people that have treaty or statutory rights that could be affected. SSAB meetings will be open to the public. The licensee will be required to provide adequate public notice of the location, time, date, and agenda for the meetings at least two weeks in advance of each meeting. All records generated or reviewed by the SSAB will become part of the decommissioning docket and be available for public inspection. 8. Stability and Flexibility Comment. Several commenters stated that NRC decommissioning standards are needed to facilitate long-term planning by the nuclear industry and to provide stability against constantly changing criteria over the years. Some commenters stated that even generic standards may not be completely stable because they will need to be changed as a result of newly perceived health effects and improvements in technology. Many commenters indicated that the rule must be flexible enough to accommodate site differences, e.g., types of radionuclides present, the geology and environmental surroundings, individuals who may be exposed, and possible exposure patterns. Most commenters favored a generic standard over site-specific standards. While supporting the establishment of a generic standard, some urged the NRC to permit site-specific considerations and site-specific modeling for licensees to demonstrate compliance and to ensure participation by local communities. One commenter stated it would be a mistake to use a generic ALARA evaluation for all sites. Several commenters recommended site-specific ALARA assessments. Some commenters, particularly in the GEIS scoping meetings, suggested that the rule only provide the process for establishing site-specific criteria. Response. The staff agrees that there is a need for consistent and stable radiological criteria for the decommissioning of licensed nuclear facilities throughout the United States. Therefore, this rulemaking would establish a single set of radiological criteria that would apply to the decommissioning of all sites. However, the staff also recognizes the need for flexibility in applying these criteria because of constraints posed by site specific conditions (e.g. geology, hydrology, meteorology, and radiation background levels) and to provide opportunity for meaningful participation by local communities in individual decommissioning actions. Therefore, the rule proposed by the staff provides for site-specific implementation of the generic criteria. The Commission would also publish regulatory guidance along with the rule that describes methods for site-specific implementation of the criteria. This guidance includes conduct of site characterization and surveys, specific radionuclide concentration and surface activities that would be considered by the NRC staff to meet the decommissioning limit, and modeling acceptable to the NRC staff to develop more site-specific values of concentration or surface activity based upon the factors unique to the activity being decommissioned. In this regard, the NRC is working with the EPA and the DOE to develop a Federal Government manual for the conduct of surveys to determine compliance with decommissioning criteria. When completed, this effort will assist in the consistent treatment of all sites requiring remediation. The NRC staff believes that generic criteria should be established for decommissioning and that codifying radiological criteria for decommissioning in the regulations would: (1) Allow the NRC to more effectively assure protection of public health and the environment at decommissioned sites; (2) Result in more efficient use of NRC and licensee resources; (3) Lead to more consistent and uniform application across all types of licenses; (4) Provide a more stable basis for decommissioning planning; and (5) Eliminate protracted delays in decommissioning that result as licensees wait for generic regulatory criteria before proceeding with decommissioning of their facilities. The NRC does not favor the option suggested of providing a process based rule whereby the criteria codified would only be for the process to be used in establishing site-specific radiological criteria. This approach would be essentially the same as the option of remaining with the current status quo. In general, a site-specific approach can lead to considerable delays and increased uncertainty on the part of all parties associated with the decommissioning. Further, this approach would be inappropriate and burdensome for the large number of licensees using sealed sources or radionuclides with relatively short half-lives. 9. ALARA Considerations Comment. Under the ALARA concept, decommissioning activities are continued beyond meeting applicable risk/dose limits in efforts to reduce radiation exposures As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). Most commenters recommended that the NRC's radiological criteria should incorporate this principle. Several commenters stated that State and local governments should be involved in ALARA determinations. However, other commenters expressed distrust of the licensees' and regulatory agencies' application of the ALARA process because it involves financial tradeoffs and licensees are motivated to maximize their profits. Response. The proposed rule requires application of the ALARA concept, provided that potential doses are constrained within limiting doses under a range of conditions. NRC anticipates that many licensees, particularly sealed source users or those who use relatively short-lived radioactive materials, will be able to satisfy the ALARA criteria with an analysis of projected dose levels. In these cases, extensive additional documentation to support an ALARA determination would not be required. State and local governments and other affected parties will be involved in ALARA determinations through opportunities to comment on decommissioning proposals and participation on the Site-Specific Advisory Board in those cases where the licensee is seeking license termination under restricted conditions. This level of involvement provides for transparent application of the ALARA considerations and safeguards against excessive licensee attention to cutting costs to maintain profit margins. Comment. Many commenters stated that for the most effective use of resources and fairness, the NRC must consider in the risk-benefit balance not only radiological risks to workers and the public but, also, non-radiological risks and indirect risks associated with the regulation of decommissioning activities.
