After reviewing and ratifying the minutes of the previous session, the House conducted a lengthy and responsible discussion of conditions in our country. The House issued the following statements: Thanks be to God, whose blessing we beseech in calamity, and who says in the Holy Koran: All believers are brothers; and who also says: There is the type of man whose speech about this world's life may dazzle thee, and he calls God to witness about what is in his heart; yet he is the most contentious of enemies. When he turns his back his aim everywhere is to spread mischief throughout the Earth and destroy crops and cattle, but God loveth not mischief. [Koranic verse] In its Wednesday, 11 May 1994 session, the House of Representatives discussed the ugly crime committed by Socialist Party outlaws who used long-range missiles to strike civilian targets, murdering and terrorizing women, children, the elderly, and the disabled who were asleep in their homes. These missiles, paid for with the food and sweat of our people, struck them and tore apart their bodies. They had committed no crime, except for their love of unity and their support of Constitutional legitimacy and political pluralism, yet they were murdered. In the light of this, the House decided the following: 1. To strongly condemn this crime committed by Socialist Party outlaws and to hold the perpetrators completely responsibile. The crime reveals the extent of the hatred harbored by these criminals and the scope of their terrorist acts against the Yemeni people. They want to achieve their selfish interests by killing the innocent and destroying the people's structures and achievements in unity, democracy, and peace. 2. The House considers these crimes to violate Islamic values and teachings, as well as international and humanitarian norms that forbid the murder of the elderly, women, children, and the disabled. These savage acts are ugly war crimes and high treason directed against God and the homeland. Its perpetrators deserve the severest punishment. 3. The House urges all members and segments of society, its political forces and its popular organizations to denounce and condemn these ugly crimes and to defend unity, democracy, pluralism, and Constitutional legitimacy, which guarantee the security and stability of Yemen and its people. The House urges the Arab, Muslim, and world public opinion and all international organizations and honorable forces concerned with the defense of human rights to denounce and condemn these crimes. 4. The executive power must take all necessary legal and Constitutional steps to deter these murderers and bring them to justice and to apply the necessary legal, and deterrent punishment against them. 5. The House urges the government to take the steps necessary to provide full care for the families of the victims of the Scud missiles and to consider these victims martyrs of unity, democracy, and legitimacy. The House stresses that Yemen and its unity, which was built by the blood and sweat of its people, is invulnerable to enemies and will remain an illuminating torch protecting national, pan-Arab, and Islamic security. It stresses that victory will, God willing, be for unity and unionists. The House urges unionists in the Socialist Party, both the civilian and military, to support Constitutional legitimacy and reject these criminal acts. The mercy of God be upon our pure martyr. God spare our country any evil. From God we seek support. The Republic of Yemen's House of Representatives noted the responsible and sincere positions taken by some Arab parliaments that support Yemeni unity, which was achieved thanks to God almighty and the Yemeni people's long struggle, and which is considered a candle lighting the path of Arab and Muslim unity. The House highly praises the position of the House of Representatives in fraternal Jordan, as well as the other Arab parliaments, and the sincere statements they issued in support of Yemeni unity and Constitutional legitimacy, which the advocates of apostasy and secession in the Socialist Party's leadership tried to violate in an attempt to push the country into the furnace of a destructive and all-out war on all levels. Since the start of the crisis fabricated by that gang, who are violating Constitutional legitimacy, the House has been stressing the need to preserve the achievements of unity and democracy in Yemen. It considers them achievements of the Arab and Muslim nations. The House, therefore, urges Arab parliaments and regional and international organizations to denounce and condemn the use by the secessionist gang of the Socialist Party of weapons of mass destruction against civilians in certain Yemeni cities, including the capital of Yemeni unity, Sanaa, and Ta'izz and al-Hudaydah. The House appeals to fraternal and friendly parliaments and regional and international organizations to motivate their governments and media to adjust the way they view the events in the Yemeni arena. This must be seen as an internal affair between Constitutional legitimacy and the rebellious gang, and not a war between north and south, as some people, intentionally or unintentionally, are saying. We beseech God to protect our country from any evil and protect all of our Arab and Muslim countries from any harm. We beseech him to grant peace and stability to the entire world. From God we seek success.
