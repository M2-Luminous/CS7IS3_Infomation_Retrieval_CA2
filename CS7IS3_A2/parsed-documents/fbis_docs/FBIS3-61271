The talk about Russian fascism is undoubtedly topical. But it should at the same time be grasped that the cancerous tumor of fascism can no longer, in my view, be surgically removed. It seems to me that Yeltsin gave the opposition carte-blanche in that... he smashed it. Everyone understands that there has been no real crushing defeat. But the confrontation has turned into some new, very dangerous channel. Let us look at the situation from the viewpoint of political metaphysics. If something is uttered and put on screen by the mass media, it actually exists, consequently. DEN actually exists. It expresses some innermost social intention, not yet realized but already identified. This is why DEN continues to appear under a different name. Combating the red-browns with the aid of a curfew is utter nonsense (I'm afraid that the curfew itself could become red-brown.) To ideology we need to counterpose ideology. An adequate measure of talent. A counter-Dugin, counter-Prokhanov, counter-Kurginyan is needed. This is very serious--historical victory is measured always not by social support but the measure of talent. They have already become fashionable. DEN's jokes are already being retold in the smoking-rooms. This is what is most frightening, for the main function of fashion is reproduction. It is possible, for that matter, that the most odious variety of fascism, this entire red-brown theater treading mainly the Moscow boards, has, truly, ceased to exist. It is possible that it can be banned even. But what of this? In 1923 Hitler staged a "beer-hall putsch" and came to power 10 years later. We must reconsider the highly prevalent view of the genesis of fascism, according to which fascism is some byproduct of political modernization, a marginal stratum inevitable at a time of major historical reforms. In actual fact, fascism is the result not of a "transitional period" but of national revanche. The most difficult time for Germany were the 1920's--peak inflation, peak unemployment. Political marginals in the form of the Hitler party and two dozen such organizations emerged. But at this time Hitler remained on the fringe of politics. He came to power only in 1933, when Germany had entered a period of economic upturn and national revanche. Hitler knew how to harness the vector of this revanche and conclude an alliance with Germany's financial and industrial elite, and only for this reason was he successful. Russian fascism may come to power only as Russian revanchism, that is, as a phenomenon more complex than what we have thus far. It is essential to recognize that what happened was not simply the defeat of communism but the national defeat of Russia, a most powerful geopolitical collapse and a loss of the character of political subject bordering on national nonexistence. I am a conservative in this respect and think in traditional categories, we will never remove the geopolitical component. It is necessary, therefore, to prepare for the worst--a Russian conservative revolution. A conservative revolution is not in itself tantamount to fascism but something similar inevitably awaits us. National collapse is the dreadful prologue to a Russian Reich. The spring is coiled to the maximum, just a little more, and it will begin to unwind with terrifying force, sweeping aside all in its path. Russian fascism may come to power only by having imbibed new energies: liberal, oligarchic, criminal. It is at the intersections between Russian liberalism, Russian fundamentalism, and the Russian criminal world that the outline of the future Russian Reich will emerge. Of course, this will be an entirely different generation of fascists, new leaders and a new ideology. It is not Prokhanov, who has condemned himself to small-time opposition theatrics, who will be the winner. The winner will be Kurginyan. Prokhanov fought modernization to the bitter end and was swept aside by it, simply having failed to understand its entire historical inevitability. Kurginyan, on the other hand, will join the ranks of this modernization, harness it and channel it in the right direction. Kurginyan is the man who knows how to conclude an alliance with Russia's financial and industrial elite, as Hitler did on the eve of his accession to power. Strictly speaking, it is not a question of Hitler at all but of Krupp. As long as the red-browns are smashing shop windows, they are not dangerous. They will become dangerous when Mr. Borovoy or Mr. Khizha concludes a deal with them. You think this is not possible? Look at Zhirinovskiy, look at Dmitriy Vasilyev--they have already become integrated in Yeltsinism. They are being viewed askance as yet, but sooner or later our entrepreneurs, our Krupp, will have need of patriotism. The most important techniques today are ideological techniques. The Kurginyan center is producing just such techniques. It is now important to launch a preventive ideological strike against the Russian Reich and to create a conceptual SDI around it. Otherwise yet another red wheel awaits us....
