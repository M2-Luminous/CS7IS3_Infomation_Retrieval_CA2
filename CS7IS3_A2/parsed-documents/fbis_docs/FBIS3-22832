That was not the first meeting of its kind. Iranian Minister of Intelligence and Security 'Ali Fallahian-Khuzestani had visited Germany three months before. This investigative report by AL-WATAN AL-'ARABI looks at what went on in secret contacts between Tehran and Tel Aviv and how they touched on Iran's nuclear program, Israeli soldiers missing in Lebanon, and the peace process, as well as charges likely to be brought against Iran in court cases in Germany, France, and Switzerland. Investigations into the assassination of Iranian opposition figures in Europe have, for the first time, turned up clues pointing to a direct involvement by top Iranian officials in international terror. This carries the potential of Iran facing an international siege, and possibly a military strike, plus a stifling isolation that has increased following the Clinton-al-Asad summit. The ayatollahs have, as a consequence, gone on full alert and used their Israeli cards to save the regime. Does the new Iranian carrot and stick drive signify a true desire for openness or is it just a blackmailing effort? On 7 November, 1993, Iran's Intelligence and Security Minister Fallahian arrived in Bonn leading a delegation on a top secret visit. Hours after his arrival, he began contacts with top German security officers under Brandt Schmidt Paur [name as published], Helmut Kohl's security adviser. Concurrently, only a few steps away from the conference room, Israeli Government officials and Mosad officers were impatiently awaiting the outcome of the secret German-Iranian session, before they themselves held an even more discreet session with Fallahian and his aides. The Iranian intelligence team's visit to Germany was designed not only to step up security cooperation between Iran and Germany: Already, their cooperation in this area was at an advanced stage. German experts had been to Tehran to oversee the training of Iranian personnel in the latest intelligence techniques. According to the German news magazine DER SPIEGEL, the German Intelligence services presented its Iranian counterpart with sensitive and sophisticated spying equipment. This time the subject of the secret talks had an Israeli connection. Fallahian came to Bonn for negotiations with Israel under German auspices with the advance knowledge and blessing of Iran's President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani and the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The aim was for Iran to help Israel get a satisfactory resolution for the issue of seven Israeli soldiers who went missing in Lebanon, including Ron Arad. The Germans are still puzzled over why Tehran disclosed the presence of Fallahian in Germany, despite its request that the news of the visit be kept a secret. [passage omitted] Israeli relations with the Iranian "Islamic revolution" have never been as hostile as Iran depicts them. Everybody remembers the role played by the Israelis in the Irangate affair and their contribution to Israeli arms sales to Iran. A report by the U.S. judicial authorities has recently revealed important information about the role of Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres in concluding these deals between 1985 and 1986 to secure the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. After that, the Israelis have maintained close, secret ties with the Iranians, especially via David Kimche [former Israeli Foreign Ministry director general]. The Jewish community in Iran, especially those people who occupy important posts in the bazaar and in the trade firms, also contributed to these contacts. Information confirms that Tehran chose to hold secret negotiations with the Israelis, just like al-Qadhdhafi sent Libyan pilgrims to Jerusalem and opened up to the Jewish lobby to persuade the Americans to stop hounding him by using the Lockerbie affair. Iran, however, knows how important the missing Israeli soldiers are to Israel. It is also aware of the importance of the Israeli key in Washington and the West. Thus, it sought to come out of these secret negotiations with as much as possible. Iran asked for a very high price. It wanted to exchange the missing soldiers for Israeli mediation with Germany to resume the building of the Bushahr nuclear reactor. The German company Seimens had started building the reactor in the days of the shah. After some discussions, Israel convinced Germany to accept a compromise: The Czech company Skoda Belsin [name as published], whose shares are mostly owned by Siemens, will provide Iran with sophisticated technology. Israel put pressure on Czech authorities to accept this, especially since this country, which needs money, will receive millions of dollars from this project. The Israelis, indeed, organized a trip to Iran by the director of the Skoda Lobomer Sodik [name as published] between 23 November and 3 December 1993. He met with Rida Amir al- Lahi [name as published], the top official supervising the Iranian nuclear program. Observers have recently noticed that Israel has toned down its anti-Iran rhetoric and is no longer warning Europe of the nuclear danger and of Iranian missiles that can hit Tel Aviv. Moreover, General Uri Sagoy [name as published], chief of the Israeli Military Intelligence, a few days ago belittled the dangers to Israel of the missiles manufactured by Iran. Sagoy strongly criticized the assertions of his counterpart in the Israeli Air Force, who affirmed that a year from now, Iran will have the North Korean Nodong missiles, which can reach Israel. No doubt, the chief of the Military Intelligence was fully aware of the secret negotiations held a few days prior to his statement in an Eastern European capital between officials from Israeli intelligence and Iranian intelligence.
