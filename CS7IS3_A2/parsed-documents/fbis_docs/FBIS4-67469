Rimnet, the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network, can identify raised levels of nuclear fall-out, enabling UK-based emergency services to spring into action. Environment Minister Robert Atkins told a London news conference: "Any significant increase in radiation levels detected by the monitors will raise an alert on the Rimnet system and trigger alarms in continuously manned offices at my department." "If Rimnet had been operating at the time of the Chernobyl accident, it would have indicated clearly where levels of radioactivity in the UK rose above normal background variations." The system, which has monitoring stations across the country, can track radiation clouds by using sophisticated data and mapping equipment, while Government departments could alert water companies, local authorities and firms in the event of an accident. The system will record measurements of radioactivity levels in air, water, food and people and store them on a database.
