A CS information agency correspondent has been told by Deputy Security Minister Avtandil Ioseliani that a report broadcast in an Alioni TV program alleging that quadripartite talks in Sochi have failed does not correspond to the facts. A meeting of the quadripartite commission on Abkhazia took place in Sochi on 29 and 30 May. The meeting had to create a foundation for the return of forcefully displaced people to Abkhazia. During the meeting, the Abkhaz side demanded that a paragraph be included in an application form according to which Georgian refugees would promise to abide by Abkhazian laws. The Georgian and Russian parties at the meeting unequivocally rejected the demand because it was absurd to have a formulation like this before an Abkhazian status had been established. The meeting discussed an issue of registering refugees and possibilities of information exchange in this connection. A joint statement has been adopted. According to Mr. Avtandil Ioseliani, the next meeting of the quadripartite commission is to be held in Sochi on 20-21 June.
