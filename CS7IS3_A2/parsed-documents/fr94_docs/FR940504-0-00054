FR940504-0-00054 FR940504-0-00014 From Humbug Mountain to Horse Mountain, the recreational fishery will open May 1 for all salmon except coho and continue through June 30 or attainment of the 10,300 chinook quota, whichever occurs first, with a two-fish daily bag limit. This area will reopen on August 27 for all salmon except coho and continue through August 31 or attainment of the 500 chinook quota, whichever occurs first, with a two-fish daily bag limit; the mouth of the Klamath River is closed. This area will reopen September 1 through September 5, with no chinook quota and a two-fish daily bag limit. From Cape Falcon to Humbug Mountain, the recreational fishery will open May 1 through June 5 for all salmon except coho, with a daily bag limit of two fish, no more than two fish in 7 consecutive days, no more than 10 fish per year, and the open area restricted to within the 27-fathom curve (49.4 m). This fishery will reopen only between Twin Rocks and Pyramid Rock, OR, on June 6 through June 19; this fishery is entirely in State waters so regulations to manage the fishery will be implemented by the State of Oregon. North of Cape Falcon Due to the projected record low returns for Washington coastal coho, Puget Sound natural and hatchery coho stocks, and Oregon coastal and Columbia River coho, unprecedented action is being taken to close the non-treaty commercial troll and recreational ocean fisheries north of Cape Falcon in 1994. All Washington coastal and Puget Sound natural coho stocks are expected to be less abundant than forecast in 1993. Numbers of coho entering freshwater are either below spawner escapement goals (Queets, Grays Harbor, Skagit, Stillaguamish, and Hood Canal natural coho) or at the lower end of the spawner escapement goal range (Quillayute Falls and Hoh natural coho). These low expected abundances are the result of low flows in 1992, poor marine survival associated with anomalous ocean conditions, and long-term habitat degradation. Abundance forecasts for Washington coastal and Puget Sound hatchery production are also well below 1993 expectations. Even in the absence of ocean salmon fisheries north of Cape Falcon, the Council wanted to ensure that the impacts on Snake River spring/summer and fall chinook stocks, which are listed as threatened species under the ESA, did not exceed recent years' levels of impacts. For Snake River wild spring chinook, the available information indicates that it is highly unlikely these fish are impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild summer chinook, these fish comprise only a very small proportion of total chinook abundance in the Council management area, and it is unlikely these fish are significantly impacted in Council-area fisheries. For Snake River wild fall chinook that are caught in Council-area fisheries, the STT estimated significant reductions in the ocean exploitation rate under the Council's recommended 1994 ocean measures compared to the 1986&hyph;1990 average by using the Lyons Ferry Hatchery stock to represent Snake River wild fall chinook. These reductions in the ocean exploitation rate total over 90 percent for north of Cape Falcon and 80 percent for combined north and south of Cape Falcon. Treaty Indian Fisheries Ocean salmon management measures proposed by the treaty Indian Tribes are part of a comprehensive package of Indian and non-Indian salmon fisheries in the ocean and inside waters agreed to by the various parties. Treaty troll seasons, minimum length restrictions, and gear restrictions were developed by the Tribes and agreed to by the Council. The treaty Indian Tribes of the Washington coast agreed to a minimal chinook quota, with no directed coho fisheries. Recognition was made of the special right of the treaty Indian Tribes to fish in their usual and accustomed areas and the limitation of their location-dependent fisheries. In 1994, treaty Indian troll fisheries north of Cape Falcon are governed by a quota of 16,400 chinook, with no retention of coho. The all-except-coho seasons will open May 1 and extend through June 30, if the chinook quota is not reached. The minimum length restrictions for all treaty ocean fisheries, excluding ceremonial and subsistence harvest, is 24 in. (61 cm) for chinook.
