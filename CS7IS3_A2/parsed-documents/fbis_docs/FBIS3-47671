The proposal was contained in a report submitted to a policy-adjustment panel of the ruling parties by the project team on real estate and housing, the officials said. The report proposes easing taxes on real estate dealings and on real estate held for use for public projects, they said. It also calls for promotion of real estate purchases by government agencies for housing projects and an increase of funds for housing loans by the government-financed Housing Loan Corp., the officials said. Relaxation of restrictions on housing construction are also proposed, they said. The policy-adjustment panel will take into account the proposals in working out a program for tax system reforms for fiscal 1994, they said.
