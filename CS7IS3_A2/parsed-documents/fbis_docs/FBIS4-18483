The company expects production costs in Russia to be between 30 and 40 percent lower than Western levels. The implications of this decision are enormous. An important multinational has pronounced its confidence in the ailing Russian economy and above all in the still unhealthy investment climate. Many others will follow. The Eindhoven-based electronics concern is emphasizing what the Netherlands business world did not finish discussing during (Minister of Economic Affairs) Andriessen's "Global Plan" two weeks ago: That the Netherlands will have to get used to the fact that, partly due to the elimination of the Iron Curtain, some industrial activities can no longer be maintained here. The wages are too high because it is impossible to compete with a few guilders per hour in East Europe. As low-wage countries like Russia develop legal structures offering entrepreneurs sufficient guarantees, then there will be a greater desire to invest. This shift will have major consequences for employment in the West. In the short term, it means that the standard of living here will have to be sacrificed in part, in order to allow such welfare to exist in countries like Russia, for example. That hurts. But in the long term, it is a good development. Not aid but trade, because this is the only way a new macroeconomic division of labor and new equilibrium can arise. In this way, East Europe and Russia will be given the opportunity to create healthy, prosperous economies. And Western business will benefit from that, too.
