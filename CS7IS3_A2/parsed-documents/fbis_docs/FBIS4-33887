The king received Chilean President Eduardo Frei, Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle, and Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres. King Juan Carlos was interested in the situation in Chile and Costa Rica and in Central America. He said he regretted having to delay until next year his official visit to Uruguay, a country which has begun the electoral process. Gonzalez held meetings with the presidents of Colombia, Uruguay, and Honduras. The summit agenda was discussed during these meetings, but so was the situation in Cuba.

The Uruguayan president confirmed to Gonzalez that his government would continue to collaborate in the fight against terrorism, restricted only by respect for judicial decisions. Gonzalez also spoke about cooperation with the three Latin American leaders. In the specific case of Colombia, the Spanish prime minister offered to continue aid to the areas devastated by the floods in Cauca and Huila, which will be visited at the end of the summit by Jose Luis Dicenta, secretary of state for international cooperation and Latin America, who is responsible for drawing up a Spanish aid plan for southwest Colombia.
