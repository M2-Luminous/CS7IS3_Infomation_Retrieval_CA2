The reasons for this do not at all lie in the area of "enemy encirclement" or "Russian policy," but only in the fact that long term thinking is in general not characteristic of the "party of the government"--the principle of "the day before yesterday" is continuing is victorious existence. On the anniversary of independence, many democratic politicians indicated only one unconditional achievement of Kravchuk's foreign policy--Ukraine is recognized by 140 states. In the most serious analysis even this service seems quite dubious, in as much as we owe recognitions first of all to the pressure of the diasporas which are influential in Canada and Australia, to which were added pro-Ukrainian inclined circles in other states. The reason for the failure of the foreign policy of Ukraine is the fact that it came after events, since the classic position of the bureaucracy always won: do not do anything without instructions from above, because any initiative could be punished. The orientation of Ukraine toward cooperation with Iran and Slovakia, which do not enjoy the reputations of democracies in the world, and with China ("This state is a priority economic partner for Ukraine"--Ivan Plyushch), where dissidents are still suppressed, leads one to think about the desire of the nomenklatura to unite with those similar to it. It is hard to say whether the shooting of students in Tienanmen Square is an example for anyone from the "party of the government." Those who are responsible for Ukrainian foreign policy can be understood when they say that there are quite a few objective reasons for the failures. Ukrainian nuclear armament became a thorn in the paw of Ukrainian diplomacy. The entire policy of the West toward Ukraine focused on it. Russia, having survived the brief shock after the separation of Ukraine from "forever together," was able to triple its efforts on the diplomatic front, and to reach the point that in the West the nuclear Ukraine came to be seen as dangerous. The embassies of Russia, which have in individual states staffs of up to 1,000, not counting the employees of Aeroflot, naval representatives, and the offices of trading organizations, easily won the struggle for influence with the few Ukrainian ambassadors, many of whom, moreover, did not have experience gained by years of diplomatic work. It is not necessary to accept the position of the West, but it is worthwhile understanding it. Despite everything, bipolarity made possible life in a relatively stable world, where professionals opposed professionals, and intelligence agencies, "hot lines," and reciprocal plans for military action, functioned. In a world in which there are few nuclear countries, the risk of nuclear conflict was lessened, and this means that the likelihood of world war decreased. This simple and logical thesis directs all movements of the West which to some seem chaotic. However, the objective reasons which cause the difficulties of Ukrainian foreign policy, do not justify the serious mistakes of the Ukrainian leadership. The answer to the question of what could be an effective foreign policy for Ukraine, has to be sought not in the sphere of any sorts of "geopolitical interests," which sometimes take on a distorted form of "Ukrainian messianism" and a "special path" for Ukraine, but in the sphere of internal policy. The fact that the office of the President on questions of foreign policy presents the positions of western countries toward Ukraine as indifferentiatedly hostile, comes from the same concept of the policy of the nomenklatura as does the credit and financial regulation of prices. The humanitarian aid of Germany and the USA is "forgotten;" everything is forgotten which does not fit into the nomenklatura's concept of "Ukraine and a hostile world." The influence of Russia on the formulation of the policy of the West is exaggerated to the maximum, up to the point that the myth has been created about coordinated pressure of the USA and the Russian Federation in the matter of Ukrainian nuclear arms. By all this, together with other "arguments," the nomenklatura has one goal: to prove that the Ukrainian people must tighten its belt and... suffer. The nomenklatura is also still playing the card of the Ukrainian diaspora, which from idealistic considerations is paying for embassies, very often without getting any financial accountings about what its money is being spent on. These people sincerely believe that they are helping the first popularly elected President to build the state. However, in the diaspora circles, which eagerly receive guests from Ukraine and before which is chanted without logic, "Our President is our chief," they are also beginning to understand: help for the nomenklatura is not the best use of the money which they have earned by their labors. In the West, another type of sympathizers for Ukraine has appeared; those who, when independence was won, got positions in the Ministries of Defense, Trade, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence, and in embassies. The question of the independence of Ukraine is for them a question of protecting their jobs. The problem of Ukraine's nuclear capacity would automatically be pushed to the back burner if the Ukrainian government began a policy of economic reforms. The introduction of reforms would permit us to attract the funds of western investors for participation in the development of effective production; and then immediately the corresponding lobbies would be formed in western governments. It would require a change of state policy toward Ukraine just from mercantile considerations, in order to protect their own money. The question of political stabilization in Ukraine could be solved immediately by several paths. Among these are both the election of new structures of government on democratic principles, and the establishment of a dictatorship as a result of a civil war or disorders. In the second case, the government, most probably, would remain in the hands of the same leading structures and persons, as can be found at the helm today. In the eyes of the West, they have shown their bankruptcy as leaders, having passed in the Supreme Council an undemocratic law on elections, despite all the warnings of many western experts and the proposal of the Council of Europe. Carrying out democratic elections in Ukraine at least will show the West who really expresses the will of the people, and will open, as is shown there, the way to economic reform. As they evaluate the process of election of a new parliament, much will depend on the international position toward Ukraine and the possibility of further integration into the world community. Beyond this, as we choose our future in March, the whole world will see that it has become much smaller since the fall of the iron curtain.
