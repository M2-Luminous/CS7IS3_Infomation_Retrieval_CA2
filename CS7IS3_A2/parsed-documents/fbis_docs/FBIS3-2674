He told reporters that only those who do not know politics would think that Bosnian Serbs will accept the federation. Karadzic insists on an independent Serbian country, established in Bosnia or an allied country, and made up of Bosnian Serbs and other Serbs. He added that during World War II the Croat-Muslim federation, under the protection of Germany, killed tens of thousands of Serbs. Karadzic said the three warring parties must make compromises to reach a final agreement and settle boundaries. He stressed that 33.3 percent of the territory was enough for the Muslims, and that the Serbs would like to exchange part of the territory in dispute with the Croats. He also said that the West, which has been biased against the Serbs, would make a mistake to push the Serbs closer to Russia, a traditional ally.
