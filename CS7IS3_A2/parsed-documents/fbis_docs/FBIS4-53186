FBIS4-53186 "dreas096_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 18 May 1994 Thailand ROK Foreign Minister Begins Official Visit ROK Foreign Minister Begins Official Visit Discusses Regional Security Issues SK1805071994 Seoul YONHAP in English 0558 GMT 18 May 94 SK1805071994 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Report by Yi Tong-min] [Text] Bangkok, May 18 (YONHAP) -- South Korea's direct involvement in Asia's first regional security dialogue is negligible, but the forum is nevertheless a matter of keen interest for Seoul officials including Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu. The six members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore -- sit down with their seven "dialogue partners," including South Korea and five other neighbors, for the first time in July to address their common security concerns. There is no telling where this dialogue, named "ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)" will go, but it is certainly a symbol-laden beginning in a region where no such dialogue channel ever existed, mainly due to complex conflict of political interest, the vestige of the cold war and gap in historical and economic development history. South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, currently visiting Bangkok which hosts the first ARF July 25, called the forum more symbolic than substantive at this point. But he sees this as an important impetus for sub-groupings, what he described as sub-ARF. For instance, senior officials from Northeast Asian countries -- South Korea, Japan, the United States, China and Russia -- may decide to talk amongst themselves on their security issues before reporting to the ARF, Han said. "By having something like the ARF, the region has a growing chance of engaging in multilateral regional security dialogue," he said. Attesting to South Korea's interest in the forum, much of Han's meeting with Thai leaders here Wednesday focused on exchange of opinions on the future of the ARF, its relations with APEC. The birth of ARF had more to do with competition with APEC Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) rather than consensus of needs. ASEAN has long functioned as the leader organization in Asia until APEC came along in 1989 and took the spotlight in economic affairs of the region. Unwilling to let go of the spotlight, ASEAN members braved a new initiative by tackling security agendas. Last year, 18 nations including ASEAN members, their dialogue partners and five guests agreed in July to launch ARF. South Korea had said that it welcomes such initiative and promised full participation in the discussion process. Han had always said Northeast Asia needs security talks of its own, ideally in the form of mini-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE). "Our participation in the ARF is more symbolic than anything else -- symbolic in that we are taking part in this region's initiative," explained Yu Pyong-u, director-general of Asian Affairs Bureau at the South Korean Foreign Ministry. "But our true security interest lies with Northeast Asia," he said. "The ARF would certainly be a good precedent, it would tell us how we can work in a separate channel in Northeast Asia, how we can complement it to ARF," said Yu.
