The U.S. Partnership for Peace plan, which will feature on the agenda at next week's NATO summit meeting, will serve as the basis for relations with East Europe, leading ultimately to an expansion of NATO but without setting a date for this. Lubbers, who is being accompanied by Foreign Minister Kooijmans, said he was happy with the good U.S.-Netherlands relations. The fact that President Clinton will visit Europe three times this year makes it clear that these relations are being given the greatest consideration. In his talks with Mr. Christopher, Lubbers once again emphasized that the conflict in Bosnia is one for which both Europe and the United States bear some responsibility. The top priority is to ensure that the parties involved in the conflict must first reach an agreement themselves. However, there must be a viable threat to stimulate its implementation -- i.e., NATO -- which could implement the agreement by using force if necessary. Lubbers compared the situation with a horse and a cart: The parties involved in the conflict form the cart, while NATO must serve as the cart horse. According to Mr. Lubbers, Secretary of State Christopher said the United States is prepared to participate in the implementation of any agreement reached. This agreement is important in principle, said the prime minister, although it is no blank check. One complication for the United States is that they must submit the control of troops on the ground to Congress. That is no easy matter, whereby Lubbers claimed that it is important that the U.S. Government brings its full weight to bear in this respect. The prime minister did not want to say whether the U.S. Government acted prudently last spring, when it first threatened to use force, only to do a U-turn when the Europeans expressed their opposition. Lubbers said, however, that in the future a stern approach would be better than muddling on.
