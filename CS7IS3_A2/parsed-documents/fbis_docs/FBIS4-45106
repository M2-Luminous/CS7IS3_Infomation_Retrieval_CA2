A decision will be made by the government whether to use missiles for launching atomic bombs or coventional bombs. The success of the Agni missile demonstrates the success of this technology, in which India has attained expertise. Prithvi is a surface-to-surface missile of international standard. Nag is an anti-tank missile. Akash is a surface-to-air missile that is unequaled in its division. Tarishul is also a surface-to-air missile of high standard. These missiles will shoot at double force when used over the ocean. Agni is an answer to the MTCR [Missile Technology Control Regime] imposed on us. We are able to fire missiles over 1,000 to 2,500 kilometers, and even farther. At the end of the year, Prithvi will be presented to the Indian military for its use. We have learned that Pakistan has obtained M-11 missiles from China. Prithvi will be the answer to this." If we join this Indian program with its space program and its efforts to obtain cryogenic engines from Russia, then it is clear that India is making rapid progress in developing non-traditional weapons. We had to refer to this non-traditional war program of India's because the military, political, and diplomatic experts from the United States, as individuals and as a team, had been visiting Pakistan before Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott's visit to Pakistan and India. Everyone knows that U.S. General P. Hoover has visited Pakistan more than once. During this period, he went to inspect Siachen, the roof of the world, to see the Pakistani military front and meet the soldiers there. Both these visits were made public through the eyes of cameras; however, there was another visit for which there was no camera allowed. Only human eyes saw it. The tongues below these eyes, however, were tied, and will remain so. What was the purpose of this visit, and what did the two parties--the host and the guest--get from it? We cannot say anything about this. The man in charge of India's missile program has especially mentioned China's M-11, which, according to him, Pakistan has installed on its borders. But it is important to remember that the United States has made a lot of noise about the transfer of M-11s from China to Pakistan. China has repeatedly insisted that it did not supply M-11s to Pakistan, but the United States has not stoped its campaign. If we analyze U. S. pressure in this context, we can divide it into two camps: One is composed of Senator Pressler and other members, who are working hard to make Pakistan totally unarmed against its enemy India which is loaded with traditional and modern weapons. The other group wants to reach this goal indirectly. This group includes the Clinton government, and Strobe Talbott, as its important representative, has emerged on the scene. Before visiting Pakistan he went to India, where he was given a flat refusal and was told that India has no desire to cap its nuclear program. Still, Mr. Talbott returned "satisfied" from there. In Pakistan he was welcomed with a great deal of pomp and show. Here the main point of his demands was that Pakistan should first cap its nuclear program; should have it inspected in such a way that the whole world can see that the program has been capped; and it then should destroy its weapons of mass destruction. After discussing this agenda, Mr. Talbott telephoned his boss, U. S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, on 10 April 1994. "Mr. Secretary, in the context of relations with the United States, I can at least say that we have received good news in Islamabad. In addition, I consider this trip successful at the diplomatic, political, and even human rights levels. "We have established the groundwork for taking concrete steps in resolving various problems. From my perspective, this trip has been totally successful, and I am thankful to my Pakistani hosts, who made it possible to attain the solid results that will help Pakistan attain its security and political goals, meet the goals of the safety and stability of this region, and attain the goal of stopping proliferation of nuclear weapons at the international level. We have to work together." In response to a question, he said, "About the nuclear issue, I can say briefly that we have made solid progress, and officials in both countries will have to build on the foundation that we laid over the last two to three days." During Strobe Talbott's visit, the Benazir government said emphatically that it has been made clear to Mr. Talbott that Pakistan will not roll back its nuclear program. Meanwhile, the announcement about a freeze on the nuclear program (at what level, no one in Pakistan knows) was made by Benazir during her previous rule between 1988 and 1989. The question arises: What success was there that it was important to tell Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who was working in Washington on his day off? If we take a closer look at this "success," two things become clear. First, a few days earlier, the talented Pakistani scientist Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan said, "I have nothing to say about the nuclear policy or program." This is the same Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan the PPP leadership never tired of saying was brought to Pakistan by Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. Therefore, whatever is credited to Pakistani is credited to Bhutto I. Now Bhutto II, alias Benazir, has put the same scientist in such a situation that we cannot explain it in any words. Secondly, Ms. Robin Raphael, a member of Mr. Talbott's deputation, said in her earlier visit that a nuclear bomb can be fired from even an ox cart or dropped from a C-30 transport plane. These words have some relation to Dr. Abdul Qadeer's words. Dr. Khan finished the work of enriching uranium in the Kahuta plant a long time ago. President Ziaul Haq said about the results of this, "We are a screwdriver away from a bomb." Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan's interview with Indian journalist Kuldip Nayar is on record, and only a few days earlier, during Strobe Talbott's visit to India, Prime Minister Narasimha Rao said, "Pakistan is a nuclear power, and this has been confirmed by the former Chief of Military Staff in Pakistan, Aslam Beg." It is not necessary to blast a nuclear bomb to prove you have it. These facts and much similar information is available, and when the government of Pakistan insists that it will continue its nuclear program as is (whether it has been frozen or capped), where did the U. S. Deputy Secretary of State have such success that he was so overjoyed about that he could not wait until the morning, and informed his boss that very night? Let us try to understand the news that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan has hinted about. It should be clear that President Ziaul Haq had asked Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team to develop a delivery system after attaining nuclear capability. It is common knowledge that when the United States provided F-16s to Pakistan, these planes did not have a system to drop nuclear bombs. At that time, concern was expressed that Pakistan had received "incomplete" planes. Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan and his team were given other responsibilities, and the people of our country saw that supercomputers, Giraffe radar, and similar sensitive electronic equipment began to show up. In addition, the first phase of Pakistani missiles, HATF-1 and HATF-2, were created. This gave a shot in the arm to Pakistan's defense forces. As the department made progress, India and its supporters in the West began to get worried. They thought that with the arrival of these missiles, Pakistan's ability to attack farther was improving. It has developed a delivery system without which a nuclear power cannot be said to have a defense umbrella. Thus, the biggest question for India and the United States was how to stop Pakistan from improving its delivery system. Under this strategy, the first attack was made on China, accusing it of providing Pakistan with M-11 missiles. The U. S. government went to extremes in this context, stopping a Chinese ship in the open seas and searching it to see if M-11 missiles were there. They could only be found if they existed, though. But this gives us an idea of U. S. worries. American experts have told Pakistan several times that they have information about Pakistan gathered from satellites. This information shows that China provided Pakistan with M-11 missiles. China and Pakistan have denied making such a deal. In any case, the question that emerges with full intensity and importance against this background is: Was the purpose of Mr. Talbott's visit to stop the Pakistani missile program? Mr. Talbott, at the end of his visit here, addressed a press conference in which he said, "Both governments have decided to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and means to launch them. In this context, we have agreed to cap the nuclear program, followed by a roll back, and finally, stopping the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in South Asia." Thus, the evidence that emerged during Mr. Talbott's visit to Pakistan makes it clear that the United States has changed its strategy a bit and made its first priority the finishing off of Pakistan's missile program. Thus, without the missiles, nuclear weapons can only be used for exhibition, and not for defense. The reason for this is clear. The nuclear program has become such a sensitive issue for the Pakistani people that ignoring it is not possible. Therefore, the United States achieved its goal in a different way. In this context, we received the disappointing news that Pakistan has stopped its work on the HATF-1 missile program. At the site where this program was housed, they announced, "We do not want to upset the Americans." Perhaps this is the success that Mr. Talbott was bragging about, and he did not waste any time informing his boss in Washington about this "success." As mentioned earlier, if we look at India's nuclear program, the helplessness of Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Mr. Talbott's success as a series of events, then it should be clear that this whole effort was to defeat Pakistan's nuclear program. Benazir's agreement with Mr. Talbott to suspend the missile program (it is not difficult to confirm this) will harm Pakistan so much that it is impossible to make an assumption about it.
