Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro told reporters later that the Holy See is standing by its policy of urging a "periodic" examination of the effects of embargoes such as those against Iraq, Cuba and Serbia on the populations involved. Only two days ago, Pope John Paul II urged religious and international aid organisations to exercise their "inalienable right to assist" Cuba despite the 23-year embargo against the island, saying that the almost total ban on relations was only hurting the poorest Cubans. According to Navarro, 'Aziz, who met Cardinal Sodano at his own request, briefed the prelate on the difficulties that the UN embargo continues to create for his country, above all the poorest Iraqis. The spokesman pointed out that, in his New Year's speech to the Vatican diplomatic corps, the pope voiced concern over the effects of the embargoes and urged that they should be reviewed periodically "to avoid deleterious collateral effects" on the population. The Vatican's policy on international embargoes started taking shape at least as long ago as early last year. In February 1993, the Vatican's representative at the UN, Msgr. Renato Raffaele Martino, urged greater flexibility in the embargo against Iraq, mentioning a "moral duty" because of its aggravation of the country's "humanitarian" situation. The following May, in a message to the Iraqis taken to Baghdad by Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, the Vatican's man responsible for Eastern Rite Catholic churches, the pope did not mention the UN embargo, but he voiced the hope that the Iraqis would soon be able to re-establish "mutual and fruitful" relations with the rest of the world. In the message, which was handed to President Saddam Husayn, the pope added that Iraq's emergence from isolation should take place in a "spirit of reconciliation and peace, within a framework of international solidarity and respect for the common good." The papal missive also said the entire Catholic Church was "near" the Iraqis in their suffering and stressed that the "weak and innocent" were being forced to pay for "responsibilities for which they are not responsible." The pope also voiced concern over the exodus of Iraqi Catholics since the Gulf war, voicing the hope that improved living conditions would enable them to stay.
