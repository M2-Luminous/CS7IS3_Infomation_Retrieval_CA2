The reform of Subparagraph 2 of Article 11 establishes that a person has the right to a writ of habeas corpus when any individual or authority illegally or arbitrarily restricts his or her liberty. This is also applicable when any authority attacks the mental or physical wellbeing of those people detained. Modifications to Article 17 state that no government branch, official, or authority may use expired procedures in pending legal cases or to start legal proceedings against individuals. Regarding health, an amendment to Article 68 establishes that the Public Health Higher Council shall comprise representatives from the fields of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, clinical laboratory science, nursing, and psychiatry. Congress also reformed Article 120, which now reads: "All concessions granted by the state to exploit harbors, railroads, canals, or other public holdings require that terms and conditions be set while taking into account the nature of the projects and the investment required." Regarding distribution of the state budget, the judicial branch will be entitled to an annual allotment of not less than 4 percent of the overall budget. This includes the National Judiciary Council and the National Lawyers and Notary Public Council. The Prosecutor General's Office, the Attorney General's Office, and the Human Rights Ombudsman will together have an annual assignment of not less than 2 percent of the budget.
