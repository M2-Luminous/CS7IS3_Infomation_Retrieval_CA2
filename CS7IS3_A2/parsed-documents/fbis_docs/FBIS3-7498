Hata, speaking to the day's session of the House of Councillors' Foreign Affairs Committee, said "international society should take a firm stance in unison against North Korea." Hata also said, "It is necessary to leave a window for dialogue with the North. I want to talk frankly about the issue when Mr. Juppe comes." Juppe is visiting Japan from Thursday through Sunday for talks with Hata, the Foreign Ministry said. It is his third visit since assuming the post last April. Juppe will also pay a courtesy call on Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, the ministry said. North Korea, which denies building a nuclear bomb, refused to allow experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to freely inspect all its nuclear facilities. The IAEA dispatched its team to the North earlier this month but it was barred from inspecting one of the key sites.
