This would follow two years of growth at a very fast pace of 13 percent annually, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said. Inflation in China is also likely to exceed the target level of 10 percent, but should come down from the high level of 20 percent recorded at the end of the first quarter, it said in its semi-annual Economic Outlook. But, in this respect, China is faced with a "particular risk" this year, the OECD report said. For policies implemented at the beginning of this year as part of a programme of structural reforms "are likely to heighten inflationary pressures in the short term." It cited exchange rate reform and various tax reform measures, but noted a number of factors that might reduce the risk. The overhaul of the exchange rate system, aimed at establishing yuan convertibility, was followed by a 45 percent devaluation of the "official" yuan exchange rate, the OECD noted. But since only one-third of imports were at the "official" yuan rate, it said, the mechanical effect of this may be to add only around 15 percent to the total value of imports, so reducing the domestic price impact. The government also introduced a value-added tax to boost central government revenue from this year, the report said. It added that while price freezes on some basic consumer goods had "little impact" on inflation, the strict controls imposed recently on non-infrastrucutre investment, especially construction, "may prove more efficient in reining back inflation pressures emanating from the demand side." The brisk expansion in China over the past two years was fuelled by "very strong domestic demand growth," as investment doubled between 1991 and 1993, OECD economists noted. They said this placed constraints on resources available for exports and triggered "a surge" in imports, the value of which grew by nearly 30 percent. Both growth and inflation were immediately reined in when authorities imposed an economic austerity programme last July. But it also dried up liquidity in state enterprises and in the agricultural sector. So austerity measures were eased from last October, and growth and inflation quickened again. Against the background of developments on the price front and the recent upturn in activity, "it is likely that although slowing somewhat in 1994, GDP growth and inflation will remain above the official targets of 9.0 and 10 percent respectively," the OECD said. The report also noted that inflows into China of foreign direct investment remain "substantial," and contribute to boosting the already steep growth in investment. China notably benefitted from appreciation of the Japanese yen, which encouraged transfers by Japanese investors, although on a smaller scale than in 1987-89. The OECD said China was among the key targets of investment flows from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which were concentrated on the countries with the lowest labour costs.
