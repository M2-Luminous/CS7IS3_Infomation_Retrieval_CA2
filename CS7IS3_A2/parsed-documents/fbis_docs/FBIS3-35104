He said: They ask us to halt the resistance so that the Israeli army may live on our land, which is foolishness. Our land is occupied and the resistance was not the cause of occupation but rather a result. He indicated that the army can ensure security in the south and if Israel withdraws, the army can carry out security duties efficiently. On preparations to face any aggression, he said: We want to keep the people steadfast. The resistance will not be touched and the army is mobilized and completely ready to play its role as it did in the Seven-Day War. These are the capabilities that we will use and that we are not willing to surrender. We have taken all precautions within our reach and will not give in. He added: We are not willing to be defeated peacefully at the negotiating table because we were not defeated militarily in the war with Israel. Israel should make a decision on a comprehensive, just peace and on the exchange of land for peace, because occupation and peace cannot be combined.
