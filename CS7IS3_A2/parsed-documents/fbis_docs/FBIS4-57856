Defense Minister Raul Tovar Pierola disclosed this information on 17 May at the conclusion of the ceremony honoring the 180th anniversary of the creation of the Argentine Navy, which was held at the Bolivian Military Naval School. Minister Tovar also announced that the conclusions of the summary proceedings delivered by the Military Justice Court, which are to be submitted to authorities this week, will lead to the "opening of criminal proceedings against approximately 70 people, among them civilians and military personnel, who are involved in this case" for trial in the regular courts. Tovar said: "They will all go to the regular courts because those involved in the crimes can only be labeled common criminals, as they have seriously harmed the nation." He did not, however, reveal the names of the people to be accused of criminal acts before the regular courts. He said the number of people involved in the "affair" is large, but refused to give their names. He admitted, however, that there are more foreigners than nationals involved in this case. He added: "Many Bolivians took advantage of the circumstances, and there is evidence that some institutions were negligent in the fulfillment of their functions and duties." [passage omitted]
