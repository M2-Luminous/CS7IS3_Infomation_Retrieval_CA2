Mr. Aba-al-Khayl said that the $20 million is part of a total of $100 million which King Fahd has decided to provide as aid for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. It should be mentioned that Saudi Arabia had pledged to provide the $100 million, as aid to the Palestinians in the occupied territories for them to establish their government and authority, after the signing of the Oslo agreement dealing with self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. The Saudi minister, in a statement broadcast by the Saudi News Agency, also said: "An UNRWA delegation will arrive in Riyadh in order to conclude an agreement concerning arrangements for carrying out the agreement between the Saudi Development Fund and UNRWA dealing with cooperation in this area." Diplomatic observers see in this decision by King Fahd an indication that Saudi Arabia has not waited for the establishment of the self-rule in Gaza and Jericho in order to begin furnishing the aid it had publicly committed itself to providing after the signing of the Oslo agreement. On the contrary, Saudi Arabia decided to begin right away with its aid to Palestinians in the occupied territories who are suffering from bad economic, educational, and social conditions. This is being done by means of UNRWA, which oversees projects dealing with improvement of the Palestinians' conditions in the territories, so that the furnishing of the aid is not influenced by political developments involving the Palestinian cause or by the course of the negotiations with Israel. Saudi Arabia apparently feels that the negotiations still require time--time that the Palestinians perhaps cannot afford to take because of their economic and social conditions in the occupied territories. In this regard, it is noted that there are three types of material aid that Saudi Arabia is providing to the Palestinians at this stage, and they are the following: 1. Official aid that will start going to the Palestinians via UN humanitarian organizations, and this is the aid that was announced yesterday. 2. Aid for the masses of people, which will go to the Palestinians via the PLO. This aid is being collected by popular committees to help the Palestinian people, and they are headed by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of the district of Riyadh. Most of the aid is collected by means of 5-percent deductions from the salaries of Palestinians working in Saudi Arabia. This aid has never been cut off since it began being collected in 1968--not even during the periods of tension in relations between Saudi Arabia and the leadership of the PLO, and not even during the crisis period when Iraq occupied Kuwait. 3. Aid for the masses of people, which is collected by means of campaigns organized to support a particular project, such as the campaign unleashed by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd- al-'Aziz, on instructions from King Fahd given during the latter part of last Ramadan, to save Jerusalem. This aid, according to Prince Salman, will go directly to the Palestinians of Jerusalem. In addition to these types of aid, there are other forms of Saudi aid provided directly to the occupied territories. There is, for example, the aid to specific projects such as the project to restore the al-Aqsa Mosque and other Islamic holy places in Jerusalem, which King Fahd donated money to finance last year. There is also the aid consisting of donations to some of the educational, social, and health-related establishments in the occupied territories, such as the unpublicized donations provided by King Fahd to the hospital run by the Association for Islamic Charitable Purposes in Jerusalem and King Fahd's recent donation to the victims of the massacre in Hebron. In addition to the above, there are donations provided by Saudi businessmen directly to educational and health-related projects in the occupied territories, such as the donation by the Saudi businessman 'Abd-al-Rahman al-Juraysi, head of the Saudi Council of Chambers of Commerce, for the purpose of constructing and furnishing Bi'r Zayt University's College of Administration and Business building. Before this, there was the donation by the businessman 'Umar al-'Aqqad for the purpose of constructing and furnishing the College of Engineering in this same university. Also, the businessman Sabih al-Misri donated $3.5 million for the construction and furnishing of a new building for the medical clinics in the hospital run by the Association for Islamic Charitable Purposes, and many Saudi companies and establishments have donated sums of money annually to this hospital.
