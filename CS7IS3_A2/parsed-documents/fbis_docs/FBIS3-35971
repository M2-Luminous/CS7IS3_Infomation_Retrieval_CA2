For the first time, the crew of the shuttle will include Russian cosmonaut Sergey Krikalev. He has already made spaceflights twice in international crews. The flight on board the "Discovery" will set the beginning to a joint programme of space exploration which became possible due to agreement between the presidents of Russia and the United States. Before entering on a pre-flight quarantine, Krikalev gave an interview to ITAR-TASS. Krikalev said the programme for flight preparation at the Lyndon Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, differs little from the cosmonauts training programme in Russia. Language barrier was the main difficulty. Krikalev said that he and his standby Vladimir Titov were sent to Houston on November 1, 1992 without having been given time for language studies. The programme included the study of systems, safety rules, training in the ways of emergency evacuation from the ship and drilling in survival methods. Asked about the flight's purposes and programme and his personal contribution to it, Krikalev said his purpose was to meet the requirements for an ordinary member of the American crew. Upon the arrival in the U.S., the Russian cosmonauts began training in fulfilling the duties envisaged by the rank of a specialist which corresponds to Russian qualifications of a flight engineer. The main purpose of the flight is to bring into space a satellite shaped like a saucer and to put it into orbit by means of a special manipulator. Sensors installed on the satellite will analyse jets of the shuttle's engines. This is very important as the cooperation programme envisages the shuttle's flight towards Mir station and the linkup with it. When asked what he thinks about the fact that he will make the flight on board an American and not a Russian shuttle, Krikalev said that regarding the level of technology and organisation of the programme Russia and the U.S. are on approximately the same level. American astronauts are ahead in some things, Russians in others, particularly from the viewpoint of prolonged flights. Russian "Buran" was launched back in 1988. It took off and landed in an automatic regime and in very bad weather. Not a single shuttle ever flies when the weather is so bad, Krikalev said. Regarding Americans training for a flight in the Russian orbital complex in 1995, Krikalev said that several American astronauts are training for the flight. He said the advantage of their training is that the American astronauts selected for the flight have been studying Russian eight hours a day over the recent months. The Americans attitude to this aspect is serious and they are thorough.
