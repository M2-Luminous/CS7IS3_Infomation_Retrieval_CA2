FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Nicholas Memoli, Marketing Specialist, Order Formulation Branch, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1932. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This administrative action is governed by the provisions of sections 556 and 557 of Title 5 of the United States Code and, therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Radisson Plaza Hotel, 101 South Tryon Street, Charlotte, NC 28280 (Tel: (704) 377&hyph;0400), beginning at 9:00 a.m., on January 4, 1995, with respect to proposed amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the Carolina, Tennessee Valley, and Louisville-Lexington-Evansville marketing areas. The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR Part 900). The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders. Actions under the Federal milk order program are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96&hyph;354). This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and informational requirements are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business'' if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly, interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring their applicability to small businesses. The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 8c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 4 copies of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of other participants at the hearing. List of Subjects in 7 CFR Parts 1005, 1011, and 1046 Milk marketing orders.
