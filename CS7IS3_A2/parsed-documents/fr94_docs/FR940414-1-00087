The capital and annualized total costs (which include amortized capital, annual operating and maintenance, and monitoring costs) of complying with Option 3/S.1 are estimated to be $102.9 and $40.1 million, respectively. One Subcategory C facility is estimated to close due to compliance with Option 3/S.1. One hundred sixty-seven facilities are estimated to incur moderate impacts. Total U.S. job losses are projected, in the worst case, to be 470 FTEs as a result of the estimated impacts. 2. Facilities Using Only the Additional PAIs To estimate the impact on the second set of facilities, those facilities that formulate, package or repackage only non-272 active ingredients, EPA assumed that they were similar to the surveyed facilities in the following ways: (1) They have the same proportion of water dischargers that will incur costs, (2) they have the same average cost per facility, and (3) they will have the same percent of closures and moderate impacts. Using these assumptions, the Agency projects that the non-272 PFPR facilities would incur $10.2 million in annual costs, one facility closure, and 83 moderate impacts. EPA also estimates that there could be as many as 13 additional manufacturing facilities that also formulate, package or repackage pesticide products, not included in the study of the facilities that formulate, package or repackage the 272 PAIs. EPA estimates that costs for this subgroup of 13 facilities would be $5.8 million and would result in no additional impacts. This information is summarized in Table 19. Table 19 presents only the data used to proportion costs for facilities that only make non-272 PAI products. Therefore, Table 19 does not include the estimated costs for the expanded scope production at facilities which produce both 272 PAIs and non-272 PAIs.
