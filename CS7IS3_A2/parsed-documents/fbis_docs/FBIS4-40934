A statement by the Council says that "the country has entered a phase of political terror of unprecedented dimensions. A State Duma deputy, a banker, and an entrepreneur have been among the victims. The people involved in the revival of Russia are dying." People's constitutional right to safety must finally become a state, rather than just a private problem, the document notes. Defective legislation, which more often than not protects the criminal rather than the citizen, the impotence of the law-enforcement organs, and official inaction are merely giving the criminal world a free hand. Society is entitled to demand that the state power structures place an insuperable barrier in the way of the criminals rampaging in the country and placing basic democratic values in peril. "Terrorist actions are carefully thought out and organized and have a very specific aim: To give criminal elements a clear run at the levers of political power," a statement by the Association of Russian Banks says. The document notes that the association is prepared to give every assistance to the law-enforcement organs and other state structures in the fight against crime. The Russian Party of Free Labor, in turn, believes that the edict on protecting the population against bandits "contains no visible means of making law-abiding property-owners safe from bandit attacks. But militia officers have been given a free hand in the area of constitutional guarantees of the protection of citizens' private lives -- an area they have been interested in for a long time." The Russian Party of Free Labor urged "the president and the State Duma to instruct independent experts to finalize proposals on combating organized crime, keeping them reasonable and, at the same time, bringing them into line with the Constitution."
