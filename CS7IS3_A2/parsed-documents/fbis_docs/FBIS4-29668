The focus of attention that caused public concern was the issue on foreign investors being given permission to invest in the mass media. The press, parliamentarians and even certain members of the government, were observed to have reacted strongly to the issue without making any prior effort to understand the actual situation. The situation became indisputable only after the president clarified the issue to Information Minister Harmoko. The implementation of Government Regulation No:20/1994 still needs the president's final approval. The president will refer to and apply the relevant existing laws and regulations before giving his final approval. Regarding the press, there is Regulation No:21 of 1982. The regulations forbid foreign investors to own press media. Therefore, in implementing Government Regulation No:20/1994, particularly for the mass media, the president will definitely invoke Regulation No:21. In other words, foreign investors cannot own the mass media. As such, it was a relief to acknowledge that the anxiety on the issue related to the mass media had somewhat subsided. What about the implications of Government Regulation No:20/1994 regarding laws governing the electronic mass media such as television -- the regulations that have yet to be set up? For the moment, there was no reaction to this issue. It may emerge sooner or later. This is because the electronic mass media's implications are parallel to those of the print media. It should be reminded that the television sector is more open and susceptible to control by foreign investors compared with the print media. Meanwhile, it was observed that the decisions, which were included in Government Regulation No:20/1994 on the mass media, were not strongly directed toward the electronic mass media. Such things happen everywhere. The electronic mass media, such as the television, needs huge funds and the most modern technology. The acquisition of programs is more of a transnational nature. As acknowledged, the United States dominates the entertainment and news programs. If it were true that the foreign investors' presence in the mass media would enhance their footing in the electronic mass media, then they could similarly do so in the print media. This should be food for thought. Furthermore, we are currently facing changes to globalization and the information era. Strong influences are not within our reach nor under our control. It was also acknowledged that competition also exists in other countries between the electronic mass media and the print media, particularly the television sector. In this regard, the public sector was seen to reflect a positive attitude toward Government Regulation No:20/1994. Government Regulation No:20/1994 should be accepted by the public with an open and positive attitude. The public needs to be involved in discussions, particularly in issues pertaining to the implementation and supervision of mutual interests. If a serious concern prevails on the part of the public regarding such matters, then important and pertinent issues should not be brushed aside. The public's principal concern was that there was no coordination during the preparation of Government Regulation No:20/1994, which was later presented to the public. This was observed when more than one minister stated that they were not invited to participate in the consultations. Therefore, the coordinating minister should provide explainations should there be queries. It was possible that such an issue was overlooked. Such a move was not beneficial. Thus, the president's aides were considered responsible for the weakness or lack of coordination. There were numerous public opinions in this regard. There were those of the opinion that the lack of coordination was not a new issue while others created a humorous acronym, KISS, which when expanded means that each official is living in his own castle. Then there are persons who considered that coordination had never been smooth, and the current situation remains unchanged. It was considered that coordination is deteroriating. The various opinions and evaluations were considered to be constructive. One thing is clear. We need to have a smoother and more effective coordination no matter how we may view the current situation of coordination. The government, and particularly the presidential aides, needs to coordinate this issue more effectively. Coordination is much needed because the challenges and issues we are facing are becoming more complex and difficult, and they exist within a dynamic and intensifying condition -- in the socioeconomic, sociopolitical and other sectors that lie within the flow of dynamic reforms. Therefore, the present need for coordination is much greater than before. The objective, purpose, and implication of Government Regulation No:20/1994 are ethical, far-reaching, and strategic in ensuring the continuation of development. Its aim and background is clear, that is, to turn Indonesia into a more competitive nation that can attract more foreign investors. Let there be an open public discussion on the issue of the far-reaching implications and the possibility of finding some alternative ways to attract foreign investments. A truly wholesome discussion is hoped for in the effort toward procuring optimum benefit from Government Regulation No:20/1994 and in sharing the prosperity with the public. At the least losses within the public interests could be reduced.
