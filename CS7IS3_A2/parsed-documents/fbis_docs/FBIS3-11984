Together with the president of the Central Bank of Bolivia, his namesake Fernando Candia, the secretary of the treasury has the mission, assigned by the president of the Republic, to maintain economic stability. With this objective, he is now about to give the finishing touches to the 1994 general budget, which will soon be submitted to Congress. It is no easy task because "it means having great fiscal discipline. This role, naturally, is not very pleasant; everyone has pretensions to more funds and wants to do things, but there are essential limitations and it is not possible," he explains. Nevertheless, he is optimistic about the country's future, while not ignoring the difficulties, and he is prepared to receive an evaluation mission from the International Monetary Fund on Wednesday, 16 March, which will in his judgment make possible a disbursement of $20 million--suspended because of a deficit incurred by the previous government--and will begin to negotiate for new assistance over a period of three years. After two postponements and amid constant interruptions (until he turned off the cellular telephone), Cossio received PRESENCIA in his office. [PRESENCIA] How will the balance in the national budget between social investment and economic investment work in practice? [Cossio] The tendency over the medium and long terms is to give greater emphasis to social investment. However, this will no longer be possible beginning in 1994 because most foreign financing already agreed upon or in the process of being approved still complies with traditional criteria of public investment. On the other hand, it is rather difficult to develop new plans in three months. These procedures are much longer and normally take more than 18 months. This discrimination in favor of the social sector will become much more evident beginning next year. In spite of this, the 1994 budget already assigns an appreciable amount of funds to the social sector; but, this has begun to grow with the passage of time as new projects to be financed in the social sector take shape and--something very important--the structural reforms take shape. Which means that they "go together." Let me explain: so that investment in education, for example, be much more efficient and not be wasted--as happens now--there must be a change in the structural functioning of the sector. It cannot be otherwise. The administration of these funds must be handled much more efficiently than it has been so far. It is no accident that among the important conditions of the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to grant loans, one, for example, is that educational reform be under way. [PRESENCIA] And for the health sector? [Cossio] The same for the health sector. Now, naturally we must enact the reforms with or without the World Bank. Because, what happens if we do not? We build schools, health facilities that no one takes care of, that fall apart by themselves, there is no maintenance and, five years later, you have to start spending again to recapture the investment, and so on in a vicious circle, because there is no maintenance or care, the desks are stolen, the windows in many educational institutions.... Then, the community must look after these assets, and that is how education reform is going. The education councils or the scholastic communities (or whatever they are called), that will be made up of parents, teachers, and representatives of municipalities, will be the ones who look after the schools. At the moment, there is no supervision of any kind. If the teacher goes to school, fine. If he does not go, nothing happens. There is no supervision over the use of these resources. [PRESENCIA] Will resources be transferred directly to the community or will the state continue to manage them, under its own control and authority? [Cossio] As this is not my area and I have not dealt with it, I do not have exact answers, but I have the impression that the unit of Bolivian society that is going to be strengthened with the participation of the people will be the municipality, which will receive the resources. [PRESENCIA] You have said that the general budgetary cap is 9.5 billion bolivares. Where will the revenue come from if domestic income and customs only produce 2.8 billion bolivares? [Cossio] The financing is roughly as follows: About 53 percent of the Treasury's revenues come from income and customs; about 42 percent from transfers from hydrocarbons, and the remainder from various items: services provided, surpluses, and something (minimal) from mining royalties. Basically, it is domestic revenue, customs' revenue, transfers from hydrocarbons, and foreign financing for investment, which is a large share. [PRESENCIA] This is about 9.5 billion bolivares? [Cossio] No, this is the amount in the nonfinancial public sector. The Treasury budget is only 4.2 billion bolivares, more or less. The nonfinancial public sector, the consolidated sector, is 9.5 billion bolivares. Excluded are the public financial sector, which is the Central Bank, and certain funds, such as the National Fund for Regional Development, that are institutions of a financial nature that we do not take into account. What we do take into account are the nonfinancial public sector, that is, the Treasury, the central government, decentralized state-owned companies, and development corporations. [PRESENCIA] To clarify, the Treasury has 4.2 billion bolivares.... [Cossio] Yes, 4.2 billion. [PRESENCIA] This comes from customs, income, transfers from hydrocarbons, and various services. And the difference of 5.3 billion bolivares? [Cossio] This is from resources of their own that the companies generate and much of the foreign financing, which goes to the companies. [PRESENCIA] How will the 7.5 percent increase in global wages, proposed by the government, be translated into real wages? [Cossio] First, why 7.5 percent? Because our forecast for inflation in 1994 is 7.5 percent and our policy is to at least maintain real wages. We are aware that we cannot improve them from one day to the next, but we will maintain real wages. [PRESENCIA] Could the 7.5 percent increase in global wages vary in real wages as a function of differentiated curves or to benefit some sectors more than others, as in previous years? [Cossio] The 7.5 percent is applied to the global wage of each group. Now, as long as it does not exceed 7.5 percent, some might receive 10 percent and others 5 percent, to reach the average of 7.5 percent. [PRESENCIA] Will each institution decide this distribution independently or will your ministry be in charge of doing it? [Cossio] I believe that each ministry will negotiate with its sector, and each company will take its real possibilities into account. [PRESENCIA] One of the proposals for education reform is to increase teachers salaries substantially. Does what you say mean that this increase will be possible only through the application of the 7.5 percent? [Cossio] No. There is something more in the teachers' situation that may also arise in other situations. We have a study on teacher staffing which shows us that, in the city of La Paz, there is a difference of 2,800 positions that are paid but not occupied. These are what are called ghost teachers. We have the impression that in the three principal cities of the central axis there are 5,000 to 6,000 positions that exist in the budget but are not filled; this is the difference between the positions in the staffing pattern and the people who are actually there. As we identify these ghost positions, which are important, the resulting savings can go to improve the salaries of teachers who really exist. [PRESENCIA] Will the 7.5 percent by which the global salary will be increased be calculated on the present staffing, including the ghosts? [Cossio] Yes, but we are naturally going to clean this up when the reenrollment of all government employees is completed. There are ghosts not only in teacher staffing, but in other institutions as well, even among the well-deserving of the fatherland. There are many persons who have died but who continue to receive payment. The number of widows does not diminish but rather increases. [PRESENCIA] How many teachers are there paid by the state? [Cossio] There are 107,000 positions. [PRESENCIA] With regard to the 7.5 percent increase in the budget for universities, you said that this decision was "unchangeable but could be revised." What does that mean? [Cossio] It means that the 7.5 percent cannot be revised, but if there is a real willingness to negotiate, expenses could be rationalized in other sectors of the universities' budgets. Everyone knows, for example, that administrative personnel staffing is very large in relation to the number of professors and students. Some universities have already begun to rationalize. For example, there has been an important reduction in administrative personnel in the Technical University of Orura and the Greater University of San Simon. [PRESENCIA] Will the premium for efficiency for universities be continued? [Cossio] Only for 1993, which we are going to pay now, in 1994. These are one time only payments. [PRESENCIA] If the budget prepared by the government is followed, will it not be necessary to increase the price of hydrocarbons? [Cossio] No, because the budget is going to be unbalanced, with a deficit of 800 million bolivares, which is three percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and must be financed. [PRESENCIA] According to what you say, the budget is very austere and the government has forecast growth of 4.5 percent. Is there not a risk of entering a vicious circle of low spending but also of low growth? And what remains of the promise of 8 percent annual growth by the end of this administration? [Cossio] Let us not forget that 1994 is the first real year of this government. We estimated 4.5 percent taking into consideration above all foreign financing, which is assured. We think that progress in the capitalization process and greater, more decided and bolder participation by the private sector in investment must cause the economy to grow by 7 to 8 percent in one or two years. Last year, total investment in Bolivia was about 14 percent of GDP; the public sector invested about 7 percent and the private sector a similar amount. I am speaking in very global terms, but those are the orders of magnitude. If we had an investment structure similar to Chile, for example--about 25 percent of GDP--the state would have to be investing about 9-10 percent and the private sector about 15 percent. Only those levels of investment can assure growth of 8 percent. In sum, the private sector (the foreign portion, through capitalization, as well as the domestic portion, through its own investments, in a market economy that is working) has to assure these higher investment levels. [PRESENCIA] How much public investment is there; and what portion of it comes from foreign credits or grants and how much from the Treasury? [Cossio] This is a somewhat dynamic situation. Until the budget has been presented to Congress and promulgated by the executive, the numbers will be changing constantly. We are still adjusting them, but let us say that the level should be around $500 million. I believe that will be the figure, more or less, from $500 to $510 million. Investment from foreign resources is about $350 million in credits and grants. The rest is from the Treasury, and in addition what corporations invest with copartnerships, royalties, etc. [PRESENCIA] A large share of the Treasury's income comes from transfers from state-owned companies. When these companies are capitalized, will the taxes they pay equal the amount of the transfers? [Cossio] They must, they have to. [PRESENCIA] Do the projections show this? [Cossio] We are conducting exercises with mathematical simulations and with models to calculate exactly the levels of revenue that the new system should produce, so that the Treasury will not lose out during a period of transition. [PRESENCIA] The announcements about the composition of the budget and the structural measures the government intends to initiate are already causing social conflict. Although your office is essentially technical, what political factors are there to weaken or to negotiate with the various sectors? [Cossio] There is a large margin for negotiation, and to explain that not only the government is going to benefit by these changes but the entire country. That is the essential element of a transformation. Transformations do not occur in a calm environment. There are going to be conflicts because a transformation brings with it a change in things, and people normally do not like change. I believe that, while not entering areas that are not my responsibility, there is a broad margin for negotiation and for becoming convinced of the need for these reforms. [PRESENCIA] Do you believe in force? [Cossio] In the force of ideas, yes. [PRESENCIA] In the context of what you have said, would you hazard a forecast of what the government is going to do in the next four years? [Cossio] It would be very pretentious of me to do that, in general, but I believe that if we are successful in the capitalization process, if we carry out the law on popular participation--which is really going to change the country's roots in the allocation of resources--and if there is greater and massive private investment, the conditions will exist to see a new Bolivia in four or six years. These are long processes and no one can say that the country will be totally changed by 1997, but if we leave the seed well planted in fertile soil, I believe.... I am very optimistic. [Box, p 2] My Beloved Buenos Aires [PRESENCIA] What is the situation with Argentina at the moment? [Cossio] I can cite only two facts, because the subject is outside my area. First, only $20 million remains of the special payment made by Argentina last year, which will be paid in January and February. Unfortunately, this special payment of $110 million is finished. Second, new sales contracts--because there might be more than one--are being negotiated. [PRESENCIA] Has provision been made for these contracts in the 1994 budget? [Cossio] We have made provision in the budget for a volume similar to that of 1993, estimating the sales price at 10 percent more than the previous year, at $1.10. It is a very conservative estimate but also very realistic. [PRESENCIA] But does this not open a serious gap for the government? [Cossio] The gap we have is caused by the end of the special payment, because there will no longer be any taxes to be collected on it. [PRESENCIA] How has this gap been filled? [Cossio] With very significant cuts in operating expenses. First, we reduced all budgets for overtime pay by half; travel by half; travel expenses by 33 percent. These are the cuts, the savings we have been talking about, and it is a lot of money. Second, we have sufficient data to be almost certain that income tax collections will improve by 17 percent, which means additional revenue of some 240 million bolivares. These measures make it possible for us to cover the gap caused by the decline in revenues due to the cessation of the special payment from Argentina, and also part of the salary increase. [Box, p 2] The Dreary Legacy [PRESENCIA] What was the legacy left by the previous government in the economic area? [Cossio] The figures tell the story. The previous government had committed itself, in the plan agreed on with the IMF, to a deficit of about 750 million bolivares (total deficit of the nonfinancial public sector). But, we arrived at the end of the year with a deficit of 1.48 billion bolivares. There were three reasons for this: First, they lost control of salaries in 1993 and they granted increases well above what had been agreed upon with the IMF, which was 9 percent. What came out of Congress was 12 percent. But, because of previous agreements with the petroleum workers, insurance funds and corporations, they reached a salary increase in real terms of 18 percent. The second reason is that they inflated revenues and relied on the supposition that internal revenue and customs would improve their efficiency by 41 percent. But customs was ineffective, it was completely disorganized, and internal revenue was no better. Therefore, that projection turned out not to be true. At least internal revenue began to improve, starting in September, but it was too late to make up for the shortfall of the entire year. The third reason is that, in an election year, there was a great deal of spending, and the domestic debt increased spectacularly. They were contracting projects, buying goods and services, and not paying for them. This is why we received an accumulated domestic debt of almost 180 million bolivares. [PRESENCIA] Is this the problem with the construction companies? [Cossio] With everyone. Construction companies, providers of goods and services, payments to the social communication media, for example. They continued to accumulate debts. One way of financing was to increase the domestic debt. They stopped paying the complementary funds; there too we received a significant floating debt. These are the reasons they lost control in 1993 and this is why they could not reach an agreement with the IMF. [PRESENCIA] How are you negotiating the payment of these debts? [Cossio] We know that we cannot pay it all in one year and we are making a payments plan. For example, we have already proposed to the Bolivian Chamber of Construction that we pay them with Treasury bonds redeemable in four years. We think we can comply in that period, with all due precaution and beginning with the oldest debts. That is one possibility. Some companies have accepted, others no, but the dialogue is open. [Box, p 2] The Endless Foreign Debt According to figures provided by Treasury Secretary Fernando Cossio, the foreign debt on 31 December 1993 was $3.788 billion, of which $2.478 is owed by the Treasury. Of the total debt, 55 percent "is of multilateral origin, the principal creditors being the IDB and the IBRD [International Bank for Reconstruction and Development], with 46 percent of the debt. The remainder are crumbs: 3 percent to the CAF [Andean Development Corporation] and 3 percent to FONPLATA [River Plate Basin Development Fund]." "Then, 42 or 43 percent is bilateral, and the two principal creditors, with 22 percent, are Germany and Japan," he said, adding that 1.6 percent of the debt is owed to private banks. Cossio said that being in debt to the multilateral organizations is an advantage and a disadvantage. An advantage because "most of the credits were made on concessionary terms, for a term of 40 years at 2 percent interest and a 10-year grace period. The disadvantage is that it is not renegotiable. We cannot go to the Club of Paris and renegotiate the multilateral debt." He explains that the Treasury's debt was incurred primarily for roads, but in addition, when a state enterprise, corporation, potable water service, or municipality does not pay its debt, the debt is assumed by the Treasury. "For example, we are paying $43 million in foreign debt for the City of La Paz, we are paying SAMAPA's [Municipal Drinking Water and Sewer Service] debts, and debts of corporations because, always, when they can no longer pay, somebody has to pay, and it is the poor Treasury that has to pay the piper. This is the reason for our reluctance to continue taking on commitments, because the Treasury has reached a limit. This debt represents about 12 percent of its budget," complains Cossio. Asked whether part of foreign borrowing is used to pay old debts, Cossio says that only "a very small part--funds that come in as balance of payments support, which are usually grants in the type of aid program that we have with Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and also part of balance of payments support from the United States--is used to pay foreign debt, but it is not very much." Finally, he pointed out that, in 1994, the government has made provision to pay about $173 million to service the foreign debt (amortization and interest). [Box, p 2] Distribution of Public Investment and Allocation of Resources When discussing the national budget, the most important subjects after the salary increase are the distribution of public investment to the regions and the allocation of resources to the various government departments. According to the treasury secretary, public investment will be carried out on the following basis: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Investments by Department (in percentages) | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Santa Cruz |18.9 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |La Paz |18.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Cochabamba |12.18 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Tarija |6.4 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Potosi |5.97 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Oruro |5.6 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Chuquisaca |5.2 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Beni |3.65 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Pando |1.5 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |National investments |12 | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |Multidepartmental investments (benefi-|8 | |ting two or more departments) | | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Distribution by Sector The treasury secretary was also asked about allocation by sector. Cossio said that "about 37 percent of the Treasury budget goes to the Ministry of Human Development (which includes education, health, and housing). Then, the Defense Ministry, with 14 percent." Regarding allocations to the economic area, he explained that the portion assigned to the Treasury is very inflated, because it includes service on the foreign debt, which represents 20 percent of the Treasury budget, "which is very important."
