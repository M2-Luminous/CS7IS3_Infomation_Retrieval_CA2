However, during Velayati's talk with Economics Minister Schuessel, the focus was on the revival of Austrian-Iranian trade: In 1993 Austria's exports to Iran decreased by 20 percent and imports even by 29 percent. The reason was Iranian payment difficulties and, as a result, nonliability by the Austrian Control Bank. In mid-March at least the obstacle of financing and liability was overcome: In bilateral negotiations in mid-March, Austria rescheduled Iranian debts amounting to 5 million schillings.
