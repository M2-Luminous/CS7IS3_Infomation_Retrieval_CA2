FR940706-0-00061 FR940706-0-00014 In response to those commenters opposed to the incorporation by reference of certain manufacturing standards, the FHWA notes that the intent of this process is to reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register and Code of Federal Regulations by referencing relevant material published by the private sector. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in the Federal Register . This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force and effect of law. Motor carriers do not need to obtain copies of all of the materials which are incorporated by reference but only those that are relevant to their specific circumstances (e.g., carriers relying solely upon steel chains do not need to obtain copies of standards for steel strapping, cordage, webbing, or wire rope). Although there may be advantages to printing certain texts from private sector documents in the regulations, the FHWA does not intend ยง393.102 to be a technical reference on manufacturing standards. Both the volume and complexity of the information covered in the referenced documents is too great to be effectively presented in the FMCSRs. As for the specific documents to be incorporated by reference, the final rule differs from the NPRM in that it does not refer to Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880, Strapping, Steel Flat and Seals (May 13, 1980). Instead, the final rule incorporates American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) D3953&hyph;91, Standard Specification for Strapping, Flat Steel and Seals. As the CVSA noted in its comments, steel strap manufacturers, working in conjunction with the ASTM, are currently developing recommendations or guidelines concerning the use of steel strapping in load securement. The FHWA has reviewed the preliminary strength and use guidelines that ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 provided to the CVSA concerning breaking strengths and working load limits for steel strapping or banding. A copy of the preliminary strength and use guidelines is included in the docket file. The working load limits are 1/4 of the breaking strengths (the breaking strength multiplied by a design factor of 1/3 and a ``joint efficiency'' of 0.75) listed in ASTM D3953&hyph;91. After a review of ASTM D3953&hyph;91, the FHWA has determined that the preliminary strength and use guidelines of ASTM Subcommittee D10.14 have merit and could, to some extent, be addressed in the final rule through the incorporation by reference of ASTM D3953&hyph;91. The FHWA has compared the requirements of Federal Specification No. A&hyph;A&hyph;880 with those of ASTM D3953&hyph;91 and determined that the ASTM standard specification would serve as a better reference for manufacturers and carriers to use in determining if certain sizes or grades of steel strapping are adequate for cargo securement applications. Although the ASTM subcommittee (D10.14) is developing new guidelines, most of its preliminary recommendations are based on ASTM D3953&hyph;91. Therefore, the FHWA believes that it is appropriate to incorporate by reference the ASTM standard specification at this time, and consider the ASTM strength and use guidelines for incorporation after they have been published.
