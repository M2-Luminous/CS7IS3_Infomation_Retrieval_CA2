Chien made the remarks when he was asked during an interpellation session at the Legislative Yuan on how well the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is prepared for South Africa's possible diplomatic switch from Taipei to Beijing, an "old friend" in South African President Nelson Mandela's terms. He said Pretoria may choose to recognize both Taipei and Beijing, which would benefit Taipei because other countries might then be prompted to follow suit. And such a policy on the part of South Africa would not mean Taiwan has abandoned its "one-China" policy, he asserted. But he added that Taiwan has "no right to snoop into South Africa's external relations," saying it was up to Pretoria to decide with whom to make friends.
