During the ceremony, which began with a recital of verses from the Koran, brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani, member of the Presidential Council, delivered a speech in which he congratulated the graduates on their success in the course and on the approach of the holy month of Ramadan, wishing the Yemeni people many happy returns full of good fortune, welfare, and happiness. He said the Political Forces Dialogue Committee today will finalize arrangements for the signing of the document of pledge and accord which the political forces completed last month. He hoped that the political leadership will sign this document within a week from today. This document was completed after a lengthy dialogue among the political forces because of the crisis which our country has been facing since 9 August 1993. The brother member of the Presidential Council said that the crisis had negative effects on the various political, economic, and social fields, noting that it resulted in many things we hoped will never happen and the consquences of which will be assumed by those who caused it. He hoped that after the signing of the document, our country will enter a new stage of security, stability, and serious action in order to compensate for the events of the past period in which matters reached a state of paralysis in all parts of the country. He added that thanks to God almighty and Yemeni wisdom, the Yemeni people and their political forces resorted to dialogue as a means to resolve problems. He noted that the dialogue led to this document to which we are committed and which we will implement, in text and spirit, because it contains many guidelines for tackling a number of political issues in local government, economic and security issues, the Armed Forces, and other issues that were the cause of this crisis. Dr. 'Abd-al-Ghani hoped that the graduates will perform their duty in this important security field with absolute sincerity and dedication. He noted that all our Yemeni people and those working at the Interior Ministry, who shoulder a primary responsibility of maintaining the country's security and stability, should pay more attention to security in our country. Concluding his speech, he congratulated the graduates and valued the teaching staff's great efforts and sincere work to render this course a success. [passage omitted]
