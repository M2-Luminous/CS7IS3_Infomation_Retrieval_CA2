Russia estimates the Cairo document as a fore-sighted political step, that brought Israel and the PLO closer to the conclusion of a full-scale agreement on the Gaza Strip and Jericho, says a statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry circulated here today. The agreements that regulate the implementation of the declaration on principles of temporary Palestinian self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are the result of a compromise. The latter was made possible by thorough work for rapprochement of the sides' stands on complicated issues that had hampered the negotiations. These are communications, including corridors between Jericho and the Gaza Strip, security, in particular that of Israeli settlements, and check points. The Foreign Ministry believes the most difficult part of implementation of the Gaza and Jericho formula has been done. The Arab-Israeli negotiations are part of Russian-Israeli foreign political consultations underway in Moscow, said the statement.
