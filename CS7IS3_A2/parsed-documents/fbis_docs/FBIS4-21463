The opinion of the ministry as well as the stance of the Russian Federal Committee for Oversight of Nuclear and Radiation Safety and the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry had not been taken into account, despite official reports, at the time a draft protocol on this matter was agreed. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources will be insisting on an immediate correction of the document because the protocol directly violates the law ``On the Protection of the Natural Environment.''
