FR941013-1-00005 FR941013-1-00002 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;14&hyph;AD] Airworthiness Directives; Jetstream Aircraft Limited (Formerly British Aerospace, Regional Airlines Limited) HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream Series 200 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM). SUMMARY: This document proposes to supersede AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, which currently requires repetitively inspecting the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited (JAL) HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes, and replacing any cracked bracket. The Federal Aviation Administration's policy on aging commuter-class aircraft is to eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number of repetitions of certain short-interval inspections when improved parts or modifications are available. The proposed action would require replacing the mounting bracket with a new mounting bracket of improved design as terminating action for the repetitive inspections that are currently required by AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1. The actions specified in the proposed AD are intended to prevent inadvertent rudder movement caused by a cracked rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket, which could result in loss of rudder control. DATES: Comments must be received on or before December 16, 1994. ADDRESSES: Submit comments in triplicate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;14&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Comments may be inspected at this location between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, holidays excepted. Service information that applies to the proposed AD may be obtained from Jetstream Aircraft Limited, Manager Product Support, Prestwick Airport, Ayrshire, KA9 2RW Scotland; telephone (44&hyph;292) 79888; facsimile (44&hyph;292) 79703; or Jetstream Aircraft Inc., Librarian, P.O.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited Interested persons are invited to participate in the making of the proposed rule by submitting such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received. Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;14&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Availability of NPRMs Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;14&hyph;AD, Room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106. Discussion The FAA has determined that reliance on critical repetitive inspections on aging commuter-class airplanes carries an unnecessary safety risk when a design change exists that could eliminate, or in certain instances, reduce the number of repetitions of those critical inspections. In determining what inspections are critical, the FAA considers (1) the safety consequences of the airplane if the known problem is not detected by the inspection; (2) the reliability of the inspection such as the probability of not detecting the known problem; (3) whether the inspection area is difficult to access; and (4) the possibility of damage to an adjacent structure as a result of the problem. These factors have led the FAA to establish an aging commuter-class aircraft policy that requires incorporating a known design change when it could replace a critical repetitive inspection. With this policy in mind, the FAA recently conducted a review of existing AD's that apply to JAL HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes. Assisting the FAA in this review were (1) the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), which is the airworthiness authority for the United Kingdom; (2) JAL; (3) the Regional Airlines Association (RAA); and (4) several U.S. and foreign operators of the affected airplanes. From this review, the FAA has identified AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1, Amendment 39&hyph;4150, as one that should be superseded with a new AD that would require a modification that could eliminate the need for short-interval and critical repetitive inspections. AD 81&hyph;09&hyph;03 R1 currently requires repetitively inspecting the rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket for cracks on Jetstream Aircraft Limited HP137 Mk1 and Jetstream series 200 airplanes, and replacing any cracked bracket. JAL has developed Modification No. 5162, which introduces a new rudder pedal adjusting mounting bracket with increased sectional dimension, part number (P/N) 1379111E 1. Included with this modification are Instructions to Modification No. 5162, Part 1 and Part 2, Issue 1, dated June 1981.
