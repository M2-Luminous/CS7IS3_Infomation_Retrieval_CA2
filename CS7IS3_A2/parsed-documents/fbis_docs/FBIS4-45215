Khachatphai said, however, the fighting is not as fierce as that by the Burmese government against Karen forces. "I expect Khun Sa's people escaped to Chiang Mai and Mae Hong Son Provinces. However, the authorities are prepared to deal with the problems that may arise", he said. Khachatphai also said that Thailand would take care of and assist the refugees on humanitarian grounds. But they would be sent back to Burma as soon as the situation has improved. He added that the authorities are able to ensure security for people living in the troubled border area. Asked to comment on whether the U.S. government is to provide assistance for the Burmese government to battle Khun Sa's troops, Khachatphai said the Council had not yet learned if the United States would support the Burmese forces. Also, Khachatphai said the fighting is aimed at cracking down on the production and trafficking of drugs by Khun Sa.
