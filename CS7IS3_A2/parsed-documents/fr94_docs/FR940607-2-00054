ACTION: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Revision of Lakeshore Boundary. The Act of October 18, 1976, 90 Stat. 2532, 2533, 16 U.S.C. 460 u&hyph;19, following notice to Congress as provided therein, which has been satisfied, authorizes the United States to accept title to any lands, or interests in lands, located outside the boundaries of the Lakeshore which any private person, organization, or public or private corporation may offer to donate to the United States, if the Secretary finds that such lands would make a significant contribution to the purposes for which the Lakeshore was established; and he shall administer such lands as part of the Lakeshore following this publication. Landsource, Inc. on behalf of Midwest Division of National Steel Corporation, has offered to donate 51.47 acres of land for incorporation into the Lakeshore. The tract of land being donated is in Porter County, Indiana. The lands are principally composed of oak savannah of a similar composition to the Inland Marsh unit of the Lakeshore which it adjoins. It includes significant habitat for the federally listed endangered Karner Blue Butterfly. The tract also affords recreational opportunities for the visiting public. It is considered that the recreational opportunities offered by this property, along with the biological resources on this 51.47 acres, will make a significant contribution to the Lakeshore. The specific lands proposed for addition are described as follows: A tract of land situate in Section 3, Township 36 North, Range 7 West, Second Principal Meridian, Porter County, Indiana, described as follows: Parcel 1 That part of the Northwest Quarter of the fractional Northeast Quarter of Section 3, Township 36 North, Range 7 West, of the Second Principal Meridian, Porter County, Indiana, lying South of lands conveyed to the United States of America by deed dated August 7, 1978, and recorded in Deed Record 312, Page 455, in the office of the Recorder of Porter County, Indiana, containing 25.06 acres, more or less.

The above described tract contains 51.47 acres, more or less. Therefore, notice is hereby given that in accordance with the Act of October 18, 1976, the boundary of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is revised as described above, and as shown on Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Segment Map 09. The map is on file and available for inspection in the Office of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior; the Office of the Midwest Region, National Park Service; and the Office of the Superintendent, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.
