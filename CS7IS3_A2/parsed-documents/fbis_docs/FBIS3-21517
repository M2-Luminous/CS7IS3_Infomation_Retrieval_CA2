The scientist promised to divulge on 4 February "the chemical formulae and names, precursors for their production, and mode of combat application" of our binary weapons unless he was received by the president personally so that he could familiarize him with an "independent point of view" on the destruction of chemical weapons. The dissident from the military-chemical complex has not been received by the president, 4 February has come and gone, but the world did not shudder. All the secrets except those divulged earlier remained in the scientist's head. V. Uglev gave several reasons for his "restraint." In the first place, "up above," he believes, there has been a shift in ideas about the real problems related to the destruction of chemical weapons. The president's assistant for national security, Yuriy Baturin, met with the scientist. He agreed with Uglev that there are problems, and the primary one is clarifying the real quantities of our stockpiles. Additionally, understanding the full measure of his responsibility, the scientist did not intend to reveal the secret. One of the distinctions of binary weapons from previous toxic substances is that the components in and of themselves present no great danger and are produced in immense quantities for peacetime purposes, and therefore it is practically impossible to stop up leaks. If they know the formula, in Uglev's words, fifth-grade chemistry students can manufacture a binary weapon that surpasses everything created heretofore in terms of its killing force. That is, the danger of uncontrolled spread of binary death is immense. As a person with common sense, the scientist did not intend to contribute to this, and his threat was a bluff, a means of making his way into the highest corridors of power. The third factor is specific. Having loudly declared his intentions, V. Uglev expected authorized organs to pay attention to him. But the special services ignored him. Uglev also knows the formulae for the latest developments in American chemical weaponry, which, incidentally, do not come under the Convention on Bans. It is logical to assume that our former potential enemies have a concrete idea of our "achievements." So the state secret has already leaked out, and all Uglev has to do is divulge the formula in order for all the former imperfections of the special services to be blamed on him. Another reason disappeared of its own accord. Uglev demanded the release of V. Mirzayanov from "Sailor's Rest" prison. In the words of lawyer A. Asnis, Mirzayanov does not intend to change his decisions and therefore he will not submit petitions to change the punishment. But V. Uglev is certainly not in a good mood. He does not rule out the possibility of divulging information about our achievements. "That moment may come if we are driven into a corner and the leaders continue to completely ignore these problems." The problems are indeed of an apocalyptic nature. The official, fairly rosy position will not stand up under criticism. Generals of the military-chemical complex assert that destroying chemical weapons is dangerous, but in Volskiy Rayon, where the military chemical testing ground is located, the incidence of oncological diseases has almost doubled in two years. The average indicator for Russia is less than this by a factor of 2.5. These figures are from the Saratov Oncological Center. Surpluses concealed from the world community and the people themselves are being destroyed hastily and barbarically. Last summer an outbreak of skin diseases was reported in that same Volskiy Rayon. The clinical picture is the same as with mustard gas or lewisite contamination. The military blame the grass cow parsnip which, according to biologists, is found extremely rarely in those regions. An examination of the soil in certain places on the test ground showed the arsenic content to be 330 grams per kilogram of soil. Mustard gas and lewisite contain arsenic. The poison is simply poured onto the soil! One could give a long list of examples. The program for the destruction of chemical weapons developed by generals from the military-chemical complex will apparently have to be revised. The contradictions between the majority of aspects of the official viewpoint and the positions of independent specialists, including V. Uglev, V. Mirzayanov, L. Fedorov, and others, may be what Lenin would have called blatant. This pertains both to the quantity and the classification and the technologies and the cost and the safety. Leaders of the military-chemical complex are remaining silent, but this cannot last long--these problems have received too great a response. It will be necessary to admit many unpleasant things. Having begun with some kind of "trivia," the official picture of military-chemical socialist realism is coming apart at the seams. So many sad sensations lie ahead.
