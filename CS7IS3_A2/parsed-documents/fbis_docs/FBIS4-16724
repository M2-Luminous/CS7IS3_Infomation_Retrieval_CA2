"It will probably be necessary to amend the Constitution of the Russian Federation," he said, replying to an ITAR-TASS question on the organisation of the work of the parliament's upper chamber. In Shumeyko's opinion, members of the council should be elected and not delegated from each subject of the Federation. "It is impossible to combine the duties of a governor and senator," he noted. Summing up the results of the first 100 days of the chamber's work, its speaker said that they were "spent on thinking over the functions of the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly". There are three points of view on this score among the MPs and in the society as a whole. The first view is that the council should work in strict accordance with the constitutional norms. The second view is that the chamber, being as it is the supreme legislative body, should tackle all the most important questions of social life, just as it was done by the old Supreme Soviet. This point of view is shared, in particular, by the heads of the subjects of the Federation, who account for the majority of the council members. And, finally, there is a view that the upper chamber should be "a buffer between the lower chamber and the president". This view is shared by the presidential administration. Referring to the view of the heads of council committees, whom the speaker met on Monday, Shumeyko said that "the procedural rules of the Council of the Federation should be amended". The council must discuss all the vitally important problems, but at parliamentary hearings, not at sessions. Such hearings must be "an effective mechanism of its work". In some countries, the speaker recalled, they last for 1.5 years, discussing the most important problems and tabling proposals. Sessions of the chamber could be called whenever they are necessary, in particular, to endorse laws, presidential decrees, and other documents that are within the constitutional competence of the upper chamber.
