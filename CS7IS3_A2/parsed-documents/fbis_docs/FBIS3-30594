NATO has dispatched delegations to Warsaw, Vilnius, Riga, Tirana, Sofia, Bucharest and Prague, but not to Ljubljana, to finalise agreements on its Partnership for Peace project. NATO's decision to give Ljubljana a wide berth has been received in Slovenia as a blow which has shaken even the most optimistic advocates of an easy integration into Western Europe. The most vehement critic of Slovenia's current foreign policy, former Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel, admits bitterly that the picture of untroubled relations between Slovenia and NATO is paling around the edges. "We are wrong to believe that Slovenia is steadily getting closer to Western European integrations. The fact alone that our state is still under the arms sales embargo (which is in force against all of former Yugoslavia) puts us squarely in the context of former Yugoslavia," says Rupel. The Slovenian leadership has expected that association with the world's strongest alliance would automatically usher the national economy into the convertible currency markets by the back door. The recent first official hint that this breakaway Yugoslav republic might be willing to normalise relations with Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) is not regarded here as a victory of reason over political daydreaming, but as a logical result of Slovenia's wobbly international political and economic position. Last year, Slovenia spurned Yugoslavia's offer of mutual recognition. Slovenia, once the most highly industrialised Yugoslav republic, is inescapably turning into an economic, commercial and political cul-de-sac of Europe. Its leaders have recognised this only after the slap in the face administered by NATO, and have suddenly turned to Yugoslavia, the country which Slovenian authorities are persistently and ruthlessly denegrating at every turn.
