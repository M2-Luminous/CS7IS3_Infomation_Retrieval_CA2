Analysts summed up cooperation between China and ASEAN this year as follows: One, steady growth in trade and investment volume. Data shows that trade and investment volume between China and ASEAN this year continued to grow at a rate of 30 percent. Trade between Singapore and China alone hit $4 billion. ASEAN countries such as Singapore and Malaysia now rank as China's most important trading partners. Investment by ASEAN businessmen in China topped $2 billion, while China has undertaken engineering projects, developed labor cooperation, and opened 100 joint ventures in ASEAN countries. Two, cooperation has become wider in scope and deeper. Against the background of extensive cooperation, regional cooperation is becoming a trend. Economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN countries extended to entertainment, retail, manufacturing, petroleum, chemical, metallurgical industries and financial business. Cooperation has been strengthened in wholesale land development and infrastructural projects. Banks from ASEAN countries closely followed their businessmen into China and injected vitality into bilateral economic cooperation and trade. Linglong [3781 3891] Incorporation of Malaysia, which made its entry into China only this October, has expressed interest in the development of China's coal-powered electric plants and highways. Apart from an industrial garden in Suzhou, Singapore has participated in the wholesale land development in Yintan City, Jiangxi Province. The Philippines are also involved for the first time in wholesale land development in Shishi City, Fujian Province. Cooperation centering on the "Lancang Jiang-Mekong River Economic Circle" between Yunnan of China and South East Asian countries, such as Thailand, is in full swing, prompting regional cooperation between China and ASEAN countries. More wishes for cooperation have been witnessed between Thailand and Sichuan, the Philippines and Indonesia and Fujian, and Singapore and Jiangsu and Shandong. Three, the appearance of joint-investments, a new form of investment. This year, economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN countries changed from the "isolated duels and solo fighting" pattern, into joint investment. There are Thai-Singapore joint-venture investments in South East Asia and south China; Indonesia and other countries play a part in the joint-investment in a Thai-China satellite joint venture. Talks are underway between Germany and Singapore for joint development in Shandong and Wuxi; France is interested in joining Singapore's Suzhou Industrial Garden project. Joint investment integrates capital and technology in a better way and strengthens investment spending and, therefore, boosts its effect. Four, officials' active attitude, encouragement, and guidance for bilateral economic cooperation and trade. There were frequent visits between Chinese and ASEAN state leaders this year. Many of them accompanied by business people, signalling a strong wish from both parties to strengthen economic cooperation and trade. It was as if each visiting state leader was playing the role of the "best salesman." Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir, Philippine President Ramos, Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, and concerned Thai officials all stated, in public, their full support to their businessmen in pursuing cooperation with China, suggested learning the Chinese language, laid the groundwork for telecommunications, and urged Chinese businesses to enter the ASEAN market. Chinese government officials also stated, more than once, their support for Chinese firms to invest in ASEAN countries and moves to make it convenient for ASEAN business interests to develop in China. Several things merit special mention: The first official ASEAN delegation visited China for talks on economic, trade, and technological matters; Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was invited to sit at a conference of ASEAN foreign ministers; ASEAN officially agreed to set up a special committee to coordinate and promote economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN countries. Without a doubt all these positive moves have increased business confidence and will certainly have a positive impact on bilateral economic cooperation and trade. Five, mutual promotion and common prosperity are the consensus between the two sides. China and ASEAN countries share the wish for cooperation, preserving differences, and seeking common grounds so that the entire region will prosper. Hartarto, Indonesian coordinating minister for industrial and trade affairs, once stated that the countries should reinforce each other economically to achieve common prosperity. He said that Indonesia is determined to become a newly industrialized nation in 25 years. Aside from its own efforts, it needs cooperation with other countries. An editorial in Singapore "LIANHE ZAOBAO" [United Morning Post] pointed out that the Singapore Industrial Garden project in China is a significant turning point for Singapore in its effort to internationalize its economy, while China has for its part consistently upheld the approach of developing economic cooperation and trade with ASEAN countries in a mutually beneficial manner. Concerned experts believe steady economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN countries will continue next year and feature new elements. Cooperation between Chinese private enterprises and their ASEAN counterparts will become an important means of economic cooperation and trade between China and ASEAN countries.
