Kiseleva: "The `Hashish' Did Not Get Through"] [Text] One tonne and 837 kilograms--that is the total weight of the drugs intercepted by the customs service of Russia since the beginning of the year. By comparison, 437 kilograms were intercepted for the same period last year. As an official of the department for fighting contraband narcotics of the State Customs Committee of Russia reported to a MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent, customs officers confiscated 72 kilograms of poppy straw in Bryansk last Monday. But about 300 kilograms of a similar narcotic substance were confiscated in the last two months in the very same channel. The largest batch of contraband narcotics in Moscow in the last month was found in cargo that arrived from Nigeria at Sheremetyevo-2 International Airport. The "gift"--105 kilograms of marijuana--which was concealed in the defrosting trays and between the walls of cooling chambers, was addressed to a private person in Moscow. The main flow of drugs moves to Russia from the northwestern region--Lithuania, Kaliningrad Oblast, Ukraine, and Belarus. The situation with tracking drug channels on the southern borders is made very difficult in connection with the disintegration of the USSR and the formation of independent states. In 1993, Russian customs officers conducted 11 "controlled deliveries" jointly with their foreign colleagues for the purpose of tracking the network of suppliers, deliverers, and buyers. In the course of operations to ship heroin, cocaine, hashish, opium, and marijuana from India, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Jamaica, and Colombia to Russia, 37 kilograms of narcotics were confiscated, of which 24.5 kilograms were heroin. One "controlled delivery" of five kilograms of opium from Russia to the Armenian community in Los Angeles was also conducted. According to data acquired from competent sources by the MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA correspondent, according to drug market prices, one glass of poppy straw now costs from 20,000 rubles [R] to R50,000, depending on the quality of the purity, and one matchbox of low-quality marijuana costs from R3,000 to R5,000, and high-quality marijuana--up to R10,000.
