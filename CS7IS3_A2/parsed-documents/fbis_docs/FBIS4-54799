Before leaving Bratislava, Kukan told CTK and Slovak news agency (TA SR) that he would meet with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel to discuss German support for Slovakia's efforts to join an integrated Europe, and German investments in the connection with the plans of the new Slovak Government to speed up the privatization process. Kukan said he also wanted to take up the question of compensation for the Slovak victims of the Nazi regime. However, he said he did not expect any definitive solution. For the time being, Bratislava neither intends to open the question of negotiating a new international agreement with Germany, concluded under the Czechoslovak federation. Kukan is also to meet with German Defense Minister Volker Ruhe, mainly to discuss Slovakia's participation in the Partnership for Peace plan, and its ambition to join NATO. On Thursday [5 May], Kukan is to lecture on Slovak foreign policy in the European Academy in Berlin. "Slovakia is interested in participation in the stability pact (based on a plan of French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, approved by the EU, and aimed mainly at preventive settlement of the problems concerning borders and ethnic minorities in former communist countries), but is even more interested in the pact's respecting Slovak interests. As they are not sufficiently expressed in the pact's draft wording, I will ask minister Kinkel for his support," Kukan said. Slovakia refuses the proposal to negotiate its international agreement with Hungary under EU auspice. However, the possibility of Slovakia's not joining the pact has not been considered. "We believe.. the pact will be acceptable for Slovakia as well," Kukan said. Until the recent improvement of mutual relations, Bratislava disputed with Budapest over the status and the rights of the 500,000 ethnic Hungarians living in Slovakia. While Budapest is pushing for collective rights for the Hungarian minority, which it has made the condition for the conclusion of a Slovak-Hungarian treaty, Bratislava rejects this idea and is promoting individual rights for minorities' members, in line with European standards. Slovakia has been simultaneously urging Hungary to guarantee the inviolability of the present Slovak-Hungarian borders. "We are interested in our relations with some countries of the region being settled bilaterally, without sponsorship and the oversight of somebody else," Kukan said. "We are able to negotiate important agreements ourselves and are willing to offer these agreements as our contribution to the stability pact, as well as to establish certain mechanisms to control the observance of the pact's provisions. We do not want our stands to be pressed upon us from outside," he stressed. Kukan confirmed that his meeting with his Czech counterpart Josef Zieleniec is being prepared, but a suitable date has not been found yet.
