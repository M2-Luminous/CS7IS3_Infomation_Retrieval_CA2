FR941025-0-00018 FR941025-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;37&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9040; AD 94&hyph;20&hyph;11] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 Series Airplanes Equipped With Pratt & Whitney PW4000 Series Engines AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, that requires replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. This amendment is prompted by reports of actuator piston seal leakage found during actuator overhaul on certain Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent possible deployment of a thrust reverser in flight and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective November 25, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of November 25, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Jon Regimbal, Aerospace Engineer, Propulsion Branch, ANM&hyph;140S, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2687; fax (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on April 22, 1994 (59 FR 19151). That action proposed to require replacement of the thrust reverser flow restrictor devices with one-way (check) valve restrictors. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of one of its members, requests that the proposed rule be revised to cite the latest revision of Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747&hyph;78A2128. The FAA concurs. Since the issuance of the proposed rule, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1, dated May 26, 1994, of the Boeing alert service bulletin. Revision 1 corrects certain discrepancies contained in the original issue of the alert service bulletin. The FAA has revised paragraph (a) of the final rule to reflect the latest revision to the alert service bulletin as an additional source of service information. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 94 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 32 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 24 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will be supplied by the manufacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $42,240, or $1,320 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
