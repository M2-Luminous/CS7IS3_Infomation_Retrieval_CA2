Attempts to incite trouble and discord between the people and their governments are no secret to anyone, nor are the obvious conspiracies to break up a united people and fragment and partition their united homeland. As a result of this deteriorating situation, many people have been killed, stability has been lost, and peace and security vanished. The Muslim Brotherhood announces that its program for teaching the ways of God the Almighty and religion is a peaceful program based on awakening Islamic feeling, reviving belief in people's hearts, educating the nation in knowledge, work, and morals, and spreading a spirit of sacrifice, jihad, and dedication among the Islamic people to ascend from the abyss of backwardness and work on building the unity of the nation. To achieve this, the Muslim Brotherhood gets its inspiration from the words of justice, blessed may they be: Invite all to the way of thy Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching; and argue with them in ways that are best and most gracious [Koranic verse], as well as in the Almighty's words: Let there arise from you a band of people inviting all that is good, enjoying what is right and forbidding what is wrong [Koranic verse]. At the same time, the Brotherhood shows respect for constitutions and laws and works through them to achieve the interests of the country and the people such as public freedoms, respect for human rights, and justice among people. This has been manifested by the fact that the Brotherhood has taken part in all aspects of life within the framework of the constitution and laws in force. Brotherhood members have participated in local and parliamentary councils, professional associations, and other such institutions along with other political parties and forces. Thus, they were hoping to reform the situation through the words of justice, open dialogue, constructive opinion, impartial criticism, and honorable opposition. There have been bitter acts of violence for many reasons ever since the Muslim Brotherhood emerged from the prisons nearly a quarter of a century ago. Not a single member of the Muslim Brotherhood took part in these events. On the contrary, the Brotherhood condemns these incidents because it considers such events a departure from the right course in preaching the ways of God, the Almighty, and a distancing from the path it follows. The president of the republic said this in statements to the French newspaper LE MONDE on 1 November last year. The president then said about the Muslim Brotherhood: It is an Islamic movement that has opted for political struggle rather than violence. Former Egyptian interior ministers at various stages have also stated these facts. The latest of these was a statement by Interior Minister Hasan al- Alfi in his news conference published in AL-AHRAM and AL-JUMHURIYAH on 14 April 1994. This is evidence of the innocence of the Muslim Brotherhood of such accusations which are made indiscriminately without any backing or proof. Thousands of defendants have been tried in numerous cases and thousands of others were arrested. The Brotherhood's clear and explicit stance on these issues is evidence of its commitment to its wise plan in preaching the ways of God through conviction and confirmation. The Muslim Brotherhood is not, and will not be a group advocating sedition and trouble, and will not be the cause of revolution or clashes. However, the absence of a response to the demands of the people, the delay in reforms, coupled with the big deterioration in services and disregard for man's basic rights, in addition to failure to provide the necessary guarantees for freedom of elections, some of these points, in fact all of them, are what is causing concern and fear regarding the deterioration of the situation to a unacceptable state. May God protect Egypt from the evil of schemers and keep all harmful things at bay.
