In addition to being a testimonial to U.S. military ineptitude, this incident also brought home the reality that the U.S. hierarchy are savage aggressive individuals who trample on all international standards in order to attain their own illicit interests and do not obey even a single law. What has occurred all over the world for the past 14 years merely affirms the daily growth of their savagery. The record of U.S. brutality in Vietnam, the deployment of its troops in Panama, Iraq, Somalia, its multifaceted support for the Zionists' atrocities in occupied Palestine, and the U.S. pressure on the United Nations to remain silent in the face of the Serbs' crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, all these are evidence of U.S. barbarianism in past years. On the one hand, it professes to be a champion of human rights but with the other, it crushes human beings all over the world under its military boots. This is the true nature of the United States and of all of today's domineering powers. The most serious and appropriate approach to such bestiality is the one the Islamic Republic of Iran adopted toward the United States. The occupation of the U.S. den of spies in Tehran by the student followers of the imam's line and the categorical stance taken by Imam Khomeyni against the U.S. Government on this incident and in all other cases is exactly the kind of treatment that the Americans merit. Even today the Muslim nations who wish to live in freedom, who do not want their rights to be transgressed, who do not want their women and children to be massacred by the malicious enemies of Islam, have no recourse but to take up a serious and decisive struggle against the United States. "The United States is the mother of all the evils of the century." The truth of this profound statement by Imam Khomeyni becomes clearer with the passage of every moment. What is happening today throughout the Islamic world from Bosnia-Herzegovina to Kashmir, from Palestine to the Caucasus and Afghanistan, is all under the auspices of the criminal United States, the United Nations is a mere instrument in its hands. Therefore, in order to lift the arms embargo from the Bosnian Muslims, to halt the Serbs' aggression in Gorazde, and to quell all the trouble making against the Muslims, one should fight against the United States and scorch the roots of its mischief-mongering. It is an immutable reality that "the United States is the mother of all evils of the century."
