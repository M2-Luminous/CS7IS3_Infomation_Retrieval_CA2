Sazonov, chief of the Ministry of Railways Lines Main Administration, by GUDOK correspondent V. Gitkovich; place and date not given: "Reduce Expenses, Not by Decreasing Volume"] [Text] Maintenance workers have already gone out on their lines. They have three main objectives now: to increase the volume of repair, to improve its quality, and to reduce expenses. At first glance, it is hard to coordinate these desires with each other. But obviously they can be coordinated, and most importantly, they must be! But how is this to be accomplished? Our correspondent discusses this with V. Sazonov, chief of the Lines Main Administration. [Gitkovich] Vladimir Nikolayevich, 6,808 kilometers must undergo major repair this year. If the railroads' current shortage of funds to acquire the needed quantity of materials is taken into account, it will be a very hard job. [Sazonov] This may sound paradoxical, but we plan to increase the area for repair by reducing expenses for it. The point is that the railroads will be making the maximum use possible of resource conservation technologies. We are putting many rails, ties, tie plates, and other materials into use for the second time. This was also done previously, but not in such volume, and it did not have as much effect on the production cost of operations as we expect now for this reason. After all, this year we are counting on reinstallation of 4.382 million wooden ties and 70,000 metric tons of tie plates and the reuse of 8,500 spikes. I will not list everything else. I will add only that the old track grids are being repaired intensively with reinforced concrete ties at unit assembly bases of the PMS [track machinery service]. This year we plan to make use of 1,126 kilometers of selected grid work. It will be installed on the main routes with overall freight traffic of up to 25 million ton-kilometers. If we succeed in carrying out all the measures, this year we will save 57 billion rubles (in December 1993 prices). [Gitkovich] Everything you mentioned involves major repair. And, although new rails are used in this, as a rule, there is quite a lot of concern about them as well. [Sazonov] I have not forgotten about the rails or the switches. I was simply saving them up "for later." After all, they should provide the most economy for us. Clearly, we will be welding them in long lengths. But at the same time, we will be making more and more extensive use of rails that have already completed their service life on sections with heavy traffic. Without cutting them, we will install them on lines with less freight traffic. But this will not leave our rail-welding trains without work. They will have to significantly increase the volume of hard-facing on the defective rail ends directly on the track (up to 5,000 units this year) and renovation by electric-arc welding of the frogs (over 28,500 units this year). Everything mentioned not only will provide for substantial economy, it will enable us to repair more, but, if we add to this the many kilometers of sections without a single joint from station to station that have already appeared on the Kuybyshev, Gorkiy, and other mainlines, as well as the careful polishing of the rails, we will have a line that is really "like velvet." [Gitkovich] All this is fine. But they say that we are substantially behind the most technically developed countries in our technology for major repair, and that those countries have distinctive combines that perform the entire complex of operations needed for major repair in one pass. [Sazonov] You see, the main reason for the different technologies in major repair here and in the West is the fundamentally different requirements for them. There, where the freight traffic is relatively insignificant and the network of rail lines is more dense, they can shut down a certain section for a week, or even three, to perform major repair. In past years, when transport service was increased rapidly and at times exceeded the throughput capacity of the lines, we counted every hour of interruption in the traffic. And under these conditions, productivity during a "window" hour and the opportunity to work on a double-track section without interrupting traffic on both sides for one of the tracks were most important of all for us. I believe that under these conditions our technology coped with its basic task. Perhaps the most vulnerable aspect of it was cleaning the ballast. We worked only with the upper layer, and, for that reason, whether we liked it or not, we were forced to add a substantial amount of fresh ballast, raising our tracks even higher, or to move the "extra" ballast with bulldozers to the slopes and into the ditches; in addition to the economic losses, this also damaged the roadbed. Incidentally, in the West, ballast cleaning is not as critical because the rolling stock there is in much better condition and they package much of what we ship in bulk. But life has changed now, and we have the chance to shut down entire sections of the lines for a significant period of time. I think that this, combined with the new ballast cleaning machines that not only cover a thicker layer of it, but make it possible to return the ballast to the track after cleaning, will make major repair more efficient. In addition, under these conditions, we can also devote our attention to treatment of the main roadbed, which plays a decisive role in improvement of the line. The first "windows" over many days are already under way on the October Railroad. We are checking there to see if it is necessary to spend billions right away on new machinery or whether we can manage with what is available and achieve good results. [Gitkovich] "Windows" for many days--this is one more result of the continuing decline in the volume of freight service. And the pace of this process is very rapid (22.4 percent in the first quarter of this year, instead of the 4.8 percent that was predicted). And in order to be profitable, the railroads are rushing to bring operating expenses into conformity with the decrease in transport service. And this is one of the simplest measures, at first glance--reduction of the work force. How do you view this? [Sazonov] Unfavorably. And this is why. For the present they are not cutting back on line maintenance personnel, but the personnel departments of many subdivisions are already posting lists showing that hiring for work is being discontinued. And this is essentially the same thing. The point is that the turnover in our subunits is roughly equivalent to 50 percent annually. And by discontinuing the hiring of new workers to replace those who have left, we may be short of one-quarter of the line repairmen that we had in just six months. But after all, the average personnel strength for the system at the beginning of the year was a little over 70 percent of what is authorized--and even less on individual railroads. It is hard to visualize how the brigades will look soon on the East Siberian, October, or Kemerovo railroads, where the turnover last year was 68, 70, and 81.8 percent, respectively. But after all, Russia's railroads are poorly equipped with track machinery at present, and manual and labor-intensive operations, especially for current track maintenance, are adequate for this reason. This is one of the important reasons for the turnover, by the way. Recently many highly skilled employees from a defense plant came to one of the subdivisions where a reduction in force was under way. But they did not have time to rejoice in the subdivision, since nearly all the new arrivals were dismissed. The people were unaccustomed to hard work outside in any kind of weather, and at times even at any time of day. With the extent of mechanization and the volume of repair work we have today, each line maintenance brigade should be at least 75 percent of its authorized strength. Only under such conditions can we provide for reliable track use. There is no question that authorized personnel strength should also be adjusted for the decline in transport service. These standards were worked out recently in the Ministry of Railways and sent to the railroads. I also want to point out that reducing the number of track maintenance workers is not the most efficient method of lowering operating expenses in our administration, where wages account for 32 percent of overall expenses. The introduction of resource conservation technologies is much more productive. Including those that provide for extension of the service life of materials by maintaining the track in good condition, where the track maintenance employees play an important role. A small example. Today the cost of one new rail is nearly a quarterly wage for a track maintenance worker. In sections with an excellent record, such a rail serves 1.5 to two times longer. It is not hard to determine what is more advantageous for a railroad and in which direction they need to proceed.
