The Ministry plans to produce 81 million tons of rolled steel this year to help meet the rising demand. Another 9 million tons will be supplied by stockpiles. The remaining shortage, about 10 million tons, will be met by imports, said vice-minister Wu Xichun. The import figure is down considerably from last year's level, 30.26 million tons, according to latest statistics from the General Administration of Customs. In December alone, 4.46 million tons of rolled steel were imported. "This is abnormal because at the time the steel price was plummeting, the stockpile was growing sharply," Wu said. In recent years, the annual consumption of rolled steel increased sharply. Total usage of rolled steel in 1991 was 10 million tons more than in 1990, rising by 15 million tons in 1992. Last year, it hit an estimated 93 million tons, an increase of 17 million tons over the previous year, Wu said. Domestic iron and steel makers produced 75 million tons of rolled steel last year and exported about 2 million tons. Because of the 30.26 million tons of imports, stockpiles climbed by about 10 million tons, a record high, and pulled down prices, Wu said. He attributed the sharp increase of rolled steel consumption to the rapid growth of investment in fixed assets in recent years. In 1993 total investment in fixed assets amounted to 1.15 trillion yuan ($132 billion), up 46 per cent over the previous year. This year the government intends to strengthen macro-control of the economy and curb fixed assets investment. If the target is achieved, the rapid growth of rolled steel usage in the country will be slowed down this year, experts said. And the prices, which experienced dramatic ups and downs last year, will be steady, they predicted.
