Rebelo de Sousa attributes the prime minister's reported decision to the results of the municipal elections--which were better than expected--to polls indicating that an absolute majority is not impossible, and to the signs pointing to economic recovery in Europe. Finally, Cavaco's decision may also stem from the availability of EU structural funds in time to stimulate the Portuguese economy toward the end of 1994 or the beginning of 1995. While a third prime ministership for Cavaco Silva will please some, it will upset others, Rebelo de Sousa comments. First among the latter is Socialist Party (PS) leader Antonio Guterres, whose basic strategy is predicated on the fact that the prime minister has set his sights on the presidency, in which case Guterres would face an opponent less formidable than Cavaco Silva. Guterres must thus "rethink his discourse and image" and focus on a few important issues that can withstand the test of time until 1995. Minister of Defense Fernando Nogueira, the government's No. 2 man, ought to be no less concerned than Guterres, Rebelo de Sousa continues. Nogueira has worked hard and well and gets most of the credit for the partial victory in the municipal elections. In the debate over the post-Cavaco Silva era that opened as early as 1992, Nogueira emerged as the prime minister's most likely successor, a position Rebelo de Sousa thinks would be difficult to maintain for another six years. This would lead to the "bitter" conclusion that Nogueira's long labors in "creating solidarities, fostering fidelity, and patiently managing conflicts, careers, and ambitions" will be unrewarded. A third Cavaco term would also make some people happy, Rebelo de Sousa continues. On the Right, former Prime Minister and media magnate Francisco Pinto Balsemao might decide to run for the presidency. He would then have to decide whether to run as an independent or under the PSD banner. Other candidates might be Azores regional President Mota Amaral or Madeira regional President Alberto Joao Jardim, intent on escaping "insular claustrophobia," or even "virtual" candidate and PSD luminary Eurico de Melo. On the Left, "there is the perennial candidate to candidate," former President Ramalho Eanes, "if the temptation to recoup lost time wins over a serene assessment of the situation." Also, Lisbon Mayor and PS luminary Jorge Sampaio and universitarian Rui Alarcao, whose candidacy would mean a loss for the legal field in Portugal, Rebelo de Sousa concludes. Were Cavaco Silva to run for the presidency, abandoning the government before the next legislative elections, President Mario Soares would then dissolve the National Assembly, contends the 29 January Lisbon weekly EXPRESSO, citing a Soares "confidante" as the source of the information. The paper quotes this source as saying that Soares "will not allow Cavaco Silva to do what Margaret Thatcher did in England, letting herself be replaced by a John Major whose name, in this case, is Fernando Nogueira." The president's scenario, according to EXPRESSO, is that the present difficult situation would render unlikely an absolute PSD majority, with the prime minister "forced" to announce his presidential candidacy at the party's November congress.
