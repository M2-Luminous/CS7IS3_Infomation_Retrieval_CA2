Following the secession of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] from the coalition, they confirmed Rengo's policy of deciding whether or not to cooperate with Hata's new administration "on a case-by-case basis, based on policy." In a news conference, Rengo Chairman Akira Yamagishi said: "If a minority ruling group is formed without the SDPJ, it will be impossible to manage the political situation in a normal manner. While it is not good to conduct an election under the multiple-seat constituency system which was `pronounced dead,' the Diet is likely to be dissolved soon." He thus predicted there is a possibility of Diet dissolution under the present multiple-seat constituency system after passage of the 1994 budget bill.
