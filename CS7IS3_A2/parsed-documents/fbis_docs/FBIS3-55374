The statement reads that some articles which have already been adopted by the vote of the Lithuanian Democratic Labor party faction are a challenge to the constitutional state system of the Republic of Lithuania. With the help of the law on state of emergency the Lithuanian Democratic Labor party creates conditions for itself to be able to suspend the functioning of essential clauses of the constitution on the decision of the party's faction alone on the pretext that it poses a threat to the public order, thus to violate basic human rights and freedoms, to introduce the dictatorship of their party by means of allegedly legal actions of coercion. We stress, the statement goes on, that the right of the nation and of every citizen to oppose anyone who encroaches on the constitutional state system is inalienable. The statement was signed by the leaders of the Lithuanian Democrats party, the Lithuanian Christian Democrats Party, the Independence Party, the Lithuanian Liberal Party, the Lithuanian Nationalist Union and the Lithuanian Conservative Party.
