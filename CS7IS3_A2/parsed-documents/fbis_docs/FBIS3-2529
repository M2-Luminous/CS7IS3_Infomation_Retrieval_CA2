Zhou Jue first welcomed the Chinese and foreign correspondents to cover the session. He stated: Although the current session is a regular meeting, it is very important. It is being held during an important period when our country is proceeding on all fronts in reforming its economic structure with breakthroughs in key areas, and when it is accelerating the pace of establishing a socialist market economic system. In response to a question on how to quicken legislative work and promote the operation of the market economic system, Zhou Jue answered: As empowered by the Constitution, the NPC and its Standing Committee have always made legislative work, especially economic-related legislative work, a priority. Since the First Session of the Eighth NPC, the NPC and its Standing Committee have enacted 21 laws, of which 12 concern the establishment of a socialist market economic system. Zhou Jue added: During its eighth term, the NPC will fully implement the guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee; will quicken the legislative process; and will endeavor to complete the better part of the legal framework for the socialist market economy under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and on the basis of the Constitution. Moreover, it will basically improve the legal systems in other areas. These are important and glorious tasks. A correspondent asked: Legislative work is now being accelerated, but some departments have failed to strictly enforce the law. How will the NPC tighten supervision in this regard? Zhou Jue replied: Supervising law enforcement and government work is an important duty entrusted to the NPC and its Standing Committee by the Constitution. Over the past year, the eighth NPC Standing Committee exercised close supervision over law enforcement and government work, bearing in mind the state's priority tasks and the issues of concern to the people. The NPC Standing Committee sent 10 inspection teams to 15 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government to assess work in comprehensively improving public order and in punishing those who produced and sold counterfeit and substandard commodities. The NPC's special committees also sent 27 inspection teams to assess progress in implementing 15 laws. Zhou Jue stated: The NPC Standing Committee also heard reports by relevant departments of the State Council and by the Supreme People's Procuratorate [SPP] on banking, foreign trade, education, the promotion of a clean and honest government, and civil aviation work. While listening to work reports by the SPP and relevant departments, the NPC Standing Committee affirmed and supported the work done by various government departments and the SPP in investigating major cases of importance and in fighting corruption. After having heard a report on civil aviation work, the NPC Standing Committee required departments of the Civil Aviation Administration to earnestly strengthen control, to improve the quality of their personnel and services, and to improve civil aviation work as quickly as possible. Zhou Jue added: In the future, the NPC and its Standing Committee will continue to strengthen supervision over and examination of law enforcement and government work so as to exercise in a better manner the authority vested in them by the Constitution. A correspondent asked: What significance does the promulgation of the "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots" have on expanding cross-Strait economic exchanges and trade? Zhou Jue replied: The Sixth Meeting of the Eighth NPC Standing Committee just examined and approved the "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." Cross-Strait economic relations and trade have now become even closer, and investments by Taiwanese businessmen on the mainland have increased by a large margin. However, "three direct links" have not been established yet. Under the circumstances, it is necessary to formulate a law on the protection of investments by Taiwan compatriots in order to provide adequate legal protection for their investments on the mainland. Zhou Jue stated: The main contents of the law on the protection of investments by Taiwan compatriots include the personal safety of Taiwan compatriots who have invested in the mainland, and the protection of their investments and their investment returns; the protection of Taiwan-invested enterprises from being requisitioned; the need to adopt compensational measures to protect their legitimate rights and interests in case such requisitions are necessitated on account of public interests according to law; and the government-stipulated preferential treatment to which Taiwan investors are entitled. Zhou Jue stressed: The formulation of the law fully shows a high degree of importance attached by us to Taiwan compatriots' investment-related rights and interests. It also shows our sincerity for developing cross-Strait economic contacts and trade. He expressed the belief that the law will surely be welcomed by the broad masses of Taiwan compatriots, and will play a very important role in promoting cross-Strait economic exchanges, trade, and cooperation. A correspondent asked whether Taiwan has suggested that an "agreement on the protection of investments" be signed, and does this have anything to do with the "Law on the Protection of Investments by Taiwan Compatriots." Zhou Jue answered: Investments on the mainland by Taiwan compatriots are a special kind of domestic investment. Therefore, investments by Taiwanese compatriots can only be protected by a domestic law. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Relations between the central government and Taiwan are relations between a central government and a locality. It is out of the question that the two sides may sign any "agreement." Speaking about Hong Kong, Zhou Jue stated: It is entirely because of the uncooperative attitude taken by the British in sabotaging the talks that such talks between the Chinese and British Governments regarding arrangements for elections in Hong Kong in 1994/1995 have broken down. The responsibility is entirely on the British. In accordance with the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Chinese Government will resume the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. Therefore, the three-tier political structure for Hong Kong will be terminated with the end of British rule. Beginning 1 July 1997, the political framework of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be formed according to the decision of the NPC and the relevant stipulations of the Basic Law. Zhou Jue reiterated that Hong Kong will soon return to the embrace of the motherland. No force whatsoever can stop this. The Chinese Government and people have full confidence and ability to resume the exercise of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong on time; to implement the principle of "one country, two systems"; and to carry out the Basic Law in order to realize a smooth transition and to maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. Asked about whether Deng Xiaoping will attend tomorrow's session, Zhou Jue said: Comrade Deng Xiaoping is the chief architect of China's reform, opening up, and socialist modernization drive; as well as the founder of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is the Marxism in contemporary China. He enjoys the love and esteem of the Chinese people of all nationalities. You will know whether he will attend the session when it opens tomorrow.
