FR941007-2-00139 FR941007-2-00083 There are many allegations that the traditional social service systems, including vocational rehabilitation, are ill- equipped to respond to the need for services. For example, the 1991 National Survey of Vocational Rehabilitation (VR) and AIDS, distributed to State VR agencies by the American Rehabilitation Association (ARA), concludes that there are numerous barriers to the delivery of rehabilitative services to persons living with HIV/AIDS. These barriers include the fears and anxieties of vocational rehabilitation staff, public stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, confidentiality issues, lack of knowledge about the rehabilitation needs of persons with HIV/AIDS, and the need for more extensive services than those currently available through the vocational rehabilitation system. Factors in the natural course of the disease, including remissions, exacerbations, compounding, rates of decline, and many other characteristics that are not well understood in terms of their relation to disability and to support services may affect the suitability of existing service models to meet the needs of PLWA. In addition, there is some indication that the patterns of the disease, and the associated service needs, are different for minority individuals, who are likely to enter the health care service system later in the illness, and for women, for whom not only the support needs but also the natural course of the disease appear to differ (Campbell, et al., 1989). Many rehabilitation experts hypothesize that the approaches and techniques that have been developed to address issues regarding other types of disability are relevant to, and will be effective in, addressing issues regarding HIV/AIDS. These approaches include secondary prevention, vocational rehabilitation, job accommodations, barrier removal, peer support, independent living, personal assistance services, public education, integrated model service systems, job sharing, and advocacy. However, the most effective application of disability and rehabilitative approaches to HIV/AIDS is dependent upon first increasing knowledge about the pattern(s) of disabling consequences typically associated with the disease process; the functional capacities associated with various stages of the disease process; and the duration and intensity of various types of supports needed for this population at different stages of the disease process. Any research designed to address these issues must ensure that findings can be applied cross-gender and to culturally diverse populations. Any project to be funded under this priority is expected to be familiar with, and to coordinate and cooperate with, the relevant AIDS research activities of the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and with other major current or planned research initiatives. Proposed Priority An R&D project on HIV/AIDS and disability shall_ •Analyze existing data on HIV/AIDS, prepare population estimates and statistical profiles of adults with HIV/AIDS, including such factors as: age; age at onset or diagnosis of HIV infection and AIDS diagnosis or length of time with the disease; ethnic background; gender; educational level; employment experience and current employment status; marital and socioeconomic status; patterns of SSI, SSDI, Medicaid, and Medicare enrollment; and standard demographic factors; •Document the natural course of the disability consequences of the disease process, including iatrogenic disabilities, and document the functional losses associated with various stages of the disease process, taking into consideration such factors as age, gender, ethnic background, and concomitant disabilities; •Identify and assess the major disability-related societal barriers confronted by adults with HIV/AIDS, including unemployment, discrimination, lack of accommodations, and lack of opportunities to maintain independent living, distinguishing patterns by age, gender, ethnic background, and urban or rural location;
