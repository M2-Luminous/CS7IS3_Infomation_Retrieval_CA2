FR940224-0-00043 FR940224-0-00006 Section 772.1 is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to inform exporters that validated license conditions are terminated when items are decontrolled. Exporters who have received validated licenses containing restrictive conditions for items that are now eligible for shipment under a general license (e.g., General Licenses GFW, GCT, or G-DEST) may use the appropriate general license to export such items, subject only to the specific conditions that apply to the use of these general licenses. Exporters should be aware, however, of the general prohibitions in §771.2(c) concerning the use of general licenses and of the validated license requirements that apply to certain nuclear, missile technology, or chemical-biological weapons activities described in §778.3, §778.7, §778.8, and §778.9. Finally, this rule revises the Technical Note under the heading ``Information on How to Calculate Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP)'' at the end of Category 4 in the Commerce Control List (CCL). The changes in this Technical Note may affect the control status of certain computers (e.g., eligibility for export under General License G-DEST, GFW, or GCT), as well as whether or not a computer is treated as a supercomputer. Saving Clause Shipments of items removed from general license authorizations as a result of this regulatory action that were on dock for loading, on lighter, laden aboard an exporting carrier, or en route aboard carrier to a port of export pursuant to actual orders for export before March 10, 1994 may be exported under the previous general license provisions up to and including March 24, 1994. Any such items not actually exported before midnight March 24, 1994, require a validated export license in accordance with this regulation. Rulemaking Requirements 1. This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. 2. This rule involves collections of information subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). These collections have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control numbers 0694&hyph;0005, 0694&hyph;0010, 0694&hyph;0013, 0694&hyph;0015, and 0694&hyph;0073. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficient to warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, under section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has to be or will be prepared. 5. The provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553, requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public participation, and a delay in the effective date, are inapplicable because this regulation involves a military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Further, no other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public comment be given for this rule. Therefore, this regulation is issued in final form. Although there is no formal comment period, public comments on this regulation are welcome on a continuing basis. Comments should be submitted to Willard Fisher, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration, Department of Commerce, P.O. Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.
