The main trend is a continuation of developments toward relaxation. The disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted in a thorough disintegration of the bipolar structure centered on U.S.-Soviet confrontation. Although we still cannot say that military confrontation between the United States and Russia has disappeared, the degree of tension and acuteness has been greatly decreased. The major countries of the world have shifted their attention to economic development and increasing their comprehensive national strength. Meanwhile, they are also readjusting their respective military strategies. According to information from Western research institutions, the world's military expenditures fell by 15 percent in 1992 (the main reason is that Russia and other CIS states, as well as the European countries, have reduced their military expenditure by a big margin). This is the first big reduction since the end of World War II. Troop numbers in the various major countries have also been reduced. At the same time, the pace of arms control talks has been accelerated. At the beginning of this year, the United States and Russia concluded a second stage of talks on reducing strategic nuclear weapons. They agreed that both sides would retain 3,000 to 3,500 strategic nuclear warheads each by the year 2003, which means a two-thirds reduction in existing nuclear weapons. An agreement has finally been reached on banning chemical weapons and a convention on banning the production, research, and use of chemical weapons and thoroughly destroying existing chemical weapons has been signed. There is also declining trend in the arms trade. In 1992, the volume of arms delivered fell by 25 percent. Judging from the regional situation, regional conflicts and limited wars, which were affected by the contention between the two superpowers in the past, have been scaled down. Many of them have been resolved through political channels. In short, the danger of world war and the possibility of face- to-face confrontations between the big powers has been further reduced. Relaxation is the main trend of development in the current world military situation, and this trend is likely to be preserved in the future. However, on the other hand, as the post-cold war world is entering a period of the establishment of a new international strategic pattern, various forces are undergoing a process of breaking up and reorganization. Factors of instability and uncertainty in the world military situation have also increased. Looking at the present and for a period to come, the following characteristics merit our attention: 1. All of the world's major countries are carrying out readjustments of their military strategies in order to suit the new situation after the Cold War. Although they have different emphases, a common trend is to change from making preparations for large-scale wars to dealing with regional conflicts, and from mainly dealing with practical military threats to mainly dealing with potential threats. This can be seen from their army building policies. They are all reducing troop numbers while increasing force quality, and they are carrying out reforms of the organizational establishment of their army units, force structures, and command systems. They are all trying to establish small but highly trained and highly mobile military forces, while attaching special importance to strengthening their navies and air forces. What merit our attention is that the development of science and technology will continue to play an enormous role in propelling the development of military forces in the future. Revolutionary changes will possibly take place in the development of military equipment or in types of war. This was seen especially clearly during the Gulf War. Now, while reducing forces and eliminating obsolete equipment, various countries are concentrating their strength on developing conventional high-tech weaponry and equipment. For this reason, military expenditure on scientific research is increasing in many countries. Moreover, combat theories and techniques have also been developed. A general trend is to stress combined arms on a larger scale and in larger areas. Some traditional combat theories and techniques are already outdated. In short, under condition where various countries are reducing their forces, competition among them regarding the quality of their military strength has begun quietly. 2. The disintegration of the bipolar structure has led to a serious imbalance in military strength throughout the world and the trend of U.S. military intervention has further developed. For a period to come, the United States will continue to hold a dominant position in international military affairs. Although Russia is still powerful in terms of military strength, it is difficult for it to continue to maintain military confrontation with the United States like the former Soviet Union. The United States has become the only superpower in the military sphere, capable of using military force on a large scale in the world. This will be an important factor affecting the military situation. At present, the United States is resolved to "maintain a leading position in the world." While appropriately reducing the scale of its military deployment, it is doing its best to preserve its military presence throughout the world. At the same time, it is trying hard to establish a new military pattern in various regions on the basis of the security structures of the Cold War period, with itself at the core. The United States' dominant position is also reflected by the increasing trend of intervention in the affairs of other countries through its military policy. Meanwhile, the trend of multipolarization has also developed in the military sphere. Over the past few years, when taking military action abroad, the United States has had to seek assistance and support from its allies or make use of the banner of the United Nations. This shows that although it is powerful in terms of strength, its ability still falls short of its wishes, and there are many restrictions. In particular, the rise of Germany and Japan in the economic field could possibly intensify centrifugal forces among the Western countries, which could finally become a new challenge to the United States. Russia, which is in the midst of deep economic and political crises, is still declaring its wish to preserve its position as a major world power. While reducing its military forces by a big margin, it has preserved a plan to modernize its strategic nuclear forces. Moreover, the vast numbers of large, medium, and small countries also form a latent force that cannot be neglected. In recent years, they have made positive efforts to promote regional military cooperation in order to resist intervention by foreign forces. Although for a short period to come there will be no fundamental changes in contests of military strength throughout the world, judging from a long-term point of view, this will be an important factor promoting the development of multipolarization in the world's military situation. 3. With the end of Cold War, important changes have taken place in the security concepts of many countries and the role of economic factors in international affairs is increasing. As various countries have shifted the focus of their attention to domestic economic construction and have become increasingly interdependent in the economic field, they more frequently consider interstate relations from the angle of economic interest. In their security policies, almost all countries take security in economic affairs as their main objective, while submitting military construction to the needs of economic construction. However, the rise of economic factors does not mean the role of military power in international affairs is not important. First, the role of military power is still considered seriously by various countries, especially the major powers. In consideration of their economic interests, some countries have attached greater importance to the protection of offshore resources and trade routes. After achieving successful development in the economic field, they have accelerated the pace of arms development. Some countries in the Asia-Pacific region and some Arab countries in the Middle East countries have been increasing their military expenditure over the past few years. Second, amid economic competition, nationalist sentiments are also growing. As a result, some countries have attached greater importance to bolstering their military strength in an attempt to make up for their inadequate economic strength and use this as an important means to protect their interests. Lastly, various big Western powers still regard military strength as a deterrent force and means of attack to deal with so-called "threats" from the Third World. Their gigantic military industries cannot be effectively converted to civilian production on a large scale now. As a matter of fact, these countries still maintain very high military expenditures. 4. With the further reduction in the danger of world war, regional armed conflicts and limited wars will become the main form of military conflict. Since the drastic changes in the East European countries in 1989 and the disintegration of the Soviet Union, a number of regional conflicts have taken place in the Balkan region along the borders of southern Europe, which extend northwards to the former Soviet Union, forming a new hot spot of instability. However, in general, the world situation is developing toward relaxation, and regional conflicts have also been restricted to a certain extent. Generally, there situation is changeable, sometimes tense, sometimes relaxed. Although some big powers have interfered in or had a hand in regional conflicts, they have not sparked military confrontation between the big powers. Nevertheless, we cannot conclude from this that the danger of regional armed conflict and limited wars is not important. In various regions of the world, potential hot spots exist, which could lead to the involvement of major powers and regional powers in direct military confrontation. In its new "regional defense strategy," the United States proposes that "two limited wars should be won simultaneously." It is also making earnest preparations for undertaking combat operations when necessary. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility of sudden incidents occurring.
