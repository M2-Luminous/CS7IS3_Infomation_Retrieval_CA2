All the nuclear-and defense-related cities face the same problems -- falling production, unemployment, environmental pollution. The committee for industry, energy, and transport is planning, as part of preparations for the hearing, to hold a conference in Tomsk-7 at the end of June with representatives of the other closed cities and interested departments.
