Habib Ben Said reviews some of the topics discussed at the Palestinian national authority's meeting in Tunis before it assumes its duties in Gaza and Jericho: [Ben Said] The participants continued the series of meetings today that began last evening and that were especially devoted to discussing the issue of distributing the duties within the Palestinian national authority, which will assume its responsibilities in the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho in its capacity as the Palestinian government during the transitional period. It was learned today that the number of portfolios in the government has been limited to about 22 ministries. So far, 20 Palestinian figures have been appointed to the membership of the national authority, the last of which was the appointment of Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, the independent personality in the PLO Executive Committee. This appointment was announced today. The Palestinian transitional government is expected comprise 24 personalities -- as stipulated in the 4 May agreement in Cairo between the PLO and Israel. Two seats remain vacant, and these are generally believed to be reserved for the Palestinian opposition if it wants to join the government. It is worth pointing out here that Palestinian leader 'Abbas Zaki is currently holding consultations with some Palestinian factions in Damascus to convince them of the need to join the government and occupy some ministerial posts in the National Authority. On the other hand, it has been said that the participants have also discussed the draft charter of a new government. In its outline, the draft affirms the necessity to adopt a democratic and rational type of behavior, which is based on the separation between the powers and the need to make supervisory mechanisms available to avoid any extemporization or autocracy, bearing in mind that the program of the draft document has been prepared by a specialized committee over the past two days. It controls the prerogatives of the Palestinian national authority, its duties, and the progress of its internal work, in addition to deciding the future program for this transitional government until elections are held in Gaza and Jericho before the end of this year.
