In this regard, Hanoi and Washington have recently signed an agreement to set up liaison offices. [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0956 GMT on 27 May 94 in a Dhaka-datelined report adds the following: "Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam said here Friday that Vietnam favors the resumption of full diplomatic relations with the United States as soon as possible, but that a decision is up to the Americans. "`We are ready, but the ball is in the American court and I regret that I cannot say when full diplomatic ties will be restored between our two countries,' Cam said as he wound up a three-day visit to Bangladesh. "Cam's comments at a press conference followed the announcement that Vietnam and the United States had taken another step toward diplomatic normalization by announcing that they would open liaison offices in each other's capitals. Cam said the only thing holding up normal diplomatic ties was US domestic politics, an apparent reference to pressure by American groups which claim Vietnam has not fully accounted for US servicemen still listed as missing in action from the Vietnam War. "I am sure it will come sooner or later. Ties have improved since the (President Bill) Clinton administration lifted the economic embargo on Vietnam" in February, he said. Bangladesh opened a diplomatic mission in Hanoi last November. "While here, Cam met President Abdur Rahman Biswas, Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Foreign Minister Mustafizur Rahman and business leaders. The two countries pledged in two agreements signed Thursday to work toward improving ties. Cam said the pacts gave a legal framework for cooperation and his visit here would promote mutual understanding and trust. "As for Vietnam's historic rival, China, Cam said Vietnam wanted a `bilateral dialogue' with Beijing to resolve territorial disputes on land and sea, saying `both sides should restrain themselves from force or the threat to use force.' "Asked to comment on the US decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trading status, Cam said only that Vietnam -- one of only nine countries which does not enjoy MFN -- wanted it as soon as possible for itself. As for the human rights situation in Vietnam, Cam said the Vietnamese had regained their rights only after a hard struggle for independence. "`We will promote them further to make a government for the people, of the people and controlled by the people,' he added, but `first comes the right to live in freedom and independence.'"]
