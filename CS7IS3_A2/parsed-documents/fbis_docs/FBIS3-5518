The agency said the nation's economy is still undergoing adjustment and in an overall slump, practically unchanged from expressions used in the previous month's report. An agency official briefing reporters said there are some signs showing an upswing such as household spending, durable good sales and spending for leisure. "But for such positive indicators the levels are still low and there are too many other negative indicators," the official said. Private-sector capital spending plans for fiscal year 1994 that starts April 1 will decline 4.5 percent from the previous year, according to a quarterly survey conducted by the Bank of Japan in February. On the labor front, unemployment has steadily increased and job offers have decreased, particularly in the manufacturing sector. The report noted that inventory reduction has progressed but industrial output has been lackluster. Concerning business failures, the figure for companies going broke stood at the previous year's level, it said. The only bright spots are public works spending, boosted by the government's efforts to stimulate the economy, and booming housing construction, buoyed by low interest rates, the report said.
