I have reporter Rey Rodriguez on the line, who is accompanying the foreign minister as a representative of the Cuban radio and television network and PRENSA LATINA. Rodriguez will give us further details on the foreign minister's activities, for all Cubans. Rodriguez, I think it is appropiate to tell the Cuban people about the initial activities in Jakarta of the Cuban delegation headed by Roberto Robaina. Greetings from Havana, Rey. [Rodriguez] Well. Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina arrived in Jakarta tonight at approximately 1930 for an official visit to Indonesia, the first leg of his tour of seven Asian countries. At the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport, the foreign minister was welcomed by Sukhari Siregar, director of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry's American Department, and by Latin American ambassadors accredited to this country. When asked by the local press, Robaina said that one of the objectives of this trip is to describe the true situation in his country, as well as the reforms being carried out in the economic area. Concerning Robaina's objective in the commercial area, which is to strengthen trade relations with this country, Robaina said: [Begin Robaina recording] From the commercial point of view, there are already important links with Indonesia. But above all, there are new possibilities for investments in my country. In the medical and pharmaceutical industry, and in the area of (?meteorology), Cuba has obtained modest results which I think may be of interest to you. In the particular case of Cuban relations with Indonesia, you are aware of certain negotiations that have already been established. These areas are as important as rice, oil, and [word indistinct] which we hope will be increased. [end recording] This is all we can tell you about the Cuban foreign minister's activities today in Jakarta. Are you listening there, Cavada? [Cavada] Yes. We read you clearly, Rey. We wish to thank you for the work you are doing and for providing us with further information on the activities of the Cuban foreign minister and his retinue in Jakarta.
