Sovkhoz Director Becomes Kulak Right Away"] [Text] Alma-Ata [Almaty] -- Government documents aimed at implementing radical reform in Kazakhstan's agriculture were published in the Republic press in March. There are now distinct prospects that private owners could finally emerge in the agrarian sector. The Cabinet of Ministers ratified the provisional statute on the sale of state agricultural enterprises into the private ownership of citizens (first phase). In accordance with this statute, labor collective members and persons retired on pension from a given enterprise and residing on its territory, as well as social sphere employees, have the right to buy out 49 percent of the redeemable part of the property subject to the property shares assigned to each. An "outside" buyer -- a citizen of the Republic of Kazakhstan having an agricultural education and a record of practical work in agriculture of not less than five years -- can acquire 20 percent. He buys sovkhoz property at a closed commercial tender, paying in installments with a mandatory initial payment of not less than 31 percent of its cost. The remaining 31 percent of the state property is also transferred to the buyer, but for temporary use for a period of not more than five years. He can also receive for temporary use for a maximum of two years the remaining unsold part of the agricultural enterprise's state property. The distribution of standard-size tracts of land (lots) is carried out according to the same procedure as governs the distribution of the property. However, President N. Nazarbayev has issued a special edict allocating 10 percent of the redeemable part of sovkhoz property free of charge to a sovkhoz director who has worked in this post for not less than 20 years. The director can acquire a further 10 percent for temporary use for a period of up to five years. If the farm increases its efficiency and attains stable levels of agricultural production and improves its socioeconomic indicators, the director can acquire this share free of charge over the following five years. Thus the sovkhoz director becomes the biggest property owner: Only the remaining 80 percent of the redeemable part of the property will be distributed between labor collective members and "outside" buyers. Kolkhozes have been recommended to use this sovkhoz method. Therefore, property owners could emerge in the Kazakhstani countryside in the near future, but, once again, not property owners in the full sense -- no constitutionally enshrined institution of private ownership of land exists in Kazakhstan to this day. Land shares can be transferred to citizens only on long-term leases for a period of up to 99 years, with the right of inheritance.
