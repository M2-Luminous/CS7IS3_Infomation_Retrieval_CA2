FR940906-2-00091 FR940906-2-00071 As noted above, MSRB believes that the proposed rule change will facilitate clearance and settlement of municipal securities and, therefore, is consistent with the provisions of the Act. B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition MSRB does not believe that the rule change will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act because it will apply equally to all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers. C. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Comments on the Proposed Rule Change Received From Members, Participants, or Others In March 1994, MSRB requested comment on a draft amendment to Rule G&hyph;34 that would require dealers to apply for depository eligibility of all new issue municipal securities. The draft amendment included exemptions for issues not meeting the criteria set by depositories for eligibility and for new issues under $1 million in par value. MSRB received ten comment letters in response to the draft amendments. 5 The comments were generally supportive; however, some commenters suggested modifications to the draft amendments. 5 Letters from A.G. Edwards & Sons, Inc.; The Cashiers' Association of Wall Street, Inc.; Fleet Securities; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; The New York Clearing House; The Public Securities Association; The Regional Municipal Operations Association; The Securities Industry Association; Summers & Company, Inc.; and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.
