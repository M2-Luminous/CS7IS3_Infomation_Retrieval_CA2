CONTENTS: 1. Material, Human Support for Chinese Muslims Urged 2. Support for al-Azhar To Combat Religious Illiteracy 3. Refresher Course Held for Mosque Imams 4. New Course for Islamic World Imams and Preachers MATERIAL, HUMAN SUPPORT FOR CHINESE MUSLIMS URGED In a 350-word column on page one, 'AQIDATI's board chairman Samir Rajab reports on his recent visit to China. He says he noticed this time that some of the Muslims there were more optimistic and hopeful regarding the future. He wonders whether the economic open-door policy in China has been extended to cover religious affairs as well. After noting that this was a good sign, he says: "Frankly, unless the Islamic states act effectively over all this vast far region, the Muslims will lose some of the ground they have won." He warns that "we must support these temporary gains with our material and human resources." SUPPORT FOR AL-AZHAR TO COMBAT RELIGIOUS ILLITERACY In a 100-word report on page two, Nadiyah al-Sayyid writes that the Specialized National Councils [SNC] under Dr. 'Abd-al-Qadir Hatim have called for the need to place all the necessary resources at the disposal of al-Azhar so it can shoulder its responsibilities on the issues of the call and fatwa. This can be done by reviving the senior ulema committee or by reinforcing the effectiveness of the Islamic Research Institute, emphasizing its role in combating religious illiteracy and publicizing Islam's views on issues affecting modern society. "The arena must not be left free to incorrect interpretations by religious extremists." The SNC recommends that the Awqaf Ministry supervise publicly funded and built mosques and provide them with specialized preachers who can give correct religious education to the youths to steer them away from extremist ideologies. The SNC also recommends that consideration be given to limiting Friday prayers to major mosques "to avoid wrong interpretations and endeavors by Islamic extremists." REFRESHER COURSE HELD FOR MOSQUE IMAMS In an unattributed 250-word report on page two, the paper writes that Awqaf Minister Dr. Muhammad 'Ali Mahjub and Deputy al-Azhar Rector Shaykh Sayyid Sa'ud have distributed certificates to 50 imams and scholars who attended a course for mosque imams from the governorates of Suez, Port Said, Ismailia, and Sinai. Dr. Mahjub explained that the course is considered "a big step to assist the scholars in discussing the current issues with the youths." The experiment will be extended to all governorates. NEW COURSE FOR ISLAMIC WORLD IMAMS AND PREACHERS A 75-word report on page three says that the 25th course for Islamic world imams and preachers organized by al-Azhar will begin on 1 May. The course will be attended by 30 imams and preachers from Uzbekistan, Moscow, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Zaire, Liberia, and South Africa.
