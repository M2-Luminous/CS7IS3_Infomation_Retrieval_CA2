FBIS4-52812 "dreas093_d_94016" FBIS-EAS-94-093 Daily Report 13 May 1994 South Korea Trade Ministry Said Not Interested in NAFTA Trade Ministry Said Not Interested in NAFTA SK1305012094 Seoul YONHAP in English 0052 GMT 13 May 94 SK1305012094 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, May 13 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean Government has concluded that it is premature to consider joining the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) since membership would likely bring more harm than good to the country. The Trade, Industry, and Energy Ministry said Friday it will state that now is not the right time to discuss joining the regional free trade accord, which took effect early this year, if Mexico brings up the matter during bilateral trade ministerial talks on May 16-17. Korea has not yet been approached by NAFTA member countries -- the United States, Canada and Mexico -- to join them in the free trade agreement through either official or unofficial channels, a ministry official said. "But we want to clearly state our position now because Korea has been under suspicion of intentionally spreading rumors of its becoming a NAFTA member," he said. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor also brushed aside the possibility of including Korea in the regional trade arrangement at a Senate committee hearing last February. He said Chile and other Latin American countries would be the first candidates to jump aboard and distant nations like Singapore and Korea were not under consideration at present. The initial idea behind NAFTA reportedly involves turning it into "AFTA" -- an American free trade agreement -- that could flex its muscles against rival alliances across the Atlantic and the Pacific. The ministry coordinated the views of economy-related agencies and organizations and concluded that it is too early to consider NAFTA membership. Supporting this conclusion, traders' bodies like the Korea Foreign Trade Association (KFTA) and the Federation of Korean Industries (FKI) have said that joining NAFTA would cause more harm than good. Some foreign media have reported that Seoul and Washington secretly agreed to link Korea to NAFTA, but these reports proved groundless, a KFTA official said. The Korea Trade Promotion Corp. (KOTRA) also pointed out that tariff benefits from joining NAFTA were limited and the disadvantages great due to complete agricultural and services market opening. It recommended that NAFTA membership be considered long after the country adjusts to the impact of the Uruguay Round accord.
