Waigel deplored that the IMF underestimated the dynamism in the new laender. The IMF predicted a growth of 0.8 percent, but Waigel considers 1.5 percent possible. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer does not expect any new criticism of its monetary policy. The difference in interest rates between Germany and the United States has declined from 6 percent to 1.5 percent in the past two years. The long-term U.S. interest rates have in the meantime even risen above the German level. This was possible without a change concerning the exchange rates. The two German representatives reject plans by the IMF to create new special drawing rights worth $50 billion. Waigel described the IMF argument that this would lead to additional funds for Russia as "shortsighted." Aid for Russia must be provided in the form of conditioned loans. Waigel will meet for talks with his U.S. counterpart Lloyd Bentsen. He will discuss, among other things, problems concerning the admission of German companies to U.S. stock exchanges.
