In his speech, Roman said that the only way to solve the current crisis situation is to conclude a national pact among the PD, the Democratic Convention of Romania [CDR], and the Social Democracy Party of Romania [PDSR]. The PD chairman also briefed the meeting's attendants about the PD's [separate] negotiations that are currently under way with the CDR and the PDSR and presented the party's stance regarding the [6 March] government reshuffle and the possibility of early elections. Referring to the latter issue, Roman said that in the PD's view, early elections would lead to a disaster, since the electorate, which was betrayed during the last electoral campaign, has lost confidence in everyone and everything.
