Based on the method of simultaneous local hologram recording on a photo-thermoplastic (PTP) disk with infra-red laser heating, and a method of automatic recording of two- dimensional Fourier holograms with uniform characteristics over the entire PTP surface and control of the recording process by a personal computer, a PTP disk with a holographic recording was developed. A picture of the PTP disk is shown, and the optical vector-matrix multiplication process is described. Information recording density of 2x10[.sup]5[/]bit/mm[.sup]2[/] was experimentally obtained by this method. It can provide a 1 Gbit capacity of the holographic PTP disk with a 133 mm diameter. Diffraction effectiveness, obtained for Fourier hologram digital information with a diameter of 1 mm, was 5% while signal-to- noise ratio was not smaller than 70:1. Prospects of developing an optical-electronic neural network (OENN) using a holographic disk (HD) in systems for optical information processing appear to be the most attractive. The accuracy and speed of signal processing with the OENN-HD system is analyzed. Comparison between the best electronic neural computers indicates that the OENN-HD parameters are not inferior to the parameters of the multiprocessor computing system ``Connection Machine-2'' Figures 5, tables 1, references 18: 10 Russian, 8 Western
