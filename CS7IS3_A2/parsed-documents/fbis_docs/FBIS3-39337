In successive rounds of consultations conducted by the secretary general and by the allied military commands, the Spanish representatives have replied that Spain's contribution to resolving the conflict is more than sufficient for the present. Only if the air operations were to be prolonged and it were necessary to relieve some of the aircraft present in the area could the still valid offer of six F-18 fighter bombers once made by Spain be made good. The latest of these unofficial approaches was made through the military representatives to NATO a month ago, and the response was negative, as on previous occasions. Although in principle it was questioned whether the Spanish Air Force could carry out "surgical strikes," military sources state that the F-18 is the best fighter aircraft in service in Europe, and that there are no technical or operational objections to taking part in the operation if the government gives its approval. Nevertheless, with around 160 aircraft at his disposal, Admiral Michael Boorda, chief of NATO's southern command, has more than enough resources to eliminate the batteries besieging Sarajevo if the United Nations authorizes strikes when the ultimatum expires 21 February. In addition to the United States, the UK, France, the Netherlands, and Turkey have replied affirmatively to the request to contribute aircraft to NATO's plans. Under these conditions, Spanish participation is not deemed necessary, and so its refusal has not caused annoyance in NATO. Blue Helmets' Safety A different situation would arise if an escalation in the conflict necessitated prolonging the air operations, and it were necessary to relieve other allies' aircraft. The Spanish Government once said that the offer of the six F-18's at the Zaragoza base was confined to controlling the airspace, but it seems unlikely that Spain could refuse, for instance, to defend the UN troops when its own blue helmets are under the NATO aircraft's protection. The argument used by Spain for not taking part in the mission is that it is already contributing more than enough to resolving the conflict with its 1,200 troops deployed on the scene, as well as two frigates, a P-3 Orion aircraft, and a Civil Guard patrol boat, which are monitoring the embargo on Serbia. This is not being said explicitly, because other countries are in the same situation, but the desire to preserve some neutrality in order not to endanger the blue helmets also carries weight. Spain even refused to send air traffic controllers to guide the aircraft which are to protect the UN troops, for fear that this could be interpreted as a hostile action by the warring sides, and only did so in the wake of the other countries with troops in the area. The protection afforded by these aircraft, and, above all, NATO's threat to respond vigorously to any aggression against the UN forces, is now the only effective defense for the troops.
