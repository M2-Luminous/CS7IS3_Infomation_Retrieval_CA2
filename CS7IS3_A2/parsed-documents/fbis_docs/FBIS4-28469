The measure, a response to the U.S. demand in the Japan-U.S. framework talks, will be implemented as part of such insurance system reforms as allowing life and non-life insurance companies to participate in each other's business through their subsidiaries. The idea is to begin with the insurance policies geared toward large corporations, then gradually and flexibly broaden the scope of liberalization so that insurance companies can accommodate the change. The aim is to reduce premium rates through competition among the insurance companies, thus lessening the burden on policy holders. Under the current system, such major non-life insurance policies as those for fire, casualty, and automobile insurance are exempt from the application of the Antimonopoly Law. Premium rates for those policies types are about the same throughout the industry. Moreover, the non-life insurance industry's Insurance Premium Rate Calculation Team calculates rates on the basis of the current conditions of premiums paid by companies and the administrative costs involved, then submits them to the MOF for approval. The new system will enable insurance companies to set their premiums independently according to their own expenses within a certain limit -- for example, 20 to 30 percent -- above or below the premium rates put forth by the Calculation Team. Companies wishing to exceed the limit in either direction will be allowed to do so after submitting to the MOF the basis for calculating their premium rates and gaining the ministry's approval. Even in that case, however, given the need to secure the financial resources for insurance payments, the maximum discount rate is not expected to exceed 40 percent. If the setting of insurance premium rates is liberalized, insurance companies are expected to set substantially higher premium rates and exact more demanding conditions for high-risk subscribers. Therefore, the scope of liberalization is foreseen as being limited at first only to such corporate insurance policies as fire insurance for factories, then expanded in stages to other types of policies. But in the case of automobile liability insurance, which is compulsory, liberalization is likely to be deferred in order to avoid the situation of insurance companies being unable to pay sufficient insurance money to accident victims.
