This is the view of the Party of Democratic Action [SDA] for Mostar. Such an outcome of a 10-month-long siege of Mostar by the Croatian aggressor would present a direct award to the attackers, who have committed unprecedented crimes in this region against the Bosniak Muslim people. Contrary to such a regressive option, the Bosniak Muslim people from Mostar and the Neretva River valley are committed to an open and cosmopolitan city. The political representatives of this nation at all the future political activities aimed at solving the Bosnia-Herzegovina drama will promote only this option, based on five strategic principles, including the demand that all the expelled and displaced people of Mostar and the Neretva River valley return to their homes of origin, where their personal safety and protection of property will be guaranteed, that the crimes and criminals on all the warring sides are punished, and that, in future solutions for Mostar -- in accordance with the initiatives of the European Union -- their direct participation in the administration of this city is guaranteed. These are the fundamental commitments of the SDA for Mostar, whose newly appointed municipal committee again reiterates that there can be no deviation from the party program defined clearly earlier, and the principles of the struggle for Mostar and its fate. As Mr. Safet Orucevic, chairman of the municipal committee, stressed, the SDA for Mostar extends its full political support to the Bosnia-Herzegovina state delegation led by Mr. Alija Izetbegovic in its attempts at definitely solving the bloody Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis through political means.
