The fabrication of false reports about the existence of camps for the training of Kurdish guerrillas in Troodos is part of this attempt. According to CyBC's [Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation] reliable information, the Attila [Turkish troops in Cyprus] and pseudostate forces have been placed on a state of alert in order to make an impression. A competent government source told CyBC this evening that the Turkish claims about the existence of camps for the training of Kurds in the free areas of Cyprus are absolutely unfounded. The source also stressed that these are fabrications that aim at serving Turkish propaganda and diverting public attention from the Turkish side's responsibility for the deadlock in the proximity talks. The same source recalled that in the past Turkish propaganda also tried to present Cyprus as a center for the training of Armenian commandos. If the Turks have any evidence, the source stressed, let them submit such evidence to the United Nations for investigation.
