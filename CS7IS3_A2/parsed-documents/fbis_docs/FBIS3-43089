P. Krivelev, V. V. Chepkiy; UDC 621.396.96] [Abstract] The coefficients of signal spectrum logarithm expansion along base function systems may be used as a recognition signature. Feasibility of joined measurement of the energy and non-energy signal parameters, reflected from targets is analyzed. Algorithms are developed for estimating structural parameters applicable to the conditions of regular measurements. A system is examined of structural parameters for targets' identification. Spectrum analysis of complex signal envelopes, reflected from the ``i'' and ``k'' class signals indicate that they exhibit values of structural parameters _b_[.sup]_n_[/] and _a_[.sup]_n_[/]. For example, the absence of parameters _b_[.sup]_n_[/] and _a_[.sub]_n_[/] at _n_> 2, constitute a characteristic feature of the spectrum of signals reflected from radar targets, combined in a class of single targets. Therefore, these parameters may be used as signatures of multiple-point targets in the background of single-point targets. References 5 Russian.
