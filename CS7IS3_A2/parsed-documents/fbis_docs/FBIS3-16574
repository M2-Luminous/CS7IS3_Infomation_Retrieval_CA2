A report on this question was delivered by the chairman of the standing commission for state construction, Uladzimir Lewchyk. Here is an excerpt from his speech: [Begin Lewchyk recording] As for the time limit for the collection of signatures, the commission within the framework of time for preparing the holding of elections of the president has tried to make these time limits as long as possible. They are 20 days, including time for forming the initiative group. The mechanism for collection of signatures (?in many ways) corresponds to the mechanism for collecting signatures for holding a referendum. In accordance with the Constitution of the Republic -- which was passed -- elections for the president are held using two rounds of voting. The candidate who receives more than half the votes of electors participating in the election is considered elected president. Elections are considered to have taken place if more than half of the registered voters participate. The second round of the elections is also conducted according to these rules, with the two candidates receiving the greatest number of votes in the first round. The draft law envisions the possibility of holding repeat elections for the president if none of the candidates is elected on the first or second round of voting, or in the event of the elections being recognized as not having taken place or invalid. According to preliminary estimates of the Central Electoral Commission, the presidential elections will cost us 116 billion rubles. [passage omitted]
