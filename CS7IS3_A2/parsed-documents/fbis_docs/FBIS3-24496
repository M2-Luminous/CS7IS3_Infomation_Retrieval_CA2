N. Beltyugov, S. G. Protsenko; UDC 621.382] [Abstract] A thin-film dielectric light polarizer is proposed for analysis and control of polarization conditions. The polarizer performance is based on the earlier established phenomenon of polarization anisotropy of optical characteristic of the dielectric layer with corrugated edges. Unlike the existing thin-film dielectric polarizers, the proposed optical element is a relatively simple construction intended for operation under a normal angle of incidence. For experimental testing of the proposed device, samples of dielectric polarizer were constructed and its function is described. The experiments demonstrated a feasibility of developing thin-film polarization element based on a dielectric layer with corrugated edges. Compared to the polarization structures made of metal, the technology of constructing corrugated structures on the surface of a dielectric is more simple, while polarization efficiency of the tested samples was sufficient for application with some optoelectronic devices.
