FR940613-1-00007 FR940613-1-00002 The Board also proposes to eliminate the second part of the definition, which would make the manner in which an institution classifies a loan irrelevant to its treatment for HMDA purposes. This part of the definition was originally intended to minimize the regulatory burden on financial institutions, by not requiring an institution to report a loan as a home improvement loan on its HMDA-LAR if the institution did not record the loan as a home improvement loan for other purposes. Many institutions now indicate that they would like to report loans that in fact are for home improvement purposes, but they find it difficult to do so because the loans may not be ``classified'' in the institution's records as home improvement loans. Removing the classification test would resolve this problem. However, the Board solicits comment on the extent to which this proposed change would create significant compliance burdens for institutions that do not currently record such loans on the HMDA&hyph;LAR but now would be required to do so. Comment is also requested generally on the overall advantages and disadvantages of making this change. Section 203.4_Compilation of Loan Data Paragraph (a)_Data Format and Itemization Maintenance of LARs on current basis. The regulation currently requires covered institutions to report HMDA data for a given calendar year to supervisory agencies by March 1 of the following year, but does not specify when the data must be recorded on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. The Board proposes to require institutions to fully record transactions within one month after final action is taken (such as origination of a loan, or denial or withdrawal of an application). The Board believes this approach would help in improving the accuracy and timeliness of the HMDA data. Current-year registers would be available to examiners so that, if problems were occurring, the supervisory agency could work with the institution to ensure that errors were corrected well before the relatively brief period between the end of the year and the reporting deadline. Another advantage of the proposed change would be that examiners and the institution itself would have ready access to current data that could be helpful in assessing its fair lending and community reinvestment performance. The Board recognizes that some institutions may compile and geocode transactions (assign MSA, state, county, and census tract codes) on a batch basis, from time to time during the year or at year-end. The Board solicits comment on how burdensome institutions that currently follow this procedure would find it to record all the LAR information, including the geographic codes, on the HMDA&hyph;LAR within one month after final action. In addition, comment is requested on the extent to which any burden might be reduced if the requirement were to keep the HMDA&hyph;LAR up to date on a quarterly basis, rather than monthly. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes a thirty-day requirement on the HMDA-covered institutions it supervises; the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency proposed a similar requirement, and recently adopted a quarterly update requirement instead (see 59 FR 26411, May 20, 1994). The Board believes that a requirement to update the HMDA_LAR within one month after each transaction would be an important step toward improving the accuracy and timeliness of HMDA data reporting; if the compliance burden appeared to outweigh the advantages, however, the Board would consider alternatives such as quarterly updating. Reporting income. The Board proposes to revise the regulation to clarify how institutions report applicants' income and eliminate an internal inconsistency that now exists. Currently, ยง203.4(a)(7) of Regulation C provides that financial institutions shall collect data on ``income relied upon in processing the loan application.'' The instructions for completing the HMDA&hyph;LAR state that if no income is asked for or relied on in the credit decision, the lender may enter NA (not applicable) in this field (appendix A, paragraph V.D.5.c.). The Board proposes that lenders must report all income reflected on the application, including income of coapplicants, whether or not the lender relies on a particular source of income. If the lender determined, in the course of verifying information, that some portion of the income reported by the applicant was overstated, the lender would enter the verified amount rather than the amount originally reported. Currently lenders need not report income for streamlined refinancings in which they neither ask for nor rely on income information. In addition, for privacy reasons, an institution need not record applicants' income on the HMDA&hyph;LAR for loans made to the institution's own employees. These rules will remain in place.
