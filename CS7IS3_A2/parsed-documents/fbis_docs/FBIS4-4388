Juppe, who arrived in Japan earlier in the day for a four-day stay, expressed his support in a meeting with his Japanese counterpart Tsutomu Hata, the officials said. Juppe said in a meeting with Hata it is necessary to enlarge the Security Council and the number of its permanent members to reflect the current world situation, they said. "In this context, it is natural for Japan and Germany" to acquire permanent seats, he was quoted as saying. Juppe added that France does not want to create new categories for permanent members such as creating permanent members without veto power. "France wants to maintain the current system," he reportedly told Hata, adding it is necessary to enlarge the council but also to maintain its efficiency. He also noted the need to take into account regional allocations when considering enlargement of the permanent members, the officials said. "In any case, France's position is flexible," Juppe was quoted as saying. Juppe's remarks were the clearest support yet by a French Government official for Japan's bid for a permanent seat, according to the officials. Hata said Japan would carry out its responsibilities within its capacity. Turning to problems involving North Korea's alleged development of nuclear weapons, Juppe and Hata agreed on the need for the international community to take a firm stance to tackle the issue, the officials said. Juppe told Hata that France, which currently chairs the U.N. Security Council, considers the problem very important and is very concerned, they said. Touching on the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, Juppe said France wants to have some kind of dialogue with APEC because it has close relations with the region, according to the officials. Hata replied that Japan thinks APEC should be open and wants to promote transparency of APEC's activities, the officials said. Also during the meeting covering a wide range of topics, Hata urged France to continue to refrain from conducting nuclear tests, they said.
