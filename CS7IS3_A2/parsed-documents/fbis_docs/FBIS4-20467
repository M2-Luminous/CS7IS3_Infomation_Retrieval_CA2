The apparatus, which uses microwave plasma-assisted sputtering techniques, has been utilized by the Sichuan University researchers to fabricate world-class lead-lanthanum-titanium (PLT) and lead-titanium (PT) thin films on a variety of substrates. The technique is particularly useful in fabricating ferroelectric thin films, high-Tc superconducting ceramic thin films, and superlattice films.
