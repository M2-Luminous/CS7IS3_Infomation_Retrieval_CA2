The recent hauls have ranged from 107mm artillery shells, fin stabilised 57mm air-to-ground rockets, 60mm mortars, high velocity grenades meant to be used from automatic grenade launchers (AGLs), disposal rocket launchers, grenades of NATO origin, long-range high frequency sophisticated wireless sets with multi-mode facilities and even portable solar panels for charging batteries for the wireless sets. Other gadgets include pen pistols of Japanese origin, silencers for both AK 56 assault rifles and 9mm pistols, telescope fitted `Dragnov' sniper rifles with infrared capability and a large variety of improvised explosive devices (IEDs). All this is in addition to the more conventional Kalashnikov series assault rifles, general purpose machine guns (GPMGs), rockets and rocket launchers, several types of grenades, anti-personal and anti-tank mines, and a wide range of revolvers/pistols and, of course, assorted ammunition, all of which have been recovered in mind-boggling numbers. For example, the quantum of explosives recovered by the army alone so far exceeded 6000 kg, with 2,500 kg having been recovered from a storage dump in one incident alone on December 6. "We have recovered enough weapons from the Valley to equip an infantry division," says Lt. Gen. S. Pdmanaban, the corps commander at Srinagar. "But we have managed to produce a counter of militancy in all aspects of tactics and weaponry. In many cases we have anticipated it," he adds confidently. Nevertheless, both the quantum and quality of weapons available to the Kashmiri and foreign militants not only indicates the level of Pakistani involvement in this strife-torn state but demonstrates the point that controlling terrorism in this scenic Valley will be a long haul yet. Fortunately, however, the militants have not been equipped with rockets to launch either the 107mm shells or the 57mm rockets. But the security forces are aware that Pakistan might resort to desperate measures keeping in view the post Hazratbal systematic and calculated anti-militant mop-up launched by the security forces in the state on the one hand and the gradual public disillusionment with militancy on the other. The army has discovered several specially constructed and deceptively located concrete underground bunkers in houses of active harbourers used by militants to hide both themselves and their weapons. For example, during the flushing out operation in Sopore, the army had recovered six bunkers in such houses. The bunkers fitted with small trap door entries were mostly located under the floor. In one case the trap door to such a bunker was located under the chullah in the kitchen. Another was behind a staircase, one in the field and yet another was in a narrow corridor-shaped false room. The militants have been making effective use of wireless sets. Most outfits are equipped with short range walkie talkies. Sympathisers have also been provided these sets who have often compromised the army's movements in the Valley. About 150 wireless sets have been recovered up till now. The more sophisticated ones with ranges of up to 300 km have been discovered to possess frequency hopping, selective broadcast, and digital burst communication facilities which are difficult to intercept. The sets recovered till now have been mostly of Japanese and U.S. origin. While `HAIFIS' is the common wireless set of U.S. origin, the Japanese sets have popularly been of Casio, Icom, Kempro and Yasev makes. The solar panel, which is not yet available even with the Indian army, has been the most recent recovery. The U.S. made solar panel, recovered only two weeks ago, comes in a book form, one square foot in size, and is meant for recharging sophisticated sets requiring up to 18V output. The army has also recovered battery for these sets but has yet to recover the concerned wireless set. But a sleek wireless receiver of Sony make recovered recently was found to possess automatic scanning facility fitted with a display panel and an inbuilt microphone with the facility to monitor wireless communication of the security forces between 30 and 300 MHz. The 107mm artillery shells, 57mm air-to-ground rockets and disposable rocket launchers are all of Russian origin and are suspected to be the leftovers of the Afghan war. The 107mm shells are being used as an IED, while the 57mm rocket popularly used by attack helicopters have been triggered with solar powered improvised direction giving devices. The above three weapons, as also the 60mm mortars, are all area weapons and capable of causing severe damage if fired on built up areas. Interestingly some of the two-inch mortar shells recovered from the militants have been found to have Indian ordnance markings.
