FR940228-1-00081 FR940228-1-00010 The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must acknowledge the authority of the Secretary, guaranty agencies and lenders as defined in 34 CFR part 682, nationally recognized accrediting agencies, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and State postsecondary review entities designated under subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, to share with each other any information pertaining to the institution's eligibility for or participation in the Title IV, HEA programs, or any information on fraud and abuse. The Secretary proposes to add to this list of agencies the institution's State agency with legal jurisdiction over the institution and, where appropriate, the State agency recognized by the Secretary for the approval of public postsecondary education as an alternative to accreditation or preaccreditation. The statutory provision that governs the effect of fraud and criminal conduct by individuals, agencies, or organizations affiliated with an institution was discussed in the NPRM published on February 17, 1994 (in part II) that deals with third-party servicers. The Amendments of 1992 require that an institution must timely and satisfactorily complete any survey conducted as a part of the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), or other Federal data collection effort on postsecondary institutions. The Secretary considers this provision to be self-explanatory and proposes to add this statutory requirement to the regulations without substantive modifications. The Amendments of 1992 spell out the requirements imposed on participating institutions that offer athletically related student aid. In order to participate in a Title IV, HEA program, an institution that offers athletically related student aid must compile annually and have audited independently at least every 3 years, data on the revenues derived by the institution from and expenses made by the institution for the institution's intercollegiate athletics activities. This compilation must include data on total revenues and total expenses, revenues and expenses attributable to football, revenues and expenses attributable to men's basketball, revenues and expenses attributable to women's basketball, revenues and expenses attributable to all other men's sports combined, and revenues and expenses attributable to all other women's sports combined. The compilation must also include data on the total revenues and operating expenses of the institution. The institution is required to prepare the compilation within 6 months after the end of the institution's fiscal year. The institution must make the compilation and, where allowable by State law, the required audits, available for inspection by the Secretary and the public. For purposes of this compilation, the Amendments of 1992 define revenues from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without limitation gate receipts, broadcast revenues, appearance guarantees and options, concessions, and advertising. Revenues such as student activities fees or alumni contributions not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total revenues only. The Amendments of 1992 define expenses for intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport to include without limitation grants-in-aid, salaries, travel, equipment, and supplies. Expenses such as general and administrative overhead that are not allocable to a sport must be included in the calculation of total expenses only. Generally, the Secretary is proposing to restate the language of the statute in the regulations. However, the Secretary proposes changes to conform with the NCAA's 1989 Financial Audit Guidelines. In addition to the statutory definition of what is included in revenues from intercollegiate athletics activities allocable to a sport, the Secretary proposes to specify that other conference distributions in addition to broadcast revenues would also be included. The Secretary also proposes to specify that revenues such as investment interest income that are not allocable to a sport would be included in the calculation of total revenues only.
