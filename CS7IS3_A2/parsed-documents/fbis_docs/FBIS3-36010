This opinion was voiced by Levko Lukyanenko, cochairman of the Ukraine Democratic Association, in an interview with the NOVYNY television and radio agency. Lukyanenko believes that Yuriy Meshkov's presidency is illegal, as were illegal Crimean Supreme Soviet resolutions to introduce the post and elect a Crimean president. Speaking of Yuriy Meshkov's possible activities in the new post, Lukyanenko pointed out that the Crimean Republican Party leader used to be a propagandist, while now he has became president and will have to take into account realities. According to Lukyanenko, Yuriy Meshkov's goal to improve the lives of Crimean residents is not obtainable without Ukraine.
