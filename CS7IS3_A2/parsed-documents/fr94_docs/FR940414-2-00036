ACTION: Notice of recision. SUMMARY: This notice sets forth the recision of $22,000,000 in funding to capitalize State Revolving Fund (SRF) programs authorized by (Title VI) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) as announced in the Federal Register notice Vol. 59, No. 38, of February 25, 1994. In the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994 Public Law 103&hyph;124, Congress appropriated $1,218,000,000 for the SRF program (Title VI). The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 Public Law 103&hyph;211 rescinded $22,000,000 of the funds made available under Public Law 103&hyph;124. Through promulgation of this notice, the public is notified of the revised fiscal year 1994 allotment of funds available to the States for their SRF programs. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Leonard B. Fitch, Program Management Branch, Municipal Support Division, Office of Wastewater Enforcement and Compliance (202) 260&hyph;5858. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The allotments of funds announced in the Federal Register notice on February 25, 1994, as available to States and Territories and Indian Tribes will be reduced $22,000,000. The reduction will be taken proportionally to the funds made available. The single exception is that Public Law 95&hyph;348 contains a provision preserving funds appropriated for use by the Northern Mariana Islands (NMI). Section 3(a)(2) provides that any funds made available to the NMI by the Congress after March 24, 1976, ``*␣*␣* are hereby authorized to remain available until expended.'' Accordingly, Title VI funds allotted to the NMI under the authority of Public Law 103&hyph;124 are not subject to the recision of funds under the provisions of Public law 103&hyph;211. The table at the end of this notice lists the revised amount of funding made available to each State to capitalize SRF programs authorized by Title VI of the CWA. Grants from this allotment may be awarded as of the date of this notice. Dated: April 8, 1994. Carol M. Browner, Administrator.
