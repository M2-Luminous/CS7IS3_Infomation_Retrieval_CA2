FBIS3-52663 "drnes004__a94003" FBIS-NES-94-004-A Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 ANNEX Arab-Israeli Talks Israeli Press Report on Negotiations With PLO TA0501123094 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY TA0501123094 FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] Most Israeli dailies on 5 January offer extensive coverage of the Israeli negotiations with the PLO. They report that progress has been made and two sides are coming closer together, allowing for the probable resumption of the Taba talks by next week. Jerusalem THE JERUSALEM POST in English, in a page 1 report compiled by Alon Pinkas, Batsheva Tsur, and news agencies, writes that "Senior sources in Jerusalem said progress has been made on several points, which were contained in the fax sent to the PLO." The POST details some of the controversial points. Concerning control of the Jordan River bridges the report states: "the compromise will allow for a symbolic Palestinian presence." On the issue of international supervisors at the checkpoints, "the PLO will accept Israel's refusal to allow any international force or observers to be present." Regarding Palestinian access to the Dead Sea the sides will agree that "the issue be further negotiated." On the issue of private land, the POST writes that "the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] -- in the areas which it controls -- will respect privately owned Palestinian land." Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew, in a page A1 report by Aluf Ben, Gay Bekhor, 'Aqiva Eldar, and Gid'on Alon, reports on yesterday's fax and phone contacts between Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres and Nabil Sha'th, in which two issues were discussed: "How to define the Cairo understanding, and whether this understanding stands on its own or should be seen as part in a series of contacts. Israel has expressed willingness to soften its definitions and no longer demands to define the Cairo draft as an 'agreement'. "According to political sources, the Palestinians are no longer referring to PLO Chairman 'Arafat's demands for introducing substantial changes into the Cairo understandings. This is construed as a concession to the Israeli position." Tel Aviv 'AL HAMISHMAR in Hebrew, in a page 1 report by Avner Regev, reports that "last week PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat phoned Knesset Member [MK] 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah and asked him to tell Prime Minister Rabin that the Cairo talks entanglement can be solved if Rabin agrees to enlarge the Jericho area. In exchange 'Arafat will give Israel what it wants on the Jordan bridges." The paper goes on to say that Darawshah relayed this message to the prime minister. Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew, in a report on pages 1 and 15 by Shim'on Schiffer and Nahum Barne'a, states that despite progress, "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin rejected an offer by PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat to meet on 15 January, a day prior to the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva." Senior political sources, who commented on this issue yesterday, said that "'Arafat requested a meeting with Rabin on 15 January to reach an understanding on the implementation of the self-administration in Gaza and Jericho prior to the Clinton-al-Asad summit in Geneva on 16 January. According to many assessments, the Clinton-al-Asad summit could place the Syrian talks at the center of the political negotiations at the expense of the Palestinian track. "It has further been learned that Rabin also rejected 'Arafat's suggestion that they join Clinton and al-Asad at the Geneva summit." The report adds that "the prime minister asked the MK's and ministers who plan to meet 'Arafat in Tunis to stop these private initiatives which harm the negotiations between Israel and the PLO'." YEDI'OT also writes that "Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin yesterday reiterated his opposition to U.S. mediation in the current controversy between Israel and the PLO." Rabin, in a farewell party to outgoing U.S. Ambassador Bill Brown, said: "We cooked this dish together with the Palestinians, so now we will fix it without outside intervention."
