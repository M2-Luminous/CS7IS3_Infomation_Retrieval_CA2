But implementing the new round of financial reforms was by no means easy, still less could it be accomplished in one step. It could be said that after trying and probing for fifteen years, China's financial system reform is now entering a crucial period of storming the fort and meeting strong resistance. All of the situations that reform is facing are deep-rooted, broad-based, and very hard to manage. So, each reform is a hard-fought battle and each step forward can encounter new obstacles and new difficulties. The first difficulty: It is difficult in one step to accomplish central bank macroeconomic control mainly adopting economic methods and establish an improved macroeconomic control system with mainly indirect means. The reason is not only that the constraints and affects of external conditions (such as government interference, enterprise "resistance" [daobi 0227 6656], and defects in the investment system) cause the central bank to make "ineffective adjustments" and be "powerless to control," but also in the difficulty that the central bank has in transforming its macroeconomic goals and means from the control model under the planned economic system to true market controls in one strike; and even less can the creation of market conditions for implementing indirect controls be accomplished in a day. What is especially worthy of note, is that the pursuit of a sustained high rate of economic growth has a strong impact on the central bank's first goal, "a stable currency." The second difficulty: There are numerous difficulties in establishing a policy bank. This is manifested in that: 1) It is hard to clearly distinguish policy work from business work and we lack a unified standard to measure them. Moreover, this type of standard often is constantly changing with changes in the industrial structure and development of the national economy. 2) It is difficult to appropriately decide on the capital and the day-to-day operating funds needed to set up a policy bank. In the operation it is extremely difficult to accurately give expression to or maintain the specifics of a policy bank. With the slightest inattention, it can be transformed into a second financial or commercial bank. Despite the fact that policy bank loans are clearly supportive in nature, they also are different from financial allocations. They are not free and one-time and they are paid in advance, circulating, and repayable. Also to a certain extent they stress results. As banks policy banks also are different from commercial banks. Despite their emphasis on accounting, profits are not their principal goal and they do not compete with commercial financial organizations. The third difficulty: In developing commercial banks, the burden is heavy and the road is long. Converting Chinese specialized banks to commercial banks is a very long process. We cannot successfully commercialize them by simply issuing a decree. The main reasons are: First, to convert Chinese specialized banks to commercial banks, there must first be clear-cut property rights relations, that is implementation of a stock system. But the restructuring of specialized banks to implement a stock system would be far more complicated and more difficult than the current stock system restructuring of state enterprises. Second, the ratio of bad accounts, messy accounts, serious credit asset losses, and bad assets much higher than international banking standards that Chinese specialized banks have formed over a long period of time also are a major obstacle to their conversion to commercial banks. Third, whether future state commercial banks can thoroughly divorce themselves from the interference of various factors in credit issues and truly act as autonomous businesses still awaits various common efforts. Fourth, what scale is considered appropriate for a future commercial bank to maintain still remains to be resolved. Large-scale commercial banks have numerous network points, wide coverage, and results of scale. But they also can easily become monopolies, stifle competition, and obstruct improvement in financial services and quality, and they cause commercial banks to lack force as tools of financial innovation. But if commercial banks are too small and too dispersed it also is not helpful to developing the finance industry and playing a financial role. The fourth difficulty: Standardization and internationalization of the capital market still requires time. Totally marketizing the issuance of bonds, perfecting the grading system for bond-issuing organizations and bond credit, the scale of stock-issuing markets, and a unified stock exchange market (especially, resolving the distinction between the legal person and the individual stock market, distinguishing A-stock and B-stock markets, and the entrance of state stocks into the market) all will require arduous efforts. Countermeasures in the New Round of Financial Reform Faced with numerous problems in the new round of financial system reform, we should by no means do nothing, and we certainly should not retreat from the difficulties, but we should adopt effective countermeasures. Surmounting difficulties and grasping opportunities will spur on deeper reform of the financial system. --We should be fully prepared ideologically for the difficulties of the new round of financial system reform. If financial system reform is to be completely intensified, we must storm the fortifications and run up against tough situations, we must reform and restructure what constitutes support for the old system and what can become important components for the new system, and beginning with deep-rooted aspects and adjustment of authority and benefits, advance overall and break through on key points. --Clarify the extreme importance of the government in reform of the financial system. There are two levels of content to financial reform: The first is administrative innovation, also known as government directed financial reform. It is manifested in the government's involvement in the circulation of funds and the implementation of currency policy by clear changes in financial laws and administrative regulations to attain administrative and control goals. Reform of these legal and nonlegal activities launched by governments and governmental organizations aimed at changing the structure of the financial system and expanding currency authority is administrative financial reform. The second is market innovation, that is market-directed financial reform. It is manifested in the emergence of new financial assets, financial tools, and financial techniques on financial markets. From the perspective of the history and the reality of China's financial system reform, we can say with complete reason that delays in financial reform are mainly from lack of financial innovation on the part of government--administrators. So, it is an urgent matter for the government to take the initiative in participating in financial reform, actively promoting it and energetically advancing it. --Stress overall coordination in promoting financial system reform. The affects of the new round of financial system reform are wide-ranging and far-reaching. As far as the financial system itself is concerned, reform could intensify the competition of various types of financial organizations and promote overall development of finances and improvement in the level of business administration. At the same time, it will increase the business risks for financial organizations. Increased instability in the financial system makes the task of macromanaging currency even more arduous and complex. As far as external affects of reform of the financial system are concerned, 1) Since the central bank has made currency stability its primary goal and financial deficits can no longer be taken as overdrafts on the central bank, times have not gone well for the Ministry of Finance. If policy banks are established, it will add greatly to the burdens of the Ministry of Finance. 2) After specialized banks are commercialized, the days of enterprises relying on eating from the bank's big pot will be gone forever and losing (or potentially losing) enterprises will have difficulty getting support funds from specialized banks. From another perspective, the affects of financial system reform on these sectors conversely are constraints of these sectors on financial reform. If they are not handled well, they could restrain financial system reform in different respects. So, we should stress overall reforms related to financial system reform. This consists of two aspects: One aspect is that reform within the financial system should be linked up and coordinated. The other aspect is that financial system reform should be coordinated with reform of other aspects (government, planning, finance, investment, enterprises, etc.). If we do not "act as the occasion demands" in these aspects, it will be difficult or even impossible for financial system reform to develop in depth. --Guard against the financial system reform plan losing its form, changing shape, or becoming distorted. In fifteen years of financial reform, this type of phenomenon has frequently occurred. What was originally a very good reform measure or plan can ultimately lose shape and not attain the mark in the implementation. Not only does it not give rise to the proper effect, on the contrary, it greatly exhibits the opposite effect. So, in the new round of financial system reform, we must put forth an effort to avoid a recurrence of this type of situation and from top to bottom we must heighten our awareness of the implementation of reform measures to ensure that reform plans are all implemented in accordance with predetermined goals. --Accelerate financial system reform. The arrangement of the overall framework and year of financial system reform has now been essentially clarified, but the specific steps of implementation still are not clear. Various sectors, especially numerous grass-roots units, are waiting to see. Normal tasks already are affected. If it persists, not only could it affect the development of the finance industry and the national economy, but it also could trigger new contradictions and problems. Moreover, the coexistence of dual systems leading to friction, gaps, and vacuums has caused the cost of reform to reach the limits of tolerance. Increased reform efforts and acceleration of reform have become choices that cannot be delayed in financial system reform. --Increase understanding of financial system reform and stress the dissemination of financial knowledge. The new round of financial system reform is more than many people (including some high-ranking leading cadres) can accept. For example, people still are not knowledgeable, are not accustomed, or cannot even accept such things as policy banks, commercial banks, and open markets. If there is not widespread understanding of these basic concepts, it would naturally be rather difficult to think about promoting the design of a new system that is based on these concepts. So, increased publicity and dissemination of financial knowledge and increased understanding of financial system reform has become an important part of promoting the new round of financial system reform. --Handle the relationship between reform and stability carefully and create a relatively relaxed economic environment for financial system reform. Only in this way can financial system reform be conducted smoothly. If the relationship among the various aspects of the economy are bound up very tightly or if serious inflation even occurs, it would not help to promote financial system reform and it could obstruct reform of the overall economic system and development of the national economy.
