"Dear Mr. Eliasson: ``I shall give you some details about the actions of the Azeri armed units in the captured RMK territories. ``At the beginning of May 1994 the Karabakh army liberated the villages of Talish, Seisulan, Yarmja and Karmiravan in the Martakertskiy district of the Republic from the occupants. ``Having to retreat, the Azeri command ordered to destroy the Armenian villages. The intercepted radio communications evidence that this barbarous actions have been coordinated with the Azeri high ranking political leadership. ``The abovementioned villages, as well as other villages in the RMK Martakertskiy, Gadrutskiy, Askeranskiy, Martuninskiy and Shushinskiy districts, which have formerly been occupied by the Azeri forces, are in fact razed to the ground. The retreating Azeri army is only leaving ashes behind, thus forcing [the RMK to take] [previous brackets are source-supplied] retaliative measures. ``We have irrefutable information about inhabiting native Armenian lands by the Azeris. This has also been carried in Azerbaijan on the level of state policy. The authorities in this country are actively working on inhabiting the villages of Leninavan, Maraga in the Martakertskiy district, Shahumyanov, Kharkhaputi, Verishen, Hay-Boris, Rus-Boris, Buzlukh, Gulistan, Garachinar, Hakhtut, Manashid, Nor-Shen and Yerkej in the Shaumyanovskiy district [by Azeris] [previous brackets are source-supplied]. ``The same fortune would have expected hundreds of other native Armenian villages, if not the courage of RMK defense army fighters who liberated the Armenian villages. To be more precise, not the villages but the ashes which remained after the retreat of the Azeri units. ``I would be very grateful if you can send your representative to the region for investigation of this problem on the spot. ``In all cases, we hope for immediate and effective measures you will carry for preventing the possible negative consequences of the political stance of the Azeri leaders and for the peaceful resolution of the Karabakh conflict.''
