This was announced by the 14th Russian Army Military Council. The statement, circulated on 9 February, was prompted by the emergency situation in the region. The statement is addressed to residents on either bank of the Dniester. In the run-up to parliamentary elections in Moldova, the statement stresses that "the flying wheel of military psychosis is being spun both by Dniester and Moldova TV." The authors of the document cite political negotiations as the sole method of achieving accord. As Aleksandr Baranov, 14th Army assistant commander, explained to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's correspondent, this statement has been forwarded to the leadership of Tiraspol and Chisinau. [passage omitted]
