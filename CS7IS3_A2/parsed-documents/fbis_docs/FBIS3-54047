There was no breakthrough after two rounds of talks over the weekend in Oslo, but significant progress was reportedly made on the questions of the border crossings and security arrangements in Gaza. Mark Weiss reports: [Begin Weiss recording] Both Foreign Minister Peres and Yasir 'Arafat made significant concessions at the Oslo talks. According to Qol Yisra'el's diplomatic reporter Shlomo Raz, the PLO has now reportedly dropped its insistence that Palestinian policemen be present at the border crossings. In return, Israel will reportedly allow people crossing to enter directly to Jericho, and Israel will also allow the Palestinians to set up their own holiday resort on the Dead Sea. However, disagreements remain over the size of the autonomous Jericho area. Peres and 'Arafat also reached agreement on security arrangements for roads in the Gaza Strip leading to the Gush Qatif settlement bloc. The Foreign Ministry's legal adviser Yo'el Singer and senior PLO official Abu-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] will meet this week in an attempt to put into writing the points of agreement before Peres and 'Arafat meet again a week from today in Switzerland. Speaking in Oslo last night, Peres said there is a chance that agreement can be reached in Switzerland on most of the points and there is a proper climate for such an agreement. 'Arafat told reporters that some bridges have been overcome, but more time is needed. He said if there is a will there is a way, and both sides have this will. Peres and 'Arafat held their second round of talks after attending the funeral of Norwegian Foreign Minister Johan Jorgen Holst, who brokered last year's Oslo agreement. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the strain of the peace process had contributed to his death, and said a peace agreement would do justice to his memory. [end recording] [Announcer] In all, Israeli and Palestinian representatives will be meeting this week at several locations in talks to further the peace process. The Yo'el Singer-Abu-'Ala' meetings Mark Weiss reported on, the Taba talks on autonomy for Gaza and Jericho resume in Taba tomorrow, and in Washington discussions will start in the framework of the bilateral talks between Israel and the Arab states. The U.S. Administration is at the same time reported to be working to set up a summit meeting between Prime Minister Rabin and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad. [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 22 January on page A1 carries an item by political correspondent Aluf Ben that reports Peres presented 'Arafat with a proposal to overcome the dispute over control of the border crossings. "Under the proposal, use would be made of advanced technology development in Israel to form `an unseen presence' of Israeli security officers in the Palestinian area of the crossings. The plan, in which several military industries are participating, has been approved by security elements and received Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's OK Thursday in his meeting with Peres. The PLO demanded in the negotiations that the Palestinian residents of the self-government in Gaza and Jericho `will not see Israelis' when they enter the crossings points, and agreed that Israel supervise the crossings from a distance through electronic means." [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0505 GMT on 22 January, in a report by Gil Sedan in Oslo, says that "at Peres' initiative, a $25-million international fund, the initial budget for funding the Palestinian self-government, was set up. The United States will contribute $10 million and the rest will be divided evenly between the Scandinavian countries and Japan."]
