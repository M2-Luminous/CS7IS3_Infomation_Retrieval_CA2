Sun Xianlu, 25, an ex-employee of Tianjin No. 2 steelworks, attempted to hijack the Boeing airliner to Taiwan on November 28 last year. He claimed to be carrying explosives, but was overpowered at the airport after the crew adopted measures. The plane landed safely at the airport in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, Liu said. The Nanjing Intermediate People's Court sentenced him to life imprisonment with deprivation of political rights on January 13. The verdict took effect today. Liu said that several cases of hijacking occured in China over a period, and some of the culprits were debtors, some attempted to "seek fortune" overseas, and others have had criminal records. China has been consistent in severely cracking down on the crime of hijacking, he said. According to the country's criminal law and the decision on punishing hijackers of aircraft issued by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, hijackers must be severely punished, with the death penalty in the most serious cases. At the end of 1993 an agreement was reached between the mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait and the Taiwan-based Straits Exchange Foundation. Both sides came to a common understanding that hijacking is a serious crime and hijackers should be severely punished. They agreed in principle that all hijackers will be sent back to where they came from, Liu noted.
