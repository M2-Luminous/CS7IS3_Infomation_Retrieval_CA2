Emisoras Caracol Network reported as a last-minute scoop that the leader of the Cuban Revolution telephoned Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin with a message for President Cesar Gaviria. According to the source, Fidel Castro told the Colombian minister that "neither Alfonso Cano, Ivan Marquez, nor (Bishop) Nel Beltran participated in the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity held in Havana on 27 and 28 January of this year, contrary to what the newspaper EL TIEMPO has mistakenly reported." According to the radio network, the Cuban leader reported that he personally carried out investigations and checked one by one all the names of the people who participated in that forum, and he can totally and absolutely guarantee, with his word of honor at stake, that the subversion leaders in Colombia were not in Cuba on the reported dates and did not participated in any guerrilla summit. According to Caracol, an annoyed Fidel Castro said categorically: There was no guerrilla summit and neither these persons nor any other subversive leaders of Latin America took part in any such summit. According to the radio report, he added: In a timely manner we passed to Cuba's ambassador to Colombia, Jesus Martinez, the information we had, and that information tells the truth and nothing but the truth. The Cuban chief of state said that there was a prelate at the Fourth Meeting of Solidarity, a Protestant prelate who lives in Medellin, but not the bishop of Sincelejo, Monsignor Nel Beltran. Fidel Castro stated that all this has been part of a setup aimed at preventing the sale of Colombian oil to Cuba and at marring the two country's bilateral ties. He said that there are extraneous and shadowy sources that want to break these bilateral ties. The radio network said that the telephone communication will be followed by written communication that is already on its way and that will be delivered to President Gaviria through the Foreign Ministry probably tomorrow or, at the latest, Sunday.
