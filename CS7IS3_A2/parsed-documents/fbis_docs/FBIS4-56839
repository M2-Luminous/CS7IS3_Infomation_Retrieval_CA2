Upon concluding our mission, we hereby forward the following observations to the international community and the Panamanian public: 1. We were provided with all of the information we needed to learn about the country's electoral system. Furthermore, we were able to interview and obtain information from members of the Justice and Peace Commission itself, as well as other electoral experts. They briefed us on electoral legislation and practices in Panama. 2. The Magistrates of the Electoral Tribunal welcomed us on several occasions to fully explain the system of guarantees and controls established to ensure the Panamanian people's democratic participation in the election and the respect for the will of the people as reflected in the polls. We would like to express our highest praise and strongest applause for the Electoral Tribunal for its impeccable performance during this important task in the interest of the country. 3. We examined the procedures that guaranteed a swift and trustworthy vote count. Our highest congratulations go to the National Vote-Counting Board and to the Justice and Peace Commission. 4. We interviewed the presidential candidates. We discussed their platforms, their willingness to respect the final results of the elections, and their willingness to offer the winner their personal cooperation and the cooperation of their respective parties. We thank the candidates for finding time in their very busy schedules to see us. 5. On 8 May, the team of international observers visited various areas of the country. The idea was to confirm election results directly. Thanks to the Justice and Peace Commission's excellent planning and the outstanding cooperation offered by those Panamanians who accompanied us during this time, we were able to visit a large number of voting tables all across the country. There, we observed the smooth progression of Election Day events, from the opening of the voting tables to the closure and tallying process. We did not observe one case in which there was any evidence of an attempt to distort the will of the Panamanian people. We believe that the legal mechanisms, the instructional efforts prior to the election, and the people's enormous desire to participate freely and democratically made it possible to experience an Election Day we can only describe as exemplary. 6. As international observers fulfilling our mission, we hereby state before the international community and the Panamanian public that the 8 May 1994 elections in the Republic of Panama were carried out with all necessary guarantees. The process has allowed the people of Panama to express their political will in complete freedom. 7. Last, we ask that all Panamanians and their political leaders unite and build an even more just, free, and fraternal Panama -- a Panama capable of resolving its domestic problems, particularly poverty, while broadening its relations of peace and cooperation with the countries of the region and the international community in general. To do so, Panamanian society, led by its political authorities with the support of the Catholic Church and the Justice and Peace Commission, and within the framework of the Ibero-American nations' will to build and strengthen their democratic systems, must be aware of challenges as outlined by the admirable Panamanian people, who expressed their will with outstanding civic and democratic maturity. To all of the Panamanian people, we wish to express our admiration and gratitude. [Issued] Panama City, 9 May 1994
