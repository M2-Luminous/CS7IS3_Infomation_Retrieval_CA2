[applause] Our government will take into account the dreams and ambitions of Chilean men, women, and children. I also want to greet those students who passed their university entry exams with flying colors, who are with us now as special guests. [applause] We are aware of our responsibilities and the difficulties of the task we are undertaking today. But, as I have repeatedly stated during the recent presidential campaign, I firmly believe this generation can wipe out extreme poverty from our country; that we can renew and expand our infrastructure; that we will substantially increase the GDP and our exports, change the structure of our education system, grow in a sustained manner, improve the peoples' living standards, and solve the peoples' concrete problems. After these four years of socioeconomic growth and restoration of democracy we have an excellent opportunity, which we will not miss. This is an equal opportunity for all Chileans. This afternoon I also want to greet President Patricio Aylwin, who has bequeathed us a great legacy from his years in government. [applause] The new times have started. It is not just a plan; it is a new phase in Chilean development. We must reorganize government in face of all the changes we are currently witnessing; we need to implement changes in the distribution of political power at the district, regional, and national level; we must bring about changes in the relationship between the public and private sectors, and changes in the role we play in the international arena. In sum, this is the beginning of a new historical phase, which we know, now that it is starting, will conclude when each and every Chilean decides to make an effort for the well-being of all Chileans. [applause] Tomorrow afternoon, here in Constitution Square, I will announce the style of my government. The La Moneda Palace building, where I arrived today in my capacity as president of the Chilean people, is witness to the history of our institutions, the strength of their servants, and the righteousness of our politicians. From this site I humbly ask God to keep us on this path of service and effort. With faith in Chile, in its people, and its future, deeply moved and thankful, I greet you all. The men who governed Chile from here with effort, dedication, and love for the fatherland are responsible for the Chile we have today. We will continue to work with national awareness. With your support and that of all Chileans, we are going to bring politics and the people and their daily problems together. We are going to work hard every day to be with you, to solve the daily problems of millions of Chileans, and we are going to do this observing the high moral and ethical political standards that are necessary for the times we are experiencing. [applause] I urge the Chilean people and, through you, the millions and millions of Chileans that have given us their support, to help me, to help carry out this beautiful task of building a unified country. I urge them to accompany me in this beautiful task, because the task of building and dreaming of the future, the task of building and dreaming of a developed and unified country at the threshold of the 21st century, is a task that concerns all Chileans. I am going to head this task, and with your support we will be successful; we are going to enter the 21st century as a unified, progressive country in which each and every Chilean feels part of a human country, feels that he has an opportunity. Let us walk with confidence and optimism, with faith in Chile's future. Let us go ahead. Long live Chile. [applause]
