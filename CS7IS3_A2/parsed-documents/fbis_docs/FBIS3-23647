Filippov: "Role of the U.S. Navy in Providing Antiballistic Missile Defense in a TMO"] [Text] Modern U.S. military strategy is based on the assumption that use of armed forces in regional conflicts is to become, now and in the immediate future, the most probable variant of protecting vitally important American interests. The spread of missile weapons into developing countries, the advent of a real possibility for their creation of mass destruction weapons, political instability in the former USSR, and difficulties in suppressing mobile missile systems (from combat experience in the Persian Gulf) are making it necessary to develop and deploy effective antiballistic missile (ABM) systems in theaters of military operations (TMOs) to protect friendly forces and objectives from strikes by operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles. A report to Congress by U.S. Armed Services Chairman of the Committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin L. Powell (February 1993) states that "equipped with chemical or biological warheads, the enemy's ballistic missiles can present a significant threat to our mobile forces, which are the principal forces in the USA's new regional strategy." In accordance with the state's military strategy, the command of the U.S. Navy is activating efforts to create sea-based ABM systems. Three fundamental studies were carried there in 1991: "Requirements on Tactical ABM Systems in 2010" (U.S. Navy Consultative Committee for Scientific Research and Experimental Design Work"); "Tactical Sea-Based ABM Systems" (staff of the naval secretary's advisor on armament development and purchases); "Research on Antiballistic Missile Defense" (Scientific Council of the U.S. Department of Defense). The following conclusions were reached on the basis of this research: 1. The threat of the use of ballistic missiles in a TMO is real, and continues to grow. More than 30 countries have operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles, and a large number of countries are aspiring to acquire them. Ballistic missiles already adopted could be upgraded with the purpose of increasing their combat effectiveness. Creation of warheads fitted with mass destruction weapons may be one of the routes of upgrading in this case. 2. Naval forces and resources can make a significant contribution to creating ABM systems in a TMO. The strategy of creating sea-based antimissile systems is based on factors inherent to the navy, such as accessibility to most regions, mobility, flexibility, and the capability for lengthy operation not only to protect the navy's most important facilities but also to defend mobile and expeditionary forces (assault forces), their landing ports, maritime airfields and cities, and other important facilities within their range. In addition such systems are capable of significantly increasing the effectiveness of regional ABM systems by providing support to ground-based antimissile systems. It was noted that the modern Aegis ship automated weapon combat control system outfitted with Standard-2 surface-to-air guided missiles is capable of carrying out limited ABM missions. On the whole, its specifications and performance characteristics are not optimized for antimissile defense, but there is a possibility for upgrading them for these purposes. The foreign press writes that the command of the U.S. Navy has drawn up a plan to create ship ABM systems in two phases. The first entails efforts to upgrade existing ship surface-to-air missile systems for ABM missions in the TMO, while the second entails development of future sea-based antimissile systems. The main elements of the plan for their creation were coordinated with the leadership of the SDI program. The work of the first phase includes upgrading the Aegis system and the Standard-2 SAM. Changes in the system itself will be insignificant. The MK 99 Mod.2 fire control system and the MK-41 vertical launcher remain as before. Some changes are being made in the program and work algorithm of the AN/SPY-18 radar station, the control and decision making instrumentation, and the displays. The upgrade is most visible in the Standard-2 missile, which is being fitted with a new warhead, an improved homing head and an improved fuze. The upgraded missile will have the greater killing power and speed to destroy operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles. The work of upgrading the SAMs is being carried out by America's Raytheon, which has experience in similar work on the Patriot system, which was used to defeat Iraqi ballistic missiles during combat operations in the Persian Gulf. The upgrade program was drawn up in such a way that flight tests of the block 4 Standard-2 SAM would begin upon completion of the work of improving the fuze and homing head and creating a new warhead, and that it would be finished in 1995. Ships are to be armed with an antiballistic missile capable of close interception of operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles in 1996. It is anticipated that as with the Patriot surface-to-air guided missile, the modernized block 4 Standard-2 missile will be able to effectively hit both aerodynamic and ballistic targets. The official point of view on the justifications of work in the first phase is based on the following premises: - the navy already has radar stations and vertical launchers, so all it needs is to develop antiballistic missiles, while the ground forces have to develop new radar stations, launchers and antiballistic missiles for the future ground-based THAAD ABM system; - naval ships are a mobile force, and they are capable of reaching regions of crisis rather quickly, while deployment of a ground-based ABM system in a TMO would require from 1 to 3 weeks; - sea-based ABM systems make it possible for the local command to use them more efficiently in crisis situations, for example in the first days of a conflict, while the naval ABM component in the TMO could afford protection to troop airlifts by providing cover against missile strikes to coastal airfields. American specialists assert that a zonal ABM system would play the most important role in regions of crisis, because of the 37 potential trajectories of ballistic missiles with a range of around 1,000 km, 26 pass over the water surface. Therefore, presence of a ship carrying an ABM system at the need spot would allow it to destroy a ballistic missile in flight (Figure 1). Moreover, according to estimates of the same specialists, from 50 to 60 percent of the most important cities and industrial centers in the Western Pacific may be protected by sea-based ABM systems. Figure 1. Interception of an American ships armed with ABM systems and located in the Mediterranean Sea could defend their bases in Europe from a missile attack from the African coast, particularly in the case of an attack on Italy by Libya, while ships deployed in the Persian Gulf could defeat ballistic missiles launched from countries in the Near East. Development of the next generation of the Aegis ship automated weapon combat control system, with greater ballistic missile detection and tracking range, is planned in the second phase. Both individual components of the ABM system (computers, radar stations, radar signal processors etc.) and the software will be subjected to upgrade. There are plans for developing an antiballistic missile capable of fighting operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles of the future with a range from hundreds to tens of thousands of kilometers and equipped with different kinds of warheads, including nuclear, chemical and biological. The upgraded Standard-2 SAM and the THAAD antiballistic missile presently being developed for the ground forces (with a planned range of ballistic target destruction of up to 200 km, and an altitude of 150 km) could serve this role. Concurrently there are plans for improving the control and data transmission system, which will be brought together into a unified system utilizing ground, air and space ballistic missile detection and tracking resources in order to raise the effectiveness of ABM systems. Around 25 percent of the planned appropriations for work to create ABM systems for TMOs in the 1993-1999 fiscal years are being allocated to the navy. In future upgrading of the Standard-2 SAM, a third Thiokol accelerating stage and the LEAP small homing hyperfast projectile, developed on a competitive basis by America's Boeing, Hughes and Rockwell International, are to be installed in it. LEAP ammunition, which weighs around 10 kg, will be able to destroy operational-tactical and tactical ballistic missiles due to kinetic energy released upon striking the target. It is to be outfitted with an optical homing head, which will be used at altitudes above 70 km in order to exclude the harmful influence of atmospheric optic effects (distortions of the optical viewing axis, considerable heating etc.)(Figure 2). Figure 2. LEAP Small Homing Hyperfast Work on LEAP technology for the Standard-2 missile was started in 1992. In that same year the first flight test was conducted with the purpose of demonstrating the missile's ability to deliver the LEAP projectile to an altitude above 90 km. The testing was done in the Eastern Atlantic. A target rocket was launched from the eastern missile range at Cape Canaveral, Florida to a distance of 800 km. The tests showed that the Standard-2 SAM can deliver a mockup of the LEAP projectile to an altitude of 110 km, while together with an AN/SPY-1B radar station the Aegis system is capable persistently tracking a ballistic missile and guiding a SAM to a prescribed point. During the next tests, planned for mid-1993, a Standard-2 is to be launched carrying a mockup of the LEAP projectile of actual size in order to work out the mechanism of its separation from the rocket. The next three tests of the first series are planned for 1994 with the additional Thiokol third accelerating stage. The shock, vibration and thermal loads will be determined and the operation of the autopilot will be evaluated during these tests. The faring of the missile is to be jettisoned at an altitude of 80 km and the third stage is to be started to accelerate the LEAP ammunition during the testing. The mockup of the LEAP ammunition is to separate from the accelerating stage 145 seconds after the missile's lift-off (at an altitude of 150 km); all components of the missile, including the accelerating stage, the LEAP ammunition and the work of the homing head will be checked. There are also plans for carrying out a real interception of a ballistic missile launched from Cape Canaveral to a distance of 1,000 km over the Atlantic Ocean; the intercept will occur at an altitude of 100 km, 800 km from the launch site of the operational-tactical ballistic missile. The target rocket will have a speed of 2-3 km/sec. After the first series of flight tests are evaluated, the navy will begin the second, which will include five real interceptions of ballistic missiles in 1995-1997. Concurrently, naval specialists will study the experience of associates from the ground forces in creating the THAAD ABM systems, and work out the problems, as necessary, of installing this system or its antimissiles aboard ships. In the year 2000 the U.S. Navy plans to install ABM systems aboard 22 "Ticonderoga" class guided missile cruisers and 26 "Berk" class guided missile destroyers. According to U.S. Naval specialists, sea-based ABM systems equipped with the Standard-2 SAM carrying LEAP ammunition (Figure 3), deployed by the western and eastern shores of America, could be used to repel a limited nuclear missile strike against the USA. Figure 3. Standard-2 Sea-Based In order to afford protection to Marine Corps units against missile strikes, the Improved Hawk SAM system with which they are armed is to be upgraded. This system contains an AN/TPS-51 radar station capable of identifying ballistic targets and calculating the trajectory, the launch point and the warhead's point of impact. In addition, the radar station can detect small targets like cruise missiles. Data are transmitted automatically by communication lines from the radar station to Improved Hawk SAM system batteries. The range of detection is 740 km for ballistic targets and 550 for small targets. The radar station has a device for automatic determination of its coordinates, the same as the kind in SAM batteries. Tests carried out at the White Sands Proving Grounds (New Mexico) in May 1991 confirmed the capability of the radar station for detecting and tracking ballistic missiles. During the tests it persistently tracked and transmitted information to the SAM system, which was located 120 km from the missile's launch site and 85 km from the SAM battery. There are plans for acquiring nine AN/TPS-59 radar stations for Improved Hawk missile systems possessed by the Marine Corps. The war in the Persian Gulf confirmed the operational and strategic necessity of creating ABM systems in a TMO, including sea-based ones, to neutralize the threat from ballistic missiles in regional conflicts. The American plans for creating ABM systems in TMOs are acquiring an increasingly more integrated and definite nature. The timetable and directions of development of technology have been determined rather specifically. However, the possibility of further adjustment of the technical makeup of TMO ABM systems, including sea-based systems, is not excluded. The USA generally possesses sufficient financial, economic and technical possibilities for deploying such systems by planned deadlines. COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1993.
