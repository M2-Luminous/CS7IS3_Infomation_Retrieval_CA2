In a speech to a Chinese media delegation representing Chinese media organizations, President Mubarak said that recent international developments, both in the Middle East and in East Asia, have brought attention to the vital importance of joint consultations between Egypt and China for the purpose of objectively evaluating these developments and seeking just and reasonable solutions from all parties, which would support peace and security throughout the world. More Profound Mutual Understanding With Asia President Mubarak said: "Egypt is an African nation, but it is also an Asia nation by virtue of the fact that it is located on the crossroads of three major continents. For this reason, Egypt's cultural and religious ties with a large number of the Islamic nations and peoples in Asia impel Egyptian policy to become increasingly interested in achieving more profound ties of mutual understanding with the Asian continent." The President added: "The economic and political importance of the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, and the degree to which they have come to participate in the world's production and international trade, leads us to predict that the next century will be the century of the Asian continent." The President went on to say: "In light of the traditional ties of friendship between Egypt and most of the nations and peoples of Asia, Egyptian policy is one of pursuing active diplomacy with most of the nations of that continent as well as participating with other nations in the search for solutions to problems which may appear from time to time." [passage omitted] Deep-Rooted Relations In response to a question concerning the goal and significance of his anticipated visit to China, President Mubarak said: "Relations between Egypt and China are both historical and political. With regard to the historical dimension, Egypt was the first Arab and African nation to recognize the People's Republic of China." "With regard to the political dimension, the anchor of these relations has been a deep-rooted friendship based on cooperation, mutual consultation, and coordination regarding the various Arab and world issues, due to the major role played by China in the world arena and due to the importance of Egypt among the Arab and African nations in the Middle East and Africa." The president said: "Egyptian-Chinese relations are nearly 40 years old. This has been a fertile period, full of developments in the world arena in most of the continents of the world and in the relations of the superpowers, after the profound and radical changes that have taken place in the balance of power that had been stable since World War II." Appraisal of the Situation The president continued: "There is no doubt that the leaders of both China and Egypt have their own particular views and assessments of the nature of these changes and their likely effects on the issues of international and regional security and stability in the world as well as issues such as disarmament, etc." He added: "Recent international developments in the Middle East and East Asia have brought attention to the special importance of having mutual consultations between the two nations for the purpose of coming up with an objective appraisal [of the situation] and seeking just and reasonable solutions from all parties which would support peace and security throughout the world." President Mubarak then replied to a question from the Chinese media delegation concerning his appraisal of the current situation with regard to Egyptian-Chinese relations and ways that would lead to strengthening ties of cooperation between Egypt and China during the period of important changes the world community is witnessing at the current time: Mutual Trust "Egyptian-Chinese relations are characterized by a special nature that makes them different from bilateral relations that we have with many other friendly nations. In addition to the ancient historical tradition that each of the two nations has, as well as the great degree of mutual trust that has existed between the peoples and leaders of the two nations over a period of dozens of years, cooperation between the two countries has been achieved in many areas of joint action in economic, cultural, scientific, and other fields." "Also, there have been many levels of cooperation between the official agencies and parliamentary, party, and labor union organizations. This has created a common basis for mutual understanding between the two peoples, which has greatly strengthened the firm ties of friendship on the highest levels that exist between Cairo and Beijing." President Mubarak continued: "Naturally, if our political relations have reached this degree of trust and this height, we aspire to have our economic cooperation and trade reach these world levels also, taking into consideration the great leap achieved by the Chinese economy in growth and prosperity and the important steps achieved in the Egyptian economy in recent years." Trade "These two factors should lead to an opening of broad horizons and possibilities for the expansion of trade between Egypt and China, to an increase in their share of the world's trade, benefiting the peoples of the two friendly nations, and to benefits being gained from the great technological and industrial progress which has been achieved by China in recent years." Experience in Economic Reform Concerning a question about the aspects of similarity between Egypt's and China's experience with economic reform and what the results have been of these experiments in terms of great achievements and expertise gained, which could be utilized for the mutual benefit of the two nations, President Mubarak said: "Egypt, as a developing country, which in the early sixties adopted the idea of central planning for its economy, has faced big problems and taken on many burdens as a result of the numerous armed conflicts that have taken place in the Middle East and has had difficulties in connection with developing the necessary infrastructure for economic development and increasing its rates of growth. In addition to this, in Egypt we have experienced a continual increase in our population, which has been higher than the rates of our economic growth and which has been disportionate to the nation's natural and economic resources." "In view of these problems, in the early eighties Egypt initiated a comprehensive review of its economic plans and programs, bearing in mind the requirements of modern economic thought and the application of reform programs in a manner that would be in accordance with our particular circumstances and social conditions and the needs of our citizens in Egypt." The president went on to say: "With the application of two five-year plans since 1982 and the beginning of the third plan in 1992, the reaping of the fruits of the monetary, fiscal, and structural reform in the Egyptian economy, and the following of policies of economic liberalization and privatization in accordance with the circumstances of Egyptian society by choosing the method of gradual development rather than that of a sudden leap, we have been able to restore to the Egyptian economy a large measure of its activity, vitality, and ability to produce, export, and provide employment opportunities for thousands of young people." Diagnosis and Cure President Mubarak said: "The problems are still not over. However, the diagnosis has been accurate and the cure has not been a sudden one. Signs of health and strength have begun to appear again in the Egyptian economy in the fields of industry, agriculture, urban and rural development, and raising the level of services. "There is no doubt that the achievement of stability in Egypt and in the Middle East would provide the climate necessary for pushing forward the wheel of economic progress and attracting investment." Similarity in the Two Experiments President Mubarak said: "We find a considerable degree of similarity between the Chinese and Egyptian experiments in the area of economic reform, in spite of the peculiarities of each one. The transition from a policy of central planning to that of adopting market mechanisms, giving free rein to individual initiative, and having private enterprises, in addition to the important role played by community ownership, are among the common denominators of the two experiments." President Mubarak added: "The nature of the experiment in economic reform in each of the two countries--that is, the experiment that took into consideration the special social circumstances of the two peoples in Egypt and China, or what we call the `social dimension of the process of economic development'--was one of the more obvious aspects of similarity when it came to correcting the path of the economy and adapting it to the new economic circumstances which prevail in the world. "Also, the development of the public sector, the creation of free trade zones, the policy of encouraging foreign investments, and the development of small industries are features of the Chinese experiment that are similar to the models we are following, on a smaller scale, of course, in our experiment in economic reform in Egypt." President Mubarak asserted: "Both the Egyptian and Chinese experiments are the result of the nature of the circumstances of economic development in Egypt and China, and are not merely a blind response to some plans or advice that might not necessarily be appropriate for the distinctive features of the two economic experiments." Egypt's Ties to Asia In response to a question concerning the general principles of Egypt's foreign policy and its policy toward the continent of Asia, President Mubarak said: "Egypt, as you know, is an African nation, but it is also an Asian nation by virtue of its location on the crossroads of the three great continents of Asia, Africa, and Europe. Furthermore, a part of Egypt's territory--Sinai--is in the continent of Asia." He added: "The areas of Egypt's contemporary political influence, as well as the realms of Egypt's activity throughout the course of history, have been basically Africa and Asia due to Egypt's relations with the Arab peoples and nations starting many centuries ago and continuing till the present day. "Egypt's ties to the Arab nations in Asia are not merely attributable to cultural and historical ties, but are also attributable to well-known vital economic interests, since the Egyptian economy is affected both directly and indirectly by the circumstances of the thousands of expatriate Egyptian workers in the Gulf nations. "The developments experienced by the Gulf area since the beginning of the eighties have confirmed to what great degree the security situation in the Gulf affects the security of the Arab world and consequently the security of Egypt, and this was clearly shown during the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran and the Gulf war in 1990." Cultural and Religious Ties President Mubarak continued: "In addition to this, we of Egypt have cultural and religious ties to a large number of the Islamic nations and peoples in Asia, and this has impelled Egyptian policy to be oriented toward dedicating a large part of its concerns and activities to strengthening the bonds of mutual understanding between us. "We cannot ignore the economic and political importance of the nations of Asia and the Pacific area, ties that have reached the point where they account for nearly half of the world's production and international trade. This leads us to predict that the 21st century will truly be the century of the continent of Asia, which is witnessing the appearance of large economic blocs. "Because of all these objective considerations and in light of the traditional relations of friendship that have linked Egypt to most of the nations and peoples of Asia for a long time, Egyptian policy is pursuing an active diplomacy with most of the nations of the [Asian] continent on the political, economic, and cultural levels. For the sake of achieving security and stability in this continent, which is inhabited by most of the world's population, Egypt is exchanging visits and delegations with these nations and is following their developments with great interest, and is participating along with other nations and organizations of the international community in the search for solutions to the problems that may appear from time to time."
