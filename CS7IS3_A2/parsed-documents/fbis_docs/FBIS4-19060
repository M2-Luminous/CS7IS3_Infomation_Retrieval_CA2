Algeria is "France's biggest foreign policy problem, which the government must face in the coming weeks and months," according to a senior French official. "And let us face it, France is not equipped to deal with it." Paris was not surprised by the resignation of Prime Minister Redha Malek. Government circles in Paris consider that "Redha Malek's resignation does not change the nature of the problem." French officials in charge of the issue acknowledge that "the regime's odds for survival are now very low." However, they still cling to the hope that the crisis may be defused through dialogue with some fundamentalist leaders and the unlikely improvement of a disastrous economic situation which favors "holy war" mongers. The devaluation of the dinar has paved the way for renewed international financial aid. Other emergency measures are expected, allowing for a rescheduling of the country's $26-billion debt. French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe is determined to urge Algeria's creditors to help the country. He already did so in Tokyo during his recent trip to Japan, which is Algeria's second biggest creditor. He will address his European Union counterparts this week as well. In Paris, the feeling is that other nations remain tragically indifferent to a highly hazardous situation. "Nobody is helping us to help them," complained the aforementioned senior official. While readily acknowledging that the blame for the current tragedy falls squarely on the shoulders of Algerian leaders, he said they should be helped all the same as "they remain the lesser evil." "Should fundamentalists gain power in Algiers," he added, "we would be left with a regime hostile to the West and to France, perhaps even a terrorist one. Contagion in Morocco and Tunisia will be unavoidable, and even in Egypt." The United States does not want to have anything to do with the current regime. French diplomats even charge Washington with "talking to fundamentalists," because it thinks their victory is unavoidable. "They have not learned the lessons of Iran," says a fuming French official. The French concede, however, that there cannot be a political solution that does not include the fundamentalists. France did persuade Algiers to negotiate with fundamentalists over the last few months. But Paris admits that [President] Zeroual's attempts to do so have so far failed. In fact, aware both of their powerlessness in influencing the way things are going in Algeria and of the country's apparently irreversible slide into civil war, French officials seem to be mostly concerned with planning the measures that must be taken to face the exodus that has already started. While repatriating the 2,500 French nationals still in the country will not be a problem, integrating the 50,000 or 60,000 with dual citizenship that are registered in Algeria will be more difficult. Senior officials reject the notion of throwing the doors open for the 100,000 or so individuals that may try to take advantage of their ties with France, not to mention the 400,000 or 500,000 Algerians who might cross the Mediterranean as "boat people." "French society cannot cope with such an influx of people," say parliamentary representatives of the [governing] majority. Associations of "pieds-noirs" [Algerian-born French nationals] have already voiced their opposition to an "open-door" policy. Thus far, the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless People has approved very few refugee status applications from Algerian nationals. There are no plans to extend "temporary" refugee status to Algerian expatriates, as was done for war victims from Lebanon or the former Yugoslavia. "This would trigger a tidal wave of immigrants to our shores," says an official, who gives the same explanation with respect to the government's reluctance to open a debate on ways to reconcile France's asylum tradition, its historical ties with Algeria, and the fear of political destabilization.
