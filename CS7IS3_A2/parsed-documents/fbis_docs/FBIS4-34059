After President Itamar Franco trampled on it in the chapters on rents, school fees, and the antitrust law, the economic team now finds itself facing a greater threat: the regulation of banking interest rates. President Franco has asked Deputy Benito Gama (PFL-BA) [Liberal Front Party - Bahia] to hasten the presentation of the draft bill regulating Article 192, Paragraph 3, of the Constitution, which establishes that real interest rates (not including the inflation rate) cannot surpass 12 percent annually. (Public federal bonds currently earn an interest rate of 25 percent.) But it so happens that Finance Minister Rubens Ricupero had asked Deputy Gama exactly the opposite, that is, to delay as much as possible the presentation of the aforementioned draft bill. Deputy Gama presides over the special Chamber of Deputies Committee that will present the draft bill by order of the Federal Supreme Court. The first deadline for presenting the draft bill is 20 June, but Gama had agreed with Ricupero that he will ask for an extension of the deadline. All the members of the economic team, without exception, consider it absurd to regulate interest rates. According to them, it is wrong in theory, unfeasible in practice, and politically incorrect. President Itamar maintains a populist view that high interest rates are caused by bank profiteering with the connivance of the Central Bank, while the economic team members believe that the high interest rates are the consequence of the chronic inflationary state of the Brazilian economy. The whole logic of the Real Plan foresees minimum government intervention in the economy. If government intervention is necessary, the idea is to maintain economic neutrality so that contracts in the new currency maintain the same equilibrium. Directly inspired by President Itamar, exactly the opposite was done with the conversion [into URV, real value unit] of the school fees. Although they officially remain silent, the economic team members believe that the formula to convert the school fees [into URV] is simply absurd, because it takes into account the nominal average fees of the previous four months rather than the nominal real average fees. The economic team also believes that the president's intervention undermined the rent issue. Besides, the delay in making a decision has resulted in some inflation points being carried over to the inflation rate of July, the first month in which the real will come into circulation. The rent contracts that are converted into URV now will be paid in June, and they will then be included in the composition of prices. The economic team members believe that the uproar the president made over the antitrust law has had a single effect: an effective increase of prices, besides creating an atmosphere of instability which is something very negative for the new currency. They believe that it is not necessary to issue an arrest warrant against businessmen to make them lower their prices. They believe that prices will remain stable because the public deficit will be under control, the economy restrained, without any excessive demands, and because the real will break the inflationary inertia.
