In Ponomarev's opinion, efforts to guarantee the social protection of the population will be the main distinction of the Democratic Russia party. The Democratic Russia movement has still not officially announced its reorganisation into a party. However, the decision of the latest plenary meeting of its council of representatives to draw up lists of movement members should be regarded as a step in this direction. The question of whether to set up a party or not will be decided by the movement's congress. It was decided to leave unchanged the principle of collective membership and the status of supporters, not wishing to be registered as official members, until the convocation of the congress. The regional organisations of the Democratic Russia movement will independently decide on the extent of their participation in the formation of local party cells. Ponomarev makes no bones of the fact that this decision was prompted by Gaydar's initiative to set up a party. The movement, set up about three years ago, has for a long time provided massive backing to the Russian reforms. It campaigned in one bloc with the "Russia's Choice" during the recent elections. Nevertheless, Democratic Russia has still not been offered to become part and parcel of Gaydar's party, which, in Ponomarev's opinion, would have been quite natural. "We have given altruistic support to the Gaydar government for a very long time and have even backed his shock therapy idea. However, both they and the leadership of Russia as a whole have failed to do the main thing -- explain to the nation the essence of the ongoing reforms. They also forgot to guarantee the social protection of the Russian citizens," Ponomarev said, assessing the looming split between the two previously main allies of the democratic camp. However, he stressed that members of the Democratic Russia movement still wished to rally all the democrats, including the "Russia's Choice", "Yavlinskiy-Boldarev-Lukin", "December 12", and the Democratic Russia parliamentary factions. Time will show whether these former allies will become rivals or not, and how effective the movement will be in its new form. In the meantime, only about one thousand people have signed up as members of the Democratic Russia movement during the few days of registration in ten municipal constituencies. According to Ponomarev's assessment at least 40-50 thousand Russians may join the new party.
