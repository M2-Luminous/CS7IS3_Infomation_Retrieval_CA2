On Tuesday, Premier Li Peng said the government would do its best, with the nation's help, to keep the retail price index below the budgeted 10 percent. However, it will be a tough task as the pressure powering inflation is growing, and in January and February, retail prices rose 20 percent higher than in the same period of last year, said the State Statistics Bureau (SSB). So dealing with the problem has become a priority. It will mean sharply cutting investment in fixed assets and the strict control of consumer spending, which was agreed at a forum on monetary policies held recently in Beijing. The capital's financiers decided the central People's Bank of China should throttle the broad money supply to deal safely with inflation's time bomb. Economists believed runaway inflation inevitably leads to a decline in people's living standards and threatens economic and social stability. The SSB said people's living standards in some cities plunged as much as 40 percent last year. And farmers, who make up about 80 percent of the population, are no happier than their urban counterparts. The statistics showed their real per capita income remained more or less static last year. Most economists said two main factors were causing the current rise in inflation. One was hefty investments in fixed assets, the other was the explosive increase in consumer spending. Investment in fixed assets grew by 47 percent last year, while production advanced only 10 percent, said Yu Tianyi, professor from the China Finance Institute. To curb rocketing investment in fixed assets and real estate, the country put the brakes on the money supply in the second half of last year. However, the move failed to retrieve most of the capital which had by then become reinforced concrete. Instead, working capital was squeezed, slowing the growth in production. Yu said holding down investment in fixed assets would need administrative measures backed by stern monetary policies. The government has resolved to slow the country's economic growth this year, said Premier Li Peng, in his keynote speech to the National People's Congress (NPC). The target is a 9 percent growth rate, four per cent lower than the figure for the last two years. To hold down the growth in fixed assets investment while maintaining modest economic progress, the central bank should impose strict controls over credit and loans, economists say. However, that does not mean shutting down the money supply indiscriminately. Nationwide investment should focus on propping up essential industries and agriculture and helping loss-making State enterprises to improve their technology and production capacity. These targets will only be achieved if governments, State enterprises and banks speed up internal reforms and improve their management. However, some economists support a more flexible credit policy to sustain backing for ailing State enterprises. For their ability to pay back loans may decline if their investments reduce sharply said Dai Genyou, an official with the People's Bank of China. The other cause of inflation is the huge rise in spending. The tight monetary policies imposed late last year have held down the prices of production materials, but had little effect on consumer goods, said Dai. Economists trace rising prices to the lifting last year of controls on the cost of most consumer goods. The problem has been further fueled by people's increased spending power as their wages go up. Dai said a third of State enterprises were in the red last year despite considerably increased production. Much of their cash was used to finance the rapid growth in employee's wages. China should cap pay rises in order to restrain the growth in the retail price index, said Dai.
