Originally provisional, this project has become definite. Henceforth it will be taken over by the European Environment Agency because its mission foreshadows that of the new institution: To study the feasibility of an information system on the environment. The aim is to design a geographical database (maps), which would need to be comparable from one country to another, on various environmental issues. Six inventories are currently being drawn up or have been completed: on atmospheric emissions, water quality, biotopes, coastal erosion, soil erosion, and finally land use. This is a vital tool for carrying out thematic studies at European, national, or regional levels. The land use program called "CORINE Land Cover" is being carried out under the leadership of the French Environment Institute (IFEN). It uses photographs transmitted by the (American) Landsat and (European) SPOT satellites, but also many aerial photographs, to draw up an accurate inventory (on a scale of 1:100,000) of the land used by towns, agriculture, forests, and other natural spaces. Compared in time (with old maps), these data make it possible to follow the progress of urban development, the erosion of natural areas, the development of pollution, and so forth, in 22 European countries. A valuable tool for planners, and especially for regions, but also for the allocation of EU [European Union] regional aid.
