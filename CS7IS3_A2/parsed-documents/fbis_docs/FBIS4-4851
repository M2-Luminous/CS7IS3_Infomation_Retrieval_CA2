Nazarbayev is scheduled to meet business leaders Thursday and hold talks with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in the evening. On Friday, he is to meet Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, and hold a press conference. Nazarbayev, 53, is accompanied by Kazakhstan business executives and cabinet ministers, including Akezhan Kazhegeljdin, first deputy prime minister, and Galym Abilsiitov, deputy premier, and minister of science and new technology. In talks between Nazarbayev and Hosokawa, Japan is expected to voice support for Nazarbayev's efforts to promote democratization, economic reforms and a shift toward a market economy, Foreign Ministry officials said. Japan will give high marks to Kazakhstan's entry into the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) as a nonnuclear state last December and reaffirm its intention to cooperate in dismantling Kazakhstan's nuclear weapons in accordance with an agreement signed last month, the officials said. Specifically, the Japanese Government will agree to help people who were exposed to radioactivity near the former Soviet Union's Semipalatinsk nuclear testing site by sending medical experts and providing medical equipment, ministry sources said. An estimated 233 million tons of radioactive substances are left in Kazakhstan. The costs will be covered by 100 million dollars Japan pledged last year to help four former Soviet republics dismantle nuclear weapons. The four are Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. Also on the agenda for talks are environmental cooperation, economic cooperation and expanding personnel exchanges, the officials said. The environmental cooperation involves preservation of the environment in the Aral sea, they said.
