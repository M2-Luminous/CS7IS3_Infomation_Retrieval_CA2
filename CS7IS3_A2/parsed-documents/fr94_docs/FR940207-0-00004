FR940207-0-00004 FR940207-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AAL&hyph;02] Modification of Class E Airspace; Kotzebue, AK AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action modifies the Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK, which corrects the legal description that inadvertently eliminated the Class E surface area extensions during the Terminal Airspace Reconfiguration Amendment No. 71&hyph;16. Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is no operating control tower is now Class E airspace. This action will provide adequate controlled airspace extending from the surface for aircraft executing established standard instrument approach procedures (SIAP). The area will be depicted on aeronautical charts to provide a reference for pilots operating in the area. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 u.t.c. April 28, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert C. Durand, System Management Branch, AAL&hyph;531, Federal Aviation Administration, Module G, 222 West 7th Avenue # 14, Anchorage, AK 99513&hyph;7587; telephone number: (907) 271&hyph;5898. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On September 2, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify the Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK (58 FR 46586). The proposal was to correct the legal description which inadvertently eliminated the Class E surface area extensions during the Terminal Airspace Reconfiguration Amendment No. 71&hyph;16. Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments were received. Airspace Reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``control zone,'' and airspace designated from the surface for an airport where there is no operating control tower is now Class E airspace. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Class E airspace designations for controlled airspace areas extending upward from the surface where there is no operating control tower are published in paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This Amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations modifies Class E airspace at Kotzebue, AK, to provide controlled airspace from the surface for IFR operations at the Kotzebue Airport at Kotzebue. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant Regulatory Action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71 as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1. The authority citation for part 71 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. app. 1348(a), 1354(a), 1510; E.O. 10854, 24 FR 9565, 3 CFR, 1959&hyph;1963 Comp., p. 389; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 11.69. §71.1 [Amended] 2. The incorporation by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 of Federal Aviation Administration Order 7400.9A, Airspace Designations and Reporting Points, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, is amended as follows: Paragraph 6002␣Class E Airspace Areas Designated as a Surface Area for an Airport * * * * * AAL AK E2 Kotzebue, AK [Revised] Kotzebue, Ralph Wien Memorial Airport, AK (lat. 66 ○53 ’04 ’ ’ N, long. 162 ○35 ’56 ’ ’ W) Kotzebue VOR/DME (lat. 66 ○53 ’08 ’ ’ N, long. 162 ○32 ’24 ’ ’ W) Hotham NDB (lat. 66 ○54 ’05 ’ ’ N, long. 162 ○33 ’52 ’ ’ W) Within a 4.3-mile radius of the Ralph Wien Memorial Airport and within 2.6 miles each side of the 039 ○ bearing from the Hotham NDB extending from the 4.3-mile radius to 8.9 miles northeast of the airport and within 2.4 miles each side of the 091 ○ radial from the Kotzebue VOR/DME extending from the 4.3-mile radius to 11.5 miles east of the airport and within 2.4 miles each side of the 278 ○ radial from the Kotzebue VOR/DME extending from the 4.3-mile radius to 10.2 miles west of the airport.
