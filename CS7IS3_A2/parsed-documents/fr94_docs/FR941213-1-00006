SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On November 29, 1988, OSHA proposed to revise the personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements in the shipyard employment standards (part 1915, subpart I)(53 FR 48150). This proposal updated references to national consensus standards and added requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection and care of PPE, training, lifesaving equipment and personal fall protection. The written comment period ended on February 27, 1989. The Agency received 10 comments on the proposed rule, and one hearing request, which was withdrawn. On August 16, 1989, OSHA proposed to update the existing general industry standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;060) for eye and face (§1910.133), head (§1910.135) and foot (1910.136) PPE and to add generic requirements for hazard assessment, proper selection of PPE, prohibition on use of damaged or defective PPE and training in the proper use of PPE, §§1910.132(d) through (f) (54 FR 33832). On April 10, 1990, the Agency proposed to add criteria for personal fall arrest equipment (§1910.128, 1910.129 and 1910.131) and positioning device equipment (§§1910.128 and 1910.130) to the general industry PPE standards (part 1910, subpart I, Docket S&hyph;057)(55 FR 13423). The two general industry rulemakings generated extensive rulemaking records, including hundreds of comments and several thousand pages of hearing testimony. On April 6, 1994, OSHA issued a final rule (59 FR 16334) which completed Agency action in the general industry PPE proceeding. Based on the rulemaking record, (59 FR 16334, Docket S&hyph;050), OSHA made some changes to the proposed rule in drafting the final rule. In particular, OSHA revised the proposed training requirements to provide clear requirements for what is adequate training and what circumstances trigger retraining. In addition, the final rule added requirements for certification that the required hazard assessment (§1910.132(d)(2)) and training (§§1910.132(f)(4)) had been performed. Also, based on the general industry rulemaking record (Docket S&hyph;057), the Agency is considering whether it should revise the proposed rule for general industry fall protection PPE to further limit or to prohibit the use of body belts and non-locking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems. In a related rulemaking for fall protection in the construction industry, OSHA recently issued a final rule (59 FR 40672, August 9, 1994) which prohibits the use of body belts and nonlocking snap hooks in personal fall arrest systems after December 31, 1997. The Agency believes that the substance of the OSHA standards for general industry (part 1910), shipyard (part 1915) and construction employment (part 1926) should be consistent where possible. OSHA believes that PPE used in shipyard employment does not differ markedly from PPE used in general industry, and that the standards covering PPE use should not differ markedly either. While the Agency recognizes that work activities in shipyard employment often differ from those in other industries, the Agency believes that much of the information generated in the general industry rulemakings will help the Agency draft the final rule for shipyard PPE. To this end, OSHA formally incorporated the general industry PPE rulemaking records (Dockets S&hyph;057 and S&hyph;060) into the record for the shipyard employment PPE rulemaking (59 FR 34586, July 6, 1994).
