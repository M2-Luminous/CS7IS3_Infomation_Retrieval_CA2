Pushtu-language speaking rebels abducted 16-year-old Kim Housego and David Mackie, 36, at Aroo near the resort town of Pahalgam, the news agency quoted officials as saying in the Kashmir summer capital Srinagar. No group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, the first of British nationals in Kashmir since 1989, when the Muslim separatist drive became violent. A Foreign Office report from London said Housego's parents were also kidnapped but released later to transmit the demand of the rebels seeking the release of three comrades being held by Indian authorities. Housego's father David, formerly a New Delhi-based correspondent of the Financial Times, reported the abduction to police, officials said. Meanwhile, army soldiers patrolled the curfew-bound town of Bhaderwah in the southern district of Doda to prevent violence following the gunning down of Hindu leader Rocher Kumar of the Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People's Party, BJP). Kumar was shot dead by unidentified militants in his house early Tuesday. His killers fled but the murder sparked clashes and arson attacks in which at least 10 houses were torched, officials said. A curfew was clamped in Bhaderwah and the nearby town of Kishtwar, both of which are described as "communally sensitive." Officials said 11 more people died overnight Monday in gunbattles linked to the Muslim rebel campaign for secession from India. India and neighbouring Pakistan have fought two of their three wars over the disputed state.
