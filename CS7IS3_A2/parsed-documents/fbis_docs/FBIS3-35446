Winding up the debate, Federal Interior Minister, retired Major General Nasirullah Khan Babar, said successful commando operation against the hijackers has saved the country from a national calamity. The minister said the government had no option but to resort to an operation against the hijackers who had refused to listen to any reason. Gen. Babar said the government had made it clear that it would not bow before any act of terrorism. Earlier, Mr. Abdur Rahim Mandokhel, Mr. Mohammad Ibrahim Khan, Dr. Mohammad Rehan, Mr. Shahzad Gul, and Federal Minister for Special Education Dr. Sher Afghan participated in the debate on the bus hijacking. In a written statement to the house on the attack of Pakistan Chancery building in Kabul by 100 people yesterday, the federal minister for law, justice, and parliamentary affairs, Syed Iqbal Haider, told the Senate that Pakistan was astonished that such a reaction had taken place in Kabul in support of the criminal act in which innocent children were taken hostage at gun point by three criminals. He said there was no cause for this reaction, particularly as the action against the three hijackers was taken in the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad with the consent and cooperation of the Afghan Government. The minister said this act of terrorism has been condemned by the Afghan president and prime minister. Syed Iqbal Haider said the reaction of the demonstrators on the question of food supplies to Kabul was also irrational and unreasonable. The Pakistan Government had already donated and dispatched 32,000 tons of wheat to Afghanistan during last year and was in the process of sending additional relief wheat as well as other goods to Afghanistan. The foreign minister, Sardar Asif Ahmad Ali, had only recently undertaken a humanitarian mission to Jalalabad to secure food supplies to Kabul through the ICRC by persuading Prime Minister Hekmatyar to open the route for relief convoys. Pakistan's borders had always remained open for the transport of relief goods. The route between Jalalabad and Kabul was an internal matter for the Afghan leaders. However, Pakistan was urging them to keep all internal Afghan routes open for humanitarian relief. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now going to consider the question of temporary closure of its embassy in Kabul and the issue of compensation for damage to our chancery. Decisions shall be taken after examining all possible aspects of our relations with Afghanistan. However, the Government of Pakistan will not allow the acts of criminals to undermine the close brotherly relations between the two countries.
