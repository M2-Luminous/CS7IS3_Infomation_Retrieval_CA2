The United States, booted out of a dirt-poor Third World country as a neocolonial oppressor, would never again meddle in Indochina -- an outcome that was to dull the sweetness of victory into the blandness of irony in the course of time. Vietnam's seasoned soldiers found it hard to consecrate their glory in peace, and for more than a decade after the fall of Saigon in 1975, they strove to rule the regional roost, standing up to all outside pretenders. The exertions of military power, even after the roost was reached, could not still the groans of empty stomachs, however. The doi moi [renovation] reforms were instituted in 1986, and soon after, the irony of victory was made plain. Vietnam's economic horizons were clouded by the sore indifference of the world's biggest economic power. Until today the injured pride of American patriotism is still refusing to heal, and upon turning its back on Indochina, America found it hard to forgive and forget. Thus, the sourpuss' fault-finding denial of diplomatic and economic good sense -- since the end of Cold War rivalry, U.S. policy over Vietnam, and by extension, the whole of Indochina, has been held to ransom by a handful of MIA refuseniks. How the MIA issue, the agitprop made out of 2,238 missing in-action servicemen still unaccounted for, can still sear the national conscience, is due to the recrudescence of Yankee pride marked by the Reagan presidency after years of liberal protest and self-doubt. Only the right-wing America Firsters can carry the compulsion to get even as belatedly as this and assign Ann Mills Griffiths, executive director of the National League of Families (of MIA's) a central role in the highest inter-agency policy planning level. "Because of her, U.S. policy towards Vietnam was determined by the narrow -- albeit deserving -- concerns of the MIA families," according to a pro-normalisation advocate in Washington. The Clinton Administration, in spite of its eye on the domestic implications of foreign policy, has kept a safe distance from the emotive pull of the bereaved families. To the president's credit, he has attempted a rational tack, one directed at a constituency governed by the hard facts of economic realism. The announcement of the lifting of the 30-year-old trade embargo was excitedly welcomed by U.S. businessmen in Hanoi yesterday. In spite of Clinton's cleverness at political dissimulation -- he said the embargo's withdrawal was intended to get the "fullest possible accounting" of the MIAs and denied its practical merits -- the move is a first step towards long overdue normalisation. Part of this procrastination has been due to Clinton himself: a good-guy president who is much too vulnerable to angry placard-waving. No matter how it has been packaged and disguised, the president's hard-headed practicality in the Vietnam issue is a change from his usual weak-stomached dallying over foreign policy. Vietnam, of course, has it all to gain. No one is going overboard in expectations of a flood, but at least the door has been flung wide open. Even with the embargo in place, although somewhat relaxed, Vietnam obtained 7.5 percent economic growth in 1993. Without its biggest single constraint, that economy could well grow by more than 10 percent this year. [passage omitted]
