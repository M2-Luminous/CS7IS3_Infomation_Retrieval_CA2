"Bosnian infantry units are expanding and advancing their trench system in Zuc and Mojmilo," two regions that overlook the capital, Aikman said. "They're improving their defense positions. It's a violation of the ceasefire." The ceasefire went into effect last Thursday and was prompted by a mortar attack on a Sarajevo market that left 68 people dead and 197 injured. The attack also prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to issue an ultimatum giving Bosnian Serbs besieging Sarajevo until February 21 to surrender their heavy weapons or face air strikes. The Bosnian army also must abide by the ultimatum. The weapons handover, which began Friday, has been proceeding at a snail's pace with each side handing in only a few pieces of artillery. Aikman said the Serbs surrendered two mortars Sunday evening, bringing to 28 the total number of mortars and heavy artillery they have handed in since Friday. The weapons are under UN custody. The Bosnian army, for its part, has so far handed in 10 mortars, Aikman said.
