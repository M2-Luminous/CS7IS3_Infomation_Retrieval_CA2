The new convoy should leave from Zagreb Monday, travelling through the Serb-held town of Banja Luka, said Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The second 10-truck run will provide a real test of Serb will to allow humanitarian aid for the 100,000 people living in the enclave, which has been under Serb siege since mid-1993. [passage omitted] "It's wonderful, we all are very pleased, we finally succeeded," said Kris Janowksi, a UNHCR spokesman in Sarajevo. Janowski said several additional convoys are scheduled in coming days to assist the region's war-weary population, described in a recent UN report as walking skeletons. On Sunday, the Bosnian Serb army denied Croat reports that it was retreating from Maglaj to the town of Teslic, 20 kilometres (12 miles) further north-west. Croatian Radio said the withdrawal followed an ultimatum by the HVO commander in Zepce, a Croat enclave 20 kilometres south of Maglaj. In a statement carried by the local Serb agency SRNA, a commander of the First Army Corps of the self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic described the report as "pure disinformation and a propaganda action by the Croat media." Serb forces "are not withdrawing and their heavy arms are not blocked," said the statement.
