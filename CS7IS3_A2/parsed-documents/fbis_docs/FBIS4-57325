Rodriguez] [Text] Tegucigalpa -- The government will not negotiate with international financial organizations to continue the economic adjustment program imposed by Rafael Leonardo Callejas' administration. It will instead present its own proposal, which has been coordinated with different productive sectors. The statement was made yesterday by Economy Minister Delmer Urbizo Panting a few hours prior to talks with international credit organizations, scheduled for today and tomorrow. He added that the international representatives' visits will involve preliminary negotiations where they will discuss the terms for a negotiation and the possible results, to have an overall idea and later notify all the groups. "We must temper agreements reached by the previous government and the conditions (established with financial organizations) so these do not have a violent impact on the Honduran people; if they made credits contingent upon something, we will try to reverse that," he said. Referring to the increase in some staple product prices, Urbizo Panting said that according to figures from the Central Bank of Honduras, there was a 3 percent increase in February, but it dropped in March, which proves it has been a moderate increase. The economy minister said agreements have been reached with the private sector concerning price controls, a salary increase, and the supply of assets and services. He added that when the economic cabinet begins to discuss the scope of the measures with international organizations, the cabinet will have to first reach an agreement with businessmen so that they are fully aware of the situation. The official said the government wants the national community to be aware of the possible results of the credit organizations' plans and the state's position in the talks. He emphasized that joint efforts must be exerted by all national groups to face the challenge, not only of international organizations but also the challenge resulting from a shortage of products.
