The general rejected the accusations and explained that some of his expressions may have been caused by misunderstanding or inadequate translation. But he repeated his statement about the regrettable corruption in the Estonian society and added that his January 5 decree on combatting corruption in the army had gone unnoticed by the mass media and the government institutions. Only one private company had expressed its interests in the guidelines, he pointed out. General Einseln also repeated his criticism of the Laanemaa Volunteer Rifle Company, which he had compared to the Nazi stormtroopers. The company, "an experimental unit organised by politicians", is completely useless to Estonia, he said, but refrained from further comments, since no definite decision had been made. He did express his opinion that forces outside Estonia may have been involved and also cited the judgement of the Finnish military expert, Colonel Matti Lukkari, of the Rifle Company. The general further criticised the draft law on peacetime military service as useless in its present form and repeated his conviction that the defence concept must be approved by the nation. He rejected the accusations by MP [member of parliament] Katrin Linde and Minister Peeter Olesk, explaining that Linde had never discussed the matters she had included in her draft law. General Einseln pointed out that Olesk had not met him or asked for information concerning the Rifle Company affair before accusing him of failing to react to the events.
