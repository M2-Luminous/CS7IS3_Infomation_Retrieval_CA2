"We have 49 percent of its shares for sale," confirmed the minister, although he would not say to whom he wanted to sell the LOT shares. "It does not have to be a strategic investor, nor does it have to be an airline company," noted Liberadzki. Asked by a PAP journalist whether American Airlines would be involved, the minister said LOT had concluded a strategic alliance with the American carrier and "that is enough for the moment." He added that during the latest conference of transport ministers in France he talked with the American secretary of transportation about "aviation and roads." The minister denied that a two-year deadline for privatizing LOT (since its transformation into a State Treasury company) would expire in December this year, as "special legislation applies in this case." "First we have to establish the true value of LOT whose book value is 2.02 trillion zloty," he added.
