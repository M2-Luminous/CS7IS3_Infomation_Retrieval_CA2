The Project, from the commencement of work to completion, or to such earlier date or dates when the Owner may take possession and control in whole or in part as hereinafter provided shall be under the charge and control of the Bidder and during such period of control by the Bidder all risks in connection with the construction of the Project and the materials to be used therein shall be borne by the Bidder. The Bidder shall make good and fully repair all injuries and damages to the Project or any portion thereof under the control of the Bidder by reason of any act of God or other casualty or cause whether or not the same shall have occurred by reason of the Bidder's negligence.
