The length of the border would appear to have been shortened, but, judging from the fact that you are spending most of your time out of the office, the number of concerns has increased in inverse proportion. What is the explanation for this? [Nikolayev] The border of the former Union exceeded 62,000 km, while Russia's border is 60,932 km. Not a large difference, as you can see. The numerical strength of Russia's Border Troops is 30,000 men below the Union level. As much as 30 percent of the Border Troops' assets, along with engineering and technical equipment, remained outside of Russia. This means that the border has been weakened by the same percentage. Around 1,500 border violators have been apprehended just since the beginning of this year. Around 400 weapons and a large quantity of ammunition have been detected and confiscated. And so, as you can see, the border fully reflects those disturbing processes occurring inside the country. This is why I perform my job more on the border than in the office. This is confirmed by the fact that I have gone on special assignment 14 times in 2 months. [Lunev] You were recently made a member of the Security Council, which means that the border service today is regarded not just as armed protection and defense of Russia's borders but also as a political field contributing to the maintenance of diplomatic mutual understanding of contiguous states. Is that so? [Nikolayev] One has to be a diplomat, to seek and find mutually acceptable decisions on issues involvig contiguous states. Reality is forcing us to do that: the border with countries which are not members of the Commonwealth--the Baltic states (which have a border with the Russian Federation stretching 1,025 km, and the crossing of the border is not defined in the international legal respect); the border with Norway, Finland, Poland, the PRC, Mongolia, Korea, Japan and the USA, which coincides with the border of the former USSR (with a length of 9,758.2 km; the maritime border with Japan and he United States is not defined by legal treaty); the border with the Commonwealth nations--Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan--which extends more than 12,000 km (these border sections are not covered in the military respect and are not defined by legal treaty). [Lunev] Andrey Ivanovich, your name appeared in the newspapers when you were still a young lieutenant. Today you are a colonel-general. An entire lifetime separates these milestones. If you can, tell us about that briefly. [Nikolayev] I was born in Moscow four years following the Victory. I had to become a military man if only because that was the main occupation for men like us. My father was a colonel-general. He brought us up in such way that I was never the general's son, but I was the son of a general. The reader may not believe that this fact brought me many unpleasant moments during my studies at the school. My career as an officer then began. I commanded a company, a battalion and a regiment. I graduated from the Academy imeni Frunze and the General Staff Academy. In order for people not to think that I achieved this through patronage I had to strive for gold medals, even though I am indifferent when it comes to any kind of award. I shall be happy if I can be of benefit to Russia in this post and if at least one of my sons continues the family tradition. [Lunev] How do you see the future of the Russian border? Will it be an "iron curtain" or something like the American-Mexican border? [Nikolayev] We shall form on the basis of treaties groups of Russian border troops in states of the "near abroad" for the joint protection of the CIS' external borders. Such groups have already been set up in Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzia. On other sectors of the border there will be a gradual transition from continuous (solid) engineering and technical equipment of protection based on barbed-wire obstacles to a system of covering individual sectors using the latest achievements of science and technology. With time, I am certain, there will be no "iron curtain."
