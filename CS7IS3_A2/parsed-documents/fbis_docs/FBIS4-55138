Tomorrow he will hold consultations with the political forces and on Wednesday [11 May] he will submit at parliament the cabinet's programme by year's end and the proposals for structural and personnel changes in the incumbent cabinet. Prof. Berov said the changes will not affect the Ministries of Defence, of the Interior and Agriculture. He will propose that some of the branch committees be closed down, including the Forestry Committee, whose functions will be taken over by the Environment Ministry. The Power Engineering Committee (PEC) will be transformed into a ministry to be headed by now PEC Chairman Nikita Shervadshidze. The proposals for cabinet changes also include a new trade minister. According to the prime minister, a new deputy prime minister without a portfolio should be named to replace Valentin Karabashev, who recently resigned. A candidate for this office is economist Roumen Getchev. All agencies, and particularly the Privatization Agency, will continue to operate contrary to press reports. Commenting on press allegations that Justice Minister Peter Kornazhev will be replaced, Prime Minister Berov said that he only declared his intention to move at parliament for revoking the memorandum on the execution of death sentences, to which the justice minister responded by threatening to resign in case the MPs second the proposal. According to Prof. Berov, the figures on the May 4 token strike called by the Confederation of the Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria (KNSB, one of the two major labour organizations in this country) were substantially exaggerated. He further said that the future will show how many people supported the strike and what ends it was after: social or political, adding that all of KNSB's reasonable demands will be met.
