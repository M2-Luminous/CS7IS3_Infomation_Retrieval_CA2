An approach similar to the GATT-EU approach could be the best way to deal with the economic legacies of the conflict. The expected partnership requires a balanced economic growth which means that the excessive disparities in income levels between potential partners in the region must be reduced. This can be achieved, at some stage, by freedom of movement for goods, services, capital and labor. In the end, peace is not in the hands of governments, but of individuals, and unless peace can be made attractive to the man on the street, the best efforts of those seeking to achieve peace will be fruitless, leading to the conclusion that the gradual achievement of peace for peoples who have suffered for a long time from the calamities of the conflict will not be possible. Such a thorough and clear view by His Highness Prince Hasan is principally based on the experience of Jordan, which is the nearest to the core of the conflict, and which shouldered an enormous human load. Jordan has given shelter to three waves of displaced Palestinians and endured a vast demographic strain and an approximately $7 billion in debts. Thus, the reconstruction of the Middle East could proceed apace, especially if this region is allowed to play a more creative role within the context of the world economy. The climate of conflict, which has been going on for a long time, has forced the diversion of efforts away from development to finance the military confrontations. We hope the approaching age of peace will mark the end of, and the last chapter in that conflict.
