FR940621-2-00041 FR940621-2-00031 Richmond Power Enterprise, L.P.; Petition [Docket No. RP94&hyph;286&hyph;000] June 15, 1994. Take notice that on June 10, 1994, Richmond Power Enterprise, L.P. (RPE) filed a petition for an order declaring that RPE has the right under the ``regulatory out'' provision of its off-peak transportation (OPI) service agreement with Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (Columbia) to terminate its service agreement for OPI service. RPE contends that this termination right was triggered by Commission orders regarding Columbia's Order No. 636 compliance filing. Specifically RPE asks the Commission to institute proceedings (but not evidentiary hearings), in accordance with an order of the bankruptcy judge in Columbia's bankruptcy proceeding, and to grant its motion for summary judgment regarding its termination rights under the OPI service agreement. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before July 6, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room. Lois D. Cashell, Secretary. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;15002 Filed 6&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6717&hyph;01&hyph;M
