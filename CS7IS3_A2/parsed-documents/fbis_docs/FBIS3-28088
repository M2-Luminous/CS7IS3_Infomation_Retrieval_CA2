Finance Minister Hong Chae-hyong, attending a meeting of business leaders sponsored by the Korea Employers' Federation on Wednesday, said the government would also selectively allow the introduction of foreign commercial loans to finance imports of capital goods for infrastructure expansion projects. To help corporate investment in foreign countries, restrictions on overseas real estate investment will be eased, while the red tape surrounding government approval of corporate foreign investment plans will be removed. In addition, overseas securities investment by institutional investors, such as securities houses and insurance companies, will be liberalized, Hong said. To improve the country's foreign investment environment, he added, the five-year industry-by-industry plan on market opening for foreign investors, set to start in 1996, will be revised to advance the opening date and broaden the opening scope. The increased investment in foreign industries and securities markets will check inflation due to an anticipated increase in foreign fund inflows in the coming year, he observed. Foreign investors are expected to increase their participation in the stock market here this year, combining with a current-account surplus expected for the year to expand foreign fund flows to the country. Corporations giving employees part of their profits in the form of a special bonus in shares, not in cash, will be accorded tax benefits in a bid to promote labor peace in such corporations, Hong said.
