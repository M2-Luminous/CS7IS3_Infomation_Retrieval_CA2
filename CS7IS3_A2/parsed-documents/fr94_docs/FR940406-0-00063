FR940406-0-00063 FR940406-0-00005 The Military Department will identify properties having a ready market and begin the appraisal process as soon as possible but not later than 6 months after completion of the new expedited McKinney Act screening process in paragraph 2. of this summary. The appraisals should take into consideration uncertainties and the associated risks in property development as well as the impact of the base closure on market conditions. Moreover, the appraisal will reflect the most likely range of uses consistent with local interests rather than highest and best use. To assist in determining the estimated fair market value, the Military Departments will solicit for expressions of interest for the entire or a substantial portion of the base for a period no longer than 6 months. The results will be shared with the local redevelopment authority. Expressions of interest will be solicited simultaneously with other screening and disposal actions and will not cause a delay in the disposal process. The Military Departments will analyze each expression of interest and determine if it represents a reasonable proposal that is likely to lead to rapid development and job creation. If after consulting extensively with the local community, the Military Department makes a favorable determination, the Department may decide to offer the property for sale. The local redevelopment authority will be promptly notified of the decision and may challange the decision. If the Military Department nevertheless decides to proceed with the sale, potential bidders will be strongly encouraged to work with the local redevelopment authority so that their proposals are compatible with the local redevelopment plan. Identifying a substantial portion of the base for sale, however, does not preclude the community's acquisition of the property through a negotiated sale with the Department of Defense. In the event that a base or substantial portion thereof, is identified as potentially valuable but does not sell due to the absence of a ready market, the property will then be available for conveyance for public benefit or, economic development purposes. Throughout this process, the Military Departments will make maximum effort to give community considerations a high priority. 5. Economic Development Conveyances Closing military bases often have a great deal of land that may not be readily developable or marketable due to its location. Additionally, closing bases often have buildings that may need to be demolished in order to encourage redevelopment and economic revitalization. Historically, the process of selling bases, or parts thereof, for fair market value has been time consuming and the proceeds from the few sales of base closure properties have been less than originally anticipated. In the past, the law permitted the Department of Defense to convey property at a discount of up to 100 percent (free of charge) for specific public purposes such as health, aviation, recreation, and education_but not for economic development. The new authority permits the DoD to convey land and buildings to redevelopment authorities initially for free, after it is determined that the base, or significant portions thereof, cannot be sold in accordance with the rapid job creation concept. Such conveyances may help induce a market for the property, thereby, enhancing economic recovery. Redevelopment authorities requesting an economic development conveyance, shall submit a simple written request containing four basic elements as described in the interim rule. Generally, installations will be conveyed at no initial cost with a recoupment provision that will permit the Department of Defense to share in any future profits should the base be later leased or sold. Bases in rural areas shall be conveyed under this authority at no cost and with no recoupment if they meet the standards as detailed in the interim rule. The conveyance for economic development should be used by local redevelopment authorities to gain control of large areas of the base, not just individual buildings. The income received from some of the higher value property should help offset the maintenance and marketing costs of the less desirable parcels. In order for this conveyance to spur redevelopment, large parcels must be used to provide an income stream to assist the long term development of the property.
