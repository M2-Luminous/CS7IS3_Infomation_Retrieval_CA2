FBIS4-57342 "drlat096_m_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-096 Daily Report 13 May 1994 Brazil Nine More Parties To Participate in Elections Nine More Parties To Participate in Elections PY1405034794 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO in Portuguese 13 May 94 p 4 PY1405034794 Rio de Janeiro O GLOBO Portuguese BFN [Text] Brasilia -- The Federal Supreme Court (STF) has approved modifications to the electoral law and has thus opened up space in the electoral competition for nine small parties. These modifications could cause changes in a political scenario that had been practically defined. The Social Christian Party [PSC], for example, is already considering the possibility of talking to Senator Jose Sarney (PMDB-AP) [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party--Amapa] if the STF also modifies the term for party registration. PSC President Vitor Nosseis said Senator Sarney would be welcome to the party if he decides to leave the PMDB to run in the elections. Even if Senator Sarney does not accept the PSC invitation, the party will have a presidential candidate, chosen between Brigadier Ivan Frota and Admiral Ernani Goulart Fortuna, former War College commander. Prona [Party for Redefinition of National Order] will also have a candidate: Eneas Ferreira Carneiro, who is ready to enter the electoral campaign with the same slogan he used during 1989: "My name is Eneas." At that time, he had only 15 seconds of free electoral propaganda time. Now he will have at least one minute, and he plans to make use of the space reserved for Prona's 18 gubernatorial candidates. Eneas asserts that if he could have two or three minutes, he would run over his rivals like a tractor. Among the other small parties, some still think about having their own candidates. Most of them, however, are committed to alliances with the large parties. The PMN [National Mobilization Party], which ran in the last elections with Celso Brandt as candidate, is holding talks with the PDT [Democratic Labor Party]. The PC do B [Communist Party of Brazil], the PPS [People's Socialist Party], and the PSTU [Unified Social Workers Party] joined the PT [Workers Party] in supporting Lula's candidacy. The PV [Green Party] is still holding talks with the PSDB [Brazilian Social Democracy Party], the PT, and the PDT. All the small parties will have free electoral propaganda time on television, and the TSE [Superior Electoral Court] will have to redistribute the free electoral propaganda time among 20 parties.
