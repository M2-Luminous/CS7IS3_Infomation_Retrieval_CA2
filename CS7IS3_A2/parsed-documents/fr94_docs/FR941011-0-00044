Background Section 169A of the Clean Air Act 1 establishes as a National goal the prevention of any future, and the remedying of any existing, impairment of visibility in mandatory Class I Federal areas 2 which impairment results from man-made air pollution. Section 169A called for EPA to, among other things, issue regulations to assure reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal, section 169A(a)(4), including requiring each State with a mandatory Class I Federal area to revise its State implementation plan (SIP) to contain such emission limits, schedules of compliance and other measures as may be necessary to make reasonable progress toward meeting the National goal. Section 169A(b)(2). 1 The Clean Air Act (``the Act'') is codified, as amended, in the U.S. Code at 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 2 Mandatory class I Federal areas are certain national parks, wildernesses and international parks described in section 162(a). These areas are the responsibility of ``Federal land managers'' (FLMs), the Secretary of the department with authority over such lands. See section 302(i) of the Act.
