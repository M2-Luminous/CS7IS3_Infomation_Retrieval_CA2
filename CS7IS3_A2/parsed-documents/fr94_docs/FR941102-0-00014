FR941102-0-00014 FR941102-0-00004 A national bank may establish an Exchange Act disclosure base for the Form S&hyph;3 by registering its common stock on Form 10 (General form for registration of securities pursuant to section 12(b) or 12(g) of the Exchange Act) prior to the effectiveness of its offering document and incorporating by reference the form pursuant to Item 12(a)(1) of Form S&hyph;3 in lieu of a Form 10&hyph;K (General form of annual report). The proposal also required that the registration statement must meet the requirements of the SEC regulations referred to in the registration form. Those regulations include Regulation S&hyph;X (17 CFR part 210), which applies to financial statements, and Regulation S&hyph;K (17 CFR part 229), which applies to the nonfinancial statement portion of the registration statement. The OCC expects that, consistent with SEC requirements and practice, filers will prepare registration statements for bank securities in accordance with Securities Act Industry Guide 3_Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies (17 CFR 229.801(c) and 231). Because the proposal required registration statements to satisfy the requirements of the SEC regulations referred to in the applicable registration form, the financial statements in the registration statements must be audited. The OCC sought comment on whether it should limit the requirement for audited financial statements to banks of a certain size and whether that size should be the cut-off for the requirement for annual independent audits that was established pursuant to section 112 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) (12 U.S.C. 1831m). Several commenters stated that the OCC should limit the audited financial statements requirement to banks of a certain size, although they disagreed as to what that size should be. After considering the comments, the OCC has decided not to limit the audited financial statements requirement to banks of a certain size. The final rule requires audited financial statements from national banks to the same extent that the SEC requires audited financial statements of other corporations. Requiring banks to provide audited financial statements in their registration statements helps ensure that purchasers of bank stock receive the same quality of disclosure and the same protections as do purchasers of stock of other types of issuers. Because the proposal required registration statements to comply with the SEC regulations referenced in the applicable registration form, banks that were subsidiaries of holding companies had to include audited bank financial statements, rather than bank holding company statements, in their registration statements. However, a number of commenters felt that banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies that have securities registered under the Exchange Act should not have to include audited bank financial statements in their registration statements. The commenters stated that these banks should instead be allowed to include in their registration statements the audited financial statements contained in the holding companies' Exchange Act filings and the banks' Call Reports. The OCC disagrees, and the final rule requires banks that are subsidiaries of holding companies to include audited bank financial statements in registration statements for bank securities. The OCC believes that purchasers of bank securities that are not subject to any sophistication requirements should be provided with bank, not merely holding company, financial statements. Those purchasers need bank level financial statements in order to make informed investment decisions about bank securities. The proposal cross-referenced the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1&hyph;3 of the SEC's general rules on registration in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). Regulation C includes the SEC rule on shelf registration in Rule 415 (17 CFR 230.415_Delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities). Shelf registration enables banks to register securities that are to be sold in the future and then to sell those securities when the market conditions are most favorable. Regulation C also includes SEC Rule 430A (17 CFR 230.430A_Prospectus in a registration statement at the time of effectiveness). Rule 430A allows an issuer to file a prospectus that omits certain information dependent on the offering price. The former part 16 did not contain any provisions comparable to Rule 415 or Rule 430A, so price and other information had to be set at the time an offering document was filed. The final rule, like the proposal, cross-references the requirements of Rule 400 and Articles 1&hyph;3 of the SEC's general rules on registration in SEC Regulation C (17 CFR 230.400 through 230.439). However, the final rule also cross-references the other articles of Regulation C (17 CFR 230.445 through 230.497). The OCC is cross-referencing the remaining articles of Regulation C in order to adopt the SEC's rules and procedures governing when registration statements and amendments become effective. (For a discussion of this matter see ``Effectiveness (ยง16.16)'' in this preamble). These remaining articles include rules on delaying amendments and acceleration of the effective date that are integral to the procedures under which registration statements and amendments become effective.
