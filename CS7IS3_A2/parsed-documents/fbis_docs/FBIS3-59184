For some time the Americans have shown an irresistible inclination to turn inward. They used to call it "splendid isolation," when talking about the American east and west coasts. Clinton's predecessor, George Bush, was the "foreign affairs" president. With his State of the Union address, Clinton has left no doubt that domestic policy is his priority. In his speech, Clinton was as brief as he was vague when talking about foreign issues. Naturally the president underlined the absolute leadership of the United States in the world. But he kept the foreign chapter strikingly short, to be able to go on all the quicker to popular domestic topics. Clinton's plan to reform health care in the United States is undoubtedly popular among average Americans, even though they find the plans unclear and scarcely comprehensible. But the reform plan is facing considerable opposition from the traditional right-wing camp -- including the Republicans and right-wing Democrats. It is now as good as certain that Clinton will have to water down his plans very significantly. So the question arises: How much of the original plan will remain when the president has reached a compromise with the Republican opposition? The president also wants to reform the support system for the millions of poverty-stricken Americans. Clinton wants to provide these people with social security benefits and training, but if they have not found work in the private sector after two years then the money will once again be shut off irrevocably. Clinton has not yet said how he will finance his plan. And for this plan too he will be obliged to compromise with the Republicans. The striking feature in the president's speech was the fight against crime. This is a very popular subject of conversation in the United States and the hobbyhorse of the "law-and-order fanatics" under the Republicans. Clinton wants to floor and even overtake his rivals on this particular Republican private hunting ground. And there is a very real danger of demagogically raising the stakes in the fight against crime. Clinton wants to take on 100,000 new policemen and build more prisons at a cost of US$23 billion. The anticrime law passed recently by the Senate expands the death sentence and has the president's support. Better than any other, Bill Clinton knows what themes make a president popular in the United States.
