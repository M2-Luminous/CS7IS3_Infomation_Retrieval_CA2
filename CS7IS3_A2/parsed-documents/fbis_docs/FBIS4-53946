Otani, 58, admitted to the bulk of the charges in his first hearing at the Nagoya District Court that while he was in the prefectural assembly he falsified declarations on political funds, but maintained that any tax evasion on the part of his supporters was a separate matter. He has refused to comment on whether or not his actions with a former secretary Susumu Ochiai, 51, who also faces charges in court, and his supporters constitute a conspiracy. Otani served four terms in the prefectural assembly before leaving the LDP to join Shinseito, the core party of the governing coalition. He left Shinseito in January after admitting to most of the charges. The prosecution alleged that Otani took advantage of a system under which persons giving a donation to a political group can reduce their tax payout by attaching a receipt from the group to their tax return. Prosecutors allege that some of the claims by his supporters of donations paid never existed. The prosecution alleges that as a result of the false claims, Otani and 72 of his supporters received a total of some 56 million yen in refunds as tax deductions. In his statement at a press conference following the hearing, Otani apologized to his supporters, but distanced himself from the period when he was a prefectural assemblyman, saying that since entering the Diet he had assumed new responsibilities. "I will decide how I will assume my responsibilities in the future, on the basis of the opinion around me and the judgment of the court," he said, in referring to questions on whether he would resign his Diet seat.
