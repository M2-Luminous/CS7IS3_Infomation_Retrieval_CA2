In June of this year, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and other leading comrades each made speeches in dedication at the opening ceremonies. Yesterday, the contest organizing committee distributed prizes to the winners in a solemn ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Premier Li Peng and other leading comrades met with the winning contestants at Zhongnanhai. Throughout the course of the competition, leaders from every province, city, autonomous region, and industry showed heartfelt concern and support for the talented stars of labor. All of this amply demonstrates that our party and nation attaches a great deal of importance to our nation's working class, and in particular, to the vast number of young workers. The labor of our workers, and especially that of our skilled workers, is the key link in transforming science and technology into a productive force, and is an important foundation of economic growth. Without the labor of workers who possess high quality and skill, high quality products would be impossible, as would a soaring economy. Science and technology is social wealth, and operational skill is also social wealth. In a certain sense, they are important sources of wealth at a deep level. We can introduce superb technology, advanced equipment, effective management techniques, and the applicable experts from abroad; but is it possible to introduce from abroad the vast numbers of skilled workers required for economic construction? The superb operational skills of talented workers can create incalculable social wealth that money cannot buy. For this reason, Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that, "skilled workers are the sine qua non of economic construction." This is something we must fully recognize. People can still remember back to the 1950's and 1960's when our nation was producing large numbers of skillful craftsmen and "masters of technology" like Li Ruihuan, Ni Zhifu, Hao Jianxiu, and Wang Chonglun. The "top notch work," "knack for getting the job done," and "work style" that these individuals demonstrated on the production line greatly enhanced product quality and production efficiency. Their diligent technical study and the superb skills they attained were of monumental value in promoting construction enthusiasm in the working classes throughout the nation. Countless "masters of technology" not only created huge amounts of material wealth for our society, but they created precious spiritual wealth for society as well. The party, the nation, and society as a whole attached enormous importance to these workers. Today there are 120 million enterprise employees and nearly 100 million township enterprise employees in China, with 170 million of these people being workers who are the main force behind the creation of material wealth in society. As science and technology and the economy all grow at a rapid pace, the demand for higher cultural and technical quality of workers grows stronger. Yet, if we look at the current situation in the worker ranks in China, we see that this demand is far from being met. Looking at the make up of our workers ranks, we find only 200,000 technicians and 2,000-plus highly skilled technicians. If we look at the proportions of skill capacities required for production, we find that our technician ranks should grow to one million workers. Heightening the technical quality of our worker ranks is indeed an urgent mission required for development of our national economy. Vigorous national development demands that, while we attach importance to and give full play to the role of the intellectuals, we also must attach importance to and give full play to the role of the skilled workers, and this applies with particular force to highly skilled workers. We must stress growth in the worker ranks, we must adopt various forms, we must pursue various routes, and we must accelerate the cultivation of the various forms, we must pursue varius routes, and we must accelerate the cultivation of the various specialized technical workers. We must create a social atmosphere that attaches importance to technical operational skills and that respects technical workers. Of course, singers, movie stars, and dancers are needed in society. But, if "these three stars are the only ones that shine," while the multitude of skilled workers and technical stars who create immense wealth for society are busy with their noses to the grindstone, working in obscurity, and getting the cold shoulder, or being condemned or denounced, how is society going to grow? We should pay more attention to shining the media spotlight of skilled workers, we should focus the camera lens and direct the pen more toward capturing the accomplishments of the skilled workers and technical stars, and we should let the people know that, without the contributions of our technical stars and skilled workers, our society would be floundering in emptiness as it chases its "stars." At the same time, we must call on leaders at every level to ardently show concern, to support, and to fully use and fully reward skilled workers and technical stars. This is an important measure that will prevent talent drain, safeguard the enthusiasm of skilled workers, and encourage skill growth and wealth creation on the job. Of course, further reform of an irrational labor wage system, destruction of the communal rice pot, and promotion of the social status of the skilled worker remain the fundamental ways to protect our skilled workers and induce young workers to study technical skills. I hope that the "technical stars" and the ranks of the skilled workers in China expand into an enormous and powerful force. When large numbers of "technical stars" and skilled workers emerge, then the Chinese economy will enjoy sustained, rapid, and healthy growth. We look forward to this wonderful future!
