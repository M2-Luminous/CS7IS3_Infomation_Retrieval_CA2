In a circular distributed nationwide recently, the general office of the State Council said that such trading organized by governments of province-level areas is subject to State Council approval. Governments of cities below the prefectural level may not organize such trading, the circular said. "Property rights of state-owned enterprises belong to the state," it stressed. The transfer of such rights of locally-managed state-owned companies is subject to approval of governments of cities above the prefectural level, it said. The transfer of such rights of state-owned companies managed by central departments is subject to State Council approval. So is the transfer of large state-owned enterprises, including those run by local governments, the circular noted. Before transferring their property rights, state-owned firms must evaluate their assets, including their land-use rights, and handle necessary procedures concerning changes in their property rights, it said. Proceeds from the transfer of such rights must be used, first of all, to repay bank loans and make living arrangements for employees of state-owned enterprises, it said. The remainder of such proceeds then can be used by local governments to aid structural readjustment or fund other state-owned companies, but may not be used as regular expenditures or to offset budgetary deficits or issue wages and bonuses. The circular banned the sale of such property rights at an unrealistically low price, the free distribution of such rights to individuals and the transfer of such rights on credit. It mandated government bodies to take specific measures to provide jobs and social security to workers of state-owned enterprises. It also asked relevant State Council departments to promptly formulate a set of new regulations governing the management of trading of property rights of state-run enterprises.
