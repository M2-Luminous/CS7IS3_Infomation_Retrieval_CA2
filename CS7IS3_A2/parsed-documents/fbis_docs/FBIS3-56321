Newspapers abounded with headlines like the following: "Russia Is Trying to Return Border Troops to Azerbaijan." At the "Musavat" party headquarters the visit was evaluated as a demonstration of "a new form of Russian expansionism," bearing in mind that the northern neighbor has not repudiated the idea of stationing Russian troops in Azerbaijan and switching the protection of the republic's external borders to their jurisdiction. During a meeting with President Geydar Aliyev the Russian Federation Border Troops commander in chief clarified the aim of his visit: "The Armenia-Azerbaijan border is a matter for the politicians of these two states. It is the question of protecting Azerbaijan's external borders which interests Russia." In a situation where the republic's southwestern regions are occupied and the Armenia-Azerbaijan border is to all intents and purposes non-existent there, while 170 km of the Iran-Azerbaijan border is under the control of Armenian armed formations, the proposal for Russia and Azerbaijan to collaborate in protecting the external borders, according to the head of state's reaction, has not been perceived in a positive light. AYNA writes that it is obviously pertinent to take account of the actual state of play in the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict and the situation on the fronts. In this connection Geydar Aliyev noted that Azerbaijan's border has in point of fact become an arena for military operations. According to commentators, the question of collaboration between the two states is directly linked with resolving the Karabakh conflict under rigorous compliance with international norms -- the guarantee of territorial integrity and the immutability of republic borders. Nowadays Azerbaijan is also concentrating on this in trying to alter the course and nature of the Karabakh war. To all appearances it was this interpretation of the approach to proposals from the Russian Federal Border Service that led to the decision to continue the talks. On this subject Andrey Nikolayevich gave a clarification: For talks to continue, the forms and methods of cooperation between the two states will have to be defined. To a question on the possibility of stationing Russian troops on the Iran-Azerbaijan border, the Russian Border Troops commander in chief gave an evasive reply: "It all depends on what both sides agree." On the eve of the visit Gasan Gasanov, leader of Azerbaijan's foreign policy department, discussed the aforementioned questions with the higher political leadership of Iran and Turkey. The Azerbaijan Foreign Ministry Press Center announced that agreement has already been reached between Turkey and Azerbaijan on transforming the border treaty between Turkey and the former USSR into a treaty between Turkey and Azerbaijan. Working commissions have been set up to study the question. Among other things, the two sides arrived at an agreement that efforts to alter the borders of the Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic and Azerbaijan by force will in general be evaluated by them as a breach of the Kars Treaty, and in that event Turkey will not remain a detached onlooker.
