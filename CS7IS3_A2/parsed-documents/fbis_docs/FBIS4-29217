His comment indicates in clearer terms than before the government's stance that it wants to obtain a permanent seat in the UNSC to contribute to the international community. Becoming a permanent member of the UNSC is an extremely important choice for Japan to make because it will determine its future course. However, no thorough discussions on this issue have yet been held, even in the Diet. We are deeply concerned that the government has repeatedly indicated its intention to seek a permanent seat in the UNSC while making no efforts to answer questions from the people or to form a national consensus. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata has long displayed a positive attitude toward obtaining the permanent membership. At a question-and-answer session held at the Diet last month, he expressed his willingness by saying: "If Japan, a nonnuclear nation, joins the UNSC as a permanent member, it will strengthen UN functions." In his speech given at the UN General Assembly last fall, former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa merely showed a moderate stance on Japan's bid to become a permanent UNSC member. Regarding the UNSC reform issue, he said: "It is important to actively make good use of the member nations, which have the will and capability to contribute to world prosperity and stability." It must be pointed out that "prosperity and stability" in Hosokawa's speech was changed to "security and stability" in Owada's remarks. Obviously, the Hata administration has gone a step further than the former administration. Diplomatic authorities seem to think that Owada's recent remarks only indicate an already established policy in line with the stance expressed by Prime Minister Hata and Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa. However, what is the meaning of Japan's joining the UNSC, which is comprised of five nuclear power nations, and how should Japan think of responsibilities and obligations to protect security in view of its pacifist Constitution? Regarding these basic questions, it cannot be said that we have had satisfactory discussions and explanations. At the aforementioned question-and-answer session, Tomiichi Mirayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], called for revision or abolishment of the current UNSC permanent membership system and said: "Being a major power in the United Nations, obtaining an important post in the old United Nations should not be Japan's UN diplomatic objective." Although the Hata administration is expecting the SDPJ to return to the coalition, there still is a large gap between them regarding the issue of permanent UNSC membership. Shinto Sakigake [New Harbinger] head Masayoshi Takemura even directly criticized the government by saying: "I doubt it is a good idea for the government to repeatedly express at diplomatic venues the positive stance of becoming a permanent member before forming a national consensus." Because political leaders and parties have been absorbed in the political warfare under the current fluid political condition, they failed to deepen discussions on such important issue. This must be called political negligence. However, this does not mean that politicians should let bureaucrats take over the issue without going through formalities and making efforts to form a national consensus. From the statement that Japan was asked to submit to the International Court of Justice to present its opinion on the legal status of the use of nuclear weapons, the government just deleted a sentence that said the use of nuclear weapons "is not necessarily a violation of international law." This must be taken as a lesson and the government must realize that a diplomatic stance will not be established without taking the people's will and sentiments into consideration. On one hand, Prime Minister Hata explained how significant it is for Japan, "a nonnuclear nation," to become a permanent member of the UNSC. On the other hand, he accepted the Foreign Ministry's view that "the use of nuclear weapons is not a violation of the law" -- a view shared by nuclear nations -- until criticism erupted from various sectors. This indicates how shaky his determination is to carry through Japan's stance in the UNSC. Therefore, we must immediately start in-depth discussion on what is the meaning of Japan's pursuing permanent UNSC membership by taking various viewpoints into consideration.
