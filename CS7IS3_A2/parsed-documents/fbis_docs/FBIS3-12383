Our people managed to wipe out the despotic imamate regime, to expel the odious colonialism from our pure land with the eruption of their glorious 26 September and 14 October Yemeni revolution, and to restore their cherished unity on 22 May 1990, and realize their democratic and ambitious achievement on 27 April 1993, which exemplifies the Yemeni people's generous offering. Our people who have scored these victories are capable of protecting and safeguarding them, irrespective of the crises and the fierce attacks by the enemies of their revolution and of their unity and democratic gains, and those who advocate a return to the abhorent partitioning era. Under these circumstances, the Sanaa GPC commands held a meeting last night to discuss the crisis that has been besetting our people over the past six months, and the deterioration in the quality of our people's daily lives and the recent breakdowns in the military area. While they voice deep concern over these breakdowns, the Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they abide by the national constants of the revolution, unity, and democracy, stress the importance of complete abidance by the contents of the document of pledge and accord and the need for the coalition parties, in particular, and the other parties and national forces in general to carry out serious and sincere work to implement its provisions with a one-man team spirit and a united political will, and to translate it into practise and immediately start to return the military situation to what it used to be before 19 August to avoid sedition, prevent the differences becoming further entrenched and the crisis from being exacerbated, as well as having the political leadership meet and reactivate the state's executive and legislative bodies to have them carry out their duties in accordance with the Constitution, and the respect for constitutional legitimacy which is a gain for our Yemeni masses. The Sanaa GPC commands also stress the importance of immediate action to enhance the efforts that state leaders and institutions are exerting in a cohesive manner to end the people's living tribulation which resulted from the crisis, and end the mad increase in prices. The Sanaa GPC commands in these blessed days appeal to the GPC command and to all the political parties to fear God when they deal with their people and homeland. We must all work united to avoid our people being dragged into the abyss which will benefit only the enemies of the homeland who seriously seek to harm its unity and democractic gains. From this premise, we have to renew our victories along our national march in keeping with the faith we have always placed in our people that they will remain loyal to the martyrs, to the principles of the immortal revolution, and to the blessed unity. In conclusion, the Sanaa GPC commands emphasize that they will diligently and seriously work out of conviction and will exert all efforts to implement the document of pledge and accord and to cooperate with all the honest national forces to overcome all obstacles and decislvely tackle all the impediments that may hamper the implementation of the document. We ask God to grant success to all in service of the homeland's welfare, stability, and prosperity.
