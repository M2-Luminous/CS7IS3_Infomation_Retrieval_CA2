It all started with the October events, after which ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, the organ of the mutinous Supreme Soviet, was left without an owner. While the collective was thinking about the sponsorship issue and gathering the necessary documents together, the government got busy and ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA got a new owner. He who pays the piper calls the tune. The first and quite obvious change (to prevent the old comrade Ruslan Imranovich from remaining in charge) was the appearance of a new editor -- Natalya Polezhayeva, whose tough management style was not welcomed by many staffers. The new ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA Editorial Office Charter, adopted in December at a general meeting of the collective, laid down that the newspaper would be a state enterprise but would subsequently be floated. But two months later the government gave the "go-ahead" to a version of the document absolutely unknown to ordinary staffers, under which the editorial office won the status of a corporate body. Under the Law on the Mass Media such a charter can only be adopted by a journalists' collective by a simple majority. But the journalists learned of the charter after it had already been ratified. In an interview with KOMMERSANT, Pavel Gurin, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA general director, blamed the government for this violation. But that explanation is dubious. Since I am somewhat familiar with the way in which documents are submitted to Viktor Stepanovich for signing, it seems to me that nobody in the government saw this charter. Moreover, the draft new structure ratified by government apparatus leader Kvasov was signed by Natalya Ivanovna and Pavel Fedorovich. Polezhayeva began to carry out the reorganization on the basis of the ratified charter. As a result, ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA should have three departments as of today -- a social policy department, a culture department, and a state and law department. This is why there have been so many dismissals. Moreover, legally independent agencies of the most diverse kind are starting to work under the editorial office -- PROTOCOL for official information, DERZHAVA for regional information, BIZNES V ROSSII for economic information, and another for security; there will be schooling for young journalists, and so forth. Most probably some of those dismissed will be taken on by the agencies and find the reorganization painless. But the fact that the leaders of these new formations were carefully selected by Polezhayeva shows that only staffers who are particularly loyal to the Polezhayeva "regime" will be taken on. Natalya Ivanovna herself refused to comment on the situation in her own publication. But things may be made clearer by the Savelovskiy courts, where an illegal dismissal suit has been filed against the ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA administration by Marina Cherednichenko, Polezhayeva's former deputy. On the basis of the results of the first hearing it is as yet hard to be certain who will win.
