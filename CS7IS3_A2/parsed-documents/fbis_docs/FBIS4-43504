The French Foreign Ministry describes this as a ridiculous allegation, recalling that previous unfounded rumors have circulated implicating foreign countries. In Kigali the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], the rebel movement of the minority Tutsi ethnic group, has just seized control of the Sainte Famille Church. It was held by the government forces and Hutu militias until now.
