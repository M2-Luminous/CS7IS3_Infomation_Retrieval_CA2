The Japanese currency's strength against the dollar is "excessive," mieno told a private forum. The monetary authorities will "take appropriate steps in a timely manner" to stabilize exchange rates, he added. He said the recent yen rise is feared to worsen corporate sentiment. The yen gathered upward momentum against the dollar following the breakdown earlier this month of Japan-U.S. trade talks designed to establish a framework to help reduce Japan's huge trade surplus. Mieno said the Japanese economy is still stagnant but he noted that corporate sentiment is showing some slight signs of recovery. He said the current short-term interest rates are low enough to support corporate restructuring efforts.
