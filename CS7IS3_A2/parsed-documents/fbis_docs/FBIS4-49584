Li Chuanqing, State Bureau of Technological Supervision director, announced recently: In the future, the production permit system will be applicable to fewer products -- only the products which are subject to government policy restrictions --, and the number of restricted products will be reduced to around 100 from more than 280 at present. With the brisk market in China in the early eighties, a large number of poorly equipped, poorly staffed, and poorly managed enterprises emerged in China. Their products were inferior, frequently causing bad accidents. In April 1984, the State Council promulgated the "Interim Regulations on Production Permits for Industrial Products" which is applicable to important industrial products. Over last 10 years, the enterprises operating with a production permit have generally raised their awareness of quality, improved basic work, and effectively ensured good quality of their products. According to incomplete statistics, enterprises in Shanghai's electronics industry alone had to invest a total of nearly 10 million yuan in buying production and testing instruments and improving the production environment before they were given a production permit. Better technology remarkably improves the quality of products. For instance, motor-driven threshers and fire extinguishers caused many deaths and injuries before the start of the production permit system, and much less accidents have been caused by them since the start of the system. According to State Bureau of Technological Supervision statistics , the up-to-standard ratio of products subject to the production permit control averaged approximately 50 percent before an enterprise obtained a production permit, and the ratio has increased by 30 percentage points after the enterprise obtained the permit. The production permit system has effectively improved the management of various trades. For instance, the issuance of production permits has enabled the cement industry to know more about its enterprises. While more than 6,000 cement enterprises have obtained production permits, some 1,000 small plants have been eliminated due to poor production conditions. So, the overall technological level of the cement industry has been raised. While practicing the production permit system, the State Bureau of Technological Supervision and other departments investigate and punish the controlled products produced without a permit, so as to protect the consumers' interests. For instance, disposable syringes are a product concerning human life. More than 2,000 households in a Jinxian County town in Jiangxi Province, were aroused to produce them, and most of them did not have the necessary technology, equipment, or test instruments. Their substandard products caused many bad medical accidents. Working together, the State Bureau of Technological Supervision, the State Pharmaceutical Administration, and departments concerned with Jiangxi Province have destroyed 600 sets of inferior products, closed down more than 300 factories which operated without a permit, and have begun to stop the trend of production without a permit.
