FBIS4-15192 "drsov067_a_94003" FBIS-SOV-94-067 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 RUSSIA INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Foreign Ministry Denies Plans Foreign Ministry Denies Plans LD0604203994 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1919 GMT 6 Apr 94 LD0604203994 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [Text] ITAR-TASS reported Wednesday that "President Boris Yeltsin endorsed the proposal made by the Defense Ministry and cleared with the Foreign Ministry on the setting up of Russian military bases in CIS member states and in Latvia for the purpose of maintaining the security of the Russian Federation and the countries in question and testing for new military hardware." The agency said its source was the president's order to which it had obtained access. Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigory Karasin told Interfax that to the best of his knowledge his ministry had had nothing to do with the preparation of that document. Still, he said, the ministry would not be able to respond properly before the document mentioned in the ITAR-TASS report was thoroughly studied. He placed special emphasis on the fact that "all military issues in the relations with Latvia were settled in the Russian-Latvian agreements that were initialed recently." Under the agreements on the withdrawal of Russian troops that were initialed in Moscow in mid-March the Russian strategically important radar station in Skrunda will effectively remain "a Russian military establishment under civilian control" for a term of five and a half years and cannot be regarded as a military base. Officials in the Defense Ministry's Press and Information Department told Interfax that Chief of General Staff Mikhail Kolesnikov had given no interview to ITAR-TASS and "could not talk about the setting up of a Russian military base in Latvia, as reported by that agency."
