I have set my course and I will not be diverted from it. My goal is that after two years here in the Hotel Matignon [prime minister's office], France should be doing better. The record of this first year shows many improvements." Edouard Balladur has published the record of his first year in government a few days ahead of schedule -- he was asked to form the government on 29 March 1993. It is a document of around 100 pages which, with the help of graphs, reviews in detail all the issues tackled during this first year of change and takes stock of the results obtained. It is a generally positive record and one which is very encouraging for the majority and the head of government. Its publication on the eve of the second round of the cantonal elections is no accident. Although the Matignon denies turning this election, which is expected to reinforce the majority, into a test of approval of the government's policies, this early presentation will certainly prompt some gnashing of teeth within the majority and criticisms from the opposition. But the Matignon is calm. According to the prime minister's entourage, he has never tried to turn the cantonal elections into a test of his popularity. "It is not he who has said that this election would make it possible to assess the popularity of Balladur's policy. But since it has been turned into a test, it must be admitted that it is not bad for him. He will not complain!" He is complaining still less because the situation in France after the initial 12 months of his term of office is improving. Although the economic indicators are still flashing dangerously, they show real progress and make it possible to predict a resumption of growth for the end of the year. The institutes are unanimous in forecasting growth of 2 percent in December compared with negative growth (minus 1 percent) in March 1993. "When we came to power," the prime minister points out, "we found a situation characterized by recession, unemployment, an increased deficit in the budget and social security fund, a lack of growth, and a moral crisis" which had plunged the country into deep pessimism. The government has set to work in a five-year timeframe, and deliberately ignored the presidential election. Indeed, Balladur notes, the main problems which the government encountered involved the stagnation of society and the upcoming presidential election rather than with cohabitation. Moreover, this cohabitation has always gone well and has in no way hampered the government's work. Balladur's main concern was therefore to extricate himself as much as possible from the stranglehold of the preparations for the presidential election, although the Matignon points out that history contains many prime ministers who crossed the Seine [from the Matignon to the Elysee presidential office]. His second concern was of a pedagogical kind: Not imposing reforms on the French people but explaining them in advance to ensure their acceptance. Was that the right method? "I wonder," he said, "whether I was wrong or right to place the emphasis on the difficulty of carrying out reforms." Because, by raising the question, you generate debate and raise problems which go beyond the issue at hand. The prime minister is nonetheless categorical: The government could not move more rapidly. The situation was worse than expected. "We found a fragile and worried society. We had to do things gradually, with as much consultation as possible," which led to "some criticisms" about lack of government action. Remembering the past 12 months, Edouard Balladur remarked without bitterness: "I have sometimes felt loneliness." But the preliminary results are in. They are encouraging with regard to the main parameters of government action -- unemployment, budget control, the restoration of the social security fund, foreign trade, and security. -- Unemployment: The increase in the number of people seeking work is slowing down. It was 20,000 in the last three months of 1993 compared with 80,000 registered in the last three months of the Beregovoy government. It is a slowing down which is full of promise and reflects the first effects of the government measures. The prime minister, who refuses to engage in a quarrel over statistics, refutes the criticisms which blame him for the increase in unemployment from March to September 1993. "The measures which we took as soon as we came to office could not have had an effect before September." It was from then that an improvement was recorded. "I do not see how we could be held responsible" for the continued rise in unemployment between April and September "when the measures taken could not have immediate effects." -- Control of the state budget: The situation was not hopeful when the transition [of government] took place. The "budget deficit" was estimated at 343 billion francs [Fr]. The five-year law adopted by the new government were expected to reduce the deficit to Fr317.6 billion. The austerity measures which were taken made it possible to improve that forecast. The settlement of the budget resulted in a deficit of Fr315.7 billion. The government, whose objective is to reduce this deficit to Fr200 billion in 1997 (2.5 percent of GDP), notes with satisfaction that this initial result exceeds expectations. -- Social security: The balance has been maintained even if it meant increasing the CSG [General Social Contribution] by 1 percent. Edouard Balladur makes no secret of the fact that the problem of social security funding remains worrying. By the end of the century, the whole system of the organization and funding will have to be reviewed in accordance with the world economic situation. He is categorical: "We will not accept a leveling down." -- Foreign trade: As soon as it came to office, the government was faced with the GATT negotiations. It faced American demands and European hesitations with great determination and imposed a fair compromise. -- Security: The functioning of justice has been improved, the fight against crime has been given new resources. Together with a more stringent limitation of immigration, this issue was one of the French people's priorities. "We were elected to ensure that the state regained full control. We have done a great deal, but a great deal remains to be done," Edouard Balladur reaffirmed. Without dwelling too much on his positive record, he lists the main stages of 1994 in terms of a continuation of reforms which will take up all of Parliament's work: new measures for employment; reform of family allowances; reorganization of social security; the police; justice; the overseas departments; fiscal reform; the military programming law; the law on decentralization and regional development. "We are tackling all the major issues which concern France between now and the end of the century." With the desire to develop and increase solidarity "to ensure that nobody is left out." One subject concerns the prime minister particularly. He does not understand the obstinacy of high school and university students in demonstrating against a so-called "youth minimum wage" which "I would never accept." The provisions of the CIP [job training contracts], although they were originally not well drafted, are "not directed against young people. Our only concern is to help young people find a first job, to find something other than the ANPE [National Employment Agency] when they leave the school system." It is not natural for us to beat records for youth unemployment in Europe. Why should a system that has proven its efficiency elsewhere not be feasible in France? The prime minister's entourage, more incisive than him on this point, referred to a degree of manipulation of young people, a kind of protest organization to generate a social explosion. "We have been predicting problems for a year. Social explosion has become a fashionable subject. By talking about it, you give people ideas." For Edouard Balladur these demonstrations "reveal the deep disquiet which affects young people," lost between a society ruled by old regulations and technical progress which calls all values into question. This disquiet also affects the whole of society. "We must take more account of the world's development. The (economic) emergence of the developing countries means that the countries of Western Europe face a risk of being pushed to the fringes." Reforms are therefore necessary to ensure that we adapt and enter the new millennium in good condition. "It will take us a good 10 years of adaptation." But, fortunately, if growth picks up again, society will look to the future more calmly.
