[Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Perez] Pardon me? [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Perez] We will do that as often as necessary, of course. [Correspondent] Will you (?begin working) prior to 1 September? [Perez] No, no, no. The president is president until 1 September. We must respect him as president of the Republic until 1 September, and after that as former president. [Correspondent] What mechanisms will be used for the transition? [Perez] Teams will be formed and they will work together from now until 1 September, thereby ensuring a trauma-free transition. [Correspondent] Is it true that your government will have another type of team apart from the Democratic Revolutionary Party? [Perez] I have said I will form a broad-based government, if that is what you are referring to. We are still working on that. [Correspondent] Doctor, what about the future of government employees? [Perez] At ease. I have no doubt whatsoever that the government employees know perfectly well that I intend to respect them and to hasten as much as possible the approval of the administrative career. [Correspondent] Dr. Balladares, what will relations with the United States be like? [Perez] We hope they will be elevated in character because our countries are united by common interests. I do not have the slightest doubt that this will be the case and that between the two countries we will do things to improve the Panamanian people's lives. [Correspondent] President Carter said today that President Clinton's prospective ambassador to Panama is Robert Pastor. What do you think of that? [Perez] I do not know. President Endara and his administration will have to decide that. I will respect their decision. [Correspondent] Endara said he was delaying the (?angry man) until after the elections. [Perez] The elections are over. [Correspondent] Can you tell us how these teams will work? Will they be part of a ministry or independent? [Perez] They will be appointed by President Endara and I and they will work together so that we will keep abreast of matters pending completion. [Correspondent] [Question indistinct] [Perez] No, no, no. Outside. [Word indistinct] the presidency. [Correspondent] There is a fear of a return of militarism. This was the first weapon used by your political opponents. [Perez] Looking at your pants, yes. [Correspondent] Doctor, what about relations with Cuba? [Perez] Relations with Cuba will be exactly like relations with any other country in the world. I hope they will be elevated in character and respectful; each country has its political system and I demand respect for both. In other words, they must not meddle in our affairs, nor we in theirs.
