FR941122-1-00008 FR941122-1-00001 The current rule at 7 CFR 277.19 requires FNS approval prior to acquisition of any ADP equipment for SAVE. The proposal to eliminate 7 CFR 277.19 modifies this requirement so that ADP equipment for SAVE would require prior approval by FNS only if the cost is above the cost thresholds in ยง277.18. Under current rules in ยง277.19, non-ADP equipment for SAVE having a net unit cost of $25,000 or more must receive prior FNS approval. However, with the elimination of ยง277.19, the net acquisition cost threshold in Section (B)(3) of Appendix A to 7 CFR Part 277 would apply. This provision provides that prior FNS approval would be required for the acquisition of equipment having a useful life of more than one year and a net acquisition cost of more than $5,000 per unit after allocation to FNS as projected for one year after purchase. State Agency Implementation To implement this provision as of April 1, 1994 with minimum disruption to the Program, State agencies may wish to begin taking appropriate steps early. State agencies may wish to obtain the additional State funding from their State legislatures to offset the reduction in the Federal rate of reimbursement, cut back total administrative expenses prior to Federal cost sharing as of April 1, 1994, reallocate resources to or realign functions to maintain current levels of effort and to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of overall operations. Delaying the Effective Date Section 13971 of the Leland Act allows the April 1, 1994 effective date for the change in the Federal reimbursement rates to be delayed by the Secretary of Agriculture in the case where a State's legislature meets biennially and is not scheduled to meet in calendar year 1994. A delay may be obtained for such a State only if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is no mechanism for appropriating additional State funds prior to the next legislative session. It is the Department's intent that State agencies submit their requests to delay the effective date early, and not wait for the completion of the rulemaking process. It is in the State agency's interest to apply early for a delay in the effective date so a decision on the State agency's request may be made promptly. To allow adequate time for the review of these requests prior to the effective date, FNS instructed its regional offices to notify State agencies that they would need to submit their requests to FNS by December 31, 1993. State agencies were informed of this deadline in letters which were issued by FNS regional offices during the last week of October 1993 and the first week of November. The Department will, however, consider requests submitted after the deadline.
