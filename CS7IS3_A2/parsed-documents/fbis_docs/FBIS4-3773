This emerged during Sino-British talks on Hong Kong's aviation agreements. Taiwan's post-1997 aviation links with Hong Kong have been at stake in the course of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) talks on renewing Hong Kong's aviation agreements with individual countries. Talks on air service agreements (ASAs) have made little progress at the JLG because of Britain's refusal to disclose details of agreements with foreign airlines which fly from Hong Kong to Taiwan. Before 1984, all 24 ASAs in Hong Kong were an extension of Britain's agreements with other countries. The main purpose of the JLG negotiations is to take Hong Kong's aviation routes out of the original UK agreements, officially known as a "separation programme." This programme does not cover air services of Hong Kong airlines running flights to Taiwan, which is a separate issue. Direct flights from Hong Kong to Taiwan are handled by Cathay Pacific and China Airlines under commercial arrangements. The Hong Kong Government promised the Taiwan Government that the continuation of these services would be discussed by the JLG before the end of this year. At the moment, most foreign airlines' ASAs with Hong Kong contain the right to run flights between Hong Kong and Taiwan. This is a point of contention with China. It is reliably understood that China has refused to approve seven ASAs unless the following conditions are met: -- The Government must disclose details of agreements which allow foreign airlines to fly between Hong Kong and Taiwan. -- China wants to know what privileges have been demanded and gained by Britain from the governments where the airlines originate in exchange for the right to fly between Hong Kong and Taiwan. -- Countries currently enjoying the right of transit to Taiwan will have to renegotiate directly with the Chinese Government to continue this practice after 1997. All Beijing's demands have been rejected by Britain on the grounds that the Joint Declaration guarantees that only Hong Kong's Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government, not China, has the right to conclude ASAs with third countries, excluding aviation routes through mainland China. The Hong Kong government has told China that Hong Kong will suffer economically if foreign airlines lose their right to fly between Taiwan and Hong Kong. These foreign airlines, the government fears, will then demand a unilateral increase in flights to Hong Kong to compensate for the loss of flights to Taiwan. The seven ASAs China is now delaying cover airlines in Germany, Italy, Singapore, Korea, Burma, Thailand, and Indonesia. It is understood that China overlooked the Taiwan factor until 1990 when Taiwan's China Airlines started using Amsterdam as its aviation base in Europe. Government representatives are now in Europe for more talks about separating Hong Kong's ASAs from those of Britain's. Out of 24 ASAs, those signed with Kuwait, Lebanon, Portugal, and Kenya have not been in operation for a long time. The government has decided to put them aside temporarily.
