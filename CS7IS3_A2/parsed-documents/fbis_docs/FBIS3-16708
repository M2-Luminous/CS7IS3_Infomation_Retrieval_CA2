[Correspondent Dmitriy Vinsker] Representatives of the foreign and defense ministries who spoke at the hearings insisted on the need for Russia to join in this program. In their opinion, Russia outside the Partnership for Peace program will be on the path of self-isolation, but if Russia joins it can develop the program in ways which are necessary for Moscow. Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the Duma's International Committee, spoke against joining. According to him the idea of the program is good but, in his words, the devil is hidden in the details, and these details, as Lukin stressed, incidentally just like the positive and negative sides of the program, are insufficiently thought through. It is worth noting that Vladimir Lukin's stance is shared, to a lesser or greater degree, by virtually all the deputies of the lower chamber. Dmitriy Vinsker, Ekho Moskvy, the State Duma.
