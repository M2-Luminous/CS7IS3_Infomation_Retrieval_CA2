Commenting today on the article published by the newspaper IZVESTIYA, which claims that the "results of the elections and the referendum were rigged", Filatov said that the conclusions of the team "play into the hands of the irreconcilable opposition" at the time when the social concord agreement is being signed. As to the team itself, which the newspaper claims to be "a team under the presidential administration", it is pertinent to note that it "has nothing to do with the administration", Filatov said. "There is a team headed by Sobyanin, which used to analyse the results of the elections, the voting in the supreme soviet, etc., from the very first Congress of People's Deputies," Filatov stated. "Later, those people went into science," he added. The head of the presidential administration said that he was "most doubtful" about the methods they are using in their calculations. Filatov said that a denial of the article was drawn up and would be handed over for publication to the newspaper IZVESTIYA.
