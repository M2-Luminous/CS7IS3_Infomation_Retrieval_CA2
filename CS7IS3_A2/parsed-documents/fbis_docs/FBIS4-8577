Mazowiecki was addressing a congress of Warsaw's branch of the party. The leader of the UD expressed the opinion that the present government is "the government of stagnation and not of reforms". He explained that the UD had supported the presidential veto concerning the law on new wage-control measures because the veto had been concordant with the party's previous stand on the issue. Mazowiecki simultaneously stressed that the party's being in opposition cannot mean that it contributes to the destabilization of state structures by backing the possible presidential rejection of the budget. On Saturday, members of the UD warsaw branch elected 31 additional delegates to the unification congress of the party with the Liberal Democratic Congress (KLD) to be held on April 23 and 24. Similar by-elections in all regions were necessary to maintain at the unification congress the agreed statistical proportion of 2.7 UD delegates to 1 KLD delegate. The establishment of the new party will not mean that "the (Democratic) Union is beginning from scratch", Mazowiecki said. It is a process of continuation, a transition to a new stage of our party's development, he added. According to Mazowiecki, one of the most important problems facing the new party is an answer to the question how one should reconcile economic reforms with the necessity to meet public expectations. Draft statutes of the new party envisage that the first term of the new grouping's authorities will last for a year, the second one - two years. A 100-strong national council of the party is to be composed of 73 present ud members and 27 liberals. The party's presidium is to be made up of 8 UD members and 3 liberals. The new party is to have only one deputy chairman. Under the statutes, all members of the new party holding ministerial posts must join the national council. National secretaries of the party would be elected by the national council to implement "the current policy of the party" in various spheres of the economy and public life.
