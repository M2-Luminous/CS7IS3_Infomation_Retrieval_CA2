FBIS4-14022 "drnes080_c_94007" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 ARAB AFRICA Egypt Rifts Within `Extremist' Groups in Jail Noted Rifts Within `Extremist' Groups in Jail Noted NC2204124994 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR in Arabic 15 Apr 94 p 23 NC2204124994 Cairo AL-MUSAWWAR Arabic BFN [Report by Hamdi Rizq] [Text] AL-MUSAWWAR has learned that the Prisons Department last week moved 50 extremists led by Hasan al-Hillawi, who declared their breakaway from the al-Jihad Organization, from the al-Istiqbal Prison to the Mazra'at Turrah Jail after repeated clashes with the old al-Jihad members led by 'Abbud al-Zumur and Ayman al-Zawahiri inside the al-Istiqbal Prison and because the security agencies fear killings inside the prison in light of threats between the two groups. This measure was taken after the extremists in Ward A and Ward B in al-Istiqbal rejected the entry into their wards of members belonging to Hasan al-Hillawi. A joint statement released inside the prison by the leaderships of the al-Jihad Organization and the Islamic Group accused al-Hillawi of supporting the security agencies, deviating from the consensus, and of being traitors and spies. They sanctioned their murder. They took this measure to prevent other members from joining al-Hillawi, who declared his rejection of acts of violence prevailing among the extremist groups. Al-Hillawi used the hospital in the al-Istiqbal Prison as a shelter for himself and his 50-member group and sought a dialogue with the leaders of the Islamic Group, particularly Najih Ibrahim. The latter, however, rejected al-Hillawi and accused him of being a traitor and spy. Heated arguments took place between al-Hillawi and members of the al-Jihad Organization and they were about to engage in fistfights and hand-to-hand fighting. But policemen intervened, disengaged the two groups, and decided to move the al-Hillawi followers to the Mazra'at Turrah Prison. The recent crisis, the second disturbance in the al-Jihad Organization after the Muhammad al-Makkawi dissension from al-Zawahiri, who is living abroad, began when a fax reached Arab and foreign newspapers signed by Hasan al-Hillawi. Al-Hillawi is a prominent figure in the al-Jihad Organization and participated in military sedition in 1977. The fax urged the extremist groups to exercise self-restraint, stop acts of violence, lay down their arms, and hold a dialogue with the government to ease restrictions on detainees. He expressed readiness to hold this dialogue and declared that it is inadmissible to oppose the ruler and form groups opposed to the regime. Although the fax caused confusion among al-Jihad Organization ranks abroad and raised questions about al-Hillawi's role in the al-Istiqbal Prison, a lawyer on the detainees' defense panel asked to meet al-Hillawi on instructions from abroad to discuss his call and make sure that he appeared, particularly as he is considered to be an important intellectual leader in the al-Jihad Organization. The lawyer met al-Hillawi and asked him what he wanted. Al-Hillawi answered: I urge the groups to give up acts of violence and I will undertake a dialogue with the government. At the meeting, which was also attended by Ahmad Rashid Muhammad Rashid, one of the most important figures in the Vanguards of Conquest, the lawyer accused al-Hillawi of trying to get out of jail by any means, that he was weakening, and that he no longer put up any resistance. The lawyer advised the group members abroad on the details of the meeting. Despite the threats that the al-Jihad members inside the prison made to al-Hillawi to return to the fold, he rejected them and gained the support of 50 extremists. He thus established an independent organization and began making calls denouncing violence and calling for dialogue. The groups inside the prison considered these calls to be a deviation from the course by a leading intellectual figure who played a major role in the military sedition and the reorganization of the al-Jihad Organization (Case No. 401 of 1977). They feared that his influence might spread to the rest of the groups and create problems with other members. Bloody clashes would have occurred had the prison administration not intervened, saving al-Hillawi and his group from certain death by moving them to the Mazra'at Turrah Prison. Disputes continue, involving the leaderships of the extremists abroad and Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Jihad leader abroad, and Muhammad al-Makkawi, who is accused in State Security Case No. 401, known as the reorganization of the al-Jihad Organization. Attempts by members of the group in Egypt, particularly lawyers, failed to resolve the dispute despite reports that al-Zawahiri traveled to Europe and that al-Makkawi left Pakistan and joined tribes on the border fearing manhunts by the Pakistani authorities of Arabs there.
