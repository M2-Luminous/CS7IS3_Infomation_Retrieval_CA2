FR940719-1-00007 FR940719-1-00002 Section 923.52 of the order authorizes the establishment of grade, size, quality, maturity, pack and container regulations for any variety or varieties of cherries grown in the production area. Section 923.53 further authorizes the modification, suspension, or termination of regulations issued under ยง923.52. Section 923.55 provides that whenever cherries are regulated pursuant to ยง923.52 or ยง923.53, such cherries must be inspected by the Federal-State Inspection Service, and certified as meeting the applicable requirements of such regulations. Currently, the regulations require that dark sweet cherries such as Bing cherries, the predominant variety grown in the production area, meet certain grade, size, pack and container requirements. Such cherries are also required to be inspected. Light sweet cherries, including the Rainier variety, are currently exempt from these requirements. The Rainier variety was developed at Washington State University's Irrigated Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Prosser, Washington, and was first released to the Northwest cherry industry in 1960. Rainiers were initially used primarily as canning cherries. However, since the 1980s, production of the Rainier variety for the fresh market has increased substantially. Less than 600 tons were marketed fresh in 1987, but that increased to 1,543 tons in 1989 and 1,937 tons in 1992. A record crop of 2,427 tons was marketed in 1993, about 5 percent of Washington's total sweet cherry crop. As the Rainier variety gained in importance as a fresh market cherry, the Washington cherry industry began to consider the need to establish minimum standards of size and quality for the variety. At its December 15, 1993, meeting, the committee made its first recommendation to regulate Rainier cherries. Specifically, the committee recommended that a minimum size requirement be established at 101/2 row size (1 inch in diameter) for fresh market shipments of Rainier variety cherries. No minimum maturity requirement was recommended at that time, although concerns were expressed about ensuring that only ripe cherries be marketed. Subsequent to the December meeting, the Department received correspondence from 19 cherry producers, packers, and marketers concerning the committee's recommended regulation. The majority (13 of 19) were in favor of the recommendation, and 6 were in opposition to regulating the Rainier variety. Comments supporting the proposed minimum size requirement stated that such a regulation would be in the best interests of producers. Growing Rainier cherries is more labor intensive and costly than producing other varieties. Producers need to offer a quality product in order to recoup these higher production costs. The sale of small, immature cherries results in buyer dissatisfaction, which reduces repeat purchases and damages the market for all cherries. Good cultural practices (e.g., proper pruning) will result in acceptable sizes. Fruit quality and maturity are enhanced by fruit size. Those opposed to the recommendation stated that it would reduce the volume of Rainier cherries permitted to be marketed fresh, thus reducing returns on the crop. Further, they stated that taste and appearance are more important to cherry buyers than size. Those in opposition also claimed that a minimum size requirement would be detrimental to producers who farm at higher elevations, where fruit tends to be smaller, but may be sweeter. Given the lack of industry consensus on this issue, the Department asked the committee to reconsider the need to regulate Rainier variety cherries, particularly in light of the concerns raised in the above-mentioned letters. The committee met again on March 15, 1994, and rescinded its earlier recommendation. The committee recommended a lower size requirement_at least 11 row size (61/64 inch in diameter)_coupled with a minimum maturity requirement of 17 percent soluble solids. The vote on this recommendation was 13 to 1, with the dissenting voter in favor of a smaller minimum size of 111/2 row (57/64 inch in diameter). The Rainier cherry is distinct from other cherry varieties marketed by the Washington cherry industry. It is a yellow-colored cherry, with some rosy blush. It is considered a specialty item, compared with the darker colored varieties. The committee reports the costs of producing and handling Rainier cherries are higher than those associated with other cherry varieties. Rainier cherry trees need to be pruned more heavily than other cherry trees to ensure acceptable sized fruit. Rainier cherry trees are picked several times during a season, reflecting the fact that not all the fruit matures at the same time and that the cherries will not ripen after harvest. Rainier are also fragile and susceptible to damage during handling. Thus, most Rainier cherries are sorted and packed by hand. Rainier cherries are typically marketed from mid-June through July. AMS Market News data show that prices are highest for the earliest offerings of these cherries, and that such prices decline as the season progresses. In 1992, for example, the opening f.o.b. price on June 18 was $35.00 per carton. This declined to $25.00 to $28.00 per carton a week later, and f.o.b. prices were $22.00 to $28.00 per carton at season's end. This price trend serves as an incentive for producers to harvest early, which has resulted in immature, sour Rainier cherries being marketed.
