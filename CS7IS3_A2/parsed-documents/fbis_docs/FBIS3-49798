Speaking about attempts to concoct reasons for issuing threats to the Serbs, Karadzic added that, as regards Tuzla, it was obvious that those who were advocating the opening of the airport were trying to prolong the war, as this was yet another way to help the Muslims obtain weapons. There is no reason why all airports in Bosnia-Herzegovina should not be opened, but not before a peace agreement has been signed, because the airports would be abused for military purposes, Karadzic said. Karadzic held a news conference after the republic of Srpska assembly wound up its session today at which it adopted a platform for tomorrow's round of negotiations in Geneva. Details of the platform have not been disclosed. Karadzic stressed that the Serbs had worked out options that would be used to achieve their objectives, saying that he did not expect any essential changes in the Muslim side's further rejection of the peace plan. Karadzic recalled that the Muslims were not forced to change anything; they were not under pressure from the international community. Because all the threats were directed towards the Serbs, the Muslims were encouraged to continue the war. Karadzic said that the international community was prolonging the war in Bosnia by maintaining sanctions and issuing threats to the Serbs. It is absolutely certain that the Muslims would accept peace if the international community were to exert the same pressure on all three sides and stop threatening the Serbs and if it lifted sanctions against the Serbs, in which case the Muslims would clearly realize peace is more beneficial to them than war, Karadzic said. Karadzic said that although Serbians were already used to threats, they nevertheless took all threats very seriously: "These are not some minor forces but the world's largest military organization." He noted that "almost everything the international community has done so far in the area of the former Yugoslavia was irrational and irresponsible." He also stressed that he believed that reason would prevail. He added that it was the ultimate paradox that small nations like the Serbs could be such a threat to Western national interests that such a huge force might be deployed. The Serbian delegation will neither act nor take decisions under pressure, Karadzic emphasized. Replying to a question about his mood on his way to Geneva, Karadzic said he was pessimistic as regards the international community's intensions to support peace. The president of the people's assembly of the republic of Srpska, Momcilo Krajisnik, said that in the course of the debate on the platform, the deputies had demanded that the coming period and the events that might follow be taken seriously, since the Muslims were making serious preparations for war. He said certain territorial concessions had been criticized and that the deputies maintained these concessions were seriously damaging to the republic of Srpska. Expressing regret at not being able to talk about the platform because he was duty-bound not to by the assembly's decision, Krajisnik added that this document includes an invitation to talks and provides every possibility of satisfying the interests of all three sides.
