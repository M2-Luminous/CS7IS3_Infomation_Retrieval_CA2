"The potential for danger is rising," admitted State Minister Bernd Schmidbauer (Christian Democratic Union), who is responsible for the intelligence services, but he added that, despite intensive observation of the market, there have been no signs of a threat by nuclear terrorists. "So far, there is no indication at all. Weapons-grade material has not turned up in our country at all.... Terrorists do not have access to weapons-grade material, because it is not available on the market," he said in an interview with RTL. "It can still be ruled out that nuclear warheads are available in an uncontrolled manner," the news magazine quotes a report by the Federal Intelligence Office (BND). Referring to the same source, however, DER SPIEGEL warns that nuclear bombs and biological weapons from East Europe could soon be in the hands "of Western gangs." The 18-page BND report speaks of a "trend toward escalating the situation." Smuggling centers include Vilnius and Kamas in Lithuania. According to the magazine, the FRG has become the hub for nuclear smuggling. Schmidbauer explained this by referring to the FRG's geographical location. The minister reported that 300 to 350 cases of illegal nuclear trade or smuggling have been registered over the past two years. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna also does not assume that blackmailers will soon have access to nuclear weapons. "So far, we have not noticed anything like that in our worldwide monitoring," a spokesman said in an interview with the private radio station RADIO 7 in Ulm. The IAEA has helped the CIS states to establish inspection bodies so as to prevent trade of weapons-grade material.
