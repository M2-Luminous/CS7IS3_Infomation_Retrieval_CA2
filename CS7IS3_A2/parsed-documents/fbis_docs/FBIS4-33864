OAS member countries that signed human rights declarations cannot allow a gang of military men to brazenly continue to violate these principles in the name of an orthodox sovereignty concept of the past century." Marco Tullio Celli, the UN Human Rights Committee observer specially appointed to follow the tragedy of thousands of people persecuted by the coupist Haitian regime, thus preaches intervention in Haiti. During an interview with JORNAL DO BRASIL, Celli said he is sure the OAS meeting in Belem do Para will offer the appropriate framework to allow OAS members to face this problem once and for all and apply the Chilean Resolution. This resolution favors democracy. It was approved three months before the coup that overthrew Jean-Bertrand Aristide and establishes procedures for collective decisions whenever the institutional order is interrupted in any country on the American continent. Celli said OAS country members cannot forget that the coup in Haiti represents disrespect for a decision made a few months earlier by Latin American countries, and represents the beginning of a process that could jeopardize democracy in the region. During their latest visit to Haiti, Human Rights Committee representatives verified 133 cases of illegal executions last February and March alone. During a two-month period, 55 people were kidnapped (11 were killed and 24 are missing). International observers also verified the existence of mutilated bodies in Port-au-Prince as well as the rape of women and children by members of the civilian militias who were armed by the military men. Celli said: "What is the cost of the policy so far conducted by the OAS and the UN in Haiti? At least 4,000 murders!" He demands from the international community more than political and economic sanctions against the Haitian regime. Celli believes the plan to shelter Haitian refugees is also doomed to fail. "If everyone there is persecuted and the government maintains a regime of terror, what are we doing receiving 1,000 or 2,000 refugees? The repression will continue. The solution to the Haitian problem is to rebuild a government that can offer the people security." He believes there are conditions for intervention in the island. "The military threat to call the people to stage a national rebellion against an eventual occupation is not true. The Haitian Army is very small -- it has 7,000 men, of which 5,000 are in Port-au-Prince. If the capital is occupied, the whole country is occupied. The idea is to maintain in Haiti some advisers to modernize the Haitian Armed Forces and to help lead the country through a democratic process." Finally, Marco Tullio Celli has a message for those who still believe in a policy of half measures. "Above everything, everybody must understand that Haitian sovereignty is not at stake. Those who resort to this argument merely favor a group of military men who mercilessly massacre people. Intervening in Haiti does not represent an invasion. It is liberation," Celli said.
