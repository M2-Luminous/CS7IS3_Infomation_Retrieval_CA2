FR940204-1-00055 FR940204-1-00009 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [MO 15&hyph;1&hyph;5862; FRL&hyph;4833&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; State of Missouri AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The purpose of this revision to the Missouri State Implementation Plan (SIP) is to incorporate the lead nonattainment areas into the existing new source review (NSR) program. This revision changes the applicability requirements by changing the definition of nonattainment area in the state regulations to include lead nonattainment areas, and to delete the Kansas City area as a nonattainment area in light of its attainment of the ozone standards. This action proposes a limited approval because Missouri has not yet submitted to EPA augmented new source permit rules which meet the amended requirements of part D of title I of the Clean Air Act. DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 7, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments may be mailed to Robert J. Lambrechts, Environmental Protection Agency, Air Branch, 726 Minnesota Avenue, Kansas City, Kansas 66101. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Robert J. Lambrechts at (913) 551&hyph;7846. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The objective of this proposed rulemaking is to approve the three Missouri lead nonattainment areas into the existing NSR program in Missouri. This SIP revision contains the amendments to the SIP defining three areas in Missouri as nonattainment for lead. In 1978, when EPA promulgated the lead National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), it was not authorized to designate areas nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (CAAA) 1 , EPA was authorized to require states to designate areas as nonattainment, attainment, or unclassifiable for lead. On November 6, 1991, at 56 FR 56694, EPA designated the following areas as nonattainment for lead: the city of Herculaneum in Jefferson County; and the Dent, Liberty, and Arcadia townships in Iron County. The designations were effective January 6, 1992. 1 The 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act made significant changes to the Act. See Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399. References herein to ``the Act'' or ``CAA'' are to the Clean Air Act as amended, 42 U.S.C. 7401, et seq. 1. Lead NSR The CAAA made numerous changes to the NSR requirements in the Clean Air Act (CAA). Once an area has been designated nonattainment for lead, a state is required to adopt a permit program for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area. For areas designated nonattainment for the primary lead NAAQS subsequent to enactment of the 1990 Amendments, section 191(a) requires that within 18 months of designation, states submit SIPs which, among other nonattainment planning requirements, have a nonattainment program consistent with the provisions of part D of the Act, including sections 172 and 173 of the Act as amended. Section 172(c)(5) requires that states submit provisions requiring permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area in accordance with the provisions of section 173. 2. Limited Approval/Disapproval Status EPA is proposing to grant this SIP submittal limited approval because it does not meet all of the applicable requirements of the Act 2 . However, this proposed limited approval strengthens the existing SIP as representing an improvement over what is currently in the SIP, and as meeting some of the applicable requirements of the Act. In particular, the amendment means that Missouri's NSR requirements, which meet all of the provisions of the preamended Act, apply to new and modified sources of lead in the nonattainment areas. 2 EPA may grant such a limited approval under section 110(k)(3) of the Act, in light of the general authority delegated to EPA under section 301(a) of the Act to take actions necessary to carryout the purposes of the Act. However, the Missouri rule does not meet all the specific requirements of part D. These include, among others, requirements for alternate site analyses as part of NSR for all sources in nonattainment areas. Therefore, EPA is proposing only a ``limited'' approval of this SIP. If the state fails to submit the additional revisions, EPA will be required to issue a limited disapproval at a later date. 3. Impact of this Rule Revision on Kansas City Attainment Status Missouri's rule change also eliminates the Kansas City metropolitan area from the definition of nonattainment area, reflecting the redesignation of Kansas City to attainment for ozone on June 23, 1992 (57 FR 27939). Once an area is redesignated to attainment, nonattainment NSR requirements are no longer required. The attainment area is then subject to prevention of significant deterioration requirements instead of the NSR program. Missouri has amended its rules consistent with these requirements. EPA Action EPA is soliciting public comments on all aspects of this notice and on issues relevant to EPA's proposed action. Comments will be considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting timely written comments to the address above. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5. U.S.C. 600 et seq. , EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604). Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under sections 110 and 301, and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the state is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, EPA certifies that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( Union Electric Co. v. U.S. E.P.A. , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions from the requirement of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12886 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.
