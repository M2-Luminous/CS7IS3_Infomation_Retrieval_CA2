However, the displaced Kashmiris have played a very important role in this success. They not only exposed the insincerity of Pakistan's worry about human rights, but also informed the international community of its wicked plans to spread terrorism. Will the government continue to be uninvolved in the pain of the hundreds of thousands of Kashmiris who are living like refugees in their own country? Ajay Chrungoo, president of the Kashmiri Pandits organization, Panun Kashmir, appealed to the Human Rights Commission asking that before cultural disintegration and ethnic genocide happens, the international community should interfere and stop it. According to him more than 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits had to flee the valley to avoid terrorism. Pakistan has always tried to strengthen the fundamentalists in the valley to take over Kashmir. Now, the Kashmiri Pandits are living like refugees in a democratic and secular nation like India. The terrorist activities in Kashmir have transformed into efforts to get rid of the minority Hindus in the valley. This is the climax of the ethnic genocide of this peace-loving group. The purpose of the terrorists behind this violence is to annihilate all the non-Muslim groups in Kashmir and form a society based on the supremacy and control of one religion. The violent activities of the terrorists in Kashmir cannot be declared appropriate because of their political or so-called idealist values. The terrorism in Kashmir is not a war for independence in any sense. An independence effort that destroys other people's independence just is not appropriate. The Indo-European Kashmir Forum also called a press conference to get international support for the Kashmiri Hindus. The president of this forum is Dr. Shakti Bhan Khanna, and includes Dr. K.N. Pandita, president of Panun Kashmir's women branch, and the leaders of the Daughters of Vitasta and Friends of Kashmir. These Kashmiri leaders said that the Kashmiri Pandits have been pushed into the margins because of Islamic fundamentalism and violence spread by the terrorists for the last five years. About 300,000 Kashmiri Pandits were forced to flee the valley because of murders, rapes, verbal abuse, humiliation of women, and physical tortures. About 100,000 Pandits have been mercilessly murdered. They expressed regret that the international community, especially the human rights organizations and communication media, have not paid any attention to the prolonged tragedy of Kashmiri Pandits. The representatives of human rights organizations have not visited even once after 1990 to observe the Kashmiri Pandits who have directly suffered from Pakistani conspiracies. It is ironical that none of the organizations in the world that claim to protect human rights have taken this human tragedy seriously. According to Kashmiri leaders, they also met with the Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. However, Amnesty flatly said that it only deals with terrorism in which governments are involved. When Amnesty was told that the terrorism in Kashmir is spread by Pakistan, it did not pay any attention to it. It is a result of Kashmir Pandits' activities that there is a possibility of Kashmir Pandits' problems being discussed in a sub-committee meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva this summer. Abraham Fall, assistant general secretary of the UN Human Rights Commission, told the leaders of Kashmiri refugees that the problem of Kashmiri Pandits is really serious and it is imperative that an acceptable solution of this problem is found. Some Kashmiri separatists had insisted to Abraham Fall to send a fact-finding commission to Kashmir. However, he had rejected this request saying that he did not want to form any presumptions on this issue. The Kashmir Pandits are greatly perturbed by the Indian government's lack of interest. During the last week of December last year, they had organized the first Kashmiri Pandits Conference in Delhi. In this conference they declared Pakistan a terrorist nation and appealed to human rights organization, religious groups, and all the countries in the world to declare Pakistan a terrorist nation for encouraging terrorism in India. The "Delhi Declaration" was issued at the end of this conference. This declaration said that Kashmiri Pandits will increase their efforts to get Panun Kashmir back. It also had a map of Panun Kashmir which shows the region from Baramula in the northeast of the Vitasta River to Berinag as part of Panun Kashmir. The Delhi Declaration asked that Panun Kashmir be under the central government and that the Indian Constitution be fully implemented there. The demand for a separate homeland by the Kashmiri Pandits may appear to be impractical but they have used this demand for outlining their needs for resettlement. The Kashmiri refugees are suffering from a double tragedy. The Pakistan-supported terrorism has forced them to leave their homes on the one side, and the government's neglect on the other side has made things even worse. The demand for a homeland will not solve the problem, however, we have to understand that the Kashmiri Pandits cannot be totally ousted from Kashmir. Kashmir belong to them as much as it does to those of other religions living there. It is the government's responsibility to create the opportunities for this peace-loving group displaced by the terrorists to return to the valley. However, the government does not seem to be serious at all about it. The Bharatiya Janata Party has demanded several times in the Parliament and in the streets for plans to resettle and return the Kashmiris to their home. However, the government did not pay any heed to it. Should not our government pay attention to the Kashmiri refugees after returning from Geneva?*
