FR940930-1-00006 FR940930-1-00003 In addition to the proposal to increase the minimum baggage liability limit to $1,850, the Department requests comment on two alternate proposals: (1) to raise the minimum limit to $1,850 with a mechanism that automatically provides for periodic future increases, or (2) to raise the minimum liability limit to $2,000. The first alternate proposal is an automatic adjustment of the minimum liability limit every other year, calculated in proportion to any change in the CPIU. When the minimum liability limit was last amended in 1984, the CAB considered and rejected a rule that would automatically adjust the liability limit based on some specified economic measure. The CAB believed that such an approach might be unduly confusing for consumers and that it would be administratively burdensome on carriers to constantly revise tickets and internal guidance. The Department requests comment on whether, with the increasing sophistication of and reliance on computers, periodic adjustment of the minimum liability limit would pose less of a burden on the industry today. A more frequent adjustment would make the limit more responsive to changes in the economy. Comment is also requested on whether there would be a need to provide for additional public comment before each adjustment rather than simply announcing each new rate by publication in the Federal Register , and whether there is some other method that would be preferable to changes in the CPIU for calculating appropriate future changes in the minimum liability limit. As indicated above, the CPIU was the basis used by the CAB to calculate the 1984 increase to $1,250. Prior to 1984, the CPIU was considered, along with actual baggage claim data, to set the minimum liability limit. That data has not been collected since the deregulation of the airline industry. The Department also requests comment on its second alternate proposal, to increase the minimum baggage liability limit to $2,000. Under the current system, which includes notice requirements, passengers are expected to be aware of the minimum limit and not pack any items of greater value in their luggage unless they desire to purchase excess valuation or are personally willing to incur the risk. This is not to say that carriers would automatically pay $2,000 to passengers claiming lost, damaged, or delayed baggage. We wish to make clear that, as is the case today, our proposal would set the amount below which carriers could not limit their potential liability for provable damages. Thus, carriers could still decline to pay unjustified claims or pay only for damages actually shown. A $2,000 limitation would have the advantages of covering most items passengers are likely to pack in baggage, and being easy for passengers to remember because it is a round number. A collateral benefit of a $2,000 minimum limit would be that, in the event of future inflation, the limit would not become obsolete soon after issuance. It would also allow longer-term planning than an $1,850 limit, which might reduce administrative costs to the airlines for training, ticket stock, and computer programming. The Department recognizes that carriers will require some period of time to use up existing ticket stock, print new tickets, and implement other necessary changes under any of the alternatives. The Department seeks comment on whether 60 days from issuance of a final rule is a sufficient time for implementation. In the case that excess ticket stock poses a particular problem for the airlines, the Department requests comment on whether the use of a sticker or an addendum stuffed in the ticket envelope would provide adequate notice of the new limit. The Department also seeks comment on whether a bifurcated implementation would be feasible (e.g., new minimum dollar limit effective in 30 days; implementation of revised notice requirement effective in 60 days, or upon exhaustion of existing ticket stock). In the case that the automatically adjusting limit is selected, the Department requests comment on whether a 30-day implementation period would be sufficient for future adjustments under that proposal. In any event, in view of the publication of the instant proposal, the Department encourages carriers to exercise prudence in placing large orders for ticket stock or ticket jackets. The notice requirement has been clarified to better explain that written notice of the liability limit must be provided whenever air transportation is sold, whether or not the airline actually issues a ticket to the passenger. This is in response to the recent switch to a ticketless system by a few carriers. Written notice must still be provided to the passenger in conjunction with the sale of the travel, even though there is no traditional ``ticket'' that the notice can be printed on. Regulatory Analyses and Notices The Department has determined that this action is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 or under the Department's Regulatory Policies and Procedures. A regulatory evaluation that examines the projected costs and impacts of the proposal has been placed in the docket. The Department certifies that this rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Few airlines are classified as small entities. However, since the rule could apply to small carriers to the extent that they interline with large carriers, the Department seeks comment on whether there are unidentified small entity impacts that should be considered. If comments provide information that there are significant small entity impacts, the Department will prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis at the final rule stage. The Department does not believe that there would be sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.
