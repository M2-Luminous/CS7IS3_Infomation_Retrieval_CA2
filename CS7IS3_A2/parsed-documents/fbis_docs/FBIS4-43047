In an interview with HANDELSBLATT and the WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE, Kinkel stated that he and his Russian counterpart Grachev held intensive discussions of the speech Russian Defense Minister Grachev made to NATO. The first issue -- Russia's important position resulting from a special protocol in connection with NATO's offer of a Partnership for Peace -- will be discussed in Istanbul. The head of the Foreign Ministry clearly rejected all Russian ambitions to link a European security system with the CSCE and the NATO Cooperation Council, and to accord NATO and its partnership concept less significance. Kinkel stressed: "Our answer is no. There will be no relations of superiority or inferiority between the CSCE, the NATO Cooperation Council, Partnership for Peace, and NATO." Moreover, Russia will not be granted any formal rights of veto. "The Western European Union [WEU] will decide independently whom it wants to accept. The European Union will base its decision on the accession of new countries on an economic and political analysis, and NATO will naturally also make its decisions without granting Russia a right of veto." It is useful and expedient not to open up new gulfs but to incorporate Russia in Europe's new security and economic architecture. Thus, one can fully comply with Moscow's third wish, which is to intensify the process of consultation. Russia's stabilization is not only taking place on a monetary basis in the form of multilateral and bilateral loans but also in many other ways through consultation. In this respect, Kinkel mentioned the banking law, which is being established with Western support, the creation of general legal structures, regional consulting activities, and schemes for medium-sized enterprises. At the same time he admitted that more funds are bound to be wasted in Russia because of its "enormous size" than in smaller countries, such as the Baltic states. "However, could anyone expect the transition from the command to the market economy to be smooth in a huge country like Russia," Kinkel asked. Kinkel showed understanding for the mistrust with which Moscow views the establishment of closer relations between the Central and East European states and Western institutions. Whereas the Visegrad states (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia) have already "entered the vestibule of the European Union [EU], the WEU, and of NATO" because of association agreements -- the so-called European agreements -- Russia is not likely to be granted access. For this reason, NATO has offered Moscow a cooperation agreement. Kinkel expressed the hope that it will be signed at the European summit in Corfu. The foreign minister described the necessary security architecture, in which states like Ukraine must also be included, as a "policy designed to establish a general network." NATO, which "was and still is a classical defense alliance," has received important new tasks in a changed world -- "to keep and make peace." These new tasks should be the core of the European security architecture. Kinkel stressed: "NATO must help meet the need of the Central and East European reform states for security." NATO continues to be the main element in the transatlantic relationship. According to Kinkel, there is a time- and a content-related aspect to the timetable for the eastward expansion of the EU. As far as the time-related aspect is concerned, he declined to mention an exact date. However, the process will probably last longer than the countries affected and the Germans hope, Kinkel pointed out. As far as the content is concerned, the Federal Government plans to involve the Visegrad states and the Baltic republics to a much greater extent politically at this point with a view to their full membership at a later date. Also, it is important for these countries to do their homework. "They must create legal structures and become economically more attractive through self-help." Bonn wants to provide assistance in this respect. Kinkel is currently not enthusiastic about an enlargement according to the model of "concentric circles," suggested by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. In fact, he considers developments in this direction possible at a later point, but he would prefer an "organic growth" of Europe in the old structures. Kinkel admitted, however, that the enlargement of the EU by the East European states will pose considerable problems. Yet one cannot tell the countries to which closer cooperation has been offered for several years that there is no longer a free room in the European home. "We must coordinate this accession in an organic way with our partners. Germany will not take unilateral action." Kinkel believes that, when carrying out institutional reforms, "the streamlining of procedures in the councils," the representation in the troika --consisting of the country that holds the presidency, its predecessor, and its successor -- and the order of presidencies must be reconsidered. it will be very difficult to settle these issues because the smaller countries will rightly react in a sensitive manner. Their interests must be taken into consideration. Germany in particular has always done so. The foreign minister also criticized the varying intensity of integration in the European Union. In the common foreign and security policy, the Union has not yet reached the same broad development standard as in the economy. Kinkel cited the policy vis-a-vis the former Yugoslavia as an example. The EU is also "lagging behind" in the elimination of national border controls -- that is in the implementation of the Schengen Agreement. Thus, for Bonn the third major task is the development of legal and domestic policies as the third pillar of the European Union. "During the German presidency, we want to focus primarily on the fight against drug-related crime, money laundering, and the control of extremist and terrorist groups from non-EU states." Another major task will be the fight against illegal immigration and crime involving the smuggling of refugees. In addition, Bonn will make efforts to harmonize legislation concerning violent riots -- with a racist background, for example -- and to develop joint measures against nuclear crime. The fourth major issue will be to create a Europe of the citizens. Particularly in the weeks before the elections to the European Parliament, Kinkel has noticed "that people are not happy about the fact that Europe adopts executive decisions which have no legal basis." In fact, the Maastricht Treaty has brought a few new laws. The democratic deficit that still exists must be removed in the future. Kinkel wants to involve the European Parliament as much as possible during his Presidency of the European Council. Kinkel expressed confidence about the upcoming referendums on EU membership in the countries of the European Free Trade Association [EFTA]. "After all the efforts that have been made in the four EFTA states, the population will probably not reject membership. Can you imagine that Finland, which is now facing difficulties because it has lost a large part of its market because of the disappearance of the bipolar world, will not take the opportunity of becoming a member of the EU? This is inconceivable for me." Kinkel is also convinced that the outcome of the referendum in Austria, which will take place as early as on Sunday [12 June], will be positive. Germany's role in foreign policy has so far been characterized by reservedness. In view of the historical background, this was the right course, Kinkel pointed out. After reunification and the restoration of the country's sovereignty, the world now sees Germany in a different way than in the past. "The world wants us to step down from the spectator stand and assume responsibility." Kinkel expressed the hope that the "big administrative barrier" will be removed by the Constitutional Court in the summer. In his view, it should be possible in the future for German soldiers to participate in UN missions outside the NATO area after a parliamentary decision. However, Germany must never again pursue a policy of national unilateral efforts. "If we have drawn a lesson from history, it is the following: German interests must naturally be safeguarded, but within the framework of an integrated policy with the partners." Thus, Germany claims the position of a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
