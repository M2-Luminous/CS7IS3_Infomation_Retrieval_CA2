Mr Borujerdi referred to the visit paid by the Turkish consul in Orumiyeh to the victims of the incident and said: The existence of these witnesses to the bombings must have removed any doubts Turkish officials may have had about the bombs falling around the Sar-e Dasht area. He added: The Islamic Republic of Iran strongly requests that the Turkish Government adopt measures ensuring that future military operations by that country in northern Iraq will not inflict any harm or damage to the Islamic Republic of Iran's borders, even if such operations take place close to our country's frontiers. Mr. Haktanir, the Turkish ambassador to Tehran, for his part expressed deep regret over the tragic incident and said: The Iranian authorities and nation must rest assured that the plans of Turkey's military officials were to attack the positions of PKK guerrillas inside Iraqi territory, and that was precisely why we immediately sent a special fact-finding team to examine the situation close up with Iranian officials. He added: The Turkish Government will not forego any measure to make up for the losses inflicted, and the proposals of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will be speedily conveyed to the Turkish authorities.
