Its Deputy Prime Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut told reporters on arrival for a three-day official visit that Cambodia planned to set up embassy here before proceeding to do so in other ASEAN countries. Sirivut, who is also minister of foreign affairs and international co-operation, said the embassies were necessary to enable his country to keep abreast the developments in the region, as Cambodia had been isolated since the last 20 years because of civil war. However, he could not say how soon the plans would materialise as the country's top priority was to revive its economy. "Ours is a very poor country, we have to revive our economy first before embarking on other plans," he said at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Subang on arrival from Phnom Penh. Foreign Minister Datuk Abdullah Ahmad Badawi was present to greet Sirivut who is leading a 10-man delegation. Sirivut's visit was on the invitation of Abdullah. He said that he would be discussing with Abdullah about the possibility of setting up the embassy besides discussing bilateral matters with Malaysian officials. The visit was also to finalise details of Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed's three-day visit to Cambodia from April 14. The Malaysian prime minister is scheduled to hold discussions on bilateral, regional and international issues with the co-prime ministers of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen. Dr. Mahathir will then proceed to Laos, also for a three-day visit. Sirivut said that the people of Cambodia were looking forward to Dr. Mahathir's visit because of Malaysia's role in the peace process. He said Cambodia had expressed deep gratitude to the government and people of Malaysia who had contributed greatly towards the peace process in the country. Malaysia, he said, was among the first countries to send troops to serve in the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia (UNTAC) whose duty was to organise and monitor the country's first free elections. [Passage omitted] He said King Norodom Sihanouk has agreed to personally welcome Dr. Mahathir. Sirivut said Cambodia also welcomed Malaysia's private sector to invest in the country and would seek the government's assistance in its rebuilding. Cambodia is seeking Malaysia's expertise in various fields including agriculture and tourism. "We have alot to learn from Malaysia in our efforts to rebuild our country," he said. [passage omitted] He is also scheduled to call on Dr. Mahathir Tuesday.
