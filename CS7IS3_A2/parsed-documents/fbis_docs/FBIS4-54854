The above political parties and associations support the Committee for the Defence of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of Albania which has accused the Greek Government of interference into the internal affairs of the Albanian state and of the Albanian Autocephalous Church on the eve of Easter, through Anastas Janullatos, who is considered by this committee as "a foreign and illegal archbishop." Statements in support of the Autocephalous character of the Albanian Orthodox Church have been made during Easter also by the Democratic Party and the Republican one.
