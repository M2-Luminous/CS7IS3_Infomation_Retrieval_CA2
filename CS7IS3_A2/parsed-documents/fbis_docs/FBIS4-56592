Ortega's Retirement 94CA0102C Managua LA TRIBUNA in Spanish 5 Apr 94 p 6A 94CA0102C Managua LA TRIBUNA Spanish CSO [Commentary by Alejandro Bolanos Davis] [Text] Many of us have wondered, and still others continue to wonder, why Dona Violeta cannot get Humberto Ortega out of the Army. If she is president of the Republic, why is it impossible for her to remove him from office? There are certainly many different answers to this question. I will give an answer that is based on the political Constitution that was tailor-made to suit the Sandinists' needs. According to Article 144 of the Sandinists' political Constitution, the president of the Republic is the "commander in chief of the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation," but nowhere in the Constitution is there any other reference to these Defense and Security Forces of the Nation (FDSN). Therefore, the president of the Republic is the commander in chief of a nonexistent military force. What does exist is the Sandinist People's Army (EPS), but the Constitution itself does not recognize it as the "Defense and Security Force of the Nation." Article 95 of the Constitution states: "The Sandinist People's Army is a national force and shall protect, respect, and obey this political Constitution. "The Sandinist People's Army is the military arm of the people and the direct heir of the National Sovereignty Defense Army. The government plans, organizes, and directs the people's participation in the armed defense of the fatherland through the Sandinist People's Army. No armed bodies other than those established by law shall exist in national territory, and the law shall regulate the organization of military forces." The above makes it clear that: 1) The president of the Republic is the commander in chief of a nonexistent army, not of the EPS. 2) The EPS, the army of the Sandinists' party, is not the national army of Nicaragua, but it is a "national force" because it replaces the Defense and Security Forces of the Nation. 3) Only the EPS, the army of the Sandinists' political party, is allowed to exist in Nicaragua, and it is a national force because it has replaced the FDSN. 4) The EPS derives its power directly from the Army of Sandino, and arrogates to itself the exclusive power to organize the people's participation. 5) The EPS is independent of civilian power, in that it is not under the orders of the executive branch. In short, the Sandinist political Constitution states that Dona Violeta cannot remove Humberto Ortega from office because she has no power over the commander of the EPS. Antonio Lacayo, who devised and signed the famous Transition Protocol with Humberto Ortega, committing Dona Violeta's government to honoring the structure of the EPS and the Sandinist Constitution, complicated this situation even further. In one paragraph, the Transition Protocol states: "Respect for the integrity and professionalism of the EPS and the forces of public order, as well as their ranks, personnel registries, and commands, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic, is also the fundamental basis for the orderly transfer of government." It is rumored that Humberto Ortega will retire from the EPS soon, but for reasons of political and economic convenience that have nothing to do with the executive branch. Before retiring, Ortega will make sure his successor is loyal to him and no one else, so that the EPS will continue to be an integral part of the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front], a "national force." Hence the urgent need for a constituent assembly to draft a new political constitution, with new deputies elected by the people, rather than partial amendments to the Constitution by the current Congress, with a majority of deputies favoring Sandinism. We will never free the country from the grip of the Sandinist military by merely amending the Constitution.
