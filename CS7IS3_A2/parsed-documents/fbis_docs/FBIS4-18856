This will include the Eastern countries which have common borders with Community member states; the Baltic States will be included based on a broad interpretation of the concept of "maritime borders." In practice, three Central and East European countries will remain outside this programme, as they have no common border with the [European] Union [EU]. They are: Hungary, the Slovak Republic and Romania. However, the first two will have a common border with the EU once Austria joins; then Romania will be the only East European country to be excluded, and its case will require special consideration. It should be pointed out that the Commission was not able to include the FYROM [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--Skopje] in the list of countries eligible for this programme because the Council would not allow it to be included among the PHARE programme beneficiaries (due to opposition from Greece). The situation could, of course, change later on. The new programme, which will have ECU150 million in funding for 1994 is being set up at the initiative of the European Parliament. Its objective is to promote structural actions in the regions of the Central and East European countries which border on the Community and are eligible for PHARE; in the Community member states, such actions will be co-financed by the structural funds, notably by INTERREG II [Community Initiative concerning border areas]. Thus, projects in the PHARE framework will be implemented in accordance with structural policies, with INTERREG in particular. The objectives of the new programme were largely based on programmes of cross-border cooperation carried out by the Community. The eligible projects are also nearly identical to those found in the context of INTERREG II, and include, first of all, measures for the development of infrastructures; secondly, there will be various measures in the economic, social and technical spheres aimed at promoting cross-border cooperation. The process of identifying joint projects has already been kicked off by a number of meetings between representatives from the countries of Central and East Europe, the countries having borders with the EU, and the Commission services. For some countries, a number of projects affecting about three-quarters of the available budget were identified. The draft regulation on the new programme will be sent for information to the European Parliament, the ESC [Economic and Social Committee] and the Committee of Regions and will be presented to the Management Committee in April, in view of its final adoption by the Commission in light of this Committee's opinion.
