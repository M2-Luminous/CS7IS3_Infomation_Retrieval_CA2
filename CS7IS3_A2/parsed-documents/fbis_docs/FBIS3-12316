Accordingly, there is a need to rethink the Oslo, Davos, and Cairo agreements, as well as the Gazaz-Jericho accord itself. The proposed phased settlement on the Israeli-Palestinian track -- envisaging an interim five-year period followed by a final settlement, the outlines of which are by no means clear -- also needs to be reexamined. Inevitably, then, the Palestinian leadership will have to back out from a stage-by-stage settlement that it concluded with Israel under U.S. pressure. Having done that, the Palestinian leadership will have to push for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as Resolution 181, which calls for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. The Palestinian leadership has a strong case to advance to the U.S. sponsor of the peace process and the international community; namely, that the U.S. initiative and the Madrid conference were launched on the basis of UN resolutions, the land-for-peace formula, and the Palestinian people's national legitimate rights. The international community, including the powerful, permanent members of the UN Security Council, are now all too aware that Palestinians in the occupied territories are being subjected to a genocidal effort. Hence, it is not reasonable to act as if nothing has happened and carry on with the negotiations with Israel while the physical liquidation of the Palestinians continues, especially since there is not a single piece of evidence for an Israeli willingness to pull out from the entire Gaza Strip and the West Bank and Jerusalem. Nor is there any indication that Israel is willing to entertain the idea of an independent Palestinian state -- now or in the future. All of which is not lost on the Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, who has indicated that he is not pursuing an independent Palestinian state, but a confederation with Jordan! That being the case -- in other words, since the Palestinian leadership has renounced the right to self-determination and an independent state as stipulated by UN resolutions -- why not walk out of a sham peace exercise holding no promise of fulfilling Palestinian rights? The Palestinian leadership has exhausted its bargaining chips at the negotiating table with Israel and failed to get anything of significance in the way of the national rights of the Palestinian people. This is because it did not treat UN resolutions, or the Madrid conference and the land-for-peace formula as a point of reference. Instead of giving an affirmative response to President Clinton's invitation for Palestinian and Israeli negotiators to go to Washington to conclude a final deal, which, in any case, can by no means advance national, legitimate Palestinian rights, the Palestinian leadership might have suspended the talks, or attached courageous strings to their resumption. It is worth recalling here Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres' remark that Israel was negotiating with itself and dictating terms. I will go so far as to call on the Palestinian leadership to withdraw from the peace process if only to keep from bargaining away Palestinian rights. I will call on the Palestinian leadership to let Jordan and Egypt negotiate the future of the West bank and Gaza on its behalf, since the two territories were caputured from Jordan and Egypt. The two countries can conduct the negotiations on the basis of Resolutions 242 and 338 stipulating Israeli withdrawal from all the territories Israel conquered in June, 1967. If Israel has an interest in true and comprehensive peace, it will have to pull out from all occupied Arab territories -- the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Golan Heights, and south Lebanon -- in compliance with Resolutions 242, 338, and 425. If the United States wants to make a go of its peace initiative and see durable peace, security, and stability prevail in the region, it will have to talk or coerce Israel into complying with the UN resolutions on the basis of which its initiative and the Madrid conference were launched. I believe the Palestinian leadership must acknowledge its failure to regain Palestinian rights, and then go on to entrust this historic and momentous mission to Jordan and Egypt, both of which are better positioned to do the job. With the right amount of coordination and solidarity, the cordon states -- Jordan, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon -- can regain the occupied Arab territories. Subsequently, the Palestinian leadership can take the initiative and claim self-determination from Jordan and Egypt, and the Palestinian people can exercise their rights either by setting up their own independent state, forging confederal or federal ties, or entering into an outright merger with any of the cordon states. Obviously such a move on the part of the Palestinian leadership calls for a rare degree of courage. I dare say that such a courageous stand would win the support of the political and popular circles in the Palestinian, Arab, and Islamic communities. Will the Palestinian leadership take inspiration from the holy month of Ramadan and summon the courage to do the right thing, and thus rob Israel of the chance of keeping up its genocidal effort against the Palestinian people? The bloody dawn's massacre in the Ibrahimi Mosque is a meaningful lesson that ought to be learned. The Palestinian leadership and the Arab nation must hold Israel and the U.S. Administration responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre and its consequences.
