FR940104-1-00046 FR940104-1-00009 20. While the Authorization Act requires NHTSA to initiate rulemaking on brake performance for passenger cars, NHTSA is contemplating using its general authority under the Vehicle Safety Act to broaden this mandate to include trucks, vans, sport utility vehicles, and buses under 10,000 pounds GVWR. The agency is considering this approach because it believes that ABS has more potential benefits for vehicles which have a greater disparity between their unloaded and fully loaded weights. These latter type vehicles fall into this category. The agency notes that the market appears to agree with this position as ABS is more prevalent in light trucks than passenger cars. NHTSA seeks comment on its tentative decision to include these vehicles. 21. At this stage in the rulemaking, NHTSA is inclined to propose an effective date of two years after the final rule, for passenger cars, and three years after the final rule for light vehicles other than passenger cars (i.e., trucks). The agency believes that this would give the industry sufficient leadtime to develop the production capacity needed to supply the market with antilock systems. The agency expects that an increasing number of light trucks will be offered with all-wheel antilock systems, particularly if the proposed requirements cannot be met with rear-wheel-only systems. If this is the case, then manufacturers of light trucks with these systems might need more leadtime than manufacturers of passenger cars to comply with the proposed requirements. Would this implementation schedule be appropriate? Would it be reasonable to accelerate or delay any portion of it? Should the agency apply requirements for ABSs to some light vehicles but not others? H. Costs Associated with Potential Proposals 22. NHTSA estimates that this rulemaking's potential cost would be approximately $1.04 billion per year. This cost consists of ABS costs of $920 million, installation costs of about $80 million, and increased fuel costs of about $40 million due to a small increase in vehicle weight. The average retail price of an ABS system to the consumer would be about $450. This price is based on a cost study of seven ABS systems entitled ``Evaluation of Costs of Antilock Brake Systems'' and a markup factor of 1.51. The agency's cost estimate assumes that all-wheel ABS would be required on all light vehicles. It projects that all-wheel ABS would be voluntarily installed as standard equipment in 85 percent of model year 1999 passenger cars, the first model year that would be affected if a final rule were issued in 1996 and a 2-year leadtime for compliance were provided. The remaining 15 percent or about 1.4 million vehicles would be equipped only as a result of a requirement. The cost estimate also projects that all light trucks would be voluntarily equipped with ABS by model year 1999/2000, 75 percent of them having all-wheel systems. Thus, 25 percent of new light trucks, or about 1.5 million vehicles, would be involuntarily equipped with all-wheel ABS if the agency issued a final rule requiring this. In this case, all-wheel ABS hardware and installation costs would be incrementally higher (about $200 more), as compared to those for rear-wheel systems. How much would it cost per vehicle to equip all light vehicles with all-wheel ABSs? How much would it cost per vehicle to equip these vehicles with rear-wheel-only ABSs? What would be the likely costs to a final purchaser for either of the two types of antilock systems? 23. Each light vehicle manufacturer is requested to provide, with respect to model year 1994, and for each of the following types of vehicles, passenger cars, light trucks, and light MPVs: the total number of the vehicles it will produce; the vehicles it will equip with rear-wheel-only ABSs; and the vehicles it will equip with all-wheel ABSs. With respect to each of model years 1995&hyph;1999, and for each of the following types of vehicles, passenger cars, light trucks, and light MPVs, what percentages of vehicles do you expect to voluntarily equip with a rear-wheel-only ABS? With an all-wheel ABS? Do you expect to install all-wheel ABSs on all of your passenger cars? If so, when? On all of your light trucks? On all of your light MPVs? 24. NHTSA notes that some insurance companies currently offer discounts for antilock equipped passenger cars, light trucks and light MPVs. Which insurers provide such a discount? How large is the discount offered by each of those insurers? What is the basis for such discounts?
