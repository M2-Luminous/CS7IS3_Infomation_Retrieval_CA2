FBIS4-11832 "drnes063_c_94010" FBIS-NES-94-063 Daily Report 31 Mar 1994 Egypt Human Rights Group Urges Release of 22 Lawyers Human Rights Group Urges Release of 22 Lawyers NC3103211294 Paris AFP in English 2050 GMT 31 Mar 94 NC3103211294 Paris AFP English BFN [Text] Cairo, March 31 (AFP) -- An Egyptian human rights group called Thursday [31 March] for the release of 22 lawyers held for up to four years for defending Moslem militants. The Egyptian Organisation for Human Rights said in a statement the detention of the lawyers was "an act of arbitrary detention ... in violation of both the Egyptian constitution and law as well as their basic human rights." It said most of the lawyers had been "found innocent by the courts of all charges brought against them" and were being held despite orders for their release. "This is a particularly alarming violation in view of the role that these lawyers play in upholding the integrity of the law," the statement added. It said the lawyers had been held because they had visited and prepared appeals for prisoners charged in terrorist cases and were falsely accused of passing on information to people on the outside of the prison. One of the attorneys, Hasan al-Gharabawi Shihatah, has been held since 1989 even though he was cleared of all charges in May 1990 and despite 25 release orders, the group added. It has sent a list of 150 names to President Husni Mubarak of people still being held despite being declared innocent. Islamic militants have targeted banks and foreigners in a two-year campaign to topple Mubarak's government.
