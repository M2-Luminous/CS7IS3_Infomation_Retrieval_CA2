According to the service's preliminary conclusions, state-run stations are given priority in using transmitters and rebroadcasting lines, they are subsidized from the state budget, while private stations can rent equipment only by way of contest and can earn money only by selling commercial time. Besides, state TV and radio charges considerably less for commercial time and thus limits the ability of private stations to compete on the market. The competition service intends to submit its final conclusions to the parliament and the government when additional information about the situation on the TV and radio market is obtained. Supposedly, state TV and radio will have to reduce its commercial time, while the government will be recommended to take into account the income for commercials when allocating subsidies to state-run stations.
