These regulations are hereby formulated in accordance with the "PRC Law on Agriculture," the State Council's "Administrative Regulations on Charges and Labor Services To Be Contributed by Peasants," and other state laws, ordinances, and regulations concerned, and in light of the actual circumstances in this province, with a view to regulating peasant burdens by laws, protecting legitimate peasant rights and interests, giving play to peasant initiative in production, and promoting rural economic development. Article 2. Burdens on peasants as referred to in these regulations denote profits retained by villages (including villagers' groups, same definition applicable hereafter), coordination fees collected by townships (including towns, same definition applicable hereafter), and voluntary labor services and accumulated labor work [lao dong ji lei gong 0525 0520 4480 4797 1562], as well as other expenses charged to peasants according to laws, ordinances, and regulations concerned, besides taxes to be paid by the peasants to the state. It is an obligation on the part of the peasants to pay taxes to the state and undertake all the charges and corvee as prescribed by these regulations. The peasants will take the initiative in performing this obligation, but they have the right to refuse the solicitation of any other financial or material contributions or labor services to be rendered gratis, since a demand for such contributions and services is illegal. Article 3. The Agricultural Committee (hereafter referred to as the department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens) under the people's government at and above the county level is in charge of supervision and administration of affairs relating to peasant burdens within its own area of jurisdiction, the township people's government is in charge of supervision and administration of affairs related to peasant burdens within townships, while routine operations are to be run by rural economic management and administrative departments at all levels (hereafter referred to as rural economic administrative departments). Departments concerned in charge of planning, statistics, finance, auditing, commodity price controls, and administrative supervision will assist in supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens in accordance with their respective duties and responsibilities. Article 4. The duties and responsibilities of departments at all levels supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens are as follows: 1) To arrange for these regulations to be implemented; to publicize and implement state laws, ordinances, regulations, and policies concerning peasant burdens; and to supervise and monitor the progress of implementation; 2) To coordinate, supervise, and administer affairs related to peasant burdens within their own areas of jurisdiction; 3) To examine rules and measures concerning peasant burdens formulated by departments of the people's governments or by other units at the same level; 4) To check and verify annual peasant per-capita net income; 5) To attend to complaints and prosecutions concerning peasant burdens; 6) To investigate and handle, alone or in cooperation with other departments concerned, cases of violation of these regulations; 7) To provide training to personnel in charge of supervision and administration of affairs relating to peasant burdens. Article 5. A peasant burdens affair supervision card system and budget and final accounting system will be strictly enforced. All kinds of funds turned over to the authorities and corvee undertaken by peasants should be recorded in the "Manual of Registration of expenses and Corvee Undertaken by Peasants," uniformly prepared by provincial department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens, and these records are subject to regular review. Article 6. Every unit or individual has the right to report any violation of these regulations. Departments at all levels supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens and other departments concerned will investigate and handle such reported cases without delay. Article 7. People's governments and departments concerned at all levels will commend and reward organizations or individuals who have strictly implemented these regulations and made prominent contributions to keeping the burden on peasants at a legally accepted level and to protecting legitimate peasant rights and interests. Chapter II -- Village Profit Retention and Township Coordination Fees Article 8. The amount of the village profit retention and township coordination fee which peasants pay directly to collective economic organizations (profits turned over by collective-run township and village enterprises not included) will be calculated on the basis of figures given by the rural economic income distribution statistical statement prepared with data collected by rural economic administrative departments at all levels, according to the statistical method formulated by the Ministry of Agriculture and approved by the State Statistical Bureau. This amount which is to be calculated on a township or village basis will not exceed 5 percent of net peasant per-capita income recorded in the previous year. Article 9. The village profit retention comprises a provident fund, a public welfare fund, and management fees. 1) The provident fund is to be used to finance farmland and water conservation capital construction projects, tree planting and afforestation work, purchase of fixed assets for production, and operation of collective enterprises. 2) The public welfare fund is to be used to support households enjoying the five guarantees, to subsidize households in extreme difficulty, and to finance cooperative medical and health care services, epidemic prevention service, woman and child care, as well as cultural activities, education, and other collective welfare undertakings. 3) The management fee is used to pay village and production group cadres, as well as expenses for administrative operations. The employment of village and production group cadres, and rewards and subsidies for these cadres will be strictly subject to the relevant rules formulated by the provincial people's government. Article 10. The township coordination fee is to be used to run schools at the township and village levels, and to finance family planning programs, militia training, care for disabled servicemen and family members of servicemen and martyrs, road construction and maintenance works, and other civilian-run public facilities. The township and village school fund is to be used to pay off subsidies for teachers of non-government-run primary and secondary schools, premise maintenance expenses of these schools, and expenses on other non-government-run education services. Article 11. The levy percentage of village profit retention and township coordination fees will be in keeping with the level fixed by the provincial people's government. No unit or department will make any extra levies in the name of village profit retention or of township coordination fees or appropriate these two types of funds for any other purposes, except for some economically developed localities which may moderately raise the percentage only with the approval of the provincial people's government. Article 12. Village profit retention and township coordination fees are discriminatingly levied on peasants mainly according to the trades they are engaged in and to their actual income. Peasants who farm on contracted plots of land will pay off to their respective collective economic organizations the village profit retention and township coordination fees in proportion to the area of farmland (or water or hilly land) or the number of laborers working on the plots of land. A peasant who has an individually owned business or private enterprise, after taxes will pay to the local authorities which his residential household registration is attached to, village profit retention and township coordination fees at the rate of 5 percent of his net income as recorded in the previous year. But this amount will be distinguished from the 5 percent of peasant per-capita net income as referred to in Article 8 of these regulations. Article 13. An annual centralized assessment and collection system applies to both village profit retention and township coordination fees, and village collective economic organizations and township people's government organs are authorized to collect these fees. No other units and departments will do this, and no unit or individual will ask for advance payment or collect the said fees by force under any pretext. When collecting village profit retention and township coordination fees from peasant households, all collectors will present a "rural cooperative economy internal accounting voucher" prepared by the authorization of the county (city) department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens. Article 14. Households in extreme difficulty, specifically family members of revolutionary martyrs and servicemen, disabled servicemen, and demobilized or retired servicemen who have lost their working ability, may be exempted from payment of village profit retention or have their payment reduced, providing that it is approved by the assembly of the members of the village collective economic organizations or by member representative meetings. Villages that are rated by the township people's government as impoverished villages and which have suffered great economic losses caused by serious natural disasters can have payment of township coordination fees reduced, providing that an application for reduction of payment is lodged by a village collective economic organization, endorsed by a township people's government, and ratified by a township people's congress. Article 15. As far as the amount of village profit retention is concerned, the village collective economic organization is to prepare at the year end the final accounts for that year and to propose the budget for the next year. After being reviewed by the township organ in charge of rural economic administration, the final accounts and budget will be discussed and approved by the assembly of members of the village collective economic organization, and then submitted to the villagers' assembly for discussion and approval before they are filed to the township people's government for record purposes. As far as the amount of township coordination fee is concerned, the township people's government is to prepare at the year end the final accounts for that year and to propose the budget for the next year. After being reviewed by the county organ in charge of rural economic administration, the final accounts and budget will be discussed and approved by the township people's congress, and then they will be filed, together with the village profit retention final accounts and budgets of all the villages under the township's jurisdiction, to the county department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens for record purposes. The final accounts and budget, after review and approval, will be published by a notice which will be put up so that the public can supervise the progress of implementation. The villagers' committee will supervise the collection and allocation of the village profit retention. Article 16. The township coordination fee belongs to all the peasants within the collective economic organization framework, and is to be used to finance local public-aided undertakings. The nature and use of the township coordination fee as a type of collective fund will not be confused or altered. The township coordination fee will not be used to make up any financial deficits of the township, nor will the sum of the fee be divided up and separately collected, managed, and allocated by different departments. It is prohibited to place the township coordination fee under the county management. Article 17. The village profit retention and township coordination fee are subject to strict financial management. The village profit retention will be retained and allocated by the village under strict control and supervision by the township rural economic management department. The township coordination fee which is subject to centralized administration by the township rural economic management department will be allocated to different special accounts, with specific funds to be used only for specific purposes. As far as appropriation of the village profit retention and township coordination fees is concerned, an appropriation plan will be drawn up according to the quota and proportions fixed by the provincial people's government. The appropriation of these funds is subject to budgetary control and will not exceed the quota. The account will be settled in good time after fund appropriation. The practice of collecting funds without filing an application or of levying appropriations without fulfilling the fund withdrawal procedures is strictly prohibited. It is prohibited to spend the village profit retention or township coordination fees on entertaining guests or presenting gifts, and extravagance and waste will be banned. The village profit retention and township coordination fee will not be allocated indiscriminately on an egalitarian basis, nor will they be misappropriated, diverted to inappropriate use, or used as a financial guaranty. Article 18. The county and township departments supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens will practice a tailor-made auditing system for the allocation, management, and use of the village profit retention and township coordination fees. Chapter III -- Rural Voluntary Labor Services and Accumulated Labor Work Article 19. Rural voluntary labor services are mainly to undertake such works as flood prevention, tree planting, road construction and maintenance, and school construction. Each rural laborer will undertake rural voluntary labor services for not more than 10 standard work-days each year. If extra voluntary labor services are needed in case of emergencies, such as disaster fighting and relief operations, the people's government at and above the county level is to centralize the work. Article 20. Accumulated labor work is mainly to undertake such efforts as farmland and water conservation capital construction, comprehensive agricultural development, tree planting and afforestation, and the blood fluke extinction operation as a part of snail fever prevention. Each rural laborer will undertake accumulated labor work for not more than 20 work-days a year. The amount of labor work may be moderately increased where the local conditions allow, with approval by the people's government at and above the county level. But in no case will the extra amount of work for each rural laborer exceed 10 work-days. Accumulated labor work will mainly be levied during the slack season. Article 21. Rural voluntary labor services and accumulated labor work will mainly be rendered in the form of real labor work. If a peasant asks to substitute money payment for labor work, his request is subject to the approval of the rural collective economic organization. On the other hand, no peasant will be forced to pay money in place of labor work. For disabled servicemen and family members of martyrs and servicemen who enjoy special preferential treatment, voluntary labor work can be exempted or reduced according to the relevant regulations formulated by the provincial people's government. Peasants who cannot render labor services because of illness or disability may have their labor service duties exempted or reduced if approved by the assembly of members of the village collective economic organization or a meeting of member representatives after discussion. Article 22. A rural voluntary labor services and accumulated labor work allocation plan will be jointly proposed by the township people's government and the village collective economic organization after discussion. This plan will be implemented after examination and adoption by the township people's congress, and the actual allocation of such labor services will be revealed by a notice posted at the end of the year, subject to public supervision. Such practices as levying extra labor services gratis and arbitrarily altering the use of labor services are strictly prohibited. Chapter IV -- Other Burdens on the Peasants Article 23. The imposition of administrative service charges on peasants and the setting and adjustment of charge standards are subject to joint approval by the provincial financial department, commodity price control department, and the provincial department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens, and, in case of important items, also subject to approval by the provincial people's government. Service charges that are prescribed by state laws, ordinances, and regulations will go through application and approval procedures as prescribed by state laws, ordinances, and regulations. No units or departments will arbitrarily impose service charges without approval. Service charge license, payment receipt, annual auditing, and receipt inspection systems are applied to administrative service charge systems. When a service charge is collected, the service charge license will be produced, and a uniform receipt printed by the provincial financial department or a special receipt made under the supervision of this department will be issued, otherwise the peasant has the right to refuse payment of the charge. Article 24. Fund raising among the peasants is subject to rigid regulation. It will be conducted within the scope and limits prescribed by laws, ordinances, and regulations, as well as by the relevant state policies. Funds will be raised on a voluntary basis, a moderate scale, in the interests of the fund contributors, and according to the principle of specific funds for specific purposes. Establishment of funds, definition of the scope of fund raising and the amount to be raised, the examination and approval procedures of fund raising programs, the use of funds, and the returns on the funds will all be in keeping with the regulations formulated by the provincial people's government. Funds raised will be placed under the supervision of the department supervising and administering affairs related to peasant burdens. Article 25. Illegally imposing fines on peasants and confiscating peasant property are prohibited.

Agencies issuing licenses, certifying documents, and other documents to peasants will charge management costs by the price scale set by the financial and commodity price control departments, according to the provisions of laws, ordinances, and regulations, or with the approval of the provincial people's government. In no case will the agencies arbitrarily raise service charges without approval. Article 28. Economic, technical, labor, and information services to suit the needs of peasants and collective economic organizations will be rendered on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis. In no case will any peasant be forced to accept such services. And customers will be charged for services by a scale agreed by both parties through consultations or in accordance with the relevant state and provincial regulations. Article 29.
