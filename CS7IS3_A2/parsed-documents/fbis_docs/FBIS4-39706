I want to use today this simple and, at the same time, meaningful phrase that unites us all -- citizens of the Republic of Belarus! All of us in our young sovereign state should aim for a single goal and desire -- to realize ourselves and become forever a single nation of Belarus. While looking in the statistical data, one may easily see that Belarus is a multinational state. Almost one-third of its population is comprised of Russians, Ukrainians, Jews, Lithuanians, Poles, Tatars, and other nationalities. Our policy is based on respect with regard to all nationalities living in the territory of the Republic. Creating the model for our new statehood, we have laid fundamental principles of the relations between the state and all nationalities. These are: civic equality, social equality, economic, and political guarantees for every resident of the Republic, regardless of nationality, rights to national cultural development, and many others. Now, inaugurating our cultural center, I have remembered an idea from ancient philosophers: "A nation is strong because of its people!" It is a great happiness when the social and historical foundations of one nation is interwoven with the cultures and traditions of many ethnic communities. This enriches the intellectual life of the entire society. As a matter of fact, we cannot put artificial national barriers between us today. In our Republic, over half of the marriages are mixed; past, present, and future generations are closely joined by blood and cultural affinity. However, every one of us has an undeniable right (and a holy right, as well) to preserve his or her national heritage, historical culture, and spiritual values. The guarantor of all this is the state -- sovereign and multinational in its essence. These guarantees are set forth in our Constitution and laws. They include the right to education in native language, the right to follow one's national cultural tradition, and the right to national and political equality. All this is important, not only in a physical aspect. We are faced today with the difficult task to find a way out of the economic crises. This task can be resolved only by our joint efforts. Only a nation that holds together the best sources of various national cultures, common intellectual life, and civic accord, is capable of resolving such a problem. I, being one of the state leaders, can see all these problems very clearly. Therefore, the government continues to render assistance to all ethnic cultural associations. Yes, I am a supporter of dual citizenship. Not everything is simple in this issue. However, I think that one will feel oneself more stable socially if the issue is resolved this way. This is a very democratic and civilized norm. Yet there are opponents. You know who they are. One more argument. Over 3 million Belarusians are living outside of our Fatherland. They are true sons and daughters of Belarus. They have the right to possess the citizenship of their Republic. I also rule out a possibility of the partition of our society due on the principle of the indigenous nation and national minorities. Dear fellow-citizens! We undoubtfully need a network of such centers, as this one being inaugurated today, in other regions of the Republic. We must render governmental assistance to multinational system of publishing. It is necessary to broadcast special programs for the nationalities on radio and television. It is necessary to create kindergartens, classes, and schools namely for the nationalities. This is not an infringement on Belarusian language, education, and culture. This is a logical and natural process in the life of a civilized and multinational state. These days, one may often hear that there is nothing wrong in the word "nationalism." Is it a good word? The point is not in the ideas themselves, but in that what is behind these ideas historically. We know very well, and remember, that this means woe, tears, interethnical conflicts, human blood... I did not even mention fascism. There is, and will ever be, no roots of nationalism in Belarus. Here live different peoples -- of great spirit and philanthropy. This is a country where nobody will be able to impose on the people the shameful norm of taking on employees according to the percentage of nationalities; there will also never be second-rate people in Belarus. Our people are capable of cutting off any shoots of nationalism and put them into historical rubbish! National cultural problems also include those of religions. We have over 20 religions today. Understandably, there are numerous religions, as well as small ones. The matter is in something else. The issues of national accord go well back to the high principles of divine morals. It is not important what your religious beliefs may be. It is important how you honor those principles. I would not like discuss politics today. The best politics -- I am sure that you will agree with me -- is to accomplish a concrete business. For example, the creation of our cultural center is a good foundation for future business. The center will be visited by both adults and children. It will be a source of what can be called by one good word -- the Motherland. We have a custom of giving presents on such momentous days. As a matter of fact, this center is a present from the government and our good-willed veterans who amiably agreed to make room for the cultural center in their place. However, I am of different stock. I prefer to feel myself a debtor, in the good sense of the word, with regard to the development of ethnic cultures and interethnic relations -- it opens a permanent perspective for resolving new tasks and problems in this direction. Thank you for your attention and I wish you every happiness in your new home!
