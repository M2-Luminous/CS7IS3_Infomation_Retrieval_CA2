Lipatov, Bolshevo; UDC 519.3] [Abstract] Synthesis of optimal control, being a dynamic problem of optimization, is solved in closed form for an autonomous control system in the general case of a nonlinear one with an additive re-entrant control vector dx/dt= f(x(t)) + Bu(t). It is assumed that the mechanical control object f(x(t)) has a vector of independent first integrals which obeys Pontryagin's principle condition and that the control vector is subject to an upper-bound constraint on its Euclidean norm. With x(t(0)) and x(t(1)) given in the phase space, the problem is to find the structure of operator u[.sup]0[/]= u[.sup]0[/](x(t)) which will minimize the time functional �= [.sup]t0[/]Int[.sup]t1[/] dt= t(1) - t(0) to min�= T[.sup]0[/](x(t)). The solution to this variational problem is sought on the basis of the characteristic optimality condition in the quick-response problem. That minimum and thus optimum value is shown to depend not only on the vector of optimal control but also on the intrinsic motion of the control object (solution to the problem) under specific initial or current conditions in phase coordinates. The characteristic optimality condition is applied to the case of an object either in intrinsic motion or at rest, with a zero Euclidean norm of the control vector and no a'priori information about control of the object before time t[.sup]0[/]. A partial differential equation of the Hamilton-Jacobi kind and the solution to its Cauchy problem with a zero boundary condition are obtained for T[.sup]0[/]. For autonomous systems that equation is a quasi-linear first-order partial differential one solvable by the method of characteristics, the latter being solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations. In the particular case considered here the integral surface degenerates into an integral curve, the tangent plane into a tangent line, and the Monge cone into a Monge axis. As a specific example is considered motion describable by the system of two equations dx(1)/dt= x(2) + u(1) and dx(2)/dt= -x(1) + u(2) with the same upper-bound constraint on the norms of both control vectors.
