Every 11 May, she receives a letter from Johannes Rau and last year, it was her 72d birthday, he included with almost prophetic prescience a quotation from Martin Buber: "Old age is wonderful, if one has not forgotten what it means to begin." However, the new beginning in October of last year was intense even for a Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. She talked even then about alternating hot and cold baths and now, in the April before the presidential election, Free Democratic Party [FDP] Chair Klaus Kinkel provided an additional cold shower with his coalition declaration in favor of the union parties [Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union (CDU/CSU)]. October was a particularly turbulent month. Hans-Dietrich Genscher had handed the FDP his final rejection and the political barometer of ZDF [Second German TV] jumped to 15 percent at the mention of Hamm-Bruecher's name. Hamm-Bruecher was unanimously chosen on 15 October at the small party convention in Magdeburg, although some FDP leaders would have preferred to sacrifice the queen in this game of chess almost immediately. They were talking about the nominee when Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher stated emphatically that she did not see herself as a chip in a poker game--a sentiment she had to express several times. Then the Union parties revealed a quotation from her about the GDR "embassy refugees," with the transparent accusation that she had been opposed to unification. She, herself, finally suggested in June to nominate civil rights advocate Jens Reich from eastern Berlin. Since then, her candidacy has irritated some people more than Jens Reich, himself, who dismisses such matters with a smile. She said that the FDP wanted somebody who represented the party and that Reich would not have been accepted even if she had renounced her candidacy. "To Begin Is Important" The past few weeks in the Swiss Alps, she had time to ponder Kinkel's coalition declaration and her own motivation for persevering as a candidate. The party leadership had reassured her that its assent just suggested an attitude and that her candidacy would now be supported more strongly. Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher allowed herself to be appeased although she had never liked coalition declarations. She has often expressed such sentiments because assent can lead to restricted maneuverability and that could be dangerous for the FDP. Opposition would be a better choice. Some FDP members would indeed have been pleased, if the bothersome challenger had voluntarily withdrawn after Heitmann's retreat, but this never occurred to her. The decisive reason for her candidacy was not just Heitmann, the union parties' candidate, nor winning the election. When starting something, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher often said to herself "even if it fails, it was still the right course of action. That is my idea of democracy." Her reason for running has been part of her campaign from the beginning: To strengthen the image of the FDP since even the union parties do not take the FDP seriously. "We are not an appendix, nor are we a bloc party." She does not, however, have to tell us that she is sometimes simply possessed by thoughts about the unexpected possibility that her long political life will not just cease, that she may again have a chance to express her ideas--and be listened to as well. Wherever she appears, she enjoys the crowds with her head held high and always with a friendly smile. The people flock to her. "Hildegard for president" has triggered ovations. The controversial politician stands for populism and does not represent party cliques. This is important, even for the FDP, at this time of disaffection with politics in a gloomy election year. She is invited to everything and speaks at the opening of the Leipzig Book Fair, at election rallies, and at local clubs to "groups of frustrated people who have an urgent need to listen." Even the party leadership may summon her and make her the centerpiece, as--for instance--at the Stuttgart epiphany meeting. She has always called herself "a freelance liberal," and boasted about her independence. To take an unequivocal position was probably unavoidable for a woman who wanted to advance in the male-dominated political environment of the past 46 years. She says that she is sometimes ruthless and inconsiderate when anger gets the better of her. But she had the mark of a politician as early as 1946 when in the small state of Wuerttemberg-Baden she met the minister of culture with the name of Theodor Heuss. The Bruecher siblings lost their parents at an early age. The youngest three were raised in Dresden by their Jewish grandmother who killed herself when she was to be deported to Theresienstadt. Later, when Hildegard Bruecher studied chemistry in Munich, she became involved with the White Rose circle. Nobel-prize winner Heinrich Otto Wieland, her doctoral mentor, and chance saved her. Theodor Heuss remained the dominant figure in her life, and there is hardly an occasion when she does not quote him. "He was actually the first German who talked positively to me about democracy." Since then, she fights relentlessly to keep democracy from failing. She can almost understand why she is sometimes referred to in FDP circles by the title "her sacerdotal eminence, spokeswoman for a political conscience," because in the eighties she annoyed her colleagues "to the very end" with parliamentary reform. However, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher also practiced what she preached, namely that a representative is not bound by the dictates of his party but only by his conscience. She voted against tax-free aviation gas, against the Fighter-90, and against party-donation amnesty. Gerhard Baum, at least, said that she was responsible for raising his "self-esteem as a parliamentarian." On 1 October 1982, the day of the no-confidence vote in Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher said before the German Bundestag: "I cannot cast a vote of no confidence against the chancellor of the coalition government, for just a few months ago, I expressed my confidence in him." She also said that Schmidt did not deserve to be toppled without voter approval and that Helmuth Kohl did not deserve to become chancellor without voter approval. Both events carried the "stigma of violating democratic protocol." At that point the parliamentary Foreign Ministry undersecretary resigned from the government but remained a Bundestag representative. Her career was ruined, however. The word in Bonn is that from then on Chancellor Kohl never again acknowledged the existence of Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. Hans-Dietrich Genscher, on the other hand, is again writing favorable articles about her and he voted for the candidate. Yet scars remain on both sides. Maybe for that reason achievements that are her own are very important to her; for instance, the '93 charter for the Munich Citizens Association that she initiated and the Theodor Heuss Foundation. Sometimes she says that nothing has remained of her work and ideas, and that only a "few survivors" are still interested. In the mid-sixties, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher felt really at home in the FDP. With Hermann Flach amd Ralf Dahrendorf, she called this the time of political awakening. She can only visualize a switch to the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] in theory. "The external surroundings would have been quite intolerable and would not have agreed with me." She is a grande dame who says that she is barely on familiar terms even with herself. Her arguments with the Greens are less about substance than about their appearance. Even at age 72, her patrician heritage prevents her from lifting the curtain on her private life. The liberal Protestant has been married for more than 40 years to Erwin Hamm, a Catholic and member of the CDU, who worked for many years as a social and health administrator in Munich. When he derides her Protestant work ethics, she replies that it is the only way she can fritter her time away. The pile of books and articles that she has written on the side proves her point. Erwin Hamm once called her the "family Jeanne d'Arc" of Bonn, which clearly characterizes her better than to call her a feminist, although she spent her entire life practicing politics as a woman. When she started in 1948, she was the youngest city councillor in Munich and she was always the first: she was the first female Bundestag group chair, the first female parliamentary undersecretary, the first female national deputy party chief, and the first woman in the Foreign Ministry, which caused men some consternation. "But they were polite," she says, "initially they sent me to a playground and that was proper because it enabled me to gain a global perspective." She had to suffer many indignities, and in the Bavarian Landtag, she sometimes felt as if she were futilely baying at the moon. In the early sixties, the Bavarian FDP was drifting to the right and wanted to get rid of her because she could not be "integrated." The citizens saw it differently and gave twice as many votes to her 17th place on the list than to those who occupied the first places. In 1984 she toppled the Bavarian minister of justice, Theodor Maunz, because of his Nazi background. She constantly fought for better cultural and changed educational policies and succeeded to bring about a referendum against parochial schools. She is still advocating a plebiscite clause in the constitution. The opening of the school system to children of all social classes--and thus, above all, to girls--was, she thinks, her most important achievement. She cannot understand the FDP's neglect of educational policies, policies that are "liberal beacons, and subjects for mind and spirit." Toying With Intriguing Ideas Now she is again the first and convinced that, "in principle," it will be easier in the future for a woman to be a presidential candidate. She finds the thought of "a male president--a female president" intriguing--and, she says, she is up to it. Her hesitation over these words, relates to her 72 years, an age "in which one cannot simply continue one's life as it happens to be at the moment." Yet, she knows exactly what she would do as president--it is something that the protagonist of a rejuvenated democracy has always championed. She is surprised that so far nothing has been said about the foreign-policy aspect of the presidency, since Weizsaecker had made a pivotal impact on the image of the Federal Republic abroad. In this area, too, she feels confident because of her six-year experience in the Foreign Ministry. On 2 May the FDP Executive Committee will vote on the coalition declaration. Also at issue will be the presidential election and votes for Roman Herzog, for Johannes Rau, and for Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher. So far only Secretary General Werner Hoyer has said that a third ballot with the party's own candidate would be the least-flawed solution. It will be interesting, especially for the candidate who has never taken so much care in drafting her speeches as in her present position in which she has promised to polish the party's image. What action FDP members will take on 23 May remains to be seen. "Some people will settle old scores with me in the election booth." This will certainly be her last major role on the political stage--a thought that also concerns her. As a young girl, Hildegard Hamm-Bruecher was a good gymnast. She has not forgotten that one is judged not only for the execution of the exercises but also for one's dismount.
