[Yasin] Well, I'm happy about this, when the minister says so, because this will stop any further deterioration of relations between Sudan and Great Britain and everybody knows, you know, the relationship is an old one and is a strong one. We don't want the relationship to be affected by diplomats being expelled here and there. It is a heritage and legacy of long relationship, so I'm really happy that the gist of the minister's speech will curb any further deterioration of relations between my country and the United Kingdom. [Snow] On the other hand, you must be unhappy that it needs the expulsion of yourself and your British counterpart in the first place. [Yasin] Well I'm really sad for being expelled from the United Kingdom because of the retaliation to what has been done by my government, but it is known in international practice in a situation like this, but I thought the British Government would have thought otherwise by substituting Peter Streams with somebody else. [Snow] Let's get to the nub of this, because Peter Streams is accused of basically having hammered the human rights issue, which very many people feel very strongly about. Not just Britain but many other Western nations in particular, have voiced their concerns, and surely that, at the end of it, has made him an unpopular ambassador with you? [Yasin] Well, in fact he was stressing human rights issues, but he was very much exaggerating on issues which were only based on heresay. You know, he doesn't have direct evidence to condemn my government. He was just a good and observant listener of people from the opposition and he was making prejudgments in cases which could not be proved. [Snow] Well, he was hardly a lone voice. The Amnesty International has a list of cases of grave concern in Sudan and of course the civil war itself is thrown up the most awful realities of human rights abuse. [Yasin] Well, I must tell you maybe some people are exceeding the polls here or there but it was under absolute control of my government, and my government has opened the doors and all the avenues for any person from outside to see for himself, and the archbishop has been given the opportunity to see for himself the tolerance and freedom for everybody to worship whatever religion he chooses. The situation in Sudan is, we are not hiding anything. [Snow] Is there now a sense of regret that the Islamic fundamentalism practices that the government indulged in up until the last year or two have perhaps gone too far? [Yasin] Well, I can't see any sort of fundamentalist practices that would be reproached or blamed in Sudan; it is just an allegation. Sudan is living in a very civilized situation now. We are far better than any other country in the continent of Africa or even the Middle East. If you can name any country better than the Sudan now, I will admit to what you have said. [Snow] Ambassador, on that note, thank you very much.
