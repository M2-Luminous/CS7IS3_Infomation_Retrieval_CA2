During his address to the 11th ministerial summit of the NAM, Robaina stressed that an opulent North and an impoverished South is the world's reality today. He added that if we sit on our hands, we are condemned to disappear, which would mean the disappearance of two thirds of mankind. Robaina affirmed that Cuba believes that the best guarantee for a permanent and lasting peace is the elimination of hunger. Only then will human rights bloom for all people rather than for a minuscule portion of mankind. Robaina affirmed that despite the over 30-year-old blockade against Cuba, the Cuban people will overcome this difficult junction, thanks, above all, to the solidarity of the NAM. Robaina continues to fulfill a busy schedule that includes meeting with representatives of Libya, the PRC, Cyprus, Panama, Zambia, Colombia, Italy, and Ecuador.
