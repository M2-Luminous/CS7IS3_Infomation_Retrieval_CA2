Based on this, we asked Ivan Mjartan, Slovak ambassador to the Czech Republic, whether this attitude was still valid after the adoption of the U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace plan by NATO yesterday. [Begin Mjartan recording] [passage omitted] President Kovac wished to indicate that he could see another, more dynamic way of incorporating the Visegrad Four countries into NATO. His idea is based on the fact that incorporating into NATO's political structures will immediately create certain security guarantees and will provide guarantees in the process of creating another sphere of security and cooperation in Europe, in particular in eastern Europe. The NATO summit unanimously approved the U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace proposal yesterday. We emphasized on several occasions -- not only in speeches by the president and the prime minister, and in speeches by our other representatives -- that the Partnership for Peace is an acceptable alternative at this stage for us. We regard it as an intermediate stage which will be followed -- as we expect -- by the adoption of a specific timetable for a further course of action by both the United States and NATO. The outcome of this should be the final and full-fledged membership of these countries in NATO. Given this situation, the Partnership for Peace is in fact the only and acceptable alternative for us.
