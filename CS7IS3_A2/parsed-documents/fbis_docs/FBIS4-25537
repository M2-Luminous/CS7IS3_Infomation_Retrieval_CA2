A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry here said DPRK should learn a due lesson from the resolution and clearing up [as received] all its nuclear suspicions. The IAEA resolution was passed by its Board of Governors in Vienna yesterday by a vote of 28 for, one against and four abstentions. Under the resolution, IAEA would stop its technical assistance to DPRK, which amounts to 500,000-600,000 U.S. dollars a year. In protest DPRK said that its nuclear program is peaceful and there should be "no more inspections" of its nuclear facilities by IAEA. DPRK's envoy Yun Ho-chin told reporters in Vienna after the vote: "The DPRK will no longer guarantee the continuity of safeguards. The two IAEA inspectors still in (DPRK) will have to leave." The envoy stressed at the closed-door meeting at the IAEA Vienna Headquarters that the DPRK seeks a negotiated solution to the crisis. Just before the IAEA passed the resolution, DPRK Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam said in Berlin that his country would take "appropriate measures" if its honor, sovereignty and security were endangered through sanctions. The current sanctions against DPRK was the fourth of its kind imposed by IAEA on its own. South Africa, Iraq and Israel were the preceding countries that IAEA had punished.
