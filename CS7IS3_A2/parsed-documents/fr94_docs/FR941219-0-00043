FR941219-0-00043 FR941219-0-00014 Comment 8: One commenter suggested a mechanism for phased compliance be developed for EPA's water quality standards. Another commenter suggested that the standards be set aside in critically dry years until their exact utility in recovering the delta smelt and the estuary is quantified. Service Response: One of the purposes of designating critical habitat is to identify areas that may be needed for a species' recovery and delisting so that options can be retained for the realization of this goal. The Service recognizes that the degradation of delta smelt critical habitat has occurred over more than a century and that, as a result, it is unreasonable to expect that recovery will be achieved in a relatively short timeframe. Please refer to ``The Effects of Critical Habitat'' section above for a detailed discussion on how the Framework Agreement (1994), the section 7(a)(1) mandate, and CVP water contract renewals will, in essence, allow compliance with EPA's water quality standards to be phased in. However, the Act does not permit the protections provided by critical habitat to be delayed in ways that may result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat, such as what may occur in drier water years. Having threatened status under the Act means that the delta smelt is likely to become endangered within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Designating critical habitat will facilitate the recovery (i.e., delisting) of the delta smelt, rather than allowing the species to continue declining into endangered status. Water quality (salinity) in the Estuary has been identified by the Service as a primary constituent element essential to the conservation of the delta smelt. A significant modification to EPA's water quality standards, or a substantial delay or break in designating critical habitat for the delta smelt, would not only postpone recovery of the species but could adversely impact the species. The delta smelt's pelagic life history, dependence on pelagic microzooplankton, 1-year life span, limited geographic range, and low fecundity make it susceptible to decimation if its reproductive or larval nursery areas are disturbed for more than two years. In formulating the basis for the economic impact analysis, the Service assumed that destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat would not occur in any given water year, provided that Federal and State agencies and other parties comply with flows required in biological opinions interim to the State Board's implementation of water quality standards, and that Federal and State agencies are making satisfactory progress towards implementing recovery plan objectives. Comment 9: Agricultural interests and municipal representatives making comments in the public hearings felt the designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt and EPA's estuarine standards would cause water allocation in California to be inflexible, especially in light of expanding municipal water needs for population growth, natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes and fires) and expanding industry. One commenter was concerned that by designating critical habitat for the delta smelt, construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities would be prevented. Service Response: Designating critical habitat for the delta smelt will not cause water allocation in California to be inflexible. Section 7 of the Act requires Federal agencies to consult on actions that may affect delta smelt to ensure that their actions are not likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat. The Service provides advisory recommendations under section 7 by consulting with other Federal agencies to identify and help resolve conflicts between listed species, their critical habitat, and proposed actions. Management actions designed to provide protection for delta smelt through formal consultation or the section 10 incidental take permit process can be achieved in a variety of ways by considering a range of project alternatives or measures. The consultation and permitting processes are flexible, designed to identify solutions on either a project-by-project or regional basis. A critical habitat designation will not necessarily preclude the construction of new Delta water conveyance facilities. The Service's economic analysis for designating critical habitat assumed that construction of water facilities for future economic growth is more affected by application of the jeopardy standard, rather than critical habitat designation. Nonetheless, these economic assumptions do not constrain the Service's review of future water project proposals. The construction of a new Delta water conveyance facility may or may not jeopardize the continued existence of the delta smelt, and may or may not result in the destruction or adverse modification of its critical habitat, depending on numerous elements, including the facilities' design, location and operations criteria. Comment 10: Several commenters believed that implementation of EPA's water quality standards will only remedy one factor contributing to the delta smelt's decline. Commenters suggested that over-fishing, habitat modification, and the introduction of toxics and heavy metals to the Estuary have contributed to the decline of the delta smelt. Numerous respondents stated that introduced species in the Delta, such as the yellowfin goby ( Acanthogobius flavimanus ), striped bass and inland silversides are the real cause of the delta smelt's decline. Special concern was expressed over the effects that two species of exotic zooplankton and a species of the exotic Asian clam, ( Potamocorbula amurensis ) had on the Estuary ecosystem. Service Response: Regardless of other related effects, the best available information indicates that diminished water quality and quantity are major factors contributing to the decline of the delta smelt. EPA's water quality (salinity) standards will contribute to the recovery of the delta smelt. Under the Act, the Service may list species and designate critical habitat even though the interaction of many causes of the species' decline masks the relative contribution of any single factor. Critical habitat preserves options for a species' recovery. As such, designation of critical habitat preserves habitat conditions within which implementation of recovery actions can occur. As stated in the final rule to list the delta smelt, continuing studies may shed light on the causes of decline, and lead to recovery or management actions that may be of benefit to the species. Comment 11: One commenter was concerned that water users could comply with EPA's water quality standards early in the February-June compliance period, hence adequate salinity would not be provided in later months if the delta smelt were to spawn late in June or early July. The same commenter suggested that a year-round standard might be a better and more reasonable approach. Service Response: The Service generally agrees with this comment and recognized in the revised proposed rule that delta smelt may spawn as late as July. Providing water quality (salinity) to conserve the delta smelt and its critical habitat is not limited to a defined time period as EPA's standards are to the February through June period. As the ``Primary Constituent Elements'' section outlines, critical habitat for the delta smelt will be focused on the habitat needs of a particular life stage that may be affected by a project. Additional flows may be required after the February through June period to protect delta smelt present in the south and central Delta from being entrained in the State and Federal projects, and to avoid jeopardy to the species. Biological Issues Comment 12: One commenter suggested that the importance of habitat in Grizzly Bay and lower Suisun Bay should be weighted since the bays are a relatively large area of high quality habitat upon which some species rely heavily.
