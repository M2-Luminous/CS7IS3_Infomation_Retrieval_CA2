Wen Jiabao said: In 1993, we focused attention on fulfilling three tasks for peasants and achieved comparatively marked success. First, we lightened peasants' burden. Second, no more IOU's were issued for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products. Third, to a certain extent, we put an end to letting land in rural areas lay uncultivated and to the exodus of rural areas' funds and personnel to other localities through macroeconomic regulation and control. The three tasks brought about a fundamental change in the situation of our having once attached little importance to the agricultural sector. Meanwhile, they showed that we can succeed in doing something for the agricultural sector so long as we have the determination. Touching on the problems confronting the agricultural sector this year, Wen Jiabao said: This year, as far as the nation is concerned, the three most important tasks concerning the agricultural sector and rural areas are as follows: First, we must maintain a steady increase in the production of such main agricultural and sideline products as grain, cotton, and cooking oil; and we must do a good job of carrying out the vegetable basket project so as to guarantee the supply of grain, cotton, cooking oil, and other agricultural and sideline products and to guarantee a stable market. Second, we must continue to increase peasants' income. Third, we must maintain social stability in rural areas. So far as Anhui is concerned, it must bear in mind these three tasks and focus attention on fulfilling the following tasks: First, it must maintain a steady increase in the production of grain and cotton. Last year, Anhui increased grain output by a comparatively big margin and its peasants increased income comparatively quickly. This represented a comparatively outstanding success among those scored by the provinces and municipality in southern China and by all other areas across the country; this also showed that the Anhui party committee and government had attached great importance to the role played by agriculture as the national economy's foundation. Second, Anhui must increase peasants' incomes and continue to make efforts to improve their living standards. Efforts must be made to develop a highly efficient type of farming that provides greater and better yields through restructuring, to exploit various resources, to develop primary and secondary industries, and to develop village and town enterprises. Anhui must take comprehensive measures to increase peasants' incomes. Third, Anhui must step up efforts to carry out infrastructure construction for water conservancy works so as to enhance the agricultural sector's comprehensive capabilities of production and resistance against natural disasters. This task is of extremely great importance to Anhui. This year, it is still necessary for Anhui to continue to pay close attention to carrying out the harnessing of the Huai He in accordance with the central authorities' plan. Fourth, Anhui must strengthen leadership over agricultural and rural work and further bring into play the peasants' initiative. Anhui carried out rural reform ahead of all other provinces in China. It may be said that rural reform is a successful practice for the establishment of a socialist market economic system and has important [words indistinct] significance for us to reform the whole economic structure. It is hoped that Anhui will continue to give full play to its own strong points and will properly protect, guide, and bring into full play the initiative of peasants through deepening reform. Finally, Wen Jiabao said: The central authorities recently drew up a series of policies and measures to improve the agricultural sector. What counts is our paying close attention to their implementation.
