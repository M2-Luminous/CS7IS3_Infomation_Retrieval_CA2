Only this will open up prospects for breaking the international isolation of Baghdad. The statement was made at a Tuesday briefing in Moscow by the official spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry Grigoriy Karasin. According to him, Moscow has taken notice of the report of the UN Security Council Commission for the Disarmament of Iraq saying that the destruction of the Iraqi arsenal of chemical weapons is entering the final stage. The Commission Chairman Ralph Ekeus said that by now the bulk of chemical weapons has been scrapped and the necessary barriers have been built for the prevention of their production in the future. "On the whole, this can be considered as additional confirmation of Baghdad's readiness to cooperate with the United Nations in implementing Security Council resolutions on the Persian Gulf. Such changes in the Iraqi approach should be encouraged. The call was made by the Russian ambassador to the United Nations during a recent Security Council debate on anti-Iraqi sanctions," Karasin said. In his opinion, to prevent the possibility of the reconstruction of the Iraqi military potential, the mechanism of long-term monitoring should be launched as soon as possible and a trial period declared to check its efficiency.
