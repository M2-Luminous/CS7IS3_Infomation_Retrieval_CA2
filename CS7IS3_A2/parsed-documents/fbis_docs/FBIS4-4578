"We are going to adminster this town, not just militarily to prevent the return of the Khmer Rouge, but to develop it as well," Hun Sen told AFP. He did not mention whether the government would begin mining the northwestern Cambodian town's rich seams of rubies and sapphires, which earned the Khmer Rouge an estimated one million dollars per month in revenues to finance their guerrilla war. "This town will be an agricultural development and industrial zone because the natural resources in this zone can support such small factories as sugar cane processing," he said. The Cambodian government has said previously that it would honor contracts between the Khmer Rouge and Thai mining and logging companies, which are located just over the Thai border. Cambodian troops seized trucks, bulldozers and rock-sorting equipment owned by the Thai contractors when they captured Pailin, and diplomats here say the Cambodians are taking their time "cataloguing" their finds. Cambodia's deputy interior ministers, Im Chhunlim and Khan Savoeun, have been given the task of setting up a development plan and appointing a governor to run the Pailin area as a special administrative region. Hun Sen said he envisaged tourist groups traveling to the area "in a few years, when the security is improved and when malaria can be controlled." It was not clear when Pailin's development would begin, when civilians would be allowed to settle there, or when the governor would be appointed. Khan Savoeun was the commander of a regiment of formerly royalist guerrillas who had been allied with the Khmer Rouge but are now part of the coalition government fighting the Khmer Rouge. He is viewed as having previously maintained the closest of relations with his former allies, but never actually joined the Khmer Rouge hierarchy. Khan Savoeun's troops in the battle-scarred district of Stoung in central Kompong Thom province were reported by UN peacekeepers to have aided the Khmer Rouge in breaking the ceasefire well after the signing of the Paris peace accords formally ended the civil war in 1991. He became deputy interior and public security minister following the UN-run elections in May 1993 as part of a power-sharing arrangement between the monarchists, led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and the former communists headed by Hun Sen. The two share the prime minister's portfolio. Im Chhunlim is a member of Hun Sen's party.
