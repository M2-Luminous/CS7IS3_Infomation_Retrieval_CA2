FBIS3-18596 "drweu044__a94011" FBIS-WEU-94-044-A Document Type:Daily Report 7 March 1994 ANNEX Germany Government Reportedly Knew About Libyan Plant Since 1989 AU0403145294 Hamburg DPA in German 1310 GMT 4 Mar 94--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY AU0403145294 Hamburg DPA Language: German Article Type:BFN [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- After contradictory reports on the alleged involvement of German companies in the construction of a poison gas factory in Libya, doubts have been voiced about the Federal Government's information policy. On Deutschlandfunk radio, Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] security expert Norbert Gansel said on Friday [4 March] that the Federal Government held back information on German assistance for the construction of a new poison gas plant in the city of Tarhuna, some 60 km outside Tripoli. Gansel described the government's information as contradictory and as playing down the matter. Bernd Schmidbauer, of the Christian Democratic Union [CDU], the responsible official in the Chancellor's Office for the coordination of the intelligence services, said last night on ZDF's [Second German Television Channel] "Heute Journal" program, that since the summer of 1992, the Federal Government has "not just had vague indications, but very specific indications" that a subterranean facility was being built in a dry valley in Tarhuna. Various German companies had been warned beforehand. The parliamentary state secretary in the Economics Ministry, Reinhard Goehner (CDU), during question hour in Parliament, initially only spoke of "vague indications" that the government has had for about 1.5 years. Schmidbauer, however, said that the plant was discovered and "uncovered" in the summer of 1992. All "necessary steps" were initiated in international cooperation to warn all "relevant companies," the state minister stressed. There is "not a single clue pointing to a German company that is furnishing this facility," but information shows that the material that was used for the construction of the tunnel is machinery that is available anywhere in the world and "could also come from Germany." Schmidbauer said that, for the first time, it was then possible to identify the project before its completion. On Friday, Schmidbauer rejected Gansel's accusations that the Federal Government did not tell Parliament the whole truth about the "Tarhuna project." Herbert Schaefer, the author of the report broadcast by ZDF, told DPA that Schmidbauer did "not tell the truth" as far as the time at which the government found out about the construction of the tunnel. The Federal Government has known about the tunnel project and the probable involvement of German companies since January 1989. In February 1991, even more concrete indications about the tunnel project became available. The Federal Export Office at Eschborn near Frankfurt was "muzzled" by Bonn in 1991. Officials there were not permitted to repeat in front of the camera what they had said before, the author stated. On Friday, the Federal Office said that the export to Libya of tunnel drilling machines, tools, and equipment needed for the construction of a tunnel have been banned since 7 April 1993. A German company made headlines in the past in connection with the construction of a poison gas plant in Libya. The Imhausen-Chemie company of Lahr designed and constructed a poison-gas plant worth 255 million German marks in the Libyan city of Al-Rabitah. Under an identical name -- "Pharma 150" -- a multipurpose chemical plant was built in Hong Kong, which served as a camouflage address for the plans and goods that were in reality shipped to Libya. The Salzgitter Industriebau GmbH, which belongs to the then government-owned Salzgitter group, had taken over the planning of all details and all engineering work for the buildings of the project.
