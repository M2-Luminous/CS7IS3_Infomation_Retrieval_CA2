Is it correct to say that over the past few weeks, people have stopped talking about the reversible nature of the agreement? [Beilin] By its very nature, this is an interim and reversible agreement. Naturally, we all hope it will not be necessary to reverse it, because it is clear that even if this is theoretically possible, it will be extremely difficult in practice to come out and say now -- after all that has transpired -- that we are revoking the agreement. I believe it will be possible to do so only if extremely grave, intolerable incidents occur. As is the case with any other agreement, our working assumption is that both sides will abide by the agreement. It is obvious -- even if not always explicitly written down -- that if one side violates the agreement, the other side is no longer bound by it. Any agreement of this nature is reversible, but the sides always hope it will not be necessary to revoke it. [Friedman] What if the worst-case scenario happens? Will the wd?nd we have enough leverage to do what we consider necessary. [Friedman] What is the difference between the situation that will unfold in the territories as of noon tomorrow and between future Palestinian sovereignty over all the territories? [Beilin] The difference is in terms of foreign affairs and defense. Just like most autonomies in the world, in this case, too, there is independence, excluding the two key elements of foreign affairs and defense. This is more or less what we gave the Palestinians, which is the nature of autonomy. [Friedman] Where will it lead eventually? Do you see an inevitable historical process toward a Palestinian state? [Beilin] I do not believe in historical determinism. I completely reject the thesis that there is an inevitable process leading to a state. A Palestinian state will be established only if the Palestinians demand this and there is an Israeli Government ready to accept this demand. So far, no Israeli Government has accepted such a demand. If you want my opinion, I believe that eventually a Jordanian-Palestinian confederation will be established, because most of the sides involved prefer this solution or are at least ready to accept such a solution. This will be the common denominator among all the sides. [Friedman] Let me phrase the question differently: Would you agree to be a member of a government that is ready to grant the Palestinians an independent state? [Beilin] Look, I must tell you that I do not consider a Palestinian state -- which my party and the government of which it is the main constituent opposes -- to be a national disaster. At the same time, I have always preferred the confederation model. If I had to choose between the two options, I would always prefer the confederation solution.
