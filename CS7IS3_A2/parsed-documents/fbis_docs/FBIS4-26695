Tai] [Text] Taipei, June 7 (CNA) -- Taiwan's first-ever foreign exchange [Forex] brokerage is expected to open in early July as part of the government's efforts to build Taipei into a regional funding center, the Central Bank of China (CBC) said Tuesday. CBC officials said the "Taipei Forex Inc." will begin providing broking services in foreign exchange trading and foreign currency financing after obtaining a business license from the Ministry of Finance. Preparations for the brokerage's operations have been completed, they said, adding that the Central Bank gave the green light to the company's establishment last September. The brokerage, formed by 21 domestic banks, three foreign banks, and three international money brokers, was established in line with the "guidelines for approval of foreign exchange brokers" promulgated last August. Domestic banks with a stake in the firm include the International Commercial Bank of China, the United World Chinese Commercial Bank, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Chinatrust Commercial Bank, while the three foreign banks are the Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, the Bank of Tokyo, and the American Express Bank. The three international money brokerage houses are A&P of Britain, the Amsterdam-based Harlow Butler, and the New York-based Yagi-Euro. The foreign exchange brokerage is a new step in the government's financial liberalization strategy, which aims to develop Taipei into an Asia-Pacific funding center and eventually a regional financial hub, the officials pointed out. The firm will have a paid-in capital of NT [New Taiwan] $199.50 million (US$7.36 million), they added. The officials pledged that the Central Bank will take the initiative to forge stronger ties with financial institutions in Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan, and other Asia-Pacific countries to help expand the Taipei foreign exchange market. Daily transactions on the Taipei market ranged between US$100 million and US$200 million, while those in Japan, the United States, and Germany amounted to tens of billions. Meanwhile, domestic gold traders led by the state-run Central Trust of China (CTC) have decided to apply to the Ministry of Finance for approval on 24-hour gold trading. Chang Cheng, director of the CTC Trade Department, said that if all goes well, 24-hour gold trading could begin sometime in the next six months. Gold dealers could focus trading in Hong Kong and Singapore from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., then transfer trading to European markets from 3 p.m. to 12 p.m., and finally deal in New York trading until 3 a.m. the next day, Chang said. The 24-hour trading will provide both domestic and overseas gold investors with greater access to the global gold market, he stressed.
