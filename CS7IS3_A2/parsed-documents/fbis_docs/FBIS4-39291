To quote Soskovets, Russia was ready to increase coal supplies to South Korea from 400,000 to 1.5-2 million tonnes. Moscow, he said, was willing to form a joint venture with South Korea in the Neryungri coal field in Yakutia and grant the Korean side the right of ownership of a section of that deposit. Soskovets said South Korea was making "only negligible" investments in Russian industry (a mere 27 million US dollars last year). Soskovets stressed that Russia was a dependable partner and Korean private companies which invested in Russian industry would receive dividends.
