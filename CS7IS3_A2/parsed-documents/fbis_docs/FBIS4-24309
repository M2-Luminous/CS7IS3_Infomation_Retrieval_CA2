Appearing before Parliament's joint standing committee on finance, Louw confessed to being nervous, acknowledging that some of the committee's members had been "intelligence targets" not too long ago. One of the new parliamentarians, former trade unionist and ANC MP Phillip Dexter, asked whether "greater transparency" was not needed to reduce hostility to NIS because then "many of us wouldn't be so hostile to the idea of you getting any money at all." Louw said: "I suppose that many of the people in this room have been intelligence targets of our organisation in the past." But he recalled sitting in Parliament listening to an attack on the intelligence services by the leader of the opposition, who said NIS was spying on his party which was law abiding and had nothing to be ashamed of. Just a few weeks later it became known that members of that party had planted bombs. It was wrong to think that there was no longer any political threat to the country. The right wing was "vociferous" and, although it seemed to be "a bit downtrodden and shocked by the election results," there were indications that it was regrouping. On the left of the political spectrum, many had great expectations and what their reaction would be when these expectations were not met was uncertain. Louw said the number of foreign missions had grown by 160 percent since 1990 and foreign intelligence personnel had increased 182 percent. The CIA had indicated it intended closing 13 of its missions in Africa. "I can only surmise that those 13 missions will be run from SA. I have very little doubt about that. It is just another thing to take cognisance of." He said no decision had been taken on how NIS, the intelligence arms of the liberation movements and those of the former homelands, might be integrated. A special Cabinet committee was currently considering the matter. Louw also said organised crime was increasingly the terrain of intelligence services because of the link between crime, terrorism and drugs. Asked about the future of NIS, he said the organisation had tried for many years to recruit people from communities other than the Afrikaaner community with very little success. Despite a drive to recruit from many universities, including black campuses, NIS had found that many people did not want to join "simply because of the bad image we had as an instrument of state." Rather than looking at NIS's past activities, the focus should be on the future and the need to ensure a "common intelligence" in a country which could look forward to an intelligence service "at peace with itself."
