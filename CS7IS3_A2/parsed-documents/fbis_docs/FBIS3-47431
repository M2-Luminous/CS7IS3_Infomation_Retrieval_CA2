The 170-man unit was to leave for Somalia to join the 80-member advance team that left last month. The replacements will take over duties from the first unit, dispatched last summer as Korea's first participation in a U.N. Peacekeeping Operation. The Army Engineering Unit is mainly in charge of road repairs and construction.
