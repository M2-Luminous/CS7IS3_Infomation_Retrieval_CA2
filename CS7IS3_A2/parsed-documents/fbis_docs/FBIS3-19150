Mining Counselor [honorary title] Krister Ahlstroem, the chairman of the Confederation of Finnish Industry and Employers, told Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who visited the Confederation, that the industry is especially hoping for counterguarantees to be arranged. Ahlstroem also raised the Finnish companies' 6 billion Finnish markkas of receivables from Russia. According to Erik Forsman, the press director of the Confederation, the Russian prime minister did not promise a quick solution to the debt problems. [Begin Forsman recording] Chernomyrdin's general assessment was that the debt looks a lot bigger from the Finnish side than from the point of view of Russia, when they are looking at Finland -- your 6 billion is not such a big matter -- but when you look at it from our point of view, it is a big matter. [end recording] Chernomyrdin, who this morning arrived as a guest of Prime Minister Esko Aho, has in addition to meetings with industrialists had lunch with President Ahtisaari.
