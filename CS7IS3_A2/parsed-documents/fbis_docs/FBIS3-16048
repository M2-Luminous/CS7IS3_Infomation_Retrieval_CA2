Geydar Aliyev said he is ready to consider the status of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh if only the Karabakh troops leave for their territory. Thus, the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized a conflict side, though Azerbaijan was always avoiding doing it. But, according to Mamikonyan, the Aliyev's declaration gives no mechanism of conflict regulation. Mr. Mamikonyan also confirmed Karabakh for numerous times declared he has a claim on the lands of Azeris and is ready to set them free as soon as the problem of Nagorno-Karabakh security is solved.
