Will the ministry remain a ministry? This question troubled all who found themselves in the zone of ``combat activities'' between the RAN [Russian Academy of Sciences] Presidium and the leadership of the Minnauka. Military terminology is certainly apropos in this situation--what other than a retaliatory blow can we call the December resolution of the RAN Presidium expressing the desire to lower the status of the Minnauka to a state committee? This was a response to the government's desire to cut the funding of the RAN. It was at the Minnauka, as the structure that would implement this policy, that the Presidium vented its wrath. Each of the opposing sides has its own interests, which they feel agree with state interests. And each could quite soundly prove its righteousness. RAN leaders believe that all functions of fundamental sciences in the academy must be preserved. But the opinion of the government is that the state budget is unable to maintain the RAN in the form in which it now exists, and that priorities have to be chosen. This is what is at the root of the conflict. But as we can see, the forms of the struggle are arbitrary. The ministry has remained a ministry. More than that, the RF Committee on Information was placed within its structure by an edict signed by President B. Yeltsin. The above-cited resolution of the RAN Presidium evoked differing assessments from the academic milieu. Some institute directors supported it completely: A letter to President B. Yeltsin written on the instructions of the Conference of Directors of Academy Institutions of the Moscow Region is published on this page. Extracts from letters from other Moscow directors expressing disagreement with some provisions of the resolution, particularly regarding the Minnauka, are presented here as well. Academicians of the Siberian Department of the RAN also expressed trust in the ministry. We decided to acquaint you with these letters, because they reflect not only the concrete situation but also a vision of how science is to live in the future. Priority to the Priorities A group of directors of the largest institutes wrote a letter to Russian Federation President B. Yeltsin in connection with adoption of a resolution by the RAN Presidium on 14 December 1993 on financing the RAN and on matters relating to administration of science. The letter's authors agree with the provision of the resolution noting the insufficiency of basic financing of scientific institutes both in and outside the RAN system. However, they believe the resolution errs when it suggests reorganizing the RF Ministry of Science and Technology Policy as the RF State Committee for Science and Technology, and focusing its activity on the problems of organizing, shaping, and monitoring fulfillment of scientific and technical programs. In the opinion of the undersigned, institutes engaging in fundamental science must receive basic financing at least at the minimum level in order to preserve scientific potential, but under the conditions of the difficult economic situation, priority should be given to the principle of competitive financing of science. In the last two years the RF Ministry of Science and Technology Policy began implementing this principle systematically, and it enjoyed certain success on this path: Scientific collectives that achieve the greatest successes and possess the best foundation for research in the most promising direction receive priority financing through the Minnauka. The authors of the letter feel this policy of the Minnauka to be correct in principle, and they support it. The departmental principle of financing science proposed by the RAN Presidium, according to which money is distributed among the institutes by departmental leadership (in the Academy of Sciences by the RAN Presidium) is deleterious to science--it will result in the uniform impoverishment and demise of all science in Russia. Therefore in the opinion of the letter's authors the suggestion by the RAN Presidium to fundamentally reorganize the Minnauka and sharply reduce the competitive principle will lead us on the wrong path, and is totally unacceptable. The letter was signed by RAN Academician S. Belyayev, director of the Institute of General and Nuclear Physics of the Russian Kurchatovskiy Institute Scientific Center; RAN Academician L. Keldysh, director of the Physics Institutes of the Academy of Sciences imeni P. Lebedev; Professor A. Simonov, director of the Scientific Research Physicochemical Institute imeni L. Karpov; and others, nine persons in all. What's the Use of Recommendations? A message from Siberian scientists to Prime Minister V. Chernomyrdin signed by academicians V. Koptyug, D. Knorre, D. Derevyanko, A. Skrinskiy, V. Titov and V. Shumnyy, and RAN corresponding members K. Svitashev, Yu. Shokin and V. Kuleshov notes that far from all activity of the Minnauka has been supported by the scientific community. But they feel that ``elimination of a government body at the highest level responsible for `meshing together' the efforts of scientific collectives of different departments and integrating them in the solution of the most important problems of science and applied science threatens destruction of state scientific and technical policy. And this harbors very grave losses for the country. Replacement of a responsible government body by an advisory one will not save the situation under today's conditions. The unity of state scientific and technical policy would be lost.'' Are These the Forms the Reform is Supposed to Take? Now that hopeful signs of political stabilization have appeared following adoption of the new Constitution and election of the Federal Assembly, and sensible correction of the course of the reforms currently under way is planned, we, the scientists of Russia, find it necessary to state our position regarding processes occurring in Russia and in Russian science, without the apprehension that our opinion might be used to incite passions and disturb equilibrium in the society. The Russian intelligentsia was one of the main driving forces of the reforms and democratic transformations. It was among the first to understand the deleteriousness of the economy's extensive development in the former USSR, having indicated the existence of a direct correlation between quality of life and the need for converting the economy to new technologies created by science. The turn in socio-economic relations to the freedom of creativity, to the freedom of entrepreneurship for the good of Russians is the strategic direction of the reforms that attracted the scientific and technical intelligentsia. But the real results of the reforms are far from what was anticipated. A great country has been transformed before our eyes into a helpless organism. Scientific discoveries and new technologies that even before were introduced into production with difficulty are now simply unwanted. How can we discuss application of new technologies when vitally important enterprises are being shut down, and industrial investments are becoming purely symbolic? Financing of Russian science has diminished to dangerous levels. The especially grave consequences of this manifested themselves in fundamental research. Its situation is presently deteriorating from critical to catastrophic. Scientific observations providing for prompt notification regarding natural disasters (tsunamis and earthquakes for example) are coming to a halt, the work of world-renowned scientific centers is being terminated, and research on the most important state programs is being abandoned. Scientists are being forced to leave the institutes that have been their homes, and go abroad or join commercial organizations in search of a better share. Young replacements are not going into science. Scientific conferences, materials and reagents, scientific literature, and experimental devices have become luxuries beyond reach. Science is an integrated living organism, and it does not tolerate interruptions in its growth and development. Any delay in this development may cause Russia to fall many decades and generations behind the world cultural and technological level, and the country to fall back to secondary scientific positions. It has long been established that world science is indivisible. Russian science is a recognized component of it. The demise of Russian science cannot but have consequences, and it will be detrimental to all world science. This understanding of the role of Russian science is precisely one of the main motivating factors behind the assistance being provided to it from without. However, no assistance can replace providing for the normal vital activities of science. Only the state can accomplish this task. While we are totally grateful to those who are sincerely helping Russian science in its hour of need, we cannot ignore the fact that Russia is sending abroad, in mass numbers and free of charge, highly qualified scientists and specialists whose selection and training require a great deal of time and significant outlays. The losses to the CIS countries by the end of the 1990's from intellectual emigration, calculated by United Nations procedures, will be tens of millions of dollars annually. Basic state budget financing of fundamental research, scientific schools, and the principle of accessibility of the sphere of science to every citizen of the country, regardless of class membership, are the principal mechanisms by which vital and creative energy flows into Russian science. These mechanisms were developed over the course of centuries, and they have demonstrated their practical effectiveness. Now they are being destroyed. Appropriation of budgetary assets to science by the state is one of the forms of long-range investment. Investing assets into science is economically advantageous, and it is a practice followed by all developed countries. Even in the extremely difficult years of the Great Patriotic War and postwar devastation, the country found the possibility to provide real support to its science, and use the results of scientific research and development for constructive purposes. Today, however, a strange kind of deformation has occurred in the society's perception of science and of the labor of scientists. The authority of academy science has been undermined, and its importance to the life of the country is being glossed over. Despite the edicts of the Russian president ``On Creation of the Russian Academy of Sciences'' and ``On Material Support to Russian Scientists,'' which raised the hopes of the scientific community, economization of budgetary expenditures on fundamental research continues. Can we really have any serious hope of rectifying the state of affairs with the state budget by reducing and postponing essentially negligible payments to science? It doesn't take more than 0.5 percent of the country's budget to support the entire Russian Academy of Sciences for a single year, after all, at the same time that when practical use is made of the results of scientific developments, they return hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of rubles. There is one other subject about which we are deeply concerned: the appearance of information in the mass media on plans for restructuring science that would jeopardize the very existence of the RAN. Democratic transformations must not lead to the destruction of the Russian scientific school, the traditions of which ascend from the era of Peter the Great. The path to normalization of relations between government and science lies through recognition of their interdependence. Russian science will perish without government support, but after that, not only rebirth of a democratic Russian state but even its survival in the modern science-intensive world will be impossible. We believe that the existing creative potential of Russian scientists must be mobilized to lead the country out of its crisis. We will support reforms directed at improving the living conditions of the majority of Russians, and at freedom of the creativity of the individual, at the flourishing of science, and at modernization of production on the basis of modern high technology and honest entrepreneurship for the good of every inhabitant of Russia. Scientists are ready to take part in developing the course and program of the reforms, and in implementing them. We can make a contribution to the Russian economy's rebirth. We have created materials with unique properties, developed energy and resource conserving procedures, new information technologies, bioengineering, the means of protecting and restoring the environment, of conserving and making sensible use of biological resources, and of obtaining energy, new medical preparations and medical equipment, and many other things. Finding themselves together with most Russians in a difficult material position, Russian scientists are not fighting for outlandish wages, although in civilized countries the status of the scientist presupposes a worthy material reward. Russian scientists demand just one thing today--the possibility for working productively in their country, and in their professional sphere--science. It stands to reason that we clearly recognize the need for improving the forms of work of both Russian science as a whole and of its nucleus--the Russian Academy of Sciences. But we, the scientists, must do this ourselves, and in such a way as to preserve the best historically evolved traits of Russian science as a phenomenon of worldwide cultural importance. Believing the issues discussed here to be exceptionally important to development of the positive directions of transformations in Russia, we appeal to you to meet personally with the leading Russian scientists at the soonest possible moment convenient to you. In behalf and on the instruction of directors of academy institutes of the Moscow Region: RAN Academician Yu. Gulyayev, Academician G. Arbatov, Academician Yu. Zolotov, Academician N. Lyakishev, Corresponding Member Yu. Altukhov.
