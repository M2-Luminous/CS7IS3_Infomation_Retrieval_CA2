At a meeting, not included on the agenda of a visit of the Polish minister, the Polish delegation again stressed the need to eliminate the so-called "grey spheres" of influence in Europe. In the interest of the lasting peace on the continent, the West should cover the region of Central and Eastern Europe with a "political screen," the Polish delegation claimed. Earlier in the day, the Polish minister-led delegation met with Senate speaker Romeo Leblanc to discuss some European political issues, including the developments in the east of the continent. The politicians stressed the importance of friendly relations between Poland and Canada. Leblanc said he is satisfied with the signing of a package of military cooperation agreements between the two countries. Later in the day, Kolodziejdzyk took part in the wreath-laying ceremony at the monument to the Canadian soldiers killed during the two world wars and then went to the Polish house in Ottawa to decorate twelve war veterans with the military crosses. Kolodziejdzyk invited David Collenette to pay a visit to Poland. Minister Kolodziejdzyk in expected to hold a news conference on the results of his North American visit on Thursday.
