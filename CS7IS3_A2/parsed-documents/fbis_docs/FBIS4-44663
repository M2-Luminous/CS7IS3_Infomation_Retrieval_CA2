One is in Germany (a cooperative effort by the DLR, the CNES [National Center for Space Studies], DASA [Deutsche Aerospace], and the SEP [European Propulsion Company]) and the other is at the ONERA [National Office for Aerospace Studies and Research]. Using liquid hydrogen as a fuel leads to better performance in terms of specific impulse, and that finding is now being put to use in the engines of space launchers to obtain what are called cryogenic engines. The SEP tackled cryogenics in the 1970's when it was developing the engine for Ariane IV (the HM7B). Today it is working with DASA to develop Vulcain, the cryogenic main engine in Ariane V, which is scheduled to fly in 1995 (100 bar of pressure and 100 tonnes of thrust). Development of those two engines could not be based on a thorough knowledge of the physico-chemical combustion process. A very definite effort is still needed to become familiar with the process and decide how to respond to any possible difficulties (for example, the failure of the V15 and V18 due to an ignition problem). The stakes are considerable: it is a matter of reliability. Two test benches known as P8 and Mascotte are currently being set up. They are essential tools that will soon strengthen the research efforts that have been underway since 1988 as part of a Coordinated Research Program involving the CNES, the CNRS [National Scientific Research Center], and the SEP (the ONERA being part of the scientific council). P8 is being set up in Germany and should be operational by the spring of 1995. The civil engineering portion of that project by the DLR (50 percent), the CNES (30 percent), DASA (10 percent), and the SEP (10 percent) has been completed, and construction of the actual test bench is just beginning. A dual-purpose bench, it will be used both for technological development (80 percent) and for basic research (20 percent). Talks are underway to set up a French-German research program for use of the bench. With a chamber pressure of 250 bar, P8 will have a flow capacity of 8 kg/s of liquid oxygen and 1.5 kg/s of liquid hydrogen. For its part, Mascotte (Simplified Autonomous Assembly for Cryogenic Combustion in Oxygen and Any Experimental Technology) is being set up in Palaiseau. Its first research season should take place during this first quarter of 1994. This test bench, which is partly covered for security reasons, is a self-financed investment by the ONERA. Operating at a much lower cost, it is intended for qualitative qualification, the refinement of less expensive technologies, and the development of materials and technology. P8 will very certainly use what is developed by Mascotte and be used for quantitative qualification. ONERA, CNES, SEP, and CNRS are currently finalizing an agreement to establish a research group for the use of Mascotte. It will be a Franco-French structure, but its development into a French-German structure is not out of the question. Mascotte will produce a flow of up to 100 g/s of liquid oxygen (stored at ambient temperature, 300 K) at a pressure limited to 10 bar because of the liquid oxygen reserve (stored at from 90 to 110 K). Changes are planned to allow experiments at higher pressures (100 bar is conceivable). The first test assemblies have been completed, and experiments with oxygen injection have been conducted. Experiments with actual combustion cannot be far behind. One major problem to be dealt with is the injector. It must manage the transformation of the fluid into a spray in such a way as to increase surface area while preventing surface instabilities.
