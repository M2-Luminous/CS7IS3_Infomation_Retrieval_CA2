Hideaki Kumano, vice minister for administrative affairs at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), also said the yen's advance will have a negative impact on both the Japanese and global economies. The Japanese currency has steadily gained ground in recent sessions on speculation that Washington may talk up the yen to extract further concessions from Japan on stalled bilateral trade talks.
