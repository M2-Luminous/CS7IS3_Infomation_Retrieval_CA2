The Kashmiri leaders, who had come to the Indian capital to apprise the U.S. deputy secretary of state and members of his delegation about the ground realities in occupied Kashmir, rejected India's claim that the deferment of the resolution on Kashmir at the human rights conference in Geneva was a severe jolt to the Kashmiri movement. In an interview, the Hurriyat leaders Professor Abdul Ghani, Justice retired Mufti Bahuddin Farooqi, Mr. G.M. Bhatt, Maulavi Abbas Ansari, and Mr. G.N. Shahin said top priority for the Kashmiri people is to get rid of the yoke of Indian slavery.

The Hurriyat leaders praised Ms. Benazir Bhutto's government for its stand on Kashmir and hoped Pakistan would continue its diplomatic, political, and moral support to the Kashmiri people.
