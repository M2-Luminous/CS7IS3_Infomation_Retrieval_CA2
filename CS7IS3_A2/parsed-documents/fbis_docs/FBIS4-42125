Papoulias made the above announcement following a meeting with Mikhailidhis in Athens today. During the meeting the two ministers exchanged views on developments in the Cyprus issue following the delay in the submission of the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council. Replying to a question on the issue of the pan-national conference, the Greek foreign minister said that he discussed the issue with Mikhailidhis and added that the conference will take place at a time when it will be productive. He said he thinks that the situation that will result from the submission of the UN secretary general's report will make it imperative to hold such a meeting. Responding to a question about the possibility of the National Council going to Athens, Mikhailidhis said that he and Papoulias exchanged views on this issue and that it is just a matter of setting a date. Both Papoulias and Mikhailidhis expressed the view that the delay in the submission of the Butrus-Ghali report causes concern and shakes the credibility of the process for solving the Cyprus issue. Papoulias also said that it is very important for the UN secretary general's report to reflect the actual developments. Asked about Cyprus' application to join the European Union [EU], Papoulias said that during the EU Summit in Corfu the Greek presidency will propose beginning official accession talks. The Greek foreign minister said that he is certain that there will be steps toward that direction.
