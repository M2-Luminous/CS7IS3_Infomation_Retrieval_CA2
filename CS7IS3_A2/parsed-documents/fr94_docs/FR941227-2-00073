Cite GSA as the office to be invoiced for payment. e. During the initial phase of this changeover to a single payment office, contracting officers may receive inquiries from agencies and schedule contractors regarding the billing AAC and Fund code. The six-digit AAC is a code assigned to an agency in order to establish an account with GSA. The AAC identifies the agency to GSA. Agencies may obtain AAC numbers by writing to: GSA/FSS, Inventory and Requisition Management Division (FCSI), Washington, DC 20406, or calling (703) 305&hyph;6978. Fund codes are not assigned by GSA but by each individual agency. f. In addition to submitting purchase/delivery orders directly to the contractor via hard copy or EDI, agencies may also obtain schedule items by placing requisitions through MUFFIN (Multi-Use File for Inter-Agency News), or normal FEDSTRIP/MILSTRIP ordering procedures. g. Agencies shall forward an original and one copy of paper purchase/delivery orders to schedule contractors. Any oral order placed against a schedule contract must be confirmed with either an electronic (EDI) or hard copy purchase/delivery order. h. The Office of Finance, Kansas City, will be the payment office for all schedule invoices. For paper invoices containing prompt payment discount terms, the address is: General Services Administration, PO Box 419399, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6399. All other paper invoices should be sent to General Services Administration, PO Box 419029, Kansas City, MO 64141&hyph;6029. Initial invoices for each purchase/delivery order must be accompanied with a copy of the customer paper or EDI order. Contractor EDI submissions of order data and invoices must be in accordance with Federal implementation conventions for EDI. i. As is the current practice, ordering activities will resolve any discrepancies concerning purchase/delivery orders and/or items delivered against such orders directly with the schedule contractors. The GSA contracting officer may need to intervene in order to settle unresolved issues between an ordering activity, a contractor and/or the Office of Finance. Any setoffs for collection of monies owed the Government must be handled in accordance with FAR Subpart 32.6. j. The contractor represents by submission of an invoice that the supplies have been delivered or services performed satisfactorily. GSA reserves the right to require proof of shipment or evidence of delivery/performance prior to payment. k. Pursuant to the clause, Examination of Records by GSA (552.215&hyph;70) and FAR, Subpart 4.7, contractors are required to retain files, records, and information relevant to this contract, including records to support shipments and deliveries for up to 3 years after final payment, or as specified in Subpart 4.705 through 4.705&hyph;3, whichever of these periods expire first. l. GSA, Office of Finance will implement a post payment statistically reliable system to validate agency receipt of goods or services. m.
