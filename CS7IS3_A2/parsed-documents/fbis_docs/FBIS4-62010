Kruglov said the first steps were being made in this direction. In particular, a council of the leaders of CIS customs was set up which will be responsible for shaping up a coordinated customs policy of the CIS states. However, the creation of a customs union should be preceded by the creation of a strong economic union and a single economic space within the CIS, Kruglov said. At a news conference in Moscow Wednesday, Kruglov put a special emphasis on the CIS customs offices' interaction on the road to integration. In particular, the council had made a number of crucial decisions over the four months since its creation. At the initiative of the Russian customs service, the council prepared an agreement on cooperation and mutual assistance in customs affairs and another agreement on the detention and return of illegally exported and imported cultural values. The two agreements were signed by the CIS heads of government on April 15. In addition, a multilateral interdepartmental agreement on cooperation in tackling drug trafficking has been prepared and recommended for signing. At present, the council is preparing drafts of CIS customs legislation and an intergovernmental agreement on simplified clearance on customs borders.
