We are offering you a radio interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, the chairman of the Georgian State Council and head of state. Batono [Georgian polite form of address] Eduard, the first question, of course, refers to your visit to the United States. In your opinion, how fruitful was it for the Georgian delegation? I am asking you this because having returned to Tbilisi, we heard rumors that the delegation had received a bad reception, and the attitude toward Georgia [words indistinct] and so on. [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. The issue pertaining to gossip and rumors, I think that what you mean as gossip and evil rumors really exist. I do not think it is reasonable to keep proving the contrary. Those who closely watch TV programs and listen to the information we provide our population with, they do not need proof of whether the reception was good or bad. Some say that Georgia was well received rather than Shevardnadze. Some, vice versa. I would maintain that malice should also have limits. Let us assume that the delegation received a bad reception. Who should be happy over this? Why should he be happy? To speak seriously, this has been a moral and political success and I would say a victory. This is a success of a country that has invariably chosen a road of democratic development. In case Shevardnadze betrayed democracy, [words indistinct]. True fighters for real democracy, all true reformers within the space of the former Soviet Union can be considered real heroes and they are persecuted as [words indistinct]. As for gossip and malicious rumors and the venom that certain newspapers spit out, they will eventually eat themselves up. I do not pay much attention to them. Therefore, I even pity them because of their wretchedness and maliciousness. [words indistinct] This is from the point of view of polemics. Now, about the success. First of all, this is a result we gained from a dialogue with the U.S. Administration. We got support for the issue pertaining to deploying peace-keeping forces in Abkhazia. Support has been clearly expressed. Commitments have been voiced in financing this action. Second, we have the full right to say that we have a legal basis for relations with this great country. I mean that a Washington declaration has been signed, an agreement on mutual [word indistinct] has been signed. Although we cannot feel the effect of this, all this is extremely important. These are documents, which open large channels for economic and other kinds of cooperation between Georgia and the United States. This is very essential. Third, I view it as very important that in the course of our dialogue with the president and his associates, as well as in the Congress and the Senate, we managed to familiarize leaders and legislators of this great country with what Georgia is, what we have, what the Abkhazian problem is, who is right and who is wrong. This is of essential importance because this conflict has been viewed with different attitudes at various spheres and levels. The truth of the issue has been demonstrated. The next result, I can say that this has been expected. I regard my meetings with leaders of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund as very important. This will not bring immediate results today but an agreement I brought, the promises that they agree to support us in case we retain stability and strengthen it further mean that in future, we will not have to wander from one country to another in search of kopecks or dollars. All this will happen on a different basis. The financing of our programs, the development of certain spheres and so on will be based on the norms other states have been using. This is also a significant result. I regard as very important the result of my meeting with Ivan Rybkin, the head of the Russian State Duma, with whom I had an excellent conversation, and I am now even more sure that we will overcome all difficulties that still exist after signing all agreements. [words indistinct] I frankly welcomed the meeting. The next result -- this may be the most important -- I mean the meeting of the UN Security Council, where I was given an opportunity to say what a state leader is supposed to say in connection with the Abkhazian conflict. Not just because this is a high podium and one uses this podium, but we want the world to know the truth, we want the Security Council to know the truth. I think that Georgia's position was so explicit and so easy to understand that it was a rather rare case when the meeting of the Security Council proceeded without confrontation and the position of the Georgian delegation received unanimous support and unanimous recognition, especially on issues of the country's integrity and unity, the immediate return of refugees and the necessary guarantees for the deployment of peace- keeping forces. As you were present there you must have noticed that all speeches were almost unanimous on these three basic issues and clearly supported Georgia, which has taken a democratic way of development. Yet another thing: It seems like an issue of minor importance now, although it is not of minor importance that we received very serious material support, financial support. Incidentally, without request from me, President Clinton announced of his own accord that the United States of America was allotting $70 million [to Georgia]. This is humanitarian aid rather than credit. I have to say that without this aid we would not have other sources after the EC credit had been exhausted. Thus, I do not know whether we could have thought of gaining more than we did during the three days materially, financially, politically and morally, including the issue that is of major concern to us at the moment, the issue of Abkhazia. [Oniani] Speaking of Abkhazia, you have said, and it was emphasized in the United Nations too, that such unanimous support was almost unprecedented for the United Nations. No remarks were made regarding our side. It was really amazing that the Russian representative's speech was almost one of the most constructive ones. In addition to the UN Security Council's support, the U.S. President's support, and the support by the U.S. congressmen, we know that no financing of the peace-keeping operation is possible without Congress' opinion. You had a meeting in the Pentagon where an opinion was voiced that the Pentagon would help Georgia. The Secretary of Defense, Perry himself, said that a U.S. military attache would arrive [in Georgia], that they would assist us in the formation of a new army, and this is what we really need in Georgia. What way do you think will remain if a political settlement of the Abkhazian issue over which you have spoken so long and toward which the Georgian policy has been moving cannot be arranged? Are we capable of resolving this problem in a different way if we are not left any other way out? [Shevardnadze] I would answer the question in this way. We have received very strong support at the UN Security Council. Before that, when the Russian president was in Georgia, we talked, signed agreements, and made mutual commitments over the peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian conflict. Now that all this has happened in Washington and New York and a platform has been established for the peaceful settlement, notwithstanding what the resolution will say, we have to speak about using every path leading to that major road and act respectively. It can be said that we would not dream of a better opportunity. Now, everything will depend on the art of using this opportunity and our vigor. Much will depend on the complete implementation of the agreements. Now, about the Pentagon's attitude. I do not think that the Pentagon is able to exert a strong influence on our military potential. We have not asked for this either. It is not practical to think of, say, getting armaments, getting warlike stores and so on from them. In this issue we will still depend on Russia, on the Russian Army. The commitments the Russian leadership has made -- at least verbally -- should be a guarantee that the process of the Georgian Army's formation will be accelerated. As for the military way [to resolve the Abkhazian problem] you have asked me, I would give you an answer like this. We must always be ready to defend the territorial integrity of our country. No one should have any doubts of our readiness to do this. When I say that our army is in the process of formation, I do not mean that it lacks combat abilities today. So, all branches of our Armed Forces are ready to fight for Georgia's independence, freedom, and the preservation of its territorial integrity. [Oniani] Batono Eduard, before leaving for the United States you spoke about the danger of a revival of the Cold War. There, in the United States, I think at the meeting with American politicians, the Americans asked a question about it. They were interested in this issue. They recalled your words. I wonder how your American visit strengthened or, on the contrary, eliminated this feeling in connection with recent events in Russia, a feeling that the danger of a return to the Cold War period could become a reality. [Shevardnadze] As for the danger of a Cold War, of which you have just spoken, and there were quite a lot of questions referring to this issue there [in the U.S.], a danger of recurrence is real. Confrontation between the United States and Russia could become the major feeding source of the recurrence if this were allowed to happen. I spoke about the inadmissibility of this sort of confrontation at every level in the United States. This was during a dialogue with the President and his associates. I spoke about it at the Congress, at the Senate, at meetings with political and other figures. The idea was indirectly expressed in my speech at the Security Council meeting and other speeches I made in the United States. The next phenomenon that could push mankind toward Cold War is a rather widely spread aggressive separatism that grows into conflicts. You may remember that I spoke about it [words indistinct]. At that time I had the impression that this pained some people's ears. Today, the world has realized that this aggressive separatism, that cost Georgia so much, may grow into a grave threat for the whole planet. Yugoslavia is a good example. This is an explosive triggering device, which is present in a number of countries. I am afraid that if this is not stopped and these current conflicts are not settled, the danger of cold and hot wars will become reality. I am pleased that conversations in the United States touched upon this issue and Georgia's opinion, an opinion of its leader that evoked everyone's interest, not because we were inventors but because we have been in the middle of events of this kind and, therefore, we feel this in a more acute way than others, and see the scale of the threat. But the main thing is to rule out any serious confrontation between these two countries and this will be a guarantee for peace. [Oniani] The situation in Georgia is rather critical today. [Word indistinct], transport is not working and so on and so on. You had very interesting meetings at the World Bank, with the Monetary Fund, OPEC, you have already mentioned. Regarding the significant and good plans drafted for Georgia, how deep and lasting do you think our economic crisis will be? [Shevardnadze] I have to say in this connection that our economic crisis is additionally [words indistinct]. During talks with an expert from the World Bank and the executive secretary, it was emphasized that our country, with its situation in western Georgia, differs from many other countries in a critical situation by complexity and difficulties. But, at the same time, it was said that if we stuck to the course we had taken toward establishing and strengthening stability, establishing order in the country, and if we stirred up the potential we possessed, these immense international organizations would be ready to help Georgia. If this happens the length of the crisis will become shorter and chances will increase to escape from the crisis sooner. The way out depends on how well we manage our own country. In the first instance order is essential and at the same time it is necessary to use all the potential we possess. We have to harvest tea, to harvest grapes, to harvest fruit, we have to plow soil, we have to run industry as it can be run. I think that in such conditions we will be able to come out of the crisis [word indistinct]. [Oniani] It often happens that your foreign trips are echoed in Georgia. It may be an explosion, it may be a murder or something like that. The same happened this time. There were explosions in the buildings of the Rescue Corps and the Chamber of Control. How would you comment on these events? I would not want to say this, but the explosion in the Rescue Corps building has a flavor of terrorism, while the explosion in the Chamber of Control looks more like a political act. We remember that last year you said at parliament that documents connected with [words indistinct] activities would be sealed and the Chamber of Control would be starting work on the issue having collected certain materials. [Shevardnadze] It seems to me the same way. When we speak about terrorist acts, some deputies speak at parliament and throw stones into the state's garden, I mean they blame the state. They speak of state terrorism. Did the state blow up the headquarters of the civil defense [the Rescue Corps is occupying this building]? Or can a man of reason think of causing an explosion in the Chamber of Control? Ruling out any interference and influence, I would like to say the following: We are facing unruly banditry. These are acts of banditry, acts of subversion. I have to emphasize one thing. We have had a lot of good words to say to the Ministry of Security and the Interior Ministry. But now we have to say that neither the Ministry of Security nor the system of interior affairs fight against crime as they are expected to. A system of raiding criminal groups is a very good job and it is very efficient. [sentence as heard] But now it is time for a decisive say from the Ministry of Security, and the whole system of the ministry has to demonstrate its professional skills in fighting terrorist acts. It is in the state's interest, the whole state structure's interest, to have all criminal cases revealed and have criminals punished. I will tell you openly that we have to make and we will make the law enforcement bodies reveal all terrorist cases. Georgia's authority as a civilized, cultural, and normal country should be restored. This is the republic's cause. I can say that this is a national cause, a state cause, and we must do this. [Oniani] The final question: A regular working week for parliament begins tomorrow. Have you introduced any alterations into your plan of parliamentary activities? [Shevardnadze] The parliament will apparently be working according to planned subjects. There are certain ideas but I would say one thing; during my visit to the United States and especially when I had meetings with representatives of business and financial circles and so on, the main questions pertained to legislature. What laws have the Georgian parliament managed to pass that would help develop the economy. What fate will foreign investments have in Georgia. They are interested not in generalized laws but in details. In this respect our parliament is lagging behind. It is significantly lagging and it should be admitted that the chairman [Shevardnadze] and the speaker with his deputies cannot manage well. Many laws, over 60 laws are ready and we are not able to pass them. I should also say that our parliament is not keen on passing laws. They would rather be active in the political sphere than economic. This is not a fault. We must be involved in every sphere. Today however, overcoming the crisis is a major task and many deputies demand that economic reforms be implemented as soon as possible. But no reforms will be implemented if legislative activity is not properly directed. In this respect, if there is any draft law, then parliament must work on it. Parliament must work on drafting laws and their soonest possible implementation. For instance, the law on land. There were a lot of debates on this law but we could not reach consent and then we abandoned the law. Now, I am asked to issue a decree on it. I cannot do this. Land is such a problem, such a painful and delicate problem [words indistinct]. This sort of alteration, or rather turn in the activities of the parliament, especially in the economic sphere is a must. [Oniani] Thank you for the interview. You have been listening to Eduard Shevardnadze.
