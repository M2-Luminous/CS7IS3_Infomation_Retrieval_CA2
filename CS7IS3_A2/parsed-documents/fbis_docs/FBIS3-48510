The prosecution charge said Chang last October illegally withdrew from the Apkujong branch of the Seoul Trust Bank 3 billion won belonging to Ms. Ha Chong-im without the depositor's permission. Chang is also suspected of cheating 7.75 billion won out of the Sampo Mutual Trust Fund with the false promise of giving the fund a large deposit. The charge also said that when she was heading Yupyong Corp. as its chairwoman last October, the corp. issued a 500-million-won note but failed to honor it. A law stipulates that a person found guilty of fraud involving more than 5 billion won is to be given a term of five years to life. Besides, she had five years and two more months to serve when she was paroled in 1992 from prison. She was serving a 15-year term over a 1982 financial scandal. Meanwhile, the Justice Ministry on Monday afternoon retracted the parole granted to Chang in 1992, obliging her to serve out the remaining term. A ministry official said that by law a parole may be cancelled if the parolee fails to behave properly or engages in abnormal conducts. "We have cancelled her parole upon she was arrested," the official said.
