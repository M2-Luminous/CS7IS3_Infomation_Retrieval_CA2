Gamosov said that the round-up carried out by the police in practically the entire republic had not yielded any results. According to Gamosov, two chief witnesses of the seizure of hostages, who could clear up a lot of things (possibly even disclose their whereabouts) are currently hiding for unknown reasons. Both are guards of economic facilities in Northern Ossetia. According to T. Gamosov's version, "the witnesses do not want to be involved in the complex intrigues that are woven today in the state-of-emergency zone around the Ingush hostages, while the destiny of the Ossetian hostages taken back on March 30 does not interest anybody.
