He made reference to two articles in a magazine published in Florida. [Begin Alarcon recording] Farmers had no showers or proper housing, not because they were simple minded or because they did not care to live any better but because they were being exploited. They were being exploited by those who left Cuba. Now, some of those people are harboring aspirations in the face of the great difficulties and problems that Cuba is experiencing. Some of them are watering at the mouth to take a bite. I do not blame them. In this magazine there are two articles: The one on the left page is titled "This Land is My Land" and the other is titled "Reclaiming." The first deals with a man who seems to have owned a great mansion in Havana or Havana Province -- it is unclear which. He says that his house was awesome -- it is apparently now a school -- and that his back yard is no longer private [play on words of a children's nursery rhyme] because it is the school's sports field. This seems to bother this man a great deal, people playing and having a good time. The man goes on to explain that when the Revolution collapses his home will have to be returned to him, because it is his home. He says he will regain his house through legal channels because he is civilized, decent, and quiet. He goes on to say that he knows that there are many people in Miami who would go about this in a violent manner, kicking off their properties whoever was living there because those properties still belong to them. They were stolen. The other article refers to a leader of the association of Cuban landowners in exile; this concerns the ministry of [Alfredo] Jordan. There are people who claim the sugarcane mills and fields, as well as the farms you are now using for miscellaneous crops, which we hope will multiply and grow more quickly and which the ANAP is going to discuss in August. Thus, it is not we who are saying: If the Revolution were to collapse....[changes thought] We do not say this to convince anyone that we must be patriotic, we must be revolutionaries. They are the ones saying and repeating that. [end recording]
