The Armenian army attacked the southern section of the front (Fizuli-Beylagan) three times. The Azeri army managed to liberate the village of Ashagy-Abdurakhmanly and several strategically important heights. During the fighting three of Armenia's tanks and one military personnel carrier were destroyed and several dozens of Armenian soldiers were killed. The Azeri army captured five machine-guns, one flame-thrower cluster, four grenade discharger cups, and dozens of sub-machine guns. Fierce fighting in the eastern direction (Agdam-Terter) of the front took place throughout the night where the Armenian army tried to break through the defense of the Azeri army. But attempts by the Armenian army failed since the Azeri army was subject to fire upon the position of Armenian troops in this direction. Approximately 50 Armenian soldiers were killed in this section of the front. This morning the Armenian army fired upon the village of Tap-Karakayully of the Geranboy region. At the same times border posts of the Azeri army in the Tauzskiy region were subjected to fire from the Idzhevanskiy region of Armenia.
