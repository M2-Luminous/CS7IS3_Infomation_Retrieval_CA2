Despite the fact that recent polls have not favored Lewis Galindo, he believes in them and is aware that his campaign work has to be more intense. Lewis Galindo, who is 66, is accompanied by candidates David Guerra, MUN, and Marisin Villalaz de Arias, Solidarity. In an exclusive interview with LA ESTRELLA DE PANAMA, the politician speaks of the country's main problems and how he will fight them as part of a government plan. Why an Alliance With Mission? Despite the fact that Solidarity initially talked to all political parties seeking options to create a coalition, Solidarity members decided to join MUN. "In Mission we found points of agreement with our government plans, in the need to make a great national concerted agreement to frontally attack unemployment, crime, and raise our population's morality level," Lewis Galindo, who is also an entrepreneur, said. He said that it was not an alliance based on "electoral campaign conveniences," instead, a serious pact that seeks only the good of the country, intentions that are outlined in the Action Plan document. National Emergency Unemployment Plan Lewis Galindo is of the opinion that the country's main problems, which his administration will give priority to, are unemployment, crime, drug addiction, and economic development -- a topic linked to each of the others. "Unemployment is not a problem that will be resolved in days or months, but it can be reduced." He mentioned the need to create a national emergency plan to employ at least 40,000 Panamanians in community work in poor neighborhoods, which translates to paying out $70 million a year. This would be covered not by increasing taxes, but by improving their collection by 15 percent. Tourism is a source of jobs that can be taken advantage of by raising the Panama Tourism Institute to the rank of ministry and structuring a coherent development plan that will offer permanent jobs to more than 30,000 persons and attract the attention of visitors. The road network could be improved to lessen the transportation crisis, mainly in the metropolitan area. Complete Modernization of the State According to Lewis, the Panamanian state is currently ruled by the same plan that dates back 20-30 years, thus state bureaucracy needs the inducement of a civil service career that offers the same benefits and security that private enterprise workers receive. "We must immediately give the Social Security Fund [CSS] administrative and economic independence," the candidate noted and suggested a total revision of the CSS situation to improve its services, which are now deficient. One must also study the possibility of basing retirement on the activity each individual conducts, he said and added, "life expectancy is not the same for all occupations. He recommended paying greater attention to pensioners, who "often feel neglected and are unable to obtain the income they need to subsist, and here is where social security must act so that they live their last years with dignity." "We must seek the way so that the soldiers who studied a career for which there is no room in Panama can adapt to a new life," and to achieve it they must be granted study and work opportunities. He noted the National Police must receive the advisory services of experts who at some time reorganized the police corps in other countries that have social problems identical to ours. Lewis Galindo criticized the performance of Ruben Dario Carles at the helm of the state finances for "not adequately handling" the foreign debt, a situation that led to an increase of the commercial debt that currently totals $1.2 billion with interest. He has left the country more indebted than before "because he followed the easy path of yielding to U.S. pressure" and did not have an adequate economic plan. Lewis Galindo made these remarks after Comptroller General Jose Chen Barria warned about a fiscal deficit. In Lewis Galindo's opinion, the mistake was to cancel the debt with the international financial institutions and miss the opportunity of negotiating the commercial debt, which at one point was worth 13 cents and is now almost 17 cents. Lewis Galindo is a businessman and has been the chief executive officer of several industries, such as Cerveceria Chiricana [Chiriqui Brewery], Cerveceria Nacional [National Brewery], Construcciones Nacionales [National Construction Company], and the president of Banco del Istmo [Isthmus Bank], as well as ambassador to the UN General Assembly.
