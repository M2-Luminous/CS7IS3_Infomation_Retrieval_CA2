FR940128-2-00137 FR940128-2-00088 We have since made clear, in Finkelstein, that that retention of jurisdiction, that failure to terminate the case, was error: Under section 405(g), ``each final decision of the Secretary [is] reviewable by a separate piece of litigation,'' and a sentence-four remand order ``terminate[s] the civil action'' seeking judicial review of the Secretary's final decision. 496 U.S., at 624&hyph;625, 110 S.Ct., at 2663 (emphases added). What we adjudicated in Hudson , in other words, was a hybrid: a sentence-four remand that the District Court had improperly (but without objection) treated like a sentence-six remand. 3 We specifically noted in Melkonyan that Hudson was limited to a ``narrow class of qualifying administrative proceedings'' where ``the district court retains jurisdiction of the civil action'' pending the completion of the administrative proceedings. 501 U.S. at XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2162. We therefore do not consider the holding of Hudson binding as to sentence-four remands that are ordered (as they should be) without retention of jurisdiction, or that are ordered with retention of jurisdiction that is challenged. 4 3 The Secretary not only failed to object to the District Court's retention of jurisdiction, but affirmatively endorsed the practice as a means of accommodating the lower court cases holding that a section 405(g) plaintiff does not become a prevailing party until Social Security benefits are actually awarded. Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivan v. Hudson , O.T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 12&hyph;13. Those precedents were highly favorable to the Government, of course, because they relieved the Secretary of liability for EAJA fees in all cases where Social Security benefits were ultimately denied. But they were also at war with the view_expressed later in the Secretary's Hudson reply brief_that a sentence-four remand order is a ``final judgment'' in the civil action. Id. , at 16. Essentially, the Secretary in Hudson wanted it both ways: He wanted us to regard retention of jurisdiction as proper for purposes of determining prevailing-party status, but as improper for purposes of awarding fees on remand. 4 Justice STEVENS says that our holding ``overrul[es]'' Sullivan v. Hudson , 490 U.S. 877, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 104 L.Ed.2d 941, (1989). Post , at 2633, 2636. We do not think that is an accurate characterization. Hudson remains good law as applied to remands ordered pursuant to sentence six. And since the distinction between sentence-four and sentence-six remands was neither properly presented nor considered in Hudson, see supra, at 2630 and n. 3, and infra , at 2631, limiting Hudson to sentence-six cases does not ``overrule'' the decision even in part. See Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.S. XXX , XXX , 113 S.Ct., 1710, 1718, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). We agree with Justice STEVENS that until today there has been some contradiction in our case law on this subject. In resolving it, however, we have not simply chosen Melkonyan's dicta over Hudson , but have grounded our decision in the text and structure of the relevant statutes, particularly section 405. Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remand order cannot be considered a ``final judgment'' for purposes of section 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the party seeking fees to submit an application ``show[ing] that [he] is a prevailing party.'' That showing, Schaefer contends, cannot be made until the proceedings on remand are complete, since a Social Security claimant does not ``prevail'' until he is awarded Social Security benefits. The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever denied prevailing-party status (under section 2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiff who won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g). Dicta in Hudson stated that ``a Social Security claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further proceedings.'' 490 U.S., at 887, 109 S.Ct., at 2255. But that statement (like the holding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinction between a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six remand, which does not. The sharp distinction between the two types of remand had not been made in the lower-court opinions in Hudson , see Hudson v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 839 F.2d 1453 (CA11 1988); App. to Pet. for Cert. in Sullivan v. Hudson , O.T.1988, No. 616, pp. 17a&hyph;20a (setting forth unpublished District Court opinion), was not included in the question presented for decision, 5 and was mentioned for the first time in the closing pages of the Secretary's reply brief, see Reply Brief for Petitioner in Sullivan v. Hudson , O.T.1988, No. 616, pp. 14&hyph;17. It is only decisions after Hudson _specifically Finkelstein and Melkonyan_ which establish that the sentence-four, sentence-six distinction is crucial to the structure of judicial review established under section 405(g). See Finkelstein , 496 U.S., at 626, 110 S.Ct., at 2664; Melkonyan, 501 U.S., at XXX &hyph; XXX , 111 S.Ct., at 2162&hyph;2163. 5 As formulated in the Secretary's petition, the question on which the Court granted certiorari in Hudson was: ``Whether Social Security administrative proceedings conducted after a remand from the courts are `adversary adjudications' for which attorney fees are available under the [EAJA].'' Pet. for Cert. in Sullivan v. Hudson , O.T.1988, No. 616, p. I. Hudson 's dicta that remand does not generally confer prevailing-party status relied on three cases, none of which supports that proposition as applied to sentence-four remands. Hanrahan v. Hampton, 446 U.S. 754, 758&hyph;759, 100 S.Ct. 1987, 1990, 64 L.Ed.2d 670 (1980), rejected an assertion of prevailing-party status, not by virtue of having secured a remand, but by virtue of having obtained a favorable procedural ruling (the reversal on appeal of a directed verdict) during the course of the judicial proceedings. Hewitt v. Helms, 482 U.S. 755, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987), held that a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party merely by obtaining ``a favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in judgment against the plaintiff ,'' id. , at 763, 107 S.Ct., at 2677 (emphasis added). (A sentence-four remand, of course, is a judgment for the plaintiff.) And the third case cited in Hudson, Texas Teachers Assn. v. Garland Independent School Dist ., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989), affirmatively supports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party. Garland held that status to have been obtained ``[i]f the plaintiff has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit *␣*␣* sought in bringing suit.'' Id., at 791&hyph;792, 109 S.Ct., at 1493 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Obtaining a sentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial of benefits certainly meets this description. See also Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. XXX , 113 S.Ct., 566, 121 L.Ed.2d 494 (1992). III
