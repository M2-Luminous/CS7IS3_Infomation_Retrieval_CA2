The discussion is being held behind closed doors. Before the doors closed, Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin reported that Egypt is introducing difficulties in the multinational talks on the nuclear issue. He said the Egyptians try to raise the issue of nonconventional weapons at every international forum. Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Beilin defined Yasir 'Arafat's failure to condemn the 'Afula murders as stupid.
