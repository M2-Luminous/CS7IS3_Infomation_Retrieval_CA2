The meeting of labor, finance, and economics ministers of the seven major industrial nations has clearly improved conditions for harmonizing labor market initiatives. In view of the practices adopted by multinational trusts, control of the labor market and of job developments can no longer be an exclusively national task. The German Trade Union Federation had accused the government of taking a defendant's position in Detroit. The Federal Republic was the only participant that did not create a new stimulus for economic recovery, and it was criticized for this. Speaking to correspondents, Bluem said that the Detroit talks had determined fields of action that would not have become visible without this joint initiative. Against the background of big trusts' international employment policies labor policy needs find new solutions. The labor market, which has become disordered, can no longer be controlled by individual national initiatives alone. New Qualifications The Federal Republic does quite well in international labor market comparisons. Germany continues to come out on top as far as vocational qualifications are concerned. In addition, Germany is the only country besides Japan where unemployment among young people is below the average unemployment rate. This development is a success of the dual system of vocational training, Bluem said. Qualifications are also the key factor for a successful implementation of labor market initiatives. With the existing labor market situation, original training is no longer the most important thing, but new qualifications must be acquired, the minister said. Employees have good opportunities if "they keep abreast with new developments in their jobs." Referring to Finance Minister Theo Waigel (Christian Social Union), who said in Detroit that certain inflexibilities still have to be overcome in Germany following reunification, the minister called upon companies and trade unions to give up their inflexible positions with regard to working hours and to find new and creative solutions and models. There are no legal obstacles preventing this. It is high time to agree on "tailor-made individual working hours." On a critical note, Bluem said that the entire transport infrastructure accounts for German industry and administration structures that hardly allow for any variations in working hours, with work beginning early in the morning. In Germany, everything is organized by the "march in review" principle. The Federal Republic would have an additional 2 million people working if it adopted the part-time regulations common in The Netherlands. Another unresolved problem is the employment of older people, Bluem said. There are cultural and social reasons clearly speaking against early retirement of older people, but they should be offered flexible opportunities for employment instead. The policy adopted by many companies that laid off older people turned out to be a mistake. The recent development with entire sectors, such as steel or mining, hardly having any workers that are older than 50 "must be counteracted." "Vigorous Statements" This has also been proven by several analyses that U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich presented in Detroit. The minister said self-critically that "earlier vigorous Bluem statements," with which he had spoken out for many people making use of the early retirement scheme, are no longer up to date.
