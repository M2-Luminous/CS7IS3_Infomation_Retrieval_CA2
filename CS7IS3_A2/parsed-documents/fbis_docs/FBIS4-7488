He also expressed the opinion that this was an attempt to make mischief within the coalition. Borowski said that the president would sign the budget law "because, after all, there are limits to absurdity." As an element of the war with the coalition, Borowski sees the refusal of Minister Kolodziejczyk to fill the post of deputy minister at the Ministry of National Defense [MON] with a representative of the coalition. It is Borowski's view that, in this situation, parliamentary forces should be mobilized to reject the presidential veto. As far as the situation in MON is concerned, a group of 15 deputies from the SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] should propose a motion in the Sejm regarding a vote of no confidence in Piotr Kolodziejczyk. After its acceptance, Kolodziejczyk must resign.
