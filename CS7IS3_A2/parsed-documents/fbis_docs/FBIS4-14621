Answering journalists' questions at the airport while meeting UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Andrey Kozyrev indicated that there had been no changes in Russia's stance. Referring to the statements made yesterday by the president's press secretary to the effect that several months would be needed to resolve this issue, Kozyrev said he was probably talking about implementing the document rather than signing it.
