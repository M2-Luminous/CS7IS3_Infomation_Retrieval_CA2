FBIS3-52530 "drnes004yy_94003" FBIS-NES-94-004 Document Type:Daily Report 6 January 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Arab-Israeli Talks Israel Submits Draft on Autonomy's Legal Aspects TA0501144394 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew 5 Jan 94 pp 1, 15 TA0501144394 Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT Language: Hebrew Article Type:BFN [Report by Tova Tzimuqi] [Text] Israel wants to retain legal and judicial responsibility for the handling of serious crimes perpetrated by Palestinians in the autonomous areas in Gaza and Jericho, even after the agreement of principles is implemented. This proposal is contained in a draft document dealing with the implementation of the legal aspects of the autonomy agreement submitted to the PLO for perusal . According to the proposal, crimes committed by Palestinians against Israelis and resulting in death or serious injury, as well as rape and kidnapping, would be immediately transferred from the Palestinian police to the Israeli law enforcement authorities. The document relayed to the PLO was drafted by a team of police officers and legal experts in the Foreign, Defense, and Justice Ministries and the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. The document stipulates that Israelis in the autonomous areas would enjoy quasi-diplomatic status. They would enjoy immunity from the Palestinian police and could be arrested, interrogated, and tried only by Israeli elements. Israel proposes full reciprocity in law enforcement only with regard to minor crimes committed by Palestinians or Israelis within the autonomous areas. Minor crimes committed by Palestinians against Israelis would be handled by the Palestinian law enforcement authorities. They would conduct the investigation, arrest, trial, and punishment and would then report the measures taken to the Israeli law authorities. If they fail to do so, Israel would be entitled to deal with these crimes as it sees fit. The document contains a detailed proposal on law enforcement and policing in the autonomous areas. Joint patrols by Israel Police and the Palestinian police force would drive in two cars on all the roads where there is intensive Israeli traffic (such as the Erez-Rafah road). There would be two kinds of patrols: one kind would drive back and forth, while the other would be stationary. The latter would be deployed at major junctions, and would be summoned as warranted by reports about incidents. The Israeli and Palestinian police vehicles would be linked by radio to a joint situation room. Three situation rooms would be established: one in Jericho and two in the Gaza Strip, one in the north and another in the south. The situation rooms would be overseen by a liaison committee. Joint patrols accompanied by patrols of the Israeli security forces would drive on lateral roads linking the Gaza Strip and Israel. The draft agreement submitted to the PLO further states that the implementation of the autonomy in Gaza and Jericho would not annul existing entitlements or private deals between Israelis and Palestinians. The law of continuity would apply to obligations, rights, and damage suits. It should be pointed out that upon mutual consent any security and legal arrangements to be decided would be subject to revision in the following five years.
