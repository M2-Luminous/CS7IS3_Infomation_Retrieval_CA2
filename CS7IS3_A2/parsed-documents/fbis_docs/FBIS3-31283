[Rokita] It means neither. It is obvious that the governing coalition's deep crisis, which is linked--this is my impression--not to differences of opinions on substantive issues, but rather to a struggle for power inside the cabinet, neither strengthens nor stabilizes the government. On the contrary, the crisis destabilizes and weakens the government, it ruins its social reputation. But on the other hand, I am not very eager to draw hasty conclusions from the crisis or to say that the coalition is on the verge of collapsing. The will of being in power is a strong cementing factor for the coalition. For the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], and in particular for the old Polish United Workers Party [PZPR] apparatus, being in power has an enormous psychological significance because it means a kind of compensation for the last four years. For the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] in turn, being in power is a fulfillment of Waldemar Pawlak's "immemorial" aspirations to be the head of government; he will not give that up easily. [Rybus] So you do not agree with the view that the unanimous showing of who in the coalition is in charge, indirectly means the coalition's stabilization since there are no longer two equal partners who could argue over leadership? [Rokita] The effects of the crisis undoubtedly mean a defeat for Aleksander Kwasniewski. But they also represent Waldemar Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory. [Rybus] [No question published] [Rokita] The price paid for the victory in the battle for spheres of influence, was a decrease in public esteem, which has very negative consequences for the prime minister. Apart from that, my view is that one cannot really speak of Prime Minister Pawlak's domination in the coalition since Marek Borowski's departure as a result of the dispute (and Kwasniewski's disavowal of him, including a brutal description) also represents a success by the PZPR apparatus which had clearly disliked Borowski. To a certain extent, the result of the dispute we are talking about here also strengthens Kwasniewski, but not as a leader of reformers within SLD, but as a real leader of the apparatus, as a leader who wants to implement the interests of the apparatus and for that goal, he is willing to betray and abandon his political friends. [Rybus] Regardless of different views on the manner in which the prime minister resolved the conflict, it would be hard to deny political efficiency to him and PSL. A party which gained as many votes as the Democratic Union [UD] and the Liberal-Democratic Congress [KLD]--but far fewer votes than the SLD--is gradually acquiring an indivisible power. [Rokita] I do not share that view. The crisis centered around [former Deputy Finance Minister] Kawalec and [former Finance Minister] Borowski, only shows a lack of the efficiency of influence by so-called SLD reformers, which by the way was easily predictable. But it does not mean a decline in influence by the hard-line, postcommunist apparatus. Forcing the chief of the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic and of SLD to get rid of Borowski, over whose candidacy for the post of finance minister he [Kwasniewski] had fought vigorously, is, like I already said, Pawlak's Pyrrhic victory. It is also a real victory by the PZPR-derived apparatus. In my view, the conclusion regarding PSL's domination as a result of the dispute we are talking about here, is completely false. [Rybus] So if the postcommunist apparatus is now gaining victory within SLD, that means you uphold your argument you had declared immediately after the elections, about UD's refusal to take part in any coalition arrangements with SLD? [Rokita] I have always said--and I do so now--that the political logic set in motion during the election campaign will force Kwasniewski to either lose ground in the party which will finally "spit him out," or to take the leadership of a communist apparatus. To put it briefly: I have never believed--and I continue not to believe--in the governing parties' ability to reform themselves. That is why I have been and still am in favor of a tough opposition by UD. [Rybus] That explains your assessment of a famous statement by [UD Deputy Chairman] Wladyslaw Frasyniuk .... [Rokita] I think Frasyniuk's statement was a political mistake. And that is not just how I feel, but it is also the assessment of practically all of UD, including party Chairman Mazowiecki, and chairman of the parliamentary club Geremek. The mistake was made clear to Frasyniuk in harsh terms during party meetings. But is it also true that his intentions were distorted by sensation-seeking media. Pay attention that Frasyniuk had not made an appeal for UD to come to alliance with SLD, not today, and not at any time in the future. On the contrary, he is the kind of member of UD who is in favor of a strong opposition stand toward SLD. But what he also thinks--and that is an interesting view, even though I do not agree with it--is that under a situation where Aleksander Kwasniewski and the PZPR apparatus abandon leaders of the reform wing, there should be someone to publicly speak of these people in kind terms. There is no doubt that Borowski had played a positive role in Pawlak's cabinet. [Rybus] So, regarding UD's opposition nature, do you regard it as necessary to maintain it until the end of this parliament's term? [Rokita] Yes, I do. To construct a government with UD's participation, or with the participation of the club of a new party which will be formed after unification with KLD--that is not possible under the parliament which was elected on 19 September. What is possible, is a collapse of the governing coalition and one could imagine some strange forms of a government which would be openly antireform (even though I regard them as not very likely), but I cannot imagine a situation where UD, with this parliamentary composition, could find partners for itself with whom to establish a majority coalition. There are no such partners, nor will there ever be, until the end of term of this parliament, which does not necessarily mean that I think the term will last four years. After the recent events, a four-year term seems less and less likely, especially given that in the middle of the term we will have presidential elections which always change the political scene everywhere.
