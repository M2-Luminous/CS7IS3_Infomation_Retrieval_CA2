FBIS4-513 "drafr070_c_94052" FBIS-AFR-94-070 Daily Report 11 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA Financial Rand Plunges to Lowest Level Financial Rand Plunges to Lowest Level MB1104204694 Johannesburg SAPA in English 1713 GMT 11 Apr 94 MB1104204694 Johannesburg SAPA English BFN [Text] Johannesburg Apr 11 SAPA -- South Africa's foreign investment unit, the financial rand, plunged to its worst level and the commercial rand followed suit in a bruising day's trade Monday [11 April]. The finrand, an indicator of foreign confidence in the country, rapidly slid to R[Rand]5.7150 to the U.S. dollar, crashing 77 cents or 16 per cent from its pre-week-end closing level of R4.9200. Traders said international investors took an extremely gloomy view of the failed summit between the country's political leaders which ended late Friday. "All hell broke loose. Just as we thought it was finding its bottom, it fell further," a trader lamented. "In the run up to the elections, the finrand is going to head lower. Particularly, the situation in Natal seems to prevent free voting and in fact it's likely to be a bloody confrontation." The finrand's previous worst level was recorded in August 1986 when it breached R5.5500 to the greenback after the then President P.W. Botha's security crack-down and failure to embrace reform. Another trader said the bleak statements issued by President F.W. de Klerk, African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, Inkatha chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and King Goodwill Zwelethini after the Friday summit "initially got the ball rolling with offshore investors taking an extremely bearish view of the outcome of the meeting". Rumours sprung up on the currency market of a large disinvestment order, and coupled with a reluctance by market participants to be short of dollars pummelled the investment unit even lower, dealers noted. The bearish sentiment spilled over into the commercial rand market as importers rushed to buy foreign currency requirements in anticipation of the rand weakening further. The rand plunged to a record low of R3.6148 before regaining some composure to close at R3.5928 from Friday's R3.5525 close. The local unit was not helped by a stronger U.S. dollar on world markets, as it added to the uncertain waters the SA economy would wade through before April 26-28 -- the election date. A dealer said that there had been no sign of Reserve Bank intervention in either the commercial or financial rand. Reserve figures released ahead of the week-end indicated the bank had little resources to continue to prop up the rand. Analysts said the foreign exchange reserve figures showed the Reserve Bank in fact had to borrow on its foreign "overdrafts".
