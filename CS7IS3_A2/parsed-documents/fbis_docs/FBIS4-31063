This is the question that Milada Citovic put to [Bosnian Serb] president Karadzic. [Begin recording] [Karadzic] The Muslims have so far done everything to sabotage every conference, and the United States has generally helped them in this. I am afraid that if any one of us Serbs thinks that this is a serious conference on peace and that the sanctions will really be lifted and that, in the international community, it is primarily the United States that is striving for peace, he is gravely mistaken. They can achieve peace whenever they want because the Muslims are entirely obedient to the ones who issue the orders, and it is a fact that the United States -- that is, certain circles in the United States -- has instigated this war and is prolonging it to the extent that suits it. To put it succinctly, we Serbs should not fool ourselves -- this is a war for the West's goals; these goals have not been achieved by a long shot because we have kept them at bay with our defense in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina for a full two years. They have not succeeded in achieving anything that they planned to do in Serbia, and they are dissatisfied with the effect. That is why they will do everything to make the war last longer. [Citovic] The Serbian side is unconditionally for peace and has agreed to negotiate a cessation of hostilities. However, the Contact Group for Bosnia also met today, and territorial demarcation was discussed. This is illogical. First, hostilities have to cease, and then this can be discussed. [Karadzic] That is also our position. The most important thing is to stop the war, because it will be easier to negotiate in peace. On the other hand, it seems that the Contact Group is comprised of people who do not have enough authority and who do not have adequate maneuvering space. Therefore, negotiations with the Contact Group are somehow barren. Simply, it is the Muslim map that is being passed around -- that is, certain variants of it -- and the entire Contact Group is presenting itself as the representative of the Muslims' interests. We do not have a direct connection or influence on the creation of these maps, our representative is not included in this Contact Group, and we do not have unbiased mediators to take into account the interests of all three sides. To put it succinctly, the Contact Group was designed to put pressure on the Serbs. It is not a group for achieving an agreement between the three sides. [end recording]
