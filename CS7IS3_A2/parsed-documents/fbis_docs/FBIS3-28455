Prof. Genevieve Clancy of Paris University No.1 of France said that the West Sea barrage is a wonderful structure showing the inexhaustible creative power of humanity. He said he had visited many countries but had never seen such a great creation beyond human imagination. He noted that the barrage built by the Korean people with their own designs, technique and materials fully showed the mighty economic power of Korea and the indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean people who are advancing under the banner of self-reliance. Head of the Cairo University delegation of Egypt 'Ali Muhammad Sharawy said: "Such a gigantic barrage as the West Sea barrage cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets squandered a large amount of materials and funds in building the concrete wall, a symbol of division, in the area South of the Military Demarcation Line, but the people here have built a gigantic barrage for the prosperity of the country in an eight kilometer section of a rough sea. Through these two different realities we can see how just the cause of the Korean people is." Head of a Nepalese delegation for the study of the chuche idea Manik Lal Shrestha said: "The West Sea barrage is a vivid token of the enormous economic power of Korea. With the independent national economy and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, the Korean people are energetically stepping up production and construction, unshaken by any economic pressure and blockade of the imperialists." Member of the Ayn Shams University delegation from Egypt Salman Sali said it was a fascinating miracle that such great project as the West Sea barrage was completed in a matter of five years.
