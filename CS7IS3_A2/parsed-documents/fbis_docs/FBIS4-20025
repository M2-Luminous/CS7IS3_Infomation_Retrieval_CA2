The wide and deep gap between the party and the British Government over the Downing Street declaration needed to be bridged. Peace did not come in one great and all encompassing gesture, he said. It required the building of trust, imagination, courage, and gestures of goodwill which should not be arrogantly dismissed or thrown back. Mr Adams told a European election meeting of his party in Londonderry: "Regrettably the peace process is stalled. It has been stalled for too long. There is now a real possibility that we may move into a crisis and the opportunity which exists will be lost. We must all redouble our efforts to prevent this from happening." Since the signing of the peace declaration by the British and Irish Governments last December, the Prime Minister and the Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew have refused Sinn Fein demands for clarification. Mr Adams said tonight that the document was so ambiguously drafted, it was open to all sorts of differing interpretations. Earlier this month the IRA, which has yet to make a decision on the document, announced a three-day truce. But the effort by Sinn Fein to utilise that suspension to break the political stalemate had been arrogantly dismissed, according to Mr Adams. He claimed: "It appears to indicate a British Government stubbornly refusing to break from the failed policies of the past. This is clearly not good enough. It we are to bring an end to the violence which every generation has had to endure we need clarity and a willingness to adopt pragmatic political strategies and see developments in the long term. It has been variously reported and speculated that Mr Major's refusal to break the obstruction around the clarification issue is linked to his concern about the Conservative right, and his dependency upon the Unionists. If this is true and if he lacks the political nerve to deal with this relatively simple matter, how can he hope to tackle the infinitely more difficult decisions which lie ahead in any peace process?" said Mr Adams. "Are our hopes for peace to be blocked by the Tory right wing and the Unionists? Mr Major is not alone in having difficulties. We all have them. But they have to be overcome...." The IRA's three-day suspension was an "exceptional initiative which created an unparalled opportunity." But the British had closed the door on that initiative as well. The Sinn Fein president added: "What is required is a new and imaginative approach which tilts the balance away from this negative power of veto and towards the positive power of democracy, agreement and consent. The British Government holds the veto. Its removal would unlock the situation and create the catalyst for real change." The Governemnt's current policy he claimed, was effectively thwarting the efforts to remove the obstacles which were blocking progress. He added: "Consequently the peace initiative in which all of us have invested considerable time and effort and much hope, is in danger of going into crisis. We must all redouble our efforts to prevent this from happening." Mr Adams said the gap which seperated republicans from the British was wide and deep, but was one that had to be bridged. They needed to know and understand each others views and to be clear on each others long term intentions. He said: "The British Government regrettably appears unwilling to look beyond its narrow political agenda and grasp the opportunity for peace which still exists." Republicans had consistently indicated over recent years, but particularly the last 12 months, their determination to do what they could to achieve peace. Their bona fides in this respect were impeccable. Mr Adams said: "There now exists for the first time in 25 years a real opportunity to advance beyond the failures and violence of the past. It requires imagination, hard work, realism and a deep seated desire to make it happen."
