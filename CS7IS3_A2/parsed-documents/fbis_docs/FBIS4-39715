On Thursday he called on the Kazakh parliament to adopt such a decision. In Nazarbayev's opinion, the capital should not be situated near the border but rather in the center of the state. He also justified his proposal by the fact that Akmola is located at a point where the major ethnic groups meet (in Kazakhstan Russians live predominantly in the north and Kazakhs -- in the south). In addition, Alma-Ata is situated in a seismic zone and is suffering from severe environmental problems.
