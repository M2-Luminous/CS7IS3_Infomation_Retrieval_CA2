The Status of Shanghai in China's Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Development The salient features of the contemporary international economy are economic openness and a trend toward economic integration. A unique position dictates that Shanghai, being a metropolis in the Orient and China's largest economic center, should bring its superiority into full play, directly join the international division of labor, be a member in the grand international economic circle, and promote the development of the international economy together with other modern international cities. Geographically speaking, Shanghai is situated at the confluence of China's golden coast and the Chang Jiang's golden waterway. The Chang Jiang Basin has long been called the dragon of the Chinese economy. Its population and land area account for two-thirds and one-fourth, respectively, of China. It produces 40 percent of China's gross industrial and agricultural output value. As Shanghai, which is called the "crossing point of river and sea and the metropolis of southeast China," has access to information, a pool of skilled people, and a good transportation network, it ranks top among the coastal cities along the Chang Jiang and even in the entire country in terms of industrial, commercial, trade, technology, and financial levels and their input/output and investment return rates, as well as the differential rent levels. Seen from the market environment perspective, Shanghai is the most important hub linking China's market to the international market. Historically, Shanghai has been an important center for distribution and transshipment of domestic and foreign goods and has been known as the "number one port among the five treaty ports that have been open to foreign trade." At a time when China is fully opening itself up to the outside world, Shanghai is not only going all out to restore, but also consolidate its top position. It has become a large exchange center for domestic and foreign capital, commodities, technologies, skilled personnel, and information. Shanghai's function as a market hub is made all the more pronounced with the stepped-up construction of such modern transportation facilities as airports, harbors, railways, and expressways, with the successive establishment of a number of state-level financial and production-factors markets, as well as the construction of the Pudong Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone, the largest bonded zone in China. Seen from the perspective of reform, opening up, and development, Shanghai is now standing at the forefront of China's reform and opening up in the 1990's. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics has brought about an epoch-making transformation to China as a whole. With the implementation of the strategy to develop China's coastal economy in the 1980's, the Zhujiang Basin in south China took the lead in realizing an economic take-off. With the marked increase in the nation's economic strength and the gradual formulation of a strategy for comprehensive reform and opening up in the early 1990's, the Changjiang Basin, with Shanghai as the "locomotive," began to become the important center for China's reform and opening up drive. In April, 1990, the Chinese Government made a strategic decision by opening up and developing the Shanghai New Pudong Zone and called on Shanghai to build itself into one of the international economic, finance, and trade centers. This indicated that Shanghai moved from the sidelines and stepped into the limelight of China's reform and opening up. 2. Shanghai's Reform and Opening Up and Economic Development Have Entered a New Period Here, I would like to report on the economic development, reform, and opening up in Shanghai since the 1990's, particularly in the last several years. (1) The national economy enters a sustained and rapid development stage. In the past, Shanghai's overall economic development speed was lower than that of the nation's average level due to the long practice of a planned economic system. In the entire 1980's, while the nation's GNP grew at 9 percent, Shanghai grew only at 7.4 percent. Shanghai gradually stepped up its development and began to enter the stage of sustained and rapid growth. The municipality scored a GNP growth rate exceeding 14 percent both in 1992 and 1993. Quality of the economic growth, in particular, was greatly enhanced. A number of such new pillar-industries such as car-manufacturing, communications, electronics began to take shape. The proportion of tertiary industry in the municipal national economy grew from 21 percent in 1980 to 38 percent in 1993. It is expected that in the next few years, Shanghai's industrial structure will be further upgraded in a rational manner and the national economy will continue to maintain the momentum of a sustained, rapid, and healthy development. (2) Economic structural reform has been carried out in a comprehensive manner. Since the beginning of the 1990's, Shanghai has carried out indepth reform centering on reforming enterprises, markets, and government's administrative structures, and has scored a number of breakthroughs in progress. It has carried out comprehensive enterprise reforms. Nearly 90 percent of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises adopted various ways to change their operation mechanisms. By the end of 1993, 118 enterprises became limited liability companies, 92 of them became listed companies. Nearly 3,000 state-owned and collective-owned small and medium-sized enterprises experimented with joint stock operations. Some enterprises practiced contracting and leasing operations. The market system was improved. Eleven state-level exchange centers and large-scale exchange markets including securities, metals, grain, and cooking oils were opened one after another, with total transaction amounting to 1,000 billion yuan in 1993, of which the securities exchange market's stock transactions amounted to 520 billion yuan. The foreign exchange regulatory market's transactions in 1993 reached $5.3 billion, up 45 percent from 1992. In the course of a rapid transition from a planned economy to a market economy, the municipal government began to switch from a direct control of the economy to an indirect one and to gradually improve and enhance the economic regulatory and control system. (3) A new pattern of opening up to the outside world is gradually taking shape. With the constant improvement of the soft and hard investment environment, more and more foreign businessmen came to invest in Shanghai over the last two years. Some 100 world-famous transnational companies like Dupont from the United States, Mitsubishi, Hitachi, and Sharp from Japan, Volkswagen from Germany, Bell from Belgium, and the Charoen Pokphand Group from Thailand invested in Shanghai. Some 2,000 foreign enterprises recouped their investment and begun to earn profits. In 1993, Shanghai approved over 3,800 foreign investment projects, of which 3,600 were direct foreign investment. Of the $7.79 billion negotiated foreign investment fund, $3.175 billion was actually invested. Sectors that were opened up for foreign investment also expanded from industrial sectors to other sectors including finance, real estate, domestic and foreign trade, and consultation service. Shanghai approved the opening of 28 foreign bank branches. Shanghai is becoming an open city which has adapted to the development of the world economy. (4) Our efforts to develop the New Pudong Zone have gradually been shifted from building infrastructure facilities to promoting the function of such facilities. In the early 1990's, the Chinese Government decided to develop Pudong. This decision encouraged both Chinese and foreign investors. The construction and development in Pudong were particularly noteworthy as shown in the fact that funds kept flowing into this zone through various channels. The volume of fixed asset investment increased by more than 200 percent every year. By 1993, such investment reached 16.5 billion yuan, representing a growth of nearly 11 times that of 1990. Infrastructure facilities for transportation, energy, communications, and environmental protection, including such backbone projects as the Nanpu Bridge and the Yangpu Bridge, were accomplished one after another, creating to the fullest extent, conditions for improving Shanghai's investment environment. Four key functional sub-zones have been fully developed and put into operation. By the end of 1993, more than 200 projects have been built in the Jinqiao Export Processing Zones. The acreage of the Waigaoqiao Bonded Zone has been expanded to 10 square kilometers, with nearly 200 Chinese and foreign enterprises operating in it. Construction of 54 skyscrapers is under way now in the Lujiazui Banking and Trade Zone. The Zhangjiang High Technology Zone has been put into operation. In 1993, the GNP gained in the New Pudong Zone reached 16.4 billion yuan or, if calculated in terms of comparable price, a 200 percent increase over that of 1990. (5) Large scale infrastructural construction projects have been launched. Friends who visited Shanghai were surprised by the central district's dense population and it's narrow, twisted roads lined with shabby huts, and full of slow-moving traffic. This situation is undergoing a rapid change. In the early 1990's, Shanghai began to fundamentally get rid of a situation in which urban infrastructure facilities lagged behind economic development. The infrastructure facility investment over the past two years is larger than that of the 1987-1992 period. The Shanghai-Jiading and Shanghai-Songjiang Superhighways, the Bund Overall Renovation Project, the renovation projects for Yanggao Road in Pudong and Jiangsu Road in Puxi, the overall renovation projects for Huaihia Road -- a famous commercial district, as well as other major urban transportation projects, have been accomplished one after another. In terms of the length and the acreage of the roads, last year Shanghai witnessed an increase of 62 percent and 53 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The construction of the Line One Subway, the Inner Traffic Link, the Chengdu Viaduct, and other projects are now in full swing. They are expected to be finished and put into service by the end of this year. It is expected that these projects will improve Shanghai's traffic condition. Breakthrough progress has been made in renovating old housing districts. In 1993, Shanghai accomplished its housing renovation projects with a total floor space of 2.58 million square meters. It is expected that Shanghai will basically accomplish the task of renovating old housing districts by the end of this century. 3. The Prospect For Shanghai's Reform, Opening Up, and Economic Development The twenty first century will be a century for great changes in the world's economic scene. Representing a forerunner of China's reform and opening up drive, Shanghai faces an once-in-a-thousand-year opportunity for development. It takes great courage, profound wisdom, long-term strategy, and clear thinking to seize the opportunity and meet the challenge. In light of the overall pattern for the state's economic development, reform, and opening up, Shanghai has adopted its strategic goal for the next century. We are ready to build Shanghai into one of the world's economic, banking, and trade centers in about 20 years of time. Pudong will basically be turned into a new urban district -- an export-oriented, multi-functional, modern area boasting the top world standards. The following three steps are needed to achieve this goal: To lay a foundation before 1995, to form a framework before 2000, and to basically realize the goal before 2010. To achieve its long-term development goal, Shanghai will devote its efforts to the following tasks in the 1990's: While taking the lead in the establishment of the operation mechanism of a socialist market economy and striving to maintain around 10 percent GNP growth, Shanghai will accelerate the pace of allowing the domestic economy to dovetail with the international economy. The city will carry out a series of major measures that are suitable to Shanghai, including: (1) In accordance with the policy of improving Shanghai's economy quicker and better than other localities, Shanghai will carry out a comprehensive reform of the enterprise system. Shanghai is a place where state-owned enterprises, and especially state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, concentrate. Bringing into full play the guiding role of the state-owned economic sector will be of great importance to achieving the goal of developing Shanghai's economy. To achieve this goal, Shanghai will spare no efforts in reappraising the stocks and assets of enterprises, defining property rights, appraising properties and other fundamental work so as to accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system. Enterprises with favorable conditions should adopt the corporate system, with the limited responsibility company as a main form. Efforts should be made to improve enterprises' organizational systems and set up large chain enterprises, conglomerate firms, enterprise groups, and multinational companies. In this way, we can help enterprises enter the highly competitive domestic and international markets as an army group and turn them into a major factor for promoting Shanghai's economic development. (2) To accelerate the establishment of a modern large market system that extends over all regions. Shanghai will devote itself to setting up markets for stocks, futures, off-shore banking, gold trading, foreign exchange, and real estate -- all of the things that embody the functions of a metropolitan city. It will take active measures to create favorable conditions to allow the domestic economy to dovetail with the international economy. It will form as soon as possible a modern large market system facilitating the circulation of domestic and international funds, commodities, technologies, talented personnel, and information. (3) To form a large batch of modern industrial enterprises. Shanghai will accelerate the strategic adjustment of its industrial structure. It will focus on the development of banking, trade, real estate, tourism, and other tertiary industries. It will accelerate the development of pillar industries such as limousines, electronic communications, steel, petrochemical industry, chemical industry, and power station equipment. It will take active measures to promote high and new technological industry, with the focus on microelectronic and bioengineering projects. In this way, Shanghai will be able to bring its industrial advantages into full play. By the end of this century, these industries will become industries with an economic scale of more than scores of billions of yuan. Their added output value will account for more than 50 percent of Shanghai's GNP. (4) Shanghai will accelerate construction of urban infrastructural projects that are suitable for a modern cosmopolitan city. In accordance with the requirements for developing a modern cosmopolitan city, Shanghai will comprehensively carry out a series of infrastructural construction projects including telecommunications, energy resources, water supply, sewage, and environmental protection, while regarding the overall communications programs as its key projects. Shanghai will accelerate construction of a second international airport, the Pudong International Telecommunications Center, an all-weather deepwater port, underground railways across the whole municipality, and ring roads. Eventually Shanghai will become a modern cosmopolitan city that has rational urban structural designs, advanced traffic networks, efficient telecommunications facilities, and a favorable ecological environment. (5) Shanghai will further develop and open up Pudong to the outside world. With a total area of about 520 sq km, the Pudong New District is more than seven times the size of Puxi's central urban areas, is a new domain for Shanghai to develop its economy, and has enormous potential for further development. Shanghai will initially implement a comprehensive policy of reform and opening up in the Pudong New District in an effort to accelerate its development and opening up in an all-around manner. By the year 2000, Pudong will have an urban area of 100 sq km with an increased GNP value of 50 billion yuan. After accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, the Pudong New District will eventually become a pioneer and exemplary zone linking Chinese and international markets in an all-around manner. (6) Shanghai will gradually implement a strategy for establishing the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere. To achieve its future economic progress, Shanghai must make full use of the advantages of its special location, and comprehensively develop all its strategic economic aspects for progress. In accordance with the concept of "restructuring the central urban areas, building more secondary cities, upgrading the system of suburban cities and towns, and strengthening the link with a network of neighboring cities," we will establish the greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere that "has several groups and circles with different centers which will, in turn, have ripple effects on one another." The greater Shanghai metropolitan sphere will have four different circles including a modern financial and trading circle, a highly-specialized processing industrial circle, a highly-efficient agricultural circle, and a circle of neighboring cities. Hence, Shanghai will make fresh contributions to eventually orchestrating economic progress in the Changjiang River delta and to rapidly enhancing China's economic development. When the time comes, we will cruise smoothly in the sea, cross the oceans, and face the world. Shanghai people are enthusiastically and unremittingly designing a blueprint geared to the 21st century. Global economic prosperity relies on joint efforts of mankind. Today Shanghai, with its ongoing reform and opening up to the outside world, yearns anxiously, as never before, to enhance cooperation and exchanges with various countries in the world. To realize its splendid objectives of development, Shanghai must face the world and open up to the outside world in an all-round manner. At present, Shanghai has become China's most favorable area for investors. I sincerely hope old and new friends from various countries in the world will come to invest and launch joint ventures in Shanghai so as to share together the forthcoming enormous benefits that will arise from the invigoration of Shanghai and from the development of Pudong.
