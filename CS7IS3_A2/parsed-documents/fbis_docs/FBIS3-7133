Currently, only 64 per cent available satellite capacity is in use. In a presentation before a Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (PECC) meeting, Wahyu Wi Jayadi, general manager of the Medan Division of PT Indosat Indonesia, said that with such a level of utilization, the tendency for each country or even private company to have its own system will increase competition among satellite capacity providers despite continued growth in demand. New system planners must be wary. Speaking on the topic "The Emerging Demand for Satellite Communications in the Pacific Rim", Wijayadi said, "There is no doubt that the demand for satellite transponders in the Asia-Pacific region will grow considerably in the near future. The demand is driven by several factors such as globalization, a trend which is (influencing) more and more sectors; the (high economic) growth in most Asia-Pacific countries and the climate of deregulation in the telecommunications industry which has become more concrete." Another significant factor contributing to growing demand for satellite communication systems is the development of TV broadcasting systems in the region, he added. In line with the rapid economic growth in the region, the International Telecommunications Union estimated that around US$100 billion will be invested in regional telecommunications development between 1992 and 2000. The second factor is the pressing need to rectify the mismatch between demand and supply for access to a simple dial tone. Nearly 3 billion people in the Asia-Pacific region have access to only a little more than 115 million lines, translating to about one telephone line for every 26 people. "Anticipating the future conditions of world economics, one of the tools that every country races to develop is a satellite communications system," he said. Historically, most telecommunications operators in Asia-Pacific have been government or state-owned companies with a monopoly market structure. In order to catch up with developments in technology and consumer expectations of better quality service, governments have been forced to rethink these monopolies and to restructure the regulatory framework of the telecommunications sector in each country. The general objectives of the public sector in deregulating telecommunications are to improve the quality of services to the public and businesses, to create a climate more responsive to market demand, to encourage technological innovation in creating new services, to achieve a competitive tariff structure, to expand telecommunications businesses and find alternative sources to finance these developments. In a dramatic development for broadcasters, satellites are being used to transmit television programmes. Several broadcasters using the technology have established a significant presence in the Asia-Pacific region--STAR TV, Prime Spot, MTV Asia, BBC World Service and others. This trend will also contribute to the growth in demand for satellite communications. In the past, the telecommunications industry has not been customer driven, suppliers traditionally decided what their users would have and provided it to them as a service without alternatives. The industry has largely operated on the principle that supply creates demand. Market segmentation and the tailoring of products and services for specific customers have been precluded by regulations and by the complacency of non-competitive,industries. But Wijayadi predicted that customers will have increasing influence as deregulation and technological development continue. "End users of telecommunications must be viewed as customers. These consumers now have choices, and their applications driven needs for sophisticated telecommunications capabilities will exert pressure on vendors to respond to market demand." A significant factor in the growing power of customers is the changing role of the telecommunications management function in client organizations. These changes are outlined in the accompanying table. Satellite communications services in the Asia-Pacific region are served by several satellite systems including Intelsat and Inmarsat. There are four domestic Intelsat satellites in the Indian Ocean region providing public communications services such as telephone, telex facsimile and new Intelsat service such as IBS, IDR, Vista. "Satellite communications systems are entering an era of increasing competition with more advanced technology. Global competitions have the tendency to be more unpredictable, and so it has become in the Asia-Pacific region," he noted.
