FR940106-0-00063 FR940106-0-00018 Widow rockfish. A new assessment was conducted for widow rockfish which explored the consequences of near-term landings between 5,000&hyph;7,000 mt. If recent recruitment remains near the average, then stock abundance is expected to remain nearly constant with annual landings of 7,000 mt (which would, including discards, indicate a total harvest of 8,150 mt) in 1994&hyph;1996. With annual harvest at 6,500 mt, stock abundance would be expected to increase slightly towards its target level. However, the assessment also provides a plausible alternative, based on lower stock abundance and recent recruitment at a lower, median level, which would support landings of only 5,000 mt during 1994&hyph;1996. Given this uncertainty, the ABC and HG are both set at 6,500 mt for 1994. Thornyheads. The ABCs for shortspine and longspine thornyheads are the same as in 1993. The two species of thornyhead cannot be practically separated in the landings, so, as in 1993, the 1994 harvest guideline is set for the combined species. However, like POP, the harvest guideline is adjusted so that it applies only to landed catch in 1994. Under the assumption that equal amounts of each species will be in the catch, the harvest guideline is set at 6,440 mt for both species combined (the 1993 harvest guideline of 7,000 mt, which represented the total catch, minus 8 percent for trip limit induced discards). This would result in a shortspine thornyhead catch equal to its overfishing level of 3,500 mt and a longspine catch that is less than its ABC of 10,100 mt. However, the percentage of shortspine thornyheads in 1991 and 1992 has been lower than 50 percent, and therefore the catches in these years have been below the overfishing level. During the first half of 1993, shortspine contributed only 35 percent of the thornyhead landings. If the percentage shortspine in 1994 remains at this reduced level as expected, the 1994 catch would be 2,450 mt, well below the overfishing level. Yellowtail rockfish. A new stock assessment was conducted which indicates that 1983 and 1984 were stronger year classes than previously thought. The ABCs which were applied to the Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas separately in the past, are applied to different subareas in 1994, coinciding with the subareas used in the new stock assessment. These areas are: The Eureka subarea combined with the Columbia subarea south of Cape Falcon (40 ○30 ’ to 45 ○46 ’ N. latitude); the Columbia subarea north of Cape Falcon (45 ○46 ’ to 47 ○30 ’ N. latitude); and the Vancouver subarea between 47 ○30 ’ and 49 ○00 ’ N. latitude which includes Canadian waters. In the north Columbia subarea, the assessment indicates a stock that is slowly declining, and further declines are expected as the 1983&hyph;1984 year class moves through the stock. The 1994 4,160 mt ABC in this area is higher than the 1992 catch and similar to average catches between 1986&hyph;1989. In the Vancouver subarea, which extends into Canadian waters, there are contrary indicators of stock condition. Trawl survey data indicate a stable healthy stock from 1980&hyph;1992, whereas age composition data do not indicate a particularly strong 1983&hyph;1984 year class and implies a steeply declining stock. Therefore the ABC for the Vancouver subarea is more conservative, based on the lower end of the optimistic scenario in the stock assessment, and the U.S. portion is estimated at 60 percent, or 1,190 mt. In the southern subareas (Eureka/south Columbia), the stock is believed to have recently increased because of the strong 1983&hyph;1984 year classes, but will experience a declining trend as the strong year classes are exploited. In 1993, 300 mt of the ABC was set aside for the Eureka subarea, and a harvest guideline, equal to the sum of the ABCs, was set only for the U.S. Vancouver/Columbia subareas combined. In 1994, however, two harvest guidelines are set for yellowtail rockfish, dividing the U.S. Vancouver, Columbia, and Eureka subareas at Cape Falcon, Oregon. The 4,160 mt harvest guideline in the northern subareas (U.S. Vancouver/north Columbia) is the sum of the ABCs. In the southern area (south Columbia/Eureka), the harvest guideline is set equal to the ABC of 2,580 mt. Remaining rockfish. Remaining rockfish in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas includes all rockfish except POP, widow rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, bocaccio and chilipepper rockfish. The ABCs for remaining rockfish have been unchanged since 1983. The ABCs in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas were set at 1.2 times the 1977 catch, for a total of 9,500 mt. During 1983&hyph;1992, the catch of remaining rockfish in this area has ranged from 5,100 mt to 7,200 mt with an average of 6,600 mt. Although annual catches never have achieved the 9,500 mt ABC, an examination of declines in average length for several rockfish species suggests that the fishery is having a noticeable impact. Although there is insufficient information to conduct a quantitative stock assessment for the remaining rockfish in this southern area, an increase in effort in this area should not be encouraged, and therefore the ABC is reduced to 7,000 mt, the upper range of harvest in recent years. Remaining rockfish in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas are defined as all rockfish except POP, yellowtail rockfish, canary rockfish, widow rockfish, and shortbelly rockfish. The ABC is not changed in 1994. Remaining rockfish are included in both the northern and southern harvest guidelines for the Sebastes complex. Sebastes complex. The Sebastes complex includes all rockfish except widow, shortbelly, Pacific ocean perch, and thornyheads. North: The harvest guideline for the Sebastes complex in the Vancouver-Columbia area has been, and continues to be, the sum of the ABCs of the species in that area, and therefore is 13,240 mt in 1994. It is calculated by adding the ABCs for canary and remaining rockfish in the Vancouver and Columbia subareas, and for yellowtail rockfish in the Vancouver, Columbia and Eureka subareas and then subtracting 300 mt, an estimate of the yellowtail ABC in the Eureka subarea. South: A harvest guideline of 13,440 mt is established for the first time for the Sebastes complex in the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas, based on the sum of the ABCs of the species in those subareas (bocaccio, chilipepper, yellowtail rockfish, and remaining rockfish). The decline in average size of some the Sebastes species in this southern area, particularly dark-blotched rockfish, indicated a need to keep effort from expanding. Uncertainty generated by the new limited-entry management regime in 1994 prompted the Council to recommend a harvest guideline to better respond to effort shifts during the season. Dover sole. There is no change to any of the subarea or coastwide ABCs for Dover sole. At its November 1992 meeting, to mitigate the economic impact of abrupt reductions in ABC, the Council adopted a policy to reduce the harvest (and therefore the harvest guideline) in the Columbia subarea by 1,000 mt annually until the 4,000 mt ABC for that subarea is reached in 1995. This is the second year of the step-down, and therefore the harvest guideline in the Columbia subarea is reduced from 6,000 mt in 1993 to 5,000 mt in 1994, 1,000 mt above the 1994 ABC. Consequently, the coastwide harvest guideline, which is the sum of the subarea harvest guidelines, is 16,900 mt, 1,000 mt higher than the sum of the ABCs. As stated at 58 FR 2994 (January 7, 1993), the risk of overfishing Dover sole in the Columbia subarea is not appreciably increased by setting the harvest guideline greater than the ABC in 1993 and 1994. The Columbia subarea catch has declined from an average of 7,970 mt in 1988&hyph;1991 to 5,665 mt in 1992, and landings are expected to be about 5,800 mt in 1993.
