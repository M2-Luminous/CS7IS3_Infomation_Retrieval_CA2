I very much hope that this time, they will be held on a much more businesslike basis than in the past. [Sukenik] Last night you spoke to 'Arafat on the phone. Other than discussing the UN Security Council resolution, did you make any promises to him that made him push to move forward? [Rabin] I made no specific offers, except for stressing that the Palestinians as well as ourselves should in no way grant awards to loathsome murderers on both sides. They should not give any prizes to Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] or the Islamic Jihad, and we will not give any awards to the supporters of the loathsome murderer who committed the abhorrent crime in the Cave of the Patriarchs. [Sukenik] Is the issue of evacuating settlers from Hebron still off the agenda? [Rabin] I made no commitment, except for the pledge to stand by our responsibility -- in addition to the struggle against the Palestinian extremist terrorism which seeks to murder Israelis and the peace -- to provide the Palestinians with protection against loathsome murderers the likes of that man, who does not deserve to be called a human being, who committed the murder in the Cave of the Patriarchs.
