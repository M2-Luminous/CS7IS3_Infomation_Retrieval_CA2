Speaking before the U.S.-Nicaraguan Chamber of Commerce, Leal said the privileged access of Mexican products to the United States places Central America at a disadvantage. In turn, he urged that "a transition period" of about three years be adopted to allow the region to concentrate on improving competitiveness while it adheres to NAFTA. The minister recalled that the presidents of the region had met with President Bill Clinton in November 1993 and that they proposed that the region enter the treaty under the same terms received by Mexico. However, he noted that unfavorable conditions in Central America -- a postwar economy and a technological lag -- prevented the region from advancing at the same pace maintained by more developed countries. Today, about 50 percent of Central America's exports, which amount to some $4.5 billion, are shipped to U.S. markets.
