Following the high economic growth in 1992 and 1993, this has been another year of rapid progress. With all economic relations stretched tightly, the inflationary pressures are unprecedented. The situation in which two-thirds of large and medium state enterprises operate at a loss has been increasingly serious. The living standard of urban residents, especially the workers and staff members of state-owned enterprises, has dropped to some extent. Due to the problems they are experiencing in their lives, they may set themselves against the government at any time. Meanwhile, there is also a lack of coordination between the central and local authorities on whether the scale of capital construction should be reduced. Furthermore, April, May, and June are the most sensitive months politically. The CPC hierarchy is worried that, if the political and economic problems unite into a single force through mutual ignition and intensification, it will be difficult to keep the situation under control. Taking into account the practical situation, the Chinese authorities have repeatedly stressed that stability is the prerequisite of reform and development since the beginning of this year. CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed in early April that "stability comes before everything else." [wending yadao yiqie 4489 1353 1090 0227 0001 0434] In mid-May he again pointed out the need to always "grasp stability as a matter of prime importance." Hence, people cannot but feel that there may be some unspeakable worries behind the authorities' emphasis on stability. Views of the Two Party Elders on Stability Are Identical This writer revealed on 13 May in this column that it was Deng Xiaoping who had the patent rights for the remark that "stability comes before everything else." According to a source in Beijing, the patent rights for "grasping stability as a matter of prime importance" belong to Chen Yun. During his inspection tour of Shanghai between 26 April and 6 May, Jiang went to Hangzhou to visit Chen Yun. After hearing Jiang's report on the recent work, Chen gave a 12-character assessment, meaning "a correct judgment of the current political situation and a resolute and realistic way of doing things." Chen added: "Over the past few years, the economy has developed, society has been stable, and the people's livelihood has improved. All this shows that, despite having many tasks to perform, we must grasp stability as a matter of prime importance. Otherwise, we shall pay a heavy price. If any country, big or small, is unstable socially and politically, there will be turmoil. Some political forces in the West hope for the emergence of great chaos and peaceful evolution in China and, therefore, we should not lower our guard." As Chen Yun and Deng Xiaoping share identical views on stability, the CPC hierarchy is able to carry it out more satisfactorily. To ensure that there will be no problems in April, May, and June, the CPC hierarchy has adopted three measures: First, step up control over news media and propaganda. To this end, the CPC Central Committee Propaganda Department has especially set up a "press censorship" organ, which is responsible for examining and analyzing the propaganda trends of newspapers and journals at central, provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels and making a report to the central Political Bureau every week. If problems detrimental to stability are spotted, the newspapers and journals will be banned immediately. The CPC hierarchy demands that no statements that undermine stability be allowed to appear in newspapers and journals, particularly during April, May, and June. Second, tighten supervision and control over "pro-democracy activists" and "political dissidents." It is especially necessary to guard against these people going out among the workers and staff members of money-losing state-owned enterprises and taking advantage of the dissatisfaction of unemployed workers to carry out sabotage. To this end, the CPC hierarchy has instructed all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions by cable to set up a "Leading Group for Preventing Chaos and Dealing With Emergencies," which has been specially tasked to handle these matters. Third, step up ideological and political work among enterprise workers and staff members who are having material difficulties and make good arrangements for their livelihood to prevent the workers' dissatisfaction from spreading into society. Chen Yun Says There Are 10 Major Economic Problems The source said: While stressing that stability is a matter of prime importance, Chen Yun also talked to Jiang Zemin about 10 points for attention in economic construction, as follows: 1) In determining the speed of economic growth, we should proceed from our national strength and guard against "overheating"; 2) in economic construction, we should consistently put efficiency in the first place and prevent "excesses"; 3) in reforming state-owned enterprises, which are the basis of the state economy, we should base ourselves on improving, readjusting, and transforming them rather than closing them down, suspending operations, merging them with others, or selling them; 4) it is necessary to have an appropriate scale of capital construction, to act in strict accordance with planning, and to apply administrative measures in solving the problem of capital construction getting out of control; 5) the CPC Central Committee and the State Council should curb the practice of getting credits or calling loans in violation of the regulations or through personal notes, which is still fairly serious, and deal with cadres who violate the regulations; 6) it is necessary to keep inflation under control and create a situation of a low inflation rate and a fairly high economic growth, which has Chinese characteristics; 7) as the center of the state's economy and finance, the taxation system should be improved and strictly enforced, and the law should be applied to plug up loopholes and crack down on violations; 8) it is necessary to pay attention to unemployment and work stoppages and to make job placement a routine official business, and there should be medium- and long-term planning for job placement; 9) we should emphasize doing a good job in agricultural production, communications facilities, energy development, and residential housing; and 10) we should sum up the craze in real estate, stock market, and securities speculation and draw up legislation and regulations to properly solve these problems rather than let the situation become anarchy, which will adversely tarnish the state's reputation and causes confusion in people's minds. What Is the Difference Between the Economic Concepts of Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun? An economist in Beijing pointed out: The guiding idea of Chen Yun's 10-point view on economic construction is basically the same as that of his talk during the Spring Festival. Both are based on "stability," but it is different from what Deng Xiaoping advocates. Take as an example their talks in Shanghai during the Spring Festival. Deng praised Shanghai's good and rapid development, saying that Shanghai must speedily bring into play its role as a "locomotive" in promoting China's rapid economic growth, and he again stressed Shanghai's important strategic position in promoting China's economic development. Chen, however, stressed his consistent idea, namely, "the scale and speed of construction must be suited to national strength" and "it is necessary to strengthen the central authority and concentrate all energy on handling major issues." To be specific, Deng Xiaoping stresses the decentralization of power, maintaining that regional economic development (such as Shanghai) has a more important role in the overall situation; Chen Yun, however, lays stress on centralization of power, holding that the strengthening of central authority plays the most fundamental role in the overall situation. Deng holds that "development is the last word," that a basic balance of speed, scale, and national strength can be attained in the course of seeking development, and that this is more compatible with the objective law than the practice of defining first a "national strength criterion" and then the development of scale and speed. Chen, however, holds that it is of the greatest importance to first define a "national strength criterion" and that only by keeping development scale and speed in a predefined range can we genuinely act according to the objective law and ensure the healthy growth of the economy. Deng maintains that the market economy enables limited resources to be most efficiently developed and that the market economic structure is the basis for explaining "why economic scale and speed frequently exceed the predetermined range." Chen, however, regards the market economic factor as a limited supplementary factor to the planned economic structure rather than an economic means that can play an objective function to the economic situation as a whole. The economist stressed: The lack of coordination between Deng Xiaoping's and Chen Yun's economic ideas is one reason why the CPC hierarchy has been vacillating on the major issue of handling the relationship between reform and development. The CPC hierarchy is trying to strike a balance between the different economic views of the two party elders. There are indications that Chen's view is more readily acceptable to the hierarchy, while Deng's view is more readily acceptable to the local authorities. This is also an important reason why there are often contradictions between the central and local authorities.
