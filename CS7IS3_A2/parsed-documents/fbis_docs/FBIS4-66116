During his press conference here, Foreign Minister Martino said "the position adopted by President Tudjman is not justified by any attitude or position on our part.... Italy's position is that we see absolutely no problem about borders. We have never considered treaties to be pieces of paper to be torn up. Bilateral questions may exist, obviously, and we hope they can be resolved in a friendly way on a bilateral level and which satisfies both sides." President Tudjman had said, at the weekend, that die-hard Italian fascists had to give up, once and for all, any and all claims to coastal provinces of Croatia. Asked whether the treaty of Osimo, which defined the Italo-Yugoslav border, could be re-opened, the Italian diplomatic chief recalled how Slovenia and Croatia had legally replaced Yugoslavia and that the treaty "must be respected and, in some cases, even applied." The existing bilateral questions were listed by the minister as those regarding the real estate purchases by Italians and free circulation of persons. (In Brussels, Defense Minister Preveti said no disputes were open between Italy and Croatia and that, at most, only adjustments needed to be made which took into account the new political reality.)
