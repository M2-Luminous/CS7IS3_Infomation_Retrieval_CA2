Al-Ghazali Notes Need to Implement `Divine Injunctions' AUTHORITIES CONTINUE DETENTION OF 33 LAWYERS An approximately 450-word report on pages 1 and 7 by Mu'tazz al- Hadidi indicates that the Central Cairo Prosecution Office has extended for 15 days the detention of 33 lawyers who were arrested in connection with the Lawyers Association incidents. It adds that the Prosecution Office released 15 others, including 6 citizens who were arrested randomly off the streets during a clash between police and lawyers, and it names the freed lawyers. Al-Hadidi says the freed lawyers assembled at the court and protested the continued detention of their colleagues; meanwhile the security forces surrounded the court. A number of lawyers who attended the court session held a meeting at which they called for a expanded conference of lawyers on Thursday and formed a committee, made up of 24 lawyers, to act as a link between the Bar Association Council and the lawyers. The report says that over 250 lawyers who attended the meeting decided to keep the offices of the detained lawyers operating. It adds that the lawyers issued a statement after the conference saying that "we lawyers will not retreat, despite the bombs and arrests, but will continue the escalation in continuation of the Egyptian lawyers' awakening and national uprising, which history will record came after the assassination of 'Abd-al-Harith Madani." The lawyers affirmed, the report says, that "the regime" is making "overt" attempts to "discourage" the lawyers and "bury their revolution" and that they will not forget their "primary motive," the murder of their colleague, lawyer 'Abd-al-Harith Madani. HUMAN RIGHTS BODY PROTESTS MILITARY TRIBUNALS, EXECUTIONS An approximately 350-word report on pages 1 and 7 says the Egyptian Human Rights Organization [EHRO] has issued a statement on the trial of 17 defendants charged with the attempted assassination of Interior Minister Hasan al-Alfi, The statement expresses concern over the continued military trials. The report adds that the EHRO "notes its regret that its repeated appeals to the Egyptian authorities to stop referring civilians to military courts and to stop enforcing sentences passed by these courts have not met response." The organization appeals to all "civil society institutions" and all Arab and world human rights organizations to urge the Egyptian authorities to stop these military tribunals. ARTICLE URGES IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH SUDAN An approximately 1,800-word article on page 2 by Major General Tal'at Musallam discusses the current deterioration of Egyptian- Sudanese ties, reviewing each side's claims and accusations against the other. Urging improved relations between the two countries by consolidating previous bilateral accords, the author asserts the need to insure Sudan's territorial integrity and for Egypt not to support any resolution placing Sudan on the list of countries sponsoring terrorism. He notes that the contentious points between the two countries include the Hala'ib border dispute, mutual media propaganda, and Egypt's refusal in April to extradite the hijacker of a Sudanese plane. COURT HEARING OF LAWYERS CASE REPORTED Page 3 of AL-SHA'B features an approximately 700-word report by Khalid Yunus on the Southern Cairo Court's session "last Thursday," in which the court extended the detention of the lawyers arrested in connection with the Bar Association demonstration. Yunus says thousands of lawyers as well as the detainees' families assembled in the court yard and that anger and enthusiasm gripped everyone, who shouted slogans like "Long live the Bar Association" and "Prison has never changed a thought." He adds that hundreds of Central Security Forces personnel were deployed inside the court equipped with tear gas bombs and rubber bullets, poised to "repeat the tragedy of striking against the lawyers inside their association on 17 May." The reporter says that a defense lawyer moved that the items seized at the site of the lawyers' arrest are not proof of a crime. The items included a video cassette of a debate at a book fair two years ago between Shaykh Muhammad al-Ghazali, Dr. Muhammad 'Amarah, and Dr. Faraj Fudah, a video cassette on Bosnia-Herzegovina, and another cassette on Afghanistan. The reporter adds that the doyen of Lawyers Ahmad al-Khawajah in his defense statement denied that the Muslim Brotherhood members of the Bar Association had prompted the lawyers to demonstrate or that "overzealous" young lawyers had accused the association of inaction and demanded "serious moves." WRITER CRITICIZES ORGANIZATION OF NATIONAL DIALOGUE On page 5, AL-SHA'B publishes an approximately 2,000-word article by Dr. Muhammad Hilmi Murad, who criticizes the ruling National Democratic Party's call for a national dialogue and its organization of the dialogue. The writer says there is an intention to "overstep" the role of the preparatory committee of the dialogue and "jump" directly to convening the conference without prior agreement among the parties concerned on the tasks entrusted with them. He adds that by specifying the "legitimate" national forces who are to take part in the dialogue, the ruling party disparages the Muslim Brotherhood as an organization. But, he continues, it is inconceivable that the ruling party will exclude from the dialogue all leading personalities in Islamic thought who act as individuals and intellectuals, or al-Azhar University in its capacity as a cultural institution with an Islamic character. Murad notes: "The Constitution, which is currently intended to be violated, stipulates that Islam is the national religion and that the Islamic shari'ah principles are the primary guides for legislation. Naturally, nothing prevents the participation of anyone who represents the Christian intellectual trend." MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD OFFICIAL URGES NO CONFRONTATION Muslim Brotherhood Deputy General Guide Mustafa Mashhur writes a 2,000-word article on page 5, noting the "artificial security and media campaign" against the Muslim Brotherhood and urging patience. (Text filed as NC1106152694 and adds) OFFICIALS ASSERT AL-GHAZALI NOT BANNED FROM SPEECHES A 170-word report on the same page says that after "the public's overwhelming anger," officials "rushed" to meet Shaykh Muhammad al- Ghazali to assert to him that he was not banned from making speeches. The report adds that the interior minister met Shaykh al-Ghazali "last week" and affirmed to him before "television and press cameras" that the Interior Ministry views him with "every appreciation and respect and that it would be nonsensical for the ministry to ban his speeches." This week, the report says, the Awqaf minister visited al-Ghazali at his home and confirmed to him that his ministry has nothing to do with banning him from speeches. IRAN'S VELAYATI VIEWS TIES WITH ARABS, TERRORISM, BOSNIA Page 6 features a 1,800-word interview with Iranian Foreign Minister Velayati, who discusses relations with the Arabs, terrorism, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. (Text filed as NC1006160594 and adds) ARTICLE VIEWS CAMPAIGN AGAINST ISLAMISTS, MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD In an approximately 1,000-word article on page 7, the author, Dr. Majdi Qarqar, discuses campaign against Muslim Brotherhood leaders and the "Islamic trend." (Text filed as NC1106181794 and add) WRITER NOTES ANTI-ISLAM POLICY IN TUNISIA In an approximately 1,800-word article on page 8, Lutfi Bin-Ramadan reviews Tunisian-Algerian relations. He notes that the "ruling secular elite" in Tunisia is aware that its "war of annihilation" against the Islamic movement cannot end up in its favor in "an Arab and Islamic environment permeated by Islamic awakening and in an international environment quickly heading toward democracy." Therefore, he says, the Tunisian "regime" took the "fight against fundamentalism as an ideology to all international forums." The writer says that the situation in Algeria has confused the Tunisian regime and made it lose its balance so badly that it will be difficult to predict the regime's behavior should the Islamists take power in Algeria. He notes three possibilities: First, the Tunisian regime may open up to the Islamic opposition, free its prisoners, and restore democracy. The author dismisses this possibility because the "ruling elite" is "indulging in hostility to Islam as a religion." The second possibility is that it will concentrate on the economic aspect, the flow of Western financial aid, and turn a blind eye to "the laundering of drug money." The third option is that Tunisia might play the same role the "Iraqi regime" played in the Iranian revolution. This option does not exclude the possibility of Tunisia turning into a "base where foreign forces--especially the French who are linked with the Tunisian regime by a joint defense pact--would assemble." EUROPEAN RACIST POLICIES AGAINST ARAB, MUSLIM MIGRANTS CITED An approximately 900-word report on page 8 by Muhammad Jamal 'Arafah discusses European countries' recent measures to restrict the flow of foreign emigrants, especially Arabs and Muslims. The reporter cites regulations in many European countries to reduce the number of Arab and Muslim migrants, deport some of them, and incorporate others in the "fabric" of these countries. AL-GHAZALI NOTES NEED TO IMPLEMENT `DIVINE INJUNCTIONS' AL-SHA'B publishes on page 12 a 380-word article written by Muhammad al-Ghazali, who criticizes a television debate by three intellectuals on the books and views of some late Islamic intellectuals. Commenting on the debate, al-Ghazali says that blocking "God's ruling is a crime" and notes the need to implement "divine injunctions and curb human whims."
