Relations with Germany occupy an important place in our entire policy, Meksi said at the beginning of his speech. This is based on the special economic assistance and the full political support that your country has rendered to Albania so far and in the good wishes and will of both sides further to strengthen our friendly relations. Talking concretely about the present level of cooperation in the economic, political, technical, scientific, and cultural spheres, Meksi considered these to be successful and stressed that, nevertheless, there exist more favorable possibilities so that these relations be more intensively developed in other fields as well. Important positive factors are the good progress of the economic reform in Albania in its main indices and the completion of the fundamental legal framework to attract foreign investment. Overall production has increased and there is a decrease in the budget deficit and inflation. Stability can be noticed in the lek's exchange rate with foreign currencies. We can say that we have left behind the most difficult period. We have approved the main laws on investment, business, and the banking and credit system, and the civil and penal codes are in the process of being approved. Meksi further stressed that the completion of a series of bilateral agreements that are in the process of being drafted, such as the abolition of double taxation, tourism, road and maritime transportation, and scientific and cultural cooperation, will create a more facilitating legal framework to expand relations between our two countries. Focusing on the problem of foreign investment, Prime Minister Meksi said that German capital is involved in Albania in special investment, such as that of Siemens for Rinas Airport, and in the form of joint ventures. However, he said, we expect German investment to grow considerably during 1994 and beyond and to include such fields as infrastructure and telecommunication, road constructions, such as the east-west road, aqueducts, energy, etc. We greatly appreciate Germany's role both on the bilateral level and within the framework of the European Union [EU], in which Germany is the main contributor. Mr. Meksi also dwelt on the problem of the foreign debt of our banks and discussed ways of settling it, as another guarantee for attracting foreign investment. He stressed that contacts with German partners have been strengthened and hoped that with the Paris Club Agreement, this problem will find the way to solution in the framework of the general debt. For his part, Mr. Kinkel said that Germany understands quite well the difficult problems that you are encountering during the transitional period and that Germany is committed to help as before on the bilateral and the EU level. Albania is a country that has suffered the most in the past. That is why you fully deserve special assistance on our part, Kinkel stressed. Germany will fully support you in your goals for an the quickest possible political and economic approach to the EU, membership into the Council of Europe, the cooperation with BEP [expansion unknown], and the strengthening of the security of your country, both with the NATO integration and the bilateral level. For this reason, we are ready to exchange high-level visits and sign a joint statement to display our very good relations and the goals of cooperation in the future. In the economic level, our assistance will be increased and will be concentrated on the system of energy supplies, the construction of roads, economic development, etc. Though we have to face our problems with eastern Germany, our attention toward Albania will be increased. I also agree to abolish visas for diplomatic and business trips. Further on, Kinkel appreciated the achievements in the sphere of the institutional and legal reform and expressed his pleasure that the judicial system is functioning well. He was ready for assistance in this direction as well. To conclude, Meksi said that Albania is a small country and with a little investment, it can overcome this situation. We have understood that the main factor of development is within us, our work, which, with your assistance, can give rapid positive results. They also discussed German assistance in education, culture, and science, the problem of Albanian refugees, and the situation in the region.
