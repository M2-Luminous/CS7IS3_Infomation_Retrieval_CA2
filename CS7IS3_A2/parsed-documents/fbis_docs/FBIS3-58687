"There are increasing signs that the rapid decline in industrial investments is coming to an end," the Munich-based institute writes in its latest analysis. In the more probable event of a clear acceleration in the export sector and further more pronounced interest rate reductions, a real increase of 3 percent (following minus 3 percent in 1993) in plant investment could be expected in 1994. If, however, the pressures of the domestic economic situation were to increase, a further slight decline of 1 per cent was possible. In either case the negative development in investment expenditure in industry was likely to continue, in the more favourable scenario by minus 6 per cent, in the unfavourable one by minus 11 per cent (following the minus 12 per cent calculated for 1993). In 1992 investment expenditure in industry was DM127 billion and DM721 billion for all economic sectors. Investment in the former east German states continues to rise, whereby the mining, energy and services sectors as well as -- in the medium-term -- transportation predominate. Investment in the former east Germany increased by around 15 per cent despite the recession in 1993. In broad sectors of the west German economy, however, the downturn in investment was much more pronounced than even in the most unfavourable scenario, for example in trade, transport, in industry and also in agriculture, according to the Ifo. In the medium-term, the high investment level of the early 1990's could be regained in 1996 at the earliest. In the purchase of capital goods, data processing equipment and office machinery are likely to remain key areas of growth until 1998. The Ifo Institute warned against hoping for overly large economic impulses from the GATT agreement on the liberalization of world trade, reached in mid-December 1993. A definitive assessment of the outcome was not yet possible. The agreement was basically positive, although only a partial success had been achieved in some areas. Failure had only been prevented by excluding some areas or giving compensation. To describe the agreement as a "huge" or "mega economic programme" was certainly an exaggeration, the Ifo Institute writes. It should be borne in mind that the liberalisation would begin in early 1995 at the earliest and would be completed gradually in five or more stages. "At least some economic impulses can peter out as a result. In addition, it cannot be assumed that the tendency to solve structural problems through protectionist measures no longer existed." Sanctions were still not envisaged. The main reasons for the prolonged nature of the GATT negotiations -- the great conflict of interests between industrialized and developing countries in some areas and the large number of negotiating partners -- continued to exist and would continue in future to make multilateral liberalization steps more difficult. The discussion on a GATT with several speeds could therefore remain topical.
