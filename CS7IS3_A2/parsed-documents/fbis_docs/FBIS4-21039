Lieutenant Colonel Aleksandr Zelichenko, chairman of the State Commission for Narcotics Control, said today that $450,000 were allocated for the 1994-95 period. They will be used for providing equipment for sub-units engaged in fighting drug trafficking and for training specialists. Zelichenko claimed that international organizations are not only giving a fitting assessment of the Kyrgyz anti-drug services, but have also outlined a number of measures that will permit the republic to become integrated in the worldwide struggle against drug dealers. Today this is necessary: via Gornyy Badakhshan and Kyrgyzstan drugs from Afghanistan have started spreading across the CIS republics. Via Russia, Afghan opium and marijuana wind up in Western Europe. This year Kyrgyzstan will be able to reach the Kara-Korum highway via China, which will enable Kyrgyz freight to get to the coast of the Indian Ocean, into India, Pakistan, and other countries of this region. But specialists claim that, together with economic advantages, the republic will become the object of drug dealers' close attention. Using the new route, they will be able to transport narcotics in both directions--into Asia and into Europe. It is this which is compelling Kyrgyzstan's law enforcement bodies to attach special importance to stepping up the fight against drug trafficking.
