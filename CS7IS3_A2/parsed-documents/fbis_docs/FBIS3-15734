Krasnitskiy and A. Yegorov have appealed in their own right to the city prosecutor's office, the St. Petersburg and Oblast Internal Affairs Main Administration Administration for Combating Economic Crime, and the State Tax Inspectorate for St. Petersburg to carry out a check on the legality of a number of financial transactions sanctioned by B. Kurkova, leader of the "Petersburg--5 Kanal" state television and radio company. The deputies, so the report says, presented the law enforcement agencies with documents which are in their view evidence of bribe-taking by officials, in particular B. Kurkova. The deputies also appealed to St. Petersburg Mayor A. Sobchak in an open letter which says inter alia: "We consider it your moral duty to see to it that an objective investigation is carried out. We hope you will understand that there are grounds -- based on public opinion -- for fearing that you will apply official pressure in the investigation. We do not doubt your honesty and impartiality or your direct interest in the observance of law in the city."
