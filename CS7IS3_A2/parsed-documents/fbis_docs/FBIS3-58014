This prospect, with further big gains by Labour, would be a shattering blow for the Conservatives. It would make many Tory MPs in southern England nervous as to whether they would retain their seats in the Commons. The latest MORI aggregate for THE TIMES of voting intention polls from October to December underlines the vulnerability of the Tory position in both the Euro-elections and council elections in early May. MORI has used the figures to project the results in England's 71 European Parliament constituencies to take account of the boundary changes proposed last month. If the change in votes since the general election were uniform throughout England, the Tories would win 17 seats, Labour would capture 51 and the Liberal Democrats 3. On this basis, Labour would win 11 or 12 seats in Scotland and Wales and the Nationalists 1 or 2. This would give Labour a national total of 62 or 63. The Liberal Democrats could win several more seats according to a regional breakdown of voting intentions. This is because of the concentration of Liberal Democrat votes in southern England and the larger increase in the party's support in this region since the 1992 election. Taking account of these regional variations, the Tories might win only 13 seats, Labour 47 and the Liberal Democrats 11. An exact comparison with the current position is not possible since the number of seats in Britain has been increased by 6. At present, Labour holds 45 in Britain as a whole, the Tories 32, the Scottish Nationalists 1 and the Liberal Democrats 0. The projected results would be a triumph for Labour, building on an already strong position, but the advance by the Liberal Democrats is what would worry the Tories above all, since it would threaten their strongholds across southern England. Depending on the strength of their performance, the Liberal Democrats could capture not only the Euro-seats in Cornwall, Devon and Somerset, but also spread their gains along the South Coast south Kent and up through Hampshire to Wiltshire. They might even capture the Cotswolds and the seat of Essex and Suffolk South. These findings are especially significant since, nationally, support for the Liberal Democrats dropped from 25 to 22 percent during October to December, compared with the previous three months. The party's rating dropped from 43 to 39 percent in the South West, but that left it still well out in front and well ahead of its general election share of 31 percent. The Tories stood at 31 percent in the fourth quarter in the South West, with Labour at 28 percent. In the South East outside London, the Tories remain the lead at 36 percent, but this represents a drop of 19 percentage points compared with the general election. Liberal Democrats are 32 percent, up from 23 percent in April 1992, while Labour has advanced from 21 to 29 percent.
