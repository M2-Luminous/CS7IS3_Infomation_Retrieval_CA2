[Maroni] It was the most difficult electoral test of our history. We did not succeed in explaining to everybody what we wanted, but we retained our identity up to the end of a battle in which anything could have happened. Did you see what happened to Rete? We, instead, are firmly on our feet. This means that the federalist battle is very much alive and will continue throughout the north. [Caviglia] And that you will be able to govern... [Maroni] Of course, but not at any cost. We will see if they accept our conditions. [Caviglia] Which also includes a request regarding the prime minister's seat, for which [Northern League Secretary] Umberto Bossi has proposed you as a candidate. Is this not slightly excessive given that Forza Italia and National Alliance got more proportional representation votes than you? [Maroni] You cannot base your reasoning on numbers alone. You must also look at political positions. We want guarantees that the values we have always fought for will not be betrayed. For this reason we are asking for the seat of prime minister. For us it is the best guarantee of a free enterprise and federalist government. But it is not a final condition. Instead, I really think we can come to an agreement. [Caviglia] In short, there are no longer any conditions regarding the participation of National Alliance in the government. [Maroni] The only condition that we cannot renounce is that of federalism. We could not become part of a government whose members are contrary to federalism. But I think there is no hint of this. The Social Movement has such a great desire to increase its votes after all these years that I do not think it will object. Moreover, we do not want everything immediately by any means. We know that one has to proceed gradually. [Caviglia] And which are the first measures that should be taken in order to satisfy the League? [Maroni] Well, to begin with, tax reform with the autonomy of local bodies is necessary. Something like that would be a first step. [Caviglia] Well then, the government of the center-right pole is at hand. [Maroni] I would say so. The others are certainly what they are. Did you see the scenes of [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini's election meeting in Piazza del Popolo? It was full of Roman [Fascist] greetings. Our role is important precisely because of this. We are the anchor that is preventing this pole from sliding into a reactionary status. Today's result moreover is just the beginning. The objective is to create a great lineup, which is not only electoral, as soon as possible: An authentic liberal-democratic pole, the modern, liberal, and federalist Right that comes from the north. [Caviglia] And what about the controversies with your allies [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi and Fini over the past weeks? [Maroni] These belong to the past. We have put these away in the cellar, or if you prefer, in the attic.
