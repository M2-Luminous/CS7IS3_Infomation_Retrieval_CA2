Many people are outside the local office of the justice of the peace. Hours of heavy tension were experienced here. Everything began in the morning hours, about mid-morning, when people here accused a U.S. citizen of being presumably linked to gangs that are stealing babies. There was no special or legal basis on which to make such an accusation; however, the rumor was disseminated and the population united and tried to lynch the woman on the street. Local authorities intervened and managed to give her refuge at the local court building. A large number of people surrounded the building. We must note that they all used children and teenagers as shields to prevent the public forces from using greater coercive measures to calm down the people. The situation worsened by the moment. Everyone was demanding that U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), 51, come out. She is an editor for a U.S. magazine who hails from Florida and is residing in Alaska. The woman said she entered the country through Huehuetenango, toured El Quiche, arrived in San Cristobal Verapaz, and was about to board a bus to head for Coban -- she said she had come to see the beautiful carpets of the solemn processions that are made here -- but she did not imagine what was awaiting her. The situation, I repeat, turned red-hot. I was, from the very beginning, the first local reporter covering the situation from the courthouse here at San Cristobal Verapaz. We all tried to mediate. The volunteer firefighters showed up. They were attacked as they pushed their way through the mob. The departmental Red Cross also showed up, and its members were attacked. The assistant human rights official also tried to intervene. The crowd listened to no one. They said they wanted blood and that they would not be pleased until they saw blood. After trying to mediate, the police -- in an attempt to calm down the population that started to smash glass windows and make the situation more violent -- threw a can of tear gas, and this, instead of achieving the calm that was desired, actually infuriated the mob even more. The situation turned much more difficult. All of us who were inside the courthouse gathered in an extremely small room. We took refuge there while the rest of the building was being destroyed by the mob. We observed a fire. The fire was already surrounding the room housing the reporters, Red Cross members, firefighters, policemen, the assistant human rights official, the local justice of the peace, and the U.S. citizen who was being protected in the nearby restroom. The mob, however, nearly lynched every person inside the building. We managed to leave, and the U.S. citizen fell into the hands of the furious mob. The first report indicated that she was completely massacred. However, when the volunteer firefighters managed to reenter the building, they realized she was badly injured but still alive and breathing weakly. She was naked and her skull was partially destroyed. This was a very dramatic situation. She was bathed in blood. The 187th Unit of Volunteer Firefighters took her immediately to the regional hospital. We are quite far away from Coban. At this time we do not know whether the U.S. citizen is alive. Her prognosis has not yet been disclosed. The presence of the National Army has been requested since noon. Regrettably, members of the Army 21st Military Zone showed up after all this had transpired. San Cristobal Verapaz is currently under military control. We want to give you a last-minute report: Another citizen who is identified only as Luis Miguel -- he is called Mike here in San Cristobal and resides here -- was called by authorities of the local justice of the peace to serve as an interpreter and was apparently seriously beaten up. He is being taken to the regional [name indistinct] hospital. The local justice of the peace reported that the residence of a U.S. family residing here in San Cristobal has been closely monitored by the population. Rumor has it that they are also involved in the stealing of children. The sin then is to be a U.S. citizen. They have been branded. The Army is currently headed for that residence to persuade them to evacuate this place, which is a dangerous place for foreigners.
