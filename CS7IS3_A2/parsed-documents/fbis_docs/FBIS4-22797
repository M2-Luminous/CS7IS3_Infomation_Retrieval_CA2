[End boxed material] For two weeks, the main conveyer for assembly of ZIL automobiles has stood idle. The automatic flow lines have stopped, the smelting furnaces have been turned off, and the mighty forges and presses have fallen silent. The ZIL has always been a reliable, economic and productive mainstay of the government. And now this support has begun to sway, and together with it the fate of the almost 100,000-man collective. Moreover, the paralysis of the main Moscow automobile plant is about to spread at any moment to the 2,000 supplier enterprises of the AMO [Automobile Moscow Society] ZIL, bringing with it the threat that many more tens of thousands of workers will be left without a job or means of existence. In the situation of forced idleness, the ZIL trade union committee has stepped up its work, as have the plant's Sotsprof [Association of Socialist Trade Unions] and "Zashchita" trade union associations. The former held a meeting of representatives of the ZIL labor collectives. The latter two held a meeting near the second entryway which drew, by our accounts, no more than 500 people. During the meeting, the base of the monument to I. Likhachev--the first "red" director of the ZIL--was covered with slogans calling for the workers to enter the ranks of the Sotsprof, to re-elect the trade union committee, to increase wages by 2.5 times, to guarantee employment, and to dismiss the director from his duties. We may evaluate the fairness of the demands in various ways. Whether to agree with them or not--that is another question, albeit an important one. The main thing, and I have once again become convinced of this while listening to the speakers, were the emotions of the meeting--that the method used in the past was ineffective in solving the dead-end problems. I believe many of those who gathered that day at the plant's entryway understood this. Yet I do not have the heart to condemn the meeting participants. The working man, driven to desperation and losing his perspective in life, grabs onto any possibility of expressing his protest. The automotive giant stands idle. Maybe its products are not needed, not in demand? That is not so. An impressive figure was cited at the meeting of the labor collectives--159,000 automobiles. That is the order for the current year. However, the buyers have no money, and therein lies the secret. Yet how much does the ZIL pay in municipal and federal taxes? You would not believe it--92 percent from each ruble of profit. Under such conditions, how can the ZIL, which is no longer state-owned but has now been changed over to joint stockholding, increase wages? (We might add that 20 percent of the stock belongs to the state, and for this reason the government should not cast the plant to the whims of the market elements). How to develop, how to acquire new equipment, and finally how to support the huge plant housing fund? Questions, questions, questions... And they are aimed not only at the government. The plant management also caught it at the meeting. "Today the working man has no time for politics. He has grown tired of them," said director Vladimir Petrov. "Where are the new automobiles? Why is it that handicraftsmen work and survive, while a huge plant with competent engineers and skilled workers is falling apart?" "People have worked for 20-30 years, and now what--they have to collect bottles for a piece of bread. The average wage at the plant is 90,000. But this is due to the exorbitant salaries of the managers of various ranks. The workers are being laid off, while the managers are hatching more new structures which are being tacked on. And they are not answerable to anyone. If the workers knew that these structures operate for the good of the plant--by all means, they would support them. But that is not the case. So why should we hatch more parasites?" The meeting adopted an appeal to the government in which the ZIL workers demanded an immediate review of the program of financial-economic revitalization of the plant which they had developed, as well as a positive resolution of the main questions: --to review the tax policy in the interests of the producers; --to write off the indebtedness of the enterprise to the budget and extra-budgetary funds, as being unconnected with the production activity of the ZIL; --to restore the granting of free housing to those on the plant's waiting list; --to grant the enterprise special-purpose state credit. Well, and what will happen if the authorities answer with refusal? The ZIL workers intend to picket the government buildings and are also ready to declare a political stirike. Such are the sentiments at the capital's largest enterprise.
