What is the Army commander's position? [Discua] In the name of the Honduran people, I would like to congratulate the deputies, our people's representatives, for a decision yesterday befitting of the Honduran people, including the Armed Forces. A political decision has been made on this issue. We have always criticized the methods used in recruitment, because we regarded it as wrong. At that time we did not have the political decision President Reina made now to work on this aspect. I think his decision is right. The Honduran people have duties to perform. Now there is a political willingness to be carried out. [Izaguirre] Do you people believe this decision is one made by the Armed Forces commander in chief, the president of the Republic, rather than by the Armed Forces as an institution? [Discua] Correct. The Armed Forces are a nondeliberating body and as such obey the decisions made by the commander in chief, the president of the Republic. This position again establishes the fact we are a permanent, national institution; we are not a temporary institution. We are one of the columns of this country's democracy. At no time have the Armed Forces lent themselves to the promotion of internal disorder. We support the democratic system, just as we did during the past elections, and keep supporting it. The institution is permanent. [Izaguirre] Does this mean no person or institution knocking on the Armed Forces' doors can possibly use them for personal or group gain because the Armed Forces have already defined their position on the role of the Armed Forces? [Discua] The Armed Forces' new role has been clearly defined. Armed institutions in Latin America play a fundamental role on which the people's will rests entirely. This will is expressed in the free election of officials to govern the country in a democratic system. The Armed Forces will always stay alert. No individuals or groups will ever be able to thwart the role the Armed Forces play in the state. The Armed Forces are born with the mandate to defend the state's sovereignty and the people's rights and preserve internal order; this is the Armed Forces' clear and fundamental role. We have assumed another great responsibility, which we already had, according to the Constitution, concerning education. [Izaguirre] I talked with General Humberto Regalado, who held the same post as you. I would like you to discuss the people's reports that the Army's recruitment is brutal. How are recruits treated? [Discua] An armed institution must have soldiers that have a definite conviction. They must have an esprit de corps and a physical condition fit to deal with any situation that might arise. The Armed Forces have been trained to defend the country and preserve internal order. There is something taken for granted in the Armed Forces: discipline, loyalty, and respect, all of which must be strengthened. Character is formed by (?strict) discipline, such as the one we maintain. Recruitment in the past had some defects, because there was no political willingness. We now have a considerably updated and modern military service law. This law clearly defines how recruitment must be handled; unfortunately, there was never a political willingness to enforce the law. [Izaguirre] There was a lack not only of political willingness but of a desire to obey the law. I understand that the state must advise the Armed Forces of those who must render military service. [Discua] Correct. Serving in the Armed Forces is a duty clearly defined in Article 40 of the Constitution. To render military service is a citizen's duty. Details are now being clarified, but we had already typified them in the Military Service Law, which describes those who must render this service and the way this service must be rendered. Congress has now made the courageous decision of amending a Constitution article under the president's initiative. I think we are on the right track. [Izaguirre] There is general concern among the people, and you are the person who can explain the truth to the Honduran people. This is their concern: What will happen in this transition period -- that is to say, the time that will pass before the amendment to Article 276 of the Constitution is goes into force? How will recruitment be conducted between now and the time the decree goes into effect? [Discua] First, the Military Service Law is in effect. It is true that the reform has been approved, but it must be ratified by the second legislature. Therefore, the Military Service Law is in force. According to this law, it is the responsibility of the executive -- namely, the commander in chief of the Armed Forces -- to fill the vacancies in the Armed Forces. [Izaguirre] Some people also say that this temporal gap will be used by the Armed Forces to forcefully recruit personnel. Are the Armed Forces planning to carry out forceful recruitment during this time? [Discua] No, but there exists a constitutional duty to recruit, according to Article 40. In addition, the Military Service Law is in force. There are many procedures. I do not have a copy of the law with me at this moment, but the Military Service Law is clearly established and it remains in force. There are drafts and boards. There is the Military Enlistment Board, comprising the government minister and the Armed Forces commander or his delegate. There are also departmental boards, governors, and regional chiefs. We also have mayors. We will issue draft documents to the approximately 1.2 million citizens who, according to the Constitution, have a duty to serve in the military. Of this 1.2 million, less than 1 percent will be recruited into military units, whose sleeping quarters, diners, and schools have been improved. The Constitution establishes this service as a citizen's duty. [Izaguirre] When this proposal was presented, were the Armed Forces consulted on the economic repercussions of the proposal? It is one of the important factors in this issue. To make military service educational, voluntary, humanistic, and so on, money is necessary. According to the president, military service must be made attractive. Has this been discussed? Is the country prepared for this? [Discua] The president of the Republic has been adequately clear on this situation. I think he has a clear, well-defined answer. We have a new role in education. Rather, we already had this role, but now it has been defined. We must contribute to education in the country. I want to tell you something, Danilo: We have always had secondary schools, trade schools, and primary schools. I want to make something clear once and for all. Adult Hondurans dislike attending school or studying. When we have recruits in our units, we must force them to attend secondary schools and primary schools. These recruits, however, do everything imaginable to avoid going to school. We see the results of this in the number of dropouts in primary and secondary schools.
