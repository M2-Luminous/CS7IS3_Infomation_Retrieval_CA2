In a statement on Monday, it said the latest flashpoint in the region was Buchanana near Ntambanana, about 30km east of Empangeni. The statement said renewed violence started on January 9 when ANC member Bheki Ndlovu was killed in an ambush. "Despite the fact that the kwaZulu Police [KZP] were patrolling the area during the same evening, attacks continued." Several homes had been gutted by fire in a series of attacks since then, the ANC claimed. Two supporters were killed during Mr Ndlovu's funeral on Saturday. They were identified by the ANC as Wiseman Cele and Phakaniseni Hlela. On Monday morning Thokozani Patrick Mlondo and Joshua Mofokeng were shot dead by a group which opened fire before burning several houses, the statement said. The ANC demanded the South African Police and the defence force immediately take over policing in the Ntambanana area. It also called on the Goldstone Commission to investigate the latest violence. The KZP confirmed weekend incidents in the area but was unable to supply details on Monday. Senior policemen in Ulundi were unavailable late on Monday to comment on the ANC's claims.
