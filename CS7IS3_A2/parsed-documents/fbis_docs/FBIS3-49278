During the news conference, Hossu announced that during yesterday's conference of the executive bodies of the three trade union confederations they agreed upon a program of action in the near future, as they all consider that the sole solution to the current economic and social problems is to go on a general strike. Therefore, on 28 January, a one-hour warning general strike, on 4 February a one-day strike, and, beginning with 16 February, an open-ended general strike will begin, until all demands are met. Hossu added that he personally hopes that the labor conflict will be ended before 15 January. The precondition to this is that the government should also consider the demands forwarded by the trade unions, including the one requesting the establishment of a coalition government, in which case there will be no reasons to go on the planned strikes, which are actually not wanted by anyone, Hossu emphasized.
