He said: "It has been almost 20 years since the concept of basic defense power was formulated (since the present defense program guidelines were drawn up). I think it is necessary to rethink basic defense power in a way that is relative for this new era. We should basically change our viewpoints in the present vast flow." In this way, Hosokawa clarified his plan to drastically review the "concept of basic defense power," which is the basis of the present defense buildup program. Hosokawa was answering a question by Sohei Miyashita (a member of the Liberal Democratic Party). Basic defense power is stipulated as the minimum defense capability that Japan, as an independent state, should maintain in peace time. It has been explained that "basic defense power is not something that directly confronts possible military threats imposed on Japan." Hosokawa's remarks in the session will likely create a great stir because they note the need for drastically reviewing the National Defense Prorgram Guidelines, including the "basic concept" of the defense buildup, and they are not in line with explanations given by former governments. Hosokawa also indicated the intention to have his private consultative body come to a conclusion on new defense program guidelines as early as this summer, and expressed the hope that "the conclusion will be reflected in some way in the defense buildup for fiscal 1995." However, Kazuo Aichi, director general of the Defense Agency, advanced an opinion differing from Hosokawa's. He said: "In view of the actual situation, it will be very difficult to completely change the defense program in the fiscal 1995 budget." LDP's Miyashita also asked a question regarding the issue of how participation by the Self-Defense Forces [SDF] in UN peacekeeping operations (PKO) should be evaluated in the SDF's duties. He said: "There is an opinion that Article 3 of the SDF Law should be amended to rank PKO missions as the SDF's main duty. What do you think of this?" In reply, Hosokawa said: "The government should bring this issue before the people first. After the people have fully discussed the matter, the government should begin to study it." In this way, he indicated the intention to handle the issue carefully.
