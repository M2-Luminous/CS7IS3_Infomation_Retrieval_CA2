Potential fighting men are receiving draft calls in which the Defense Ministry of the Srpska republic reminds them that they are the descendants of the glorious defenders of their people and their land and that it is now their turn to do their patriotic duty. In short, to report immediately to the military section, district, or garrison in, say, Zajecar, Smederevo, or Belgrade to perform service in the Army of the Srpska republic. There is no explanation of the surprising detail that Zajecar, Novi Pazar, and Belgrade are located in the Republic of Serbia, but on the other hand the reverse of the draft notice contains detailed instructions about how many sets of undershorts, socks, undershirts, and towels the draftee should bring with him. Fascinating advice is given that they should report to the police or military officers IMMEDIATELY those who hinder them from fulfilling their patriotic duty (mothers, sisters, girl friends, wives, friends, pacifist organizations?), but that there is no need to interrupt their trip for that reason and lose time. It concludes with the warning in capital letters: "In case of failure to report, police authorities will apprehend the draftees and charges will be filed." They do not say what police will apprehend Karadzic's recalcitrant subjects, but it can be assumed that it would be Sokolovic's people. Concluding that the president of Montenegro has truly earned the right to wear Karadzic's medal, VREME's correspondent in Podgorica, Velizar Brajovic, reports that the situation is similar in that republic, where the Social Democratic Party [SDP] has publicly opposed the practice of doing all this, which is moreover being done with the knowledge and approval of the government. Delivery It is of interest that the draft notices are being distributed in refugee camps by teams made up of officers of the Army of Yugoslavia, people from opstina defense secretariats, and the military police, accompanied by a warning that those who refuse to sign will lose refugee status and will be crammed into a military prison before they are sent across the Drina. Short and clear, accompanied by a warning that there is an agreement between the Army of the Srpska republic and the Army of Yugoslavia and that answers to all questions can be found in the Srpska republic, whose medical and social welfare agencies will resolve any possible problems. In other words--the FRY is only delivering, while the Srpska republic is deciding. Nothing easier, of course, than to get to people tired of living in refugee camps, but neither have those who have found private refuge been forgotten. Draft notices from opstina military sections are arriving at their addresses. If someone makes a mistake and comes in for a conversation, the opstina official presents him the "picture postcard" from the fatherland, accompanied by the threats we have already mentioned. Those receiving the draft notices are terribly uninformed: Some people have reported to the Red Cross, but not to the police, and there have been some who have not reported to anyone. It is not just the "humanitarian" nature of the Red Cross here that has been confirmed, then, but also the tradition of reporting those around it "to the proper authorities." The appearance of uniformed people bearing the insignia of the Military Police of the Army of the Srpska republic in Novi Sad suggests the conclusion that no one is taking great pains to disguise the joint effort. Judging by its scale, that would not have been possible anyway. The Law The people manning the hot line for victims of discrimination say that this is a violation of international documents on human rights and rights of refugees. The Human Rights Council of the Center for Antiwar Efforts (which operates the hot line) took the initiative the other day for an assessment of the constitutionality of the republic Law on Refugees. "Article 2 of that law, which was adopted in April 1992, states that refugees are subject to military and labor conscription under the same conditions as citizens of the Republic of Serbia," says Biljana Kovacevic-Vuco, an attorney in the Human Rights Council. "The republic Law on Refugees, then, is contrary to the federal Law on the Army, which states that only citizens of the FRY are subject to military conscription." The problem, however, is that the courts here have remained loyal to the advice of the late marshal that there is no need to "hold to the law as a drunk man holds onto a fence," so that refugees subject to the military obligation of the Srpska republic who have no liking for the possibility of losing their heads in some ravine can only heed the advice of the High Commissariat for Refugees of the United Nations in Belgrade: "Hide." Total War A new wave of mobilization was for that matter to be expected after Karadzic's threat that unless the Muslims sign the peace plan, he will wage total war. The announcement of amnesty for deserters of the Srpska republic who put on the uniform before 10 February and news about Mladic's muffled grumbling that recently the Serbs have not managed to move the line of the front were reminders of the constant problem of Serbian units in Bosnia--the shortage of "cannon fodder." The Serbs, to be sure, still have a significant superiority in armament, but all that military equipment is useless if there is no one to operate it. On all the fronts in Bosnia, the Serbs are numerically weaker than the Muslims. In Sarajevo, for example, the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on their own admission, have about 48,000 men at their disposition, while the number of Serbs in the surrounding hills is a fraction of that. It is not possible to carry out the announced Serbian offensive which is supposed to compel the Muslims to sign some document with the present personnel, so that Karadzic has probably asked Belgrade for help. Aware that the Army of Yugoslavia does not dare for the present to become openly involved on the Bosnian battlefield, Milosevic seems to have offered his protege an inexpensive and worthwhile gift--the heads of the refugees. No one, of course, knows the details of the agreement between the Army of Yugoslavia and the Army of the Srpska republic, but it has been clear for a long time that Milosevic's and Karadzic's territorial priorities in Bosnia differ. The president of Serbia wants to "cleanse" the Muslim enclave on the Drina in order to expand the security zone westward, while Karadzic's political destiny is bound up with Sarajevo--choosing Banjaluka as the capital of the state of the Bosnian Serbs would drastically limit his power, and Pale is only a temporary solution. Milosevic and Karadzic have obviously agreed to strike from both sides. Aside from the fronts we have mentioned, Mladic probably is trying to reinforce his lines around Olovo (cutting the road between Zenica and Tuzla, in which paratroopers from Nis, according to UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] reports, are taking part) and Modrica (a preventive attempt to isolate Tuzla in case the airport should be opened). Accordingly, there are places tailor-made for getting killed. All that is needed is to find enough people. For the present, the refugees are the first target, and because it is certain that the number apprehended will not be sufficient for operations on that scale (the Bosnians move around a lot), citizens of Serbia and Montenegro who have FRY citizenship, but the misfortune of being born west of the Drina, may soon find themselves in danger. In Croatia, which recently became an ally, such moves are not uncommon anyway, and confirmation is offered by the case of Viktor Ivancic, FERAL TRIBJUN editor, about which VREME has written. The regimes in Belgrade and Zagreb have a common interest in Bosnia, and so they are resorting to similar methods. Those with a malicious tongue would say that there is an obvious coincidence of character here as well.
