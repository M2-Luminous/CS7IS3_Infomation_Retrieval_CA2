"Two of the world's most violent terrorist groups are being defeated, and by the end of my term they will no longer exist," Fujimori said, referring to the Shining Path [SL] and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Fujimori, who began a two-day official visit to Colombia today, made the statement to journalists at the end of his first meeting with Colombian President Cesar Gaviria. According to the Peruvian president, terrorism and subversive violence have claimed 25,000 lives in Peru. He asked jokingly: "What has been the meaning of `Emperor' Fujimori's government?" He replied that his government "is defeating" the violent groups. Fujimori reiterated by the time his constitutional terms ends "neither the SL nor the MRTA will exist in Peru. I am going to wipe them out." Fujimori and Gaviria discussed during their first meeting topics such as drug trafficking and guerrillas, topics that affect both countries. They also discussed bilateral relations. Both leaders will lay the groundwork for the creation of a Binational Neighbor Commission, and tomorrow they will sign a joint declaration in which they will announce new mechanisms of cooperation for the struggle against drug trafficking and guerrillas.
