This figure is particularly striking at a time when the world economy is in a recession. To maintain the strong momentum in our country's economic development, in his government work report Premier Li Peng underscored the six- character principle of "sustained, rapid, and healthy" development. The principle was formulated after careful consideration of the actual state of our country's economic development. The characters denoting "healthy" were recently introduced into this six-character principle. It is the most discussed element among National People's Congress [NPC] deputies and members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC], both during and after session. It is viewed as a sign of maturity in the guiding ideology for our country's economic construction. The six characters constitute a dialectical unity and must be managed carefully. Seeking rapid development without regard to sustained and healthy growth will hamper much-sought-after progress, ultimately keeping us from proceeding rapidly. We should place greater emphasis on quality and efficiency than on quantity and growth rate. In the words of Tianjin deputy Gao Dezhan, we should actively create conditions and stress both quantitative and qualitative growth in economic development, placing greater emphasis on the latter, so as to truly shift toward the track of improving economic efficiency. Healthy development and efficiency are interconnected. By taking "efficiency" as the central task, we can find a prescription for curing the on-again, off-again overheating in China's economy in recent years. The two characters denoting "healthy" are what people hope for and which serve as the prerequisite for sustained and rapid economic development. What is meant by healthy development? This means adapting to market demands, stressing quality and efficiency, seeking realistic growth rates, and avoiding intermittent bouts of overheating and drastic fluctuations. CPPCC member Tian Yinong said in vividly descriptive terms: "Suppose the economy is a person with a fever. In the heat of an economic expansion, people would rush headlong into mass action, and this would result in an overextended investment scale. On the surface, the economy would seem to be developing rapidly and spectacularly, but once problems occurred, it would be subject to readjustment and would contract. This erratic pattern would cause tremendous losses, in effect slowing the economy." Some aspects of our country's economy are clearly far from satisfactory, despite the rapid economic development of recent years. Hunan deputies Gao Jinping and Han Jian said: Some localities are now trying to find a solution through an expanded investment scale rather than through improved economic efficiency. Not to be outdone, various localities are vying with each other to start projects and seek fast growth rates. Shandong deputy Mu Chengze said: "Once in office, town and township cadres would take out loans, recklessly establish new organizations, start projects, and walk away before witnessing any results." These instances are not isolated cases. In the end, it is the state which suffers. This kind of development cannot be described as healthy. According to information from the State Statistical Bureau, the total investment made in fixed assets in 1993 amounted to 1,182.9 billion yuan, an increase of 50.6 percent over 1992; the annual increase was the largest since the 1980's. The deputies believe excessive investment causes fund shortages as well as greater "bottlenecks" and inflation. The NPC deputies and CPPCC members felt enlightened by re- studying a passage of Comrade Xiaoping's brilliant exposition on economic efficiency: "In our economic development, we should strive to raise it to new levels every few years. Of course we are not encouraging unrealistically high growth rates. We should work in a down-to-earth manner, stress efficiency, and achieve a steady and coordinated development." Comrade Jiang Zemin has recently pointed out: "We should have new ideas for our development, and should truly switch it onto the track of enhancing economic efficiency. We must not continue taking the road of blindly seeking high output value and growth rates, and expanding the scale of investments." Shandong deputy Guo Xinzhang had the following to say: Development includes increased quantity and improved quality. Over the last several years, the stress of our work has been placed on solving the problems of insufficient total supply and of meeting the people's basic needs in food and clothing. Now, some localities should shift the stress to improving economic and product quality. Economic quality includes economic structure, economic efficiency, and labor quality. It is precisely out of a consideration of enhancing economic efficiency and stressing healthy development that the State Council has set the 1994 growth rate at 9 percent. During their discussion of the government work report, the NPC deputies approved of the rate. They believe we will certainly make remarkable achievements with sustained, rapid, and healthy development so long as we maintain a healthy and genuine 9 percent growth rate for a number of years in a row. Stress on economic efficiency is not a new topic, but it is very difficult to ensure economic efficiency under the purely planned economic structure. Our national economy has already developed to a very large extent, and it cannot be further developed healthily with artificial arrangements. The 14th Party National Congress has made a policy decision on establishing a socialist market economic structure. In order to create the motive force for economic development, we must rely on market forces to distribute resources rationally, and we must stress economic efficiency. While planning was law in the past, our production is now guided by the market demand. Such a change has made it possible for China to turn its "growth-rate-increase economy" into an "efficiency- improvement economy." During the change of operational mechanisms, many enterprises "turned to the market instead of the mayor" in order to solve their problems. NPC deputy and economist Li Boxi stated: Presently the economic efficiency of our investment is very low because investment ignores market demands. Many enterprises under construction are bound to be losers. When they are completed, there will be no market for their products, and a large quantity of their products will lie idle in warehouses. For this reason, we must reform the existing investment system and improve investment efficiency. The key to success in this regard is to change the government functions and allow enterprises to become the main investors. How can we enhance economic efficiency and maintain healthy development? In pondering the question, many NPC deputies and CPPCC members tried to get an answer from structural readjustment and repeatedly emphasized optimization of the industrial structure. Deputy Ni Zhifu pointed out: China is a large country in which different regions have different economic foundations and natural resource conditions. Each region must consider its own reality and choose suitable main industries, as well as other related industries. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure the rational division of labor and cooperation among regions and avoid uniform industrial structures, so that all localities can give play to their strength and make effective and full use of their economic advantages and resources. Liaoning Governor and NPC Deputy Yue Qifeng discussed Liaoning's second economic progress. He said: In transforming an old industrial base, it is necessary to have new ideas and not to blindly follow other's practices. It is necessary to use high and new technology in developing a number of new enterprises and transforming a number of old enterprises. It is necessary to close down a number of old enterprises which do not merit transformation. It is necessary to constantly optimize the product mix and develop a number of technology-intensive products which are high value-added, highly marketable, bring high economic returns, and which will help promote the province's economic development. Deputy Wang Guangying, who is of noble character and high position, suggested the use of foreign capital and technology in invigorating inefficient large and medium state-owned enterprises. Economic efficiency is inseparable from product quality, marketability, and after-sale service. During the two sessions, Deputy Ma Yue, who is general manager of the Dongfeng Automobile Company in Hubei, visited the Beijing service center of Dongfeng automobiles and Fukang-brand sedans to seek users' comments on 15 March, which happened to be the "Consumer Rights Day." He said: In the past, enterprises were responsible for planning only. Now, they must be earnestly responsible to the users. If we do not enlarge the scale of production rapidly to lower costs and produce cars of a high level of technology, good quality, and reasonable prices to satisfy users, we will not be able to do anything but watch foreign companies seize all of China's automobile market. Only healthy development is genuine development, and only effective development is genuinely healthy development. To put more effort into "healthiness" and efficiency is the common aspiration of the NPC deputies and CPPCC members attending the two sessions, as well as the common aspiration of the people across the country. If everyone in our country enhances his awareness of efficiency and tries in every possible way to raise economic efficiency, we will be able to promote the country's modernization in a sustained, rapid, and healthy way.
