The government army reportedly accepted this 60-hour truce planned to start at 0600 GMT tomorrow. The Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF] has clearly stated that it does not intend to respect this cease-fire. Let's listen to Jacques Bihozagara, a member of the RPF executive committee who was appointed deputy president in the Arusha agreement: [Begin recording] [Bihozagara] For us it is unacceptable to sign a cease-fire; however, if they want to surrender we are ready to consider the proposal. If they want a cease-fire they must first stop the massacre of civilians. [Unidentified correspondent] What about the neutrality of the airport which the UN Mission in Rwanda [UNAMIR] has attempted to negotiate for several days? What will your answer be, now that you are in control of the airport? [Bihozagara] Now that we control the airport, it is out of the question to negotiate its neutrality; it is rather a matter of asking how planes can land and take off, that's all. [Correspondent] Will you differentiate between planes flying in humanitarian aid and those flying in UN soldiers? [Bihozagara] Obviously, because we expressed our support for humanitarian aid and we are ready to consider the UNAMIR request concerning humanitarian issues. [Correspondent] What about the arrival of UN reinforcements? [Bihozagara] Concerning the arrival of reinforcements, I say that if we have accepted the principle of the UN resolution we have not yet discussed their deployment. We are expecting the United Nations to give us details concerning their mission, their composition and the deployment of these forces before they arrive. [end recording]
