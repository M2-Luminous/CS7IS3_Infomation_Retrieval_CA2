The present situation: Our party great national unity strategy in the present situation is designed in such a way that it can exploit and develop our traditional concepts while renovating various aspects to suit developments at home and abroad. 1. "In the present international situation, nationalism has become a very important factor. The developing countries must carry out a very difficult and complicated struggle to extricate their countries from poverty and backwardness while opposing the reactionary forces to protect national independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. Nations are facing global, pressing issues related to the common fate and destiny of mankind such as maintaining peace, protecting the environment, reducing the population growth rate, and preventing and eradicating serious diseases." (excerpt from resolution no. 07-NQ/TU of the party Central Committee) We all know that mankind is making preparation to conclude its tasks in the 20th century to embark on the 21st century against the background of swift changes in the international situation that have dramatically affected the old world order while paving the way for a new one. The upswing in the scientific-technological revolution has brought about new results in the computer, electronic, communications, and biochemistry domains, thus helping to accelerate the pace of production development. Socioeconomic reform programs have been launched in a wide and far-reaching scale in various countries, thereby seriously affecting the fundamental social issues in each nation (these include the issues of ownership, political system, democracy, and social justice) It is necessary to say that while there are conflicts, racial and religious crusades, starvation, diseases -- especially AIDS -- destruction of the ecology, and environmental pollution in certain countries that are threatening the daily life of millions of people, new conditions and opportunities emerge eleswhere. These include the trend of peace and stability in our region, the dynamic development in the Asia-Pacific zone, the trend of increased cooperation in the world, and the vigorous development in universalizing the economic life in many nations. These are developments that have created new favorable conditions and opportunities for accelerating the developmental pace in our nation. In our efforts to join the international community, we have faced numerous difficulties caused by our poor economy and backwardness. However, as a country lagging behind, we have the chance to learn from the experiences of other nations. As a result, while facing numerous ordeals we are in a position to vigorously and quickly develop our socioeconomic situation. Thanks to our foreign policy -- one of independence, sovereignty, and diversified diplomatic activities -- our country can firmly advance forward despite acute difficulties and ordeals. This has enabled us to continue to expand relations with other nations while combining our national strength with that of the world and our traditional strength with that of the era. 2. Implementing the renovation process set and led by our party, our people have scored initial yet very important achievements, thereby creating a new condition for national development. This is a very favorable condition for strengthening the all-people national unity to help extricate our country from poverty and backwardness to advance further. While enjoying this new condition we also face many new problems that call for our great efforts to overcome them. The renovation process set by our party is basically in line with the trend of the era, the social evolution law, the reality of our nation, and the aspiration of our people. This has been proven as true by our initial achievements and by our ability to overcome numerous difficulties and ordeals. However, in reality, we still have many weaknesses. While our economy is still poor and backward, we are facing the danger of lagging behind economically compared to other countries in the region, thus causing an adverse effect for us in various domains. This is a great ordeal of the era and a danger to the vitality of the nation. As a result, we must strive to bring our self-reliance tradition into full play while closing our ranks to overcome all difficulties. 3. Vietnam has a population of more than 70 million, who have a good background and are composed of various strata, nationalities, and religious groups living at home and abroad. Although they have different backgrounds, different living conditions, and different religions, they are proud of their Vietnamese origin. Their nation has several thousand years of history and the tradition of unity to build and defend the nation. They have but one common aspiration to reunite the country to make the people prosperous, the nation powerful, and the society just and civilized, to be able to join in the international community and surge forward to catch up with developments of the era. In view of the above-mentioned characteristics, Vietnamese citizens should realize their historic duty toward the nation, bring into play their wisdom and creativity, uphold their sense of responsibility, and strengthen the great national unity bloc. Let them make every effort to enrich themselves while at the same time contributing to making the country more powerful. II. The objectives and tasks under the policy of great national unity. As specified under the "economic stabilization and development" strategy, in the years ahead, efforts must be made to help the country "tide over a crisis situation and stabilize the socioeconomic situation." Steps must be taken to lead the country out of poverty and underdevelopment, improve the people's living conditions, consolidate national defense and security capabilities, and create conditions for the country to reach a higher level of development by the start of the 21st century. The resolution of the Ninth National Assembly's Fourth Session has set forth the orientations and tasks for 1994 as follows: It is necessary to firmly safeguard the achievements of the renovation process, develop the industrialization and modernization program a step further, and grasp all opportunities to quickly increase the economic growth rate and shift our country to a new stage of development. At the same time, it is imperative to effect important changes on the cultural and social fronts, firmly maintain political stability, safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and broaden diplomatic relations. To fulfill that arduous task, it is more important than ever to strengthen unity among Vietnamese countrymen, bring into full play the strength of the national community, and strengthen the all- people great unity bloc a step further. The general tasks of the National United Front at present are "to develop the tradition of patriotism, national pride, and spirit of sufficiency and self-help; motivate all Vietnamese countrymen to participate in the renovation undertaking to firmly defend national independence, unification, sovereignty, and territorial integrity; strive to fight poverty and backwardness; surge forward to achieve the goals of making the people rich and the country powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization in society; and implement President Ho Chi Minh's sacred testament, which calls on everyone to "build Vietnam into a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, prosperous, and powerful country and contribute to the cause of peace, independence, democracy, and progress in the world." Acting in line with the above-mentioned objectives and tasks, the Political Bureau has set forth major policies as follows: 1. Great national unity calls for efforts to strengthen unity among people in the great family of the Vietnamese nation -- which is composed of various strata, classes, ethnic and religious groups, and people at home and abroad -- to make the above-mentioned goals come true. To achieve unity, we must share similarities and at the same time must accept differences that are not at variance with the common national interests. We must strive to overcome prejudices, complexes, and hatred; look toward the future; and promote the spirit of solidarity, openness, and mutual trust. Everyone should work toward the goals of national independence and freedom and of happiness for the people. 2. Great national unity constitutes the fundamental line of our party and state. The concept of great national unity must be reflected in all lines, policies, and regulations of the state and must be included in all political, economic, cultural, social, national defense and security, and diplomatic activities. This is aimed at meeting the legitimate interests and aspirations of people of all strata. We must link rights with duties and personal interests with citizens' duties and must bear in mind that the national interests come first. It is necessary to create favorable conditions for releasing the production force and encourage all individuals and economic sectors to bring into full play their energy, talents, and creativity to increase production, expand business, and enrich themselves through honest means. We must encourage the people to practice thrift and build and protect the nation and must make constant efforts to improve the material and cultural life of the people. At the same time, we must encourage the people to satisfactorily implement various social welfare policies through the movement to repay those who have rendered meritorious services to the nation, participate in public utility projects and humanitarian activities, help one another to eliminate hunger and reduce poverty, and develop the tradition of benevolence and righteousness of our fathers and forefathers. 3. We must build a clean and strong people's government with high efficiency to make it a real law-governed state of, by, and for the people. The people's government must protect the people's legitimate rights and interests, firmly maintain the state order and law, perfect and execute the policy of multisectorial economic development with the state management, and outline and execute social welfare policies. It must preserve and develop the national culture together with efforts to acquire the essence of the world culture. It must build new men, strengthen the national defense and public security, and broaden its external affair activities. 4. We must expand our great national unity block via diversified activities. We must organize and develop mass movements at different levels, create more activities suitable to all social strata, and improve the positive role of exemplary people in different social classes, ethnics, and religions. We must direct our activities to villages, subwards, and households. We must strengthen the alliance between the workers with the peasants and intellectuals to make it a foundation for our great national unity block. III. Main Ideas on Policies for Great National Unity. 1. The initial achievement of the renovation undertaking has offered opportunities for everybody to actively build their life and to contribute to the cause of national construction and protection. The policy for great national unity, on that basis, needs to encourage and create more favorable conditions for the people to develop further. Our party and state have and will create equal opportunities for everyone: peasants will be granted the right to use their land, workers will possess shares in their enterprises, and the public will be provided loans for their business operation so that everybody will have a fair chance to improve their life, making the poor become better, the average become rich, and the rich become richer. For the people who have rendered a meritorious service to the nation such as the families of fallen combatants and injured soldiers and the people who have been in national service for many years with outstanding performance, our party and state have given them privilege treatment and have launched public movements to help them. However, we must pay more attention to provide better assistance and conditions to them so that these people can have a living standard at least equal to that of average people in the same residential area would enjoy. We must not leave them struggling permanently in the poverty line. For the workers, we must provide them with additional technical and professional training so that they can adjust themselves in the industrialization and modernization process. We must train our contingent of workers for new technologies and accelerate our technical training in service management, tourism, languages, accounting, statistics, and so forth... according to the market demand. We must introduce the share-holding system in state enterprises and business, provide loans for the workers to set up their share-holding enterprises, and widely apply the quota contract system for our workers. We must provide enough jobs for workers and establish a cooperative relationship between employers and workers to improve the business productivity, quality, and efficiency. On the foundation of respecting the law, we must guarantee the workers' legitimate interests and fulfill our financial obligations to the state. For the peasants, the national industrialization and modernization will create great effects for rural areas, agriculture, and peasants. The infrastructure construction must concentrate in rural areas, especially the development of public roads, electricity, postal and communications, culture, health care, and education to narrow the gap between cities and rural areas. The government must continue to perfect its policy to grant the right of land use to peasants. It must also introduce policies to develop the reasonable relationship between the industry, agriculture, and service. It must increase investment for the development of barren land, empty hills, water surface, and coastal areas. It must develop processing industry, industries, and handicrafts and expand our market relation to quickly consume products made by peasants. Particularly, we must pay attention to improving peasants' knowledge and upgrade the cultural, medical, and education service in rural areas. Regarding the intelligentsia, it is necessary to make everyone realize that for the struggle to make the goals of making the people rich and the country powerful and of bringing about justice and civilization in society come true, along with helping our nation integrate into the world community at an early date, the key factor does not rest with the fact that our country is large in size and rich in natural resources but with the fact that it is endowed with wisdom and a fine cultural heritage. If a country treats its think tank badly or plays down its role, that country will have no conditions for development or a bright future. There exists a causality between deterioration and waste of the think tank and depletion of natural resources and socioeconomic sluggishness. To develop our national cultural heritage, learn from the cultural quintessence of the times, have access to modern science and technology, and complete projects to benefit our country and people, we must rely ourselves on our highly knowledgeable intellectuals. Therefore, we must put the intellectuals in an important position and encourage them to apply their knowledge to scientific and technological research work a step further. It is necessary to get rid of the evils of narrow-minded attitude toward and prejudices against the intelligentsia. It is important to treat our intellectuals in a spirit of democracy and equality and to pay greater attention to their aspirations. Resolute measures must be taken against science monopoly. It is necessary to rely on the intelligentsia to discover and select talents and formulate lines and policies, particularly policies toward science and technology. Steps must be taken to broaden international relations in science and technology and create favorable conditions for scientists to maintain contact with the outside world and work or participate in research projects or training courses overseas. It is necessary to keep in mind that it is the objective of the policy toward intellectuals to make our country ready to enter the 21st century, which marks the start of a new era, the era of wisdom. As for religions, it is important to regard them as necessary elements that have made their long-lasting presence felt in society. Religions meet both the spiritual and cultural needs of the people. By nature, religions do not act at variance with the nation and socialism. Instead, they exert a positive impact on society. It is necessary to pay due attention to the policy toward religious and nonreligious people, respect the people's right to believe or not to believe in a certain religion along with the concepts of love of mankind, humanitarianism, charity, and merit-making of the various religions. On the one hand, it is necessary to respect the right of the various religions to perform their activities. It is forbidden to violate places of worship or interfere with the internal affairs of the various religions. It is necessary to protect churches, pagodas, and temples. It is important to keep the various religious organizations within the people's mastership system. On the other hand, stern measures must be taken to deal with attempts to take advantage of religions to undermine the great national unity bloc and violate state law. As for people of different ethnic groups, it is necessary to give them equal treatment based on solid principles. Special efforts must be made to help ethnic minority compatriots eliminate hunger and reduce poverty. Plans must be worked out to help them with medical treatment, disease prevention, and anti-illiteracy work. Practical steps must be taken to apply birth control education to each region and each ethnic group. Due efforts must be made to care for children, especially newborn babies. A number of ethnic groups is facing the danger of extinction. Therefore, it is necessary for the state to adopt urgent measures to preserve and develop them. It is necessary for the state to work out prompt measures to resolve once and for all the allotment of forest and forest land to peasant households. It is important to make concentrated investment in the expansion of key communication networks, water conservancy projects, public healthcare facilities, small-scale hydroelectric power plants, and information and postal services. Plans must be worked out to expand the work-study school system. Sightseeing trips must be organized for ethnic minority compatriots to visit cities, mountain regions, sea areas, and foreign countries. Steps must be taken to preserve and develop the cultural quintessence of people of different ethnic groups. It is necessary to respect the spoken dialects, writing systems, and fine customs and practices of people of different ethnic groups. It is necessary to supervise the operations of sectors directly under the management of the central government. It is important to increase personnel in charge of areas inhabited by ethnic minority compatriots and key services like public health, communications, water conservancy, culture, and education. It is necessary to work out separate programs for hilltribe people and see to it that practical measures are adopted to implement them. Severe measures must be taken against sectors and individuals who violate the state nationalities policy. Regarding the private industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors, the state must strengthen its relations with them and must firmly grasp their aspirations, circumstances, and capabilities. Incentive measures must be worked out to encourage the private sector to make bold investment in production and business activities. The private industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors constitute an important part of the multisectorial economy. Once they are sponsored by or have joint ventures with the state, the private sector will develop itself into a major production force and play a positive role in socioeconomic development.
