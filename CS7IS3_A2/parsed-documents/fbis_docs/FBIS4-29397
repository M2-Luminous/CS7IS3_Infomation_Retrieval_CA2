The gap between supply and demand has spread into the whole Asian market, and consumer needs have changed. To cope with the structural causes and work out ways to survive, drastic reforms accompanied by industrial restructuring and personnel adjustments are unavoidable. Worst Recession Since the War For the petrochemical industry, the total profits of the major (ethylene center) 12 companies is expected to add up to deficits in fiscal year 1993 approaching 100 billion yen. Hence, it is falling into the worst postwar recession, even beyond that of fiscal year 1982 (60.5 billion yen in the red) following the oil crisis. Petrochemical products represented by synthetic resins are a typical cyclical industry, and swings in earnings due to business cycles have been large before, too. (When demand increases under favorable conditions, prices rise steeply; and as increases in facilities and recession weigh heavily, prices drop sharply.) However, since the current recession has not only cyclical causes, but it also has structural causes, the situation is quite serious. Structural problems can be categorized into the following three points: 1. Supply-demand gap widening The petrochemical industry (like all others) broadly expanded its facilities during the bubble era. As it takes three to four years from a planning decision for facilities to go operational, increases in the facilities' capacity are still continuing even now. To look at ethylene facilities, which constitute the starting point for the production flow of petrochemical products, in addition to the startup of Mitsubishi Petrochemical's new plant in the fall of 1992, Maruzen Petrochemical's plant, whose startup had been delayed, finally is going into operation this fall [1994]. As a result, the supply-demand gap has widened to the level of that after the oil crisis and the operating rate has dropped to around 80 percent. To look at the demand side on the other hand, demand to date for petrochemical products has been attaining GNP-plus-alpha growth through the substitution of plastics for metals, paper, and so on, but now it has come to a turning point. That is because such major users as electricals and autos have shifted production overseas and plastic product imports are steadily increasing. 2. Falling international competitiveness due to worsened international demand and the high yen It was not Japan alone that increased facilities during economic expansion. The same was true for the United States and Europe. In the same vein, however, the Republic of Korea's facility expansion was amazing. It expanded its facilities threefold in the three years from 1990 to 1992. To look at ethylene in the Asian region, it appears that with demand at about 12 million tons annually there is an excess facilities capacity of more than 2 million tons. The result is that, together with prices falling internationally and the rapid rise in the yen to nearly $1 = 100 yen, differences have widened between international prices and Japanese domestic prices viewed on a dollar basis. The pressure of Korean-made synthetic resins exported to Japan is climbing, and Japan's domestic prices have plummeted, having been dragged down by international prices. In the past, Southeast Asian markets were affected in their prices by Japan's domestic demand, being an escape valve for excess facilities in Japan. But now the situation has completely reversed, and Japan's domestic market is affected by demand in Southeast Asian market. 3. Changes in consumer needs Finally, one must mention that the demand structure that had been supporting Japan's petrochemicals has broken down. Japan's domestic prices for synthetic resins have long been higher than international prices (the prices at which they sell in countries other than Japan). This was because qualities such as appearance, strength, and heat resistance were required of them for cars, containers, and polyethylene bags. The resin manufacturers spent huge sums on development costs and meticulously developed many varieties of resin. This "excessive product quality" can be said to have supported the growth and earnings of Japan's petrochemical manufacturers. However, the times changed and consumers have come to demand lower prices even at some sacrifice in performance. As a result, the weight of research and development costs has surfaced all at once. Inefficient Industry Structure Petrochemical companies are more numerous in Japan than in Europe or the United States but are smaller in scale. This is because the petrochemical industry is a new industry born after the war, and anyone could get into it by technology induction if one had the money. Besides this, a huge infrastructure of land and port was needed for the petrochemical complexes, so there were much regulation and guidance by the government concerning their formation and growth. Circumstances being such, the petrochemical industry tends to "rely on the government." At the time of the oil crisis the "Law of Temporary Measures To Improve Industrial Structure" (or Law on Industrial Structure) was devised by the initiative of MITI [Ministry of International Trade and Industry] and market conditions were improved by industry-wide scrapping of facilities. This time, however, it does not seem that such solutions can be taken under government guidance. First, we are in an era in which leadership by the government is being criticized. In fact, it cannot be denied that the law on industrial structure, by letting firms with weak competitiveness survive and protecting an inefficient industrial structure, has become one cause of the hard times for today's petrochemical industry. Next, even if excess facilities in country are scrapped, the effect of improving market conditions is slight so long as international demand is not improved. At present, MITI is studying a project for exporting used ethylene plants to China; however, since dismantling costs climbing to huge sums, this has scant chance of being realized. Moreover, even if it were carried out, one could scarcely expect any effect of improving market conditions. Then, might Japan's petrochemical industry go right ahead and perish? To state the conclusion, its survival is possible, but drastic structural reforms are needed that include the industry's restructuring and personnel adjustments. When one considers major petrochemical corporations with some 4,000 employees merging, staffs for the new post-merger companies' management sectors, sales sectors, and research and development sectors basically would get by with those of just one pre-merger firm. As about half of the employees are believed to be the staffs of such sectors, a cut to about 2,000 people could be accomplished through a merger, and a rationalization effect of some 15 billion yen might emerge from it. Even premising current market conditions, this is a level making it possible to go into the black.

At present in industrialized nations, petrochemical industries are living on quite nicely. However, in the United States and European countries (especially the United States) the industry has been made more efficient by selling enterprises during times of recession and by mergers and so on. At the same time, major manufacturers of chemicals were quick to give up on general purpose items and have gone strongly into products close to consumers such as pharmaceuticals or into fine chemical products with a high added value. The problems with Japan's petrochemicals are that each company is small in size, that there are too many companies, and that in their meticulous development they have put too much into people and money. Having so far been a growth industry as it has existed, the petrochemical industry has set petrochemicals at the core of the enterprise in each company but has been slow to notice that it had changed into a declining industry that could not survive without rationalization. For petrochemical firms, cutting staffs decisively by merging and restructuring is inescapable. At the same time, turning their reserve power in research and development toward such new fields as biotechnology and acquiring research and development capacities on a par with Europe and the United States will be the only way that Japan's chemical industries can survive into the 21st century. Next Restructuring To Be Mitsui Group Even though the need for restructuring the industry is understood intellectually, it is difficult to go into mergers that will bring pain. Particularly in Japan, a company belongs to its employees, and managers balk at a merger that will wipe out the company itself. The very way that a company should be is what stands in the way of industrial restructuring. Yet, it may be that we are already past the stage for saying such things. Some companies have reached the end even of their off-the-books assets and are in a situation where they can no longer wait. In addition, banks are also straitjacketed by the problem of bad loans and are losing the leeway to support companies in deficit. On 24 December 1993, Mitsubishi Kasei and Mitsubishi Petrochemical Co., Ltd. announced they would merge on 1 October 1994. This move can be seen as their proclamation that they had given up on any rescue by the government or cartel character for the industry and would survive on their own power. For firms still in the process of asking favors of MITI, it was a dash of cold water and meant they would have to grope for the means of their own survival. Scenarios for industry restructuring are seen as proceeding in two stages: 1) consolidating financial groupings and 2) rescue mergers by the financial groupings. (See table) The top-ranking manufacturers in the financial groups stand out prominently in the aspects both of enterprise development and firm strength, which includes their off-the-books assets, and they may become the nuclei for restructuring. Following the Mitsubishi group, the Mitsui group can achieve vertical development from raw materials through finished products if it undertakes mergers including Toray Industries, Inc. (Toray's president Maeda is busily sending love calls to Mitsui Petrochemical Industries, Ltd.), and it can give birth to a powerful chemical company. Again, all the firms are officially pressing ahead with cost-cutting by things like rationalization and tieups, working to get into the black on their own. Yet, the top managers from the hard-pressed companies seem to be groping for decisive measures. Both personnel cuts, which so far have been taboo in Japan, and programs to transfer the middle-aged and seniors to small and medium enterprises may be pushed ahead as the nucleus. Around the end of 1995, the appearance of the industry may differ considerably from today's. With China's economic development, stagnant international market conditions also can be expected gradually to recover. We hope that in two or three years, the industry's restructuring will have reinforced its character and that a reborn petrochemical industry will be seen.
