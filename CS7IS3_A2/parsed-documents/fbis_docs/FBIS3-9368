[[Gatsinski] The investigation will clarify the circumstances under which the vessel left the Bulgarian section of the Danube. [Tsvetkov] Have any hijackers been identified? [Gatsinski] The names of the crew members and the others on board are known. The investigation will determine whether some of them could be described in the way your question implies. [Tsvetkov] Will the incident affect relations between Bulgaria and Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)? [Gatsinski] Unfortunately, in contrast with their initially declared readiness, the Serbian authorities did not cooperate in returning not only the crew, but only the vessel's cargo. Despite all this, I believe that after the comprehensive crisis in Yugoslavia ends the new states that have emerged there will find the place they deserve in Europe. I am convinced that in the process of normalizing the status of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in the international community our relations will develop actively as good neighbors, on the basis of mutual economic benefit. [Tsvetkov] Would you like to forecast a new development, or do you consider the case closed? [Gatsinski] The case will be closed after the investigation ends and the culprits are punished.
