Samusenko, Gomel State University; UDC 621.396.677.45] [Abstract] For simple shape radiators, the characteristics of antennas made of conductors with infinitely small radii _r_ can be analyzed by applying approximate analytical expressions. Algorithms were developed, and cylindrical spirals (CS) over an infinite perfectly conducting screen were numerically examined applying a random shape ultrafine wire radiator analysis method. A comparison was also made of this method with the ``Mei Integral Equations method''. The computation results obtained by the two methods agree with accuracy of 1 - 2%. In order to estimate the boundary limits of this method, the functional dependance of the radiator's characteristic as a function of the conductor's radii was also made and the numerical results were compared with the analytical. A cylindrical spiral (CS) was examined with a number of turns N=6 and the winding angle _l_=14ï¿½. It was demonstrated that when _r_ was reduced from 10[.sup]-2[/] _l_ to 10[.sup]-5[/]_l_, the input impedance Z[.sub]0[/] changed from (105-j33) Ohm to (511-j19) Ohm, and the directive gain from 11.5 to 2.5. Frequency relationships of the Z[.sub]0[/] and the directive gain for CS with _r_=10[.sup]- 5[/] _l_ are shown in a graph. Figures 3, references 9: 6 Russian, 3 Western.
