The talks were also attended by RS Vice President Nikola Koljevic and the RS Assembly President Momcilo Krajisnik. After the talks, held behind closed doors, Stoltenberg said that the talks were part of continued peace efforts and "especially of the efforts to pull Sarajevo out of the current war situation." Asked to give more details about the talks, Stoltenberg stressed that "Bosnian Serbs have agreed to a separate peace for Sarajevo." Stoltenberg stressed that it "cannot be said that the event in Sarajevo market yesterday is the only reason, but it is one more reason for attempting to establish peace in the area." He said he believed that the events in Sarajevo could affect the course of the Geneva negotiations "in that they are an indication of how necessary it is to establish peace." In reference to the Serb side's readiness to help to find those responsible for the plight of the civilians in the Sarajevo market, Lord Owen stressed that it was necessary to find the offenders but that he was, as he put it, skeptical about it. "Despite, or rather because of it, I think it is necessary to bring about peace in that part of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a step toward total peace," Owen said. He went on to add that "at this juncture we must not forget Mostar and the victims there." In Owen's view, an agreement on UN control of Sarajevo "could mean a great deal." "The acceptance of UN administration over Sarajevo would be the first step toward peace," he said. Owen stressed that he expected "all three sides to understand that we have to make a resolute step toward peace" at forthcoming negotiations in Geneva. RS President Radovan Karadzic said that the talks were very useful and stressed that this was "perhaps the final stage of an agreement on peace in Sarajevo." Karadzic said that the Serb side had hoped that "the pacification of Sarajevo would be a part of the overall solution but that it was ready to take part in negotiations on Sarajevo even before the final political solution was reached." He said that the talks on Sarajevo represented "a logical step in our constant efforts to improve the situation in Sarajevo." Karadzic said that the Serb side demanded "a very strict investigation into the tragedy in Sarajevo by a joint commission" and went on to say that this was not the first time that this had happened. Karadzic said that those "who planned such tragedies expected too much from them" but that despite everything peace talks must be resumed. Asked about the pacification of Sarajevo, Karadzic said that "all this should be discussed during the work on an acceptable solution for Sarajevo." "The best thing would be for the citizens of Sarajevo to get peace and for Sarajevo to become an open city. All conditions will be discussed during the negotiations," Karadzic explained.
