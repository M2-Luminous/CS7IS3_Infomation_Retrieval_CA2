A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Tehran said that "Jordan's decision has come to our attention and we are going to implement it." Diplomatic sources have said that the decision to expel the diplomats was taken at "the highest level." And that King Husayn during his visit to Washington received "comprehensive documents" about what were termed subversive activities carried out by 26 Iranian diplomats in Amman. The sources pointed out that other "intelligence information" from the United States and Israel reveals the Iranian Embassy's implication in "activities harmful to Jordanian interests." Iranian sources say that Jordan's decision is part of a broader "U.S. effort" to isolate Iran. And that Washington asked two other Arab states, namely Oman and Qatar, to reconsider their policies toward Iran. But the diplomatic sources said that Iran is accused of involvement in the following actions: --Distributing huge quantities of propagandist informational items in Jordan. These items are sometimes transported by trucks. --Financing "suspect candidates" in the November elections. --Trying to cause a split and instigate opposition to Jordan's position on the peace process in the Middle East. --Financing radical groups to oppose the peace process. --Encouraging certain terrorist operations like the attack on cinemas in Amman and al-Zarqa'. --Iran's possible involvement--via Hizballah--in the assassination of a Jordanian diplomat in Beirut.
