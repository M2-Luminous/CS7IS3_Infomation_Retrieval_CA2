On the 3d of this month, Tusk said in Bialystok that the new party will also be counting on the so-called absentee electorate. He added that the UD-KLD unification congress will take place in April this year. "The unification itself of the two parties does not give any positive effect, and it can cause withdrawal of small, marginal groups from the new party. While maintaining everything that is good in the KLD and the UD, the most important task for the new party will be to create such an image of the party that would be attractive to the "absentee electorate," Tusk stated. "As far as the leadership of the two parties is concerned, the determination [to merge] is mutual. Amid the party grass-roots there is skepticism, as such a merger for the middle-rank people in the union and the congress will mean lost opportunities for promotion because the internal competition will increase," the leader of the KLD said.
