For some reason I think that, had the edict talked of shooting gangsters on the spot without a trial or investigation, the approval would have been even more hearty. True, the following question will remain open: Is it always the gangster who gets shot? The state is entitled to take any number of strict measures to protect its citizens and public order from crime. In the United States they do not balk at sentencing minors to death. But over there a judge will free the most hardened criminal if the police violated the prescribed procedures when arresting him: If they entered an apartment without a warrant, bugged a telephone without authorization, or arrested and questioned him without an attorney. They are well aware that justice consists of procedures. The president's edict does not correspond, to put it mildly, very much to these principles and norms. The craftiness of this act, equal in force to a law, is that it erodes the procedural guarantees which at least nominally guarantee our rights and freedoms. We often hear and read that criminal proceedings have been instituted in a case or against a specific person suspected of a crime. Only after this are investigatory actions possible: seizures, searches, the confiscation of documents, detention, etc. Even justified suspicions must be procedurally recorded. This gives a citizen a guarantee from arbitrary action by administrative authority. By instituting criminal proceedings, by officially making accusation, the authorities put a person under the law's protection and give him the opportunity to resort to judicial control. The president's edict overturns all these guarantees. Of course, this is very convenient for the administrative authorities. In fact, an investigation can go on before criminal proceedings have been instituted. In the edict clear requirements of a procedural nature have been replaced by the empty words "by agreement with the prosecutor." Yes, our business is to a considerable extent criminal; yes, many businessmen are associated with gangland and other criminal groupings. But there is also honest business. The edict hands it over to the full arbitrariness of repressive organs, which for some reason we call law-enforcement organs. Henceforth, under a law-enforcement official's directive it will be possible to violate a commercial secret, a secret regarding deposits, and the privileged nature of banking and financial documents -- that is, everything which forms the basis of business. But is there confidence that the intrusion into business will be dictated by the interests of the fight against crime and not by a bribe from competing structures? Given the total corruptness of the apparatus? And then...how will the market be affected? Because it cannot get along with a repressive regime. Section 3, Article 1 of the edict is particularly confusing. It is worded with a fair dose of jesuitic craftiness. The crux of the matter is that people suspected of crimes who are going to be punished not under the criminal law but under this edict can be immediately arrested (detained) for 30 days. In the document the word "arrest" is neatly avoided: "a written undertaking not to leave, personal recognizance, recognizance of public associations, or a bond are not applicable." Of all the measures to secure a defendant's appearance, prison for a month is all that is left. Incidentally, the General Prosecutor's Office has been instructed to establish "constant oversight of the observance of legislation when this edict is being implemented." I wonder how it will be possible to exercise this oversight if one thing contradicts another? The document says nothing about an attorney's participation in the "edict procedure." Does it follow from this that his functions have been completely excluded? If so preliminary investigators and investigators are completely free to do as they please.... About 20 years ago the CPSU Central Committee, protecting the population from hooligans, also issued a directive authorizing arrest on the spot; at that time we wrote, thrilled by the authorities' decisiveness: "Let the ground burn under the feet of criminals." Now this has been repeated word for word by our capital's mayor. If we count back about 50-60 years we get to other laws and edicts: "Ten years apiece for gleaning ears of grain, into the dock for being late for work. I repeat again. It is not the law's severity which is terrible. It is the rejection of law that is terrible. Of procedural law above all. Stalin's mass repressions began with the simplification of the judicial procedure for certain categories of cases, then trials were eliminated altogether, being replaced by two-man tribunals, three-man tribunals, and lists.... I am very frightened by the surge in gangland and any other crime; it has indeed exceeded all bounds. Yet the most terrible thing is legalized arbitrary action by the state. Here there cannot be any protection for anyone. We have already experienced this but we are trying to forget the experience, as though people in our country have not been tried under edicts which have supplanted laws, and under laws which have supplanted justice. If a gangster can be taken away without a trial and investigation today, they will surely come after an honest man tomorrow. There are no exceptions to this rule.
