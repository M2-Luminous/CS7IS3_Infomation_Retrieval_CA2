What is the actual difference between the new and the former Slovak Government? [Moravcik] We continue what was positive--namely, the transformation of our economy, and we want to implement that as quickly and as consistently as possible. The previous government also had to put its relations with the IMF in order, and we want to do that, too. However, the precondition for that is that the budget deficit be not more than 4 percent of the GDP. Last year it was 7 percent. The former government also declared speedy privatization as one of its goals. In reality, however, it slowed down the privatization process. We want to accelerate it and, at the same time, depoliticize it. [Schwarz] In your government, very different forces are represented, that are bound together by their opposition to Vladimir Meciar. Can such a coalition last beyond the elections? [Moravcik] I believe so. However, for this purpose, we need an election result that enables us to continue our work. The precondition for lasting political stability is stability of the political parties, and these parties, for their part, must correspond to the large political parties in Europe. The cooperation of the parties plays a very important role at the European level. In our coalition, we have such parties: a leftist party, a rightist party, and one party of the liberal center. Rightist-leftist coalitions are nothing unusual. In Austria this is working very well. [Schwartz] At the moment, former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar is more popular than ever. His ouster was obviously either too early or too late.... [Moravcik] The problem is the date of the new elections. We wanted to postpone the elections for a few months, until spring 1995. By then the government would have had more opportunity to present itself to the voters as a viable alternative. It looks as if the elections in the fall will not change much about the structures in parliament. The problems will remain. [Schwarz] Meciar's HZDS [Movement for a Democratic Slovakia] obviously fears that you might drag out the election period. [Moravcik] The election period--30 September-1 October--is definite. We have no intention of changing it, even though developments so far have confirmed our opinion about a later election date. The ouster has given Meciar sympathy. But, when the government ensures a calm and busy atmosphere, which the people want, it will convince the voters. [Schwarz] After the elections, too, your government would need the support of the parties of the Hungarian minority. [Moravcik] Yes, this is very likely. The opposition is using this against us. However, we need a rational relationship with the minority parties to be able to solve the minority problem. [Schwartz] Do you expect that after the elections in Hungary it will be easier to defuse the smoldering conflict with Budapest over that? [Moravcik] We have the political will to improve relations, and this is in our mutual interest. After all, both countries want to join the European Union as quickly as possible. We cannot afford the conflict. [Schwarz] Can you adopt the Hungarian position that the minority issue involves not only individual rights but also collective ones? [Moravcik] We do not think that territorial autonomy would be good for the Hungarian minority. On the contrary, it would create unrest. [Schwarz] Relations with Austria are attributed particular importance in your government program, in particular with regard to Austria's forthcoming accession to the European Union. However, they are overshadowed by the quarrel over [the nuclear power plants of] Bohunice and Mochovce. What is your position on nuclear energy? [Moravcik] We would be vary happy if we could free ourselves of the burden of the Bohunice nuclear power plant. For us, this is primarily an economic problem. Bohunice produces a lot of energy, which we need, and we cannot afford changing to another fuel. The government has not yet closed this issue and is still looking for the best possible solution. I am convinced that we will find it. Closing down Bohunice is only a matter of time. For Mochovce, we want to choose a partner that can guarantee enough safety.
