Malinovskiy by Galina Pokomareva; place and date not given: "And Again Non-flying Weather"] [Text] "The wages of pilots at the Moscow Bykovo Airport range from 300,000 to 500,000 rubles. Pilots in Domodedovo and Vnukovo receive more than 1 million. In the opinion of the common man, not the most destitute people in the country intend to strike," I began the conversation with A. Malinovskiy, who a year ago left the post of IL-62 commander in Domodedovo in order to head Russia's Trade Union of Flight Personnel. "You are an instigator, I guessed right away," Alfred Avgustovich reacted. "One should not make extremists out of us. We demand not money, but the government's attention to the problems of the entire sector. "Only enterprises that have the opportunity to fly abroad are profitable now. The rest are unprofitable. Aviators in the North and the Far East are in the most difficult situation, despite the fact that airplanes and helicopters are the only types of transport there. Fuel is expensive, costs per flying hour are excessively high, and only millionaires can afford the transport rates. Traditional customers--petroleum industry workers, geologists, fishermen, and gold miners--had to give up aviation. Things got to the point where many air detachments performed free flights to remote settlements in order to take out sick people, women in childbirth, and mail and to deliver bread and medical supplies. At the same time, crews do not receive wages for months." [Pokomareva] Sad as it may be, the market, about which we talk a great deal, dictates its laws. Profitable enterprises flourish and unprofitable ones declare themselves bankrupt... [Malinovskiy] Under the present market economy an enterprise has an owner. Most of our aviation enterprises, as before, are state enterprises, that is, they require budget injections. After all, in any, the most developed, country the transport system enjoys the concern and support of the state. The entire population needs it. Two years ago the Trade Union of Flight Personnel proposed that free air transport rates be introduced, but, in order that the population should not suffer, that money from the budget be allocated for compensation for the needy. Which was done. As a result, ticket prices increased, but 75 billion rubles, which were allocated for compensation in 1993, did not reach those to whom they were addressed. Now every airport sets its own, often unsubstantiated, prices of fuel, spare parts, and maintenance. Departing on a flight, pilots are forced to get from their enterprise literally a bag of money and from this bag to pay in cash for everything, including the cleaning of the airplane. We demand that steps be taken to stop the chaos and arbitrariness; for example, to develop a mechanism of payment of compensations for the population for air tickets; to establish a system of mutual noncash transactions among aviation enterprises; to issue a reference catalog with rates of air services and to establish economic and administrative sanctions for their violation. [Pokomareva] However, in your demands there are also more "global" questions, which cannot be solved right away... [Malinovskiy] We fully realize that problems of "small aviation," which traditionally serviced other national economic sectors, cannot be solved right away. However, those that make decisions should at least "face" them. Agriculture suffers, not receiving the help of aviation in field fertilization and weed control. Forestry incurs losses owing to fires. Reindeer breeding brigades and fishing artels are isolated. Power industry workers are cutting down on the patrolling of electric transmission lines. Oil industry workers cannot use helicopters for the delivery of products and materials to places that are not easily accessible. It would be realistic to establish an intersectorial commission and to determine the necessary volume of aviation work and its financing from the budget of every sector. There is a need for tax privileges for aviation enterprises performing work for the need of the national economy, especially in regions of the North and the Far East. [Pokomareva] Are you confident that all 40,000 pilots will support the trade union's decision? [Malinovskiy] Two years ago I called a strike "by bluffing." Everyone supported it. Right away everyone began to take action, became frightened, and came to negotiations. This worked. They did not let the strike happen--they accepted our demands. I am confident that they will also support us now. * * * One of the specialists in the field of air law explained to me that the pilots' strike is none other than "destabilization of the state transport system" and entails criminal responsibility. As a joke he advised that the telephone numbers of the "ringleaders" of this undertaking be published in the newspaper. For passengers. Then it will become clear who is right and who is to blame...
