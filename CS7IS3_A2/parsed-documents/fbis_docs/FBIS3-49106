Deputy Minister of Labour and Social Policy Andrzej Baczkowski, present at the meeting, expressed his hope at a press conference in Gdansk that the establishment of the commission would be possible in January. He also declared that by January 7 the government would take stands on all agreements concluded with Solidarity. Baczkowski also said that the draft privatization law included in the enterprise pact is in the last stage of interministerial consultations. He added that the government would seek a consensus with trade unions about concrete legislative solutions and not the trade unions' opinion on the final version of the draft. Matters of argument could be presented to the Sejm along with the draft law, he said. Solidarity Chairman Marian Krzaklewski termed the draft budget law as "conflict-prone" while not taking into account "dynamic methods of compensating for rises in costs of living" in view of planned rises in energy prices and rents. According to him, the rules of the so called social safety net should be clearly defined before the adoption of the budget law.
