FR940208-1-00062 FR940208-1-00011 Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, to Chief, Information Policy Branch, (2136), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 10460; and to the Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officer for the EPA.'' The final rule will respond to the OMB or public comments on the information collection requirements contained in this proposal. E. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) requires EPA to consider potential impacts of proposed regulations on small business ``entities.'' If a preliminary analysis indicates that a proposed regulation would have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, a regulatory flexibility analysis must be prepared. However, regulatory alternatives that would alleviate the potential impact of the proposed standards on directly affected companies were not selected because the CAA requires all facilities that are members of a category or subcategory of major sources to meet, at a minimum, the requirements of the MACT floor. For the affected industry sectors, the Small Business Administration's definition of small business is independently owned companies with less than 100 employees. The proposed standards directly impact small companies owning gasoline bulk terminals and pipeline breakout stations. Due to downstream wholesale gasoline price increases, the proposed standards would indirectly impact small companies owning gasoline bulk plants and gasoline service stations. A definitive estimate of the number of small businesses that would be directly and indirectly affected by the proposed standards could not be feasibly obtained because of the lack of data related to the extent of vertical integration in the gasoline distribution chain. However, the EPA believes that a maximum of 56 percent of all gasoline bulk terminals are owned by small companies. Potentially, up to 99 percent of the indirectly affected gasoline bulk plants and service stations are owned by small companies. The percentage of actual small companies in these sectors, especially the gasoline bulk terminal sector, is projected to be much smaller due to vertical integration with petroleum refiners. No estimate has been made of the percentage of pipeline breakout stations owned by small companies, but since they are typically affiliated with petroleum refiners, the percentage is projected to be small. A preliminary assessment indicates that the proposed regulations would not result in financial impacts that would significantly or differentially stress affected small companies. The compliance costs for all but the smallest throughput facilities in directly affected industry segments are a minute fraction of production costs and revenues. Even so, the per unit compliance cost differential between large throughput and small throughput facilities are minor. Small facilities are likely to be serving small or specialized markets, which makes it unlikely that the differential in unit control costs between large throughput and small throughput facilities will seriously affect the competitive position of small companies, even assuming that small companies own small facilities. Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this proposed rule, if promulgated, will not have a significant impact on small companies, even though a substantial number of small companies may be affected. F. Clean Air Act Section 117 In accordance with section 117 of the Act, publication of this proposal was preceded by consultation with appropriate advisory committees, independent experts, and Federal departments and agencies. The Administrator welcomes comment on all aspects of the proposed regulation, including health, economic, technological, or other aspects.
