This was the final verdict made by the higher people's court of Hebei Province on a case involving 200 standby letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars and the Hengshui Branch of Agricultural Bank of China (HBABC) last April. Francisco Hung Moy was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment and his property confiscated, followed by deportation. His accomplice, Raymond C. Lee, was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, also followed by deportation. Both Moy and Lee are U.S. citizens. According to China's criminal law, they will be deported after they have finished their terms of imprisonment. Zhao Jinrong, former director of the HBABC, was sentenced to 11 years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights for two years for dereliction of duty and revealing state secrets; Xu Zhiguo, the deputy director, was sentenced to 19 years' imprisonment with deprivation of his political rights for three years for dereliction of duty and providing state secrets to people from outside the Chinese mainland. The Hengshui Intermediate People's Court of Hebei Province conducted public trials of the two cases on April 18, 19, 22 and 23. The court notified the U.S. Embassy in China of the date of the trial beforehand, in accordance with a Sino-U.S. consular treaty. Moy, Lee and the other defendants hired defense lawyers, who notified the relatives of the accused of the date of the trial beforehand. After the sentence, Moy, Lee and the other defendants appealed to the provincial higher court, which rejected the appeal and upheld the verdict after an overall review of the whole case. Moy, the 45-year-old chairman of the "United Asia (Group) Corporation", and Lee, 44, finance manager of the corporation, contacted the HBABC in March 1993, and passed on to Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo documents regarding introduction of foreign capital into China. During discussions, Moy and Lee claimed that their corporation had many powerful business partners in many countries, and that they would mortgage their own negotiable securities, treasury bonds and assets abroad to get funds from outside China. The standby letters of credit issued by the HBABC was only to certify that the foreign capital had been used in China. On April 1 and 2, 1993 Zhao Jinrong signed with Moy and Lee three agreements on "co-operatively introducing foreign capital for investment and development projects" to the amount of five billion, 1.6 billion and 3.4 billion U.S. dollars, respectively. Lee produced for the HBABC a "proxy statement on opening letters of credit" afterwards, claiming that the HBABC was not obliged to pay back any principal or interest on the funds being introduced into China nor did it bear any economic or legal responsibility arising from the issuance of the letters of credit. In the Chinese translation of the English original of the standby letter of credit lee gave to Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo, he deliberately left out the words, "accompanied by a signed statement by the beneficiary certifying that the amount of drawing represents indebtedness due from United Asia (Group) Corporation in connection with loan accommodation granted to United Asia (Group) Corporation". Zhao and Xu issued 200 irrevocable and transferable standby letters of credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars on April 5. Moy and Lee sent all the standby letters of credit abroad the next day. When some foreign companies inquired about the authenticity and reliability of the standby letters of credit, Moy and Lee cheated Zhao again into agreeing to a reply letter prepared by them, by repeating their lie that the letters of credit caused no risk to the bank. On April 18, in the name of the fabricated "United National Republic Bank", Moy and Lee made up a standby letter of credit to the amount of 10 billion U.S. dollars as security guarantee against the standby letters of credit issued by the HBABC. Meanwhile, Moy and Lee signed a "loan agreement" with a foreign company, which stipulated: The United Asia (Group) Corporation would borrow 7.5 billion U.S. dollars from this company and "the collateral shall be one-year standby letters of credit drawn on the Agricultural Bank of China". It also made it clear that united Asia group "does not have the responsibility to repay the principal." Besides, Moy and Lee illegally engraved the official seals of the "Agricultural Back of China, Hebei Branch" and forged the confirmation letter for two standby letters of credit to the amount of 1.68 billion U.S. dollars for some foreign swindlers from February to April 1993. The court held that the swindle caused severe social damage, infringed upon the rights and interests of the Agricultural Bank of China and seriously hampered China's financial and social order. At the same time, Zhao Jinrong and Xu Zhiguo fell for the lies of the swindlers. Violating the provisions on management of foreign currency, they exceeded their power and issued standby letters of credit for huge amounts of money. They also transgressed the laws and regulations on keeping secrets and provided state secrets to people from outside the Chinese mainland, which infringed on the interests of the country. It was learned that after the crime had been committed, judicial departments and other relevant administrations of China took a series of measures. And with the co-operation of police and financial institutions of other countries, no money was paid out during the validity period of the 200 standby letters of credit.
