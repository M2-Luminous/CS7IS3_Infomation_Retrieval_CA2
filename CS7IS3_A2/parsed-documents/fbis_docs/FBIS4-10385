Responding to U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation, President Itamar Franco has stated that he will attend the meeting with his successor. In remarks to O ESTADO, President Franco said: "By then I will be in the final stage of my tenure and I believe the president-elect should go with me." He stated that he would invite his successor "whoever he might be." Franco has already set a date for leaving Alvorada Palace: 30 September; that is, prior to the first round of the elections. He said: "I want to leave the palace at that time to make it available for the president-elect to use for meetings during the transition period." He noted that in this way the palace could be thoroughly cleaned in time for its new resident. Although he still has eight months in office, Franco is already dreaming of more peaceful days at Planalto Palace. For instance, he mentioned that his youngest daughter, Fabiana, will graduate in Economics by the end of this year. He is convinced that her graduation ceremony will not be as hectic as that of his daughter Georgeana from Law School late last year. Franco said: "Everyone will be thinking about the new president and no one will be chasing after me." He added: "At the end of your term, only the wind knocks on your door." Franco hopes to leave the government with a low inflation rate. He believes prices will drop soon. He believes time will help overcome the resistance observed in some sectors to the FHC2 [Fernando Henrique Cardoso-2] Plan. This would help Cardoso -- his presidential candidate -- qualify for the second round.
