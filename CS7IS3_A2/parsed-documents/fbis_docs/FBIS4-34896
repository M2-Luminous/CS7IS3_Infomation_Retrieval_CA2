One of the most serious reasons -- although not openly discussed -- is the fear that a "Nasserist" type movement may emerge. This was one of the topics addressed by a senior officer close to high-placed government officials during a recent meeting he held with more than 10 leading businessmen. The conversation was open, and the tone was pessimistic and full of warnings about the future. He conveyed a clear message: The best option for businessmen is to finance the candidates who could defeat Lula at the ballot boxes. A crucial point of the officer's analysis is that, in the implementation of its program, the PT could lead Brazil to an institutional impasse. He noted that even moderate PT sectors have criticized the fact that Lula's government program has not taken into account the role of Congress in outlining its projects, despite the fact that the PT program envisages major changes "that will bring about confrontations within society," the officer said. It is believed the PT will fall well short of a majority bloc in Congress. In practice it will have to deal with a conservative Congress "and there will be an institutional impasse." There is nothing new in the officer's prediction. He said that something similar occurred in 1963 and 1964, when then President Joao Goulart sought to impose his "basic reforms" on a conservative congress. When the impasse occurs, he says, Brazil will either plunge into "lawlessness" through an anarchic process or enter "an arbitration process" through "the action of mediators." The new ingredient is right here. The "mediators," quoting the officer, would be the military, although without fulfilling the role they had in 1964. The "destructuring of the Army" could provoke an intervention that may not be led by senior officers linked with a conservative project, but by middle-level officers, in a "Nasserist" type process. The officer thus alluded to the process through which then Colonel Gamal Abdel Nasser and his "young Turks" took power in Egypt in 1956. That is, a type of armed intervention advocating nationalism and a planned economy. Although the officer did not say so, it appears he was hinting that this type intervention could be done in coordination with the PT or with leftist sectors. The officer acknowledges that Lula is more tilted toward moderate PT groups and that, if moderate sectors prevail in the government, there will be no impasse. The problem, he said, is that there is no way of guaranteeing that the radicals will be kept on the sidelines. He described the PT program as "intimidating." For instance, the PT wants to implement an agrarian reform through expropriation of land in an area equivalent to three times the size of Alagoas State at a cost of $20 billion. Reforms are necessary, he said, but in a "gradual, cautious" process. Furthermore, the officer believes, irrespective of who is elected president, Brazil faces severe structural problems that the constitutional revision process could have solved. Without these changes, he said, it will be much more difficult for any president to rule the country. There will be a type of "legal anarchy" provoked by the autonomy enjoyed by lower echelons, by the strangling of the federal budget through tied and poorly used allocations, by the "inverted stability" of public employees whereby job security is granted to uneducated employees who could be hired on the market and not to administrative officials of state-owned and self-financed companies -- who are massively replaced with each government or ministerial change -- and by the possibility of public servants calling a strike, which is not prohibited by the Federal Supreme Court. As can be predicted, the businessmen fully endorsed the officer's analysis. The doubt, one businessman said, is that it remains to be seen who is the best anti-Lula candidate, either Fernando Henrique Cardoso or Orestes Quercia, a subject which was not discussed. What this type of meeting reveals, irrespective of whether the analysis of the officer is correct or not, is that Lula has to go some to bridge the gap that separates him from more conservative, and strong, business sectors and overcome the distrust he still provokes among military leaders.
