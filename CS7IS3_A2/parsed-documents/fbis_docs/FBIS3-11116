After a two-day visit in Myanmar, he will travel to Cambodia, India, Malaysia, and Vietnam. During the meeting, both sides reviewed relations, which were described as good, between the two states and projects of common interest, which they agreed will require further study. Ohn Gyaw expressed interest in the possibility of hiring Cuban health specialists, as well as in a project to develop tourism in this country. Ohn Gyaw also voiced his admiration for Cuba, which he visited last year to explore areas of cooperation, praising the social achievements of the past three decades.

Before traveling to this capital, Robaina met in Vientiane with Laotian President Nouhak Phoumsavan, Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat, the ministers of trade, nutrition, finance, and other personalities. Following a very tight agenda, Robaina has tried to accomplish the objective of his tour to southeast Asia: to promote closer relations with the region and make known the Cuban reality.
