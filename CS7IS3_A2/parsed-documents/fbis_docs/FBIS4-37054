By reaffirming the importance of Arab coordination and the need for consultations among the Arabs and by sticking to the constant Arab rights, Syria asserts that it will not be anything other than the conscience of the Arabs, the holder of the pan-Arab banner, and the defender of our nation's just causes. Nor will it allow the enemies of the Arab nation to impose their conditions and diktats or to harm the Arab will to protect and regain their rights. Hence, the pressure being brought to bear on Syria will certainly be doomed to failure because Syria is sincere and serious in its endeavors to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. Syria also has no doubt that its battle to make true peace will be strenuous and difficult, particularly since the Israeli Government is trying to block and abort peace process and force it from its true path. The summit meeting between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi came to show that any attempts to distance Lebanon from Syria will inevitably be doomed to complete failure. This has been proven by the facts and the deep-rooted, strong relations between Lebanon and Syria. It has also been proven by brotherly relations and constructive and positive cooperation maintained by both countries in the interest of the one people in Syria and Lebanon. The challenges to which the two countries, Syria and Lebanon, are being exposed are the same in light of current events, developments, and interaction. Here, there is no doubt that the joint vision, the unified position, and the strong will between the two countries will enable them to deal with the current issues in a comprehensive manner and, consequently, to confront the resulting challenges and missions. The peace process was a key issue in the summit talks between President Hafiz al-Asad and President Ilyas al-Hirawi in Damascus, particularly since the outcome of this process requires, as both presidents asserted, continued cooperation and coordination between the two countries and efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in accordance with the approved bases of the peace process and the resolutions of international legitimacy. All evidence shows that the strong relationship between Syria and Lebanon stems from their true brotherhood. The Brotherhood and Cooperation Treaty between the two countries came to explain to every one trying to penetrate this relationship that ties between Syria and Lebanon are stronger and bigger than all attempts and that these ties will remain impregnable to all plots of treachery and any carrot and stick policy. Even if Israel recruits all it means, policies, and tools, it will not be able to harm Syria's support for Lebanon in its battle to liberate its land and implement Resolution No. 425, which stipulates the withdrawal of the Israeli occupation forces from southern Lebanon immediately and unconditionally. Syria, while stressing its full support for Lebanon to regain its territories, will never accept less than the return of the entire of the Golan Heights to the motherland, Syria. These Syrian Arab assertions stem from its strong desire to make the peace process successful and achieve its goals, as defined by the Madrid conference and the resolutions of international legitimacy. Israel is completely mistaken if it believes it can peddle its designs and pretexts. Syria had the last word when it declared that there would be no peace with occupation and that true peace is based on total withdrawal in return for comprehensive peace.
