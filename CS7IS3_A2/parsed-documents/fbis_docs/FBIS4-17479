He expressed the hope that there would be a sufficient number of deputies to form a government, pass legislation and change the Constitution, for instance 430 or 440 deputies. The run-off elections in 112 constituencies are scheduled for 26 June. Kravchuk did not say whether he would run for president. He only expressed his gratitude to those who want him to. The registration of presidential candidates will end on April 26. He said that both the right and left-wing extremists in the new Supreme Soviet were ideologically Bolsheviks doing harm to Ukraine.
