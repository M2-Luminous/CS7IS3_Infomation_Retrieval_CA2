FR940722-0-00109 FR940722-0-00019 5. Processing and Procedural Rules 82. In the Notice, we proposed to adopt general processing and procedural rules for broadband PCS based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules. One commenter, AIDE, argues that the Commission's reference to proposed PCS rules is vague and legally insufficient for a Notice of Proposed Rule Making. Comments of AIDE at 16&hyph;17. AIDE also asserts that the adoption of PCS processing and procedural rules is beyond the scope of the Notice in this rule making proceeding. Id. We disagree. The Notice sought comment on specific rule sections contained in Part 22 of our Rules and asked commenters to indicate what modifications should be made to those rules to adapt them for PCS services. See Notice at ¶128. In addition, the Notice specifically requested comment on the general procedural, processing and petition to deny procedures that should be used for auctionable services. The Notice's proposal to adopt processing rules based on Part 22 of the Commission's Rules, with any appropriate modifications for PCS services, clearly indicated to commenters the terms of the proposed rules, as is required by 5 U.S.C. §553 and 47 CFR §1.413(c). Accordingly, we believe that the Notice's description of the proposed rules was sufficiently specific to alert interested parties to the substance of our proposal and to provide an adequate opportunity for comment on those proposals. Moreover, we conclude that these issues are well within the scope of the Notice. 83. As we proposed, we adopt for broadband PCS a modified version of the application processing rules contained in Part 22 of the Commission's Rules. These rules, which will comprise Subpart I of Part 24 of our Rules, will govern application filing and content requirements, waiver procedures for return of defective applications, regulations regarding modification of applications, and general application processing rules. We also adopt petition to deny procedures based on Section 22.30 of the Commission's Rules. In addition, as we proposed in the Notice, we adopt rules similar to Sections 22.927, 22.928 and 22.929 of our existing rules (47 CFR §§22.927, 22.928, 22.929) to prevent the filing of speculative applications and pleadings (or threats of the same) designed to extract money from sincere broadband PCS applicants. In this regard, we limit the consideration that an applicant or petitioner is permitted to receive for agreeing to withdraw an application or a petition to deny to the legitimate and prudent expenses of the withdrawing applicant or petitioner.
