He said that, if no consensus is reached, a parliamentary crisis will be solved through democratic means. Mircea Snegur said that the terms for the withdrawal of the 14th Army cannot be made conditional on granting special legal status to the rayons on the left bank of the Dniester River and added that the secessionists are supported by pro-imperial forces, but that the revitalization of the empire can be ruled out. The president of the Republic of Moldova reiterated the intention to sign the 'Partnership for Peace' program, after the public opinion poll scheduled for 6 March. Regarding the national army, he ruled out the possibility that it will be liquidated by a decision of the future parliament -- our Chisinau correspondent Anca Florea reports, citing the press service of the presidency.
