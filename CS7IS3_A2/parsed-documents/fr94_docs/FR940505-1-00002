ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its regulations on the monitoring of lender's collection activity after a final loss is paid, when a guaranteed borrower's account remains unsatisfied. This action is taken to further define criteria, by which FmHA will monitor the lender's future recovery from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts. There is no formal procedure at present for monitoring these accounts. The intended effect is to maximize collections from unsatisfied guaranteed borrower accounts and to minimize the financial loss to the Government.
