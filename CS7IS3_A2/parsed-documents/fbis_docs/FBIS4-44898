If so, the technology will spur dramatic progress of science and technology to an immeasurable extent. In order to develop such technology, MITI's project "Atom Technology" was initiated on a full scale. For 10 years, starting in FY92, MITI is expected to invest approximately Â¥25 billion into this ambitious project, which is being pursued by a group of brilliant minds from industry, academia, and government. It may not be merely a dream to have some of the atom technology implemented by the early 21st century. Recently, we have seen rapid progress of technologies for observing and controlling microregions that have shifted from submicron to angstrom level. Already, research papers have been published by IBM Corp., NTT Corp., and Hitachi, Ltd., to present their achievements, e.g., letters were drawn by moving one atom or molecule at a time with a scanning tunnel microscope. This technology is called mechanical probe (technology of pulling an atom or a molecule out and putting it back in). The principle of this technology is as follows. The tip of an ultra-fine needle (probe) is brought in contact with a material's surface, and pulse currents are passed through the needle to weaken the chemical bonds of the material through optical excitation. Furthermore, heat is added to cleave atomic bonds, and one atom is grabbed on the needle's tip. The atom is moved by the needle wherever desired, and a reverse-polarity electromagnetic pulse is applied to the needle to place the atom in a specific hole. Another recently developed technology permits one to pull out one atom from a material, by irradiating an electron beam, and then attach the atom in a targeted site. However, these technologies are no more than research tools, and further technological revolution is necessary for exceeding the limits of existing technologies to industrialize material synthesis technology. The aforementioned project of MITI aims at the development of next-generation common key technologies that are expected to spur fantastic growth of various industries, including the chemical, biotechnological, and electronic industries. Therefore, the project plans to try to fuse various technologies, such as the mechanical probe and laser technologies, and to seek brand new technologies based on ideas completely different from traditional ones. Fusion of All Possible Technologies The MITI project consists of four major branches: (1) solid-surface atom, molecule observation and manipulation technology; (2) spatial atom aggregation observation and manipulation technology; (3) organic molecule structure observation and manipulation technology; and (4) atom, molecule process theoretical technology. The development objectives of the solid-surface atom, molecule observation and manipulation technology are to identify, observe and measure one atom or molecule on the surface of a material under various conditions -- such as ultra-high vacuum and high and low temperatures -- and to be able to manipulate the atom or molecule. At the present level, it is extremely difficult to observe atoms and molecules of materials other than electrically conductive materials, whereas the new project aims at technologies that can be used for any type of material. In addition, under the same section of the project, technologies are to be developed to measure (in real time), analyze, and control dynamic processes such as chemical reaction, etching and surface growth on the surface of a solid. Under the spatial atom aggregation observation and manipulation technology, development targets are technologies to observe live and control the formation, aggregation, discretion, and reaction of atom aggregates in a three-dimensional space. Also targeted are technologies to form self-organizing aggregate structures made of targeted atomic aggregates by controlling their movements and reactions and electron transfers among them through the manipulation of a spatial electromagnetic field. Theory Clarification and Prediction, First of All Under the organic molecule structure observation and manipulation technology, technologies are to be developed to identify organic molecules, such as biological molecules, and to manipulate the chemical bond and electronic state at a specific segment within the molecule. Furthermore, these technologies will be used to acquire basic information for increasing the speed and the precision of decoding the base sequence of DNA. In order to develop these ultimate technologies, it is also necessary to develop basic supporting technologies, such as simulation technologies, for theoretically clarifying and predicting the behavior and reaction phenomena of atoms and molecules at a surface or an interface. Thus, the plan is also to develop a new "theoretical experimental apparatus" by combining computers and information processing software. This project has been under way at the National Institute for Advanced Interdisciplinary Research (NAIR), which was newly established by the Agency of Industrial Science and Technology in January 1993 at Tsukuba Research Center. The project R&D is being carried out by researchers from national research institutes, private corporations, and universities, all of whom work under one roof in a concentrated, cooperative manner; yet the participation of these researchers is quite flexible. A supercomputer is soon to be installed at NAIR, and other facilities and devices are being installed as scheduled. In February 1993, a technical research association called Angstrom Technology Research Organization was set up by 30 corporations, including those participating in the MITI project. Those corporations include E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc.; Texas Instruments Inc.; and Motorola Corp., in addition to Japan's major electric makers -- Mitsubishi Material Co., Ltd.; Kobe Steel, Ltd.; Nippon Steel Corp.; Ebara Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; and Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd.
