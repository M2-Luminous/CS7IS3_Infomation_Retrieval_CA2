The 493-ton vessel, "Igor Maksimov," entered the Pusan harbor on last Friday carrying 22 Korean-Russian tourists. The ship was originally scheduled to leave Pusan Sunday afternoon. But, the Korean agency of a Russian state firm to which the vessel belongs had the Pusan court distrain the ship pending the payment of a repair fee. An official of the Korean agency said on Wednesday "Igor Maksimov" was repaired for one month last August at Choyang Shipyard at Yong-to, Pusan. But, the Russian firm failed to pay the repair fee totaling about 35 million won. The vessel has a crew of 23 in addition to the ethnic Korean passengers.
