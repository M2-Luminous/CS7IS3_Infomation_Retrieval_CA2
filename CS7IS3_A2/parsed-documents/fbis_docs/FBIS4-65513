In response to a question, Previti said that in his talk with the American ambassador, Bosnia had come up only marginally and was barely touched upon. The U.S. ambassador, however, took the occasion to voice appreciation for Italy's "essential cooperation" in NATO's initiatives in and for the former Yugoslavia. Turning to Italo-American ties, Previti stressed that the long-time alliance between the two countries would continue unfailingly in the future. Meanwhile, out of Brussels, where the new Italian foreign minister Antonio Martino was attending an EU [European Union] ministerial meeting, the first signals were given that the Berlusconi government would like to play a more active role in the Balkan crisis. Stressing that "the problem is very close to our interests", Martino announced to his European colleagues that an Italian diplomatic representation was imminently about to open in Sarajevo and would be placed in the hands of ambassador Vittorio Pennarola. The minister did not rule out the sending in of Italian peacekeepers "under certain conditions" to oversee, within a NATO context, the implementation of an overall peace plan agreed to by all sides. However, Italy's controversial recent experience in Somalia led the government to want to be certain that it had a say in all the relevant decisions before committing peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, Martino said.
