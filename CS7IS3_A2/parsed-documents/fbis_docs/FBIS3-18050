Until then there will be an actual "job gap" for "almost 7 million persons," Karl Proebsting, president of the Land Employment Office, stated in an interview published by the Cologne HANDELSMAGAZIN of the Federal Work Group of Medium-Sized and Large Retail Trade Companies (BAG). Even under the most favorable economic growth conditions, no lasting improvement on the labor market is to be expected for the second half of the 1990's. "A consolidation of unemployment at an increasingly higher level threatens," he warned. "In 1995, at the latest, 4 million persons may be unemployed in Germany, about 3 million of them in the old laender." In addition to this registered unemployment, there is "an enormous amount of covert unemployment." On the one hand, it is hidden by the use of labor market policy instruments, such as job creation measures, qualification, and working short hours; on the other hand, more and more people are retreating from the labor market because they are discouraged and without prospects.
