He said that Western Europe had always feared the unification of Eastern European Slavic states and made efforts to prevent them from creating a union. "The time has come to stop taking instructions from Paris and London," he said. He believes that the Balkan war was the catalyst of the idea of a Slavic union and that Russia must form up a military-political alliance in Eastern Europe. "If the Russian troops come to the Balkans, they will never tolerate humiliation of the Slavic peoples. We shall send as many divisions to the Balkans as our Slavic brothers will ask," he said. He emphasized at the same time, that Slavs would never become aggressors. Leader of the Russian National Congress Aleksandr Sterligov said that the economic crisis in Russia was evolving into a catastrophe. This can be judged, he continued, from the unprecedented industrial recession and from the incompetence and inefficiency of the authorities. Sterligov demanded that the events in Moscow last October be investigated and that their actual organizers not be allowed to evade punishment. He said that the democrats were preparing for a civil war and were forming up armed units. He urged the opposition to do everything they can to prevent Russian-American military exercises in the Urals. In his opinion, the U.S. wanted to obtain information about the Russian army's combat capability so as to become better prepared from the occupation of Russia. He said that public committees should be set up to organize actions of protest against Russian-American military exercises. The World Congress of Slavic Orthodox and Christian Peoples is being held on the initiative of the Liberal-Democratic Party which claims that the event is being attended by delegations from Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Belarus.
