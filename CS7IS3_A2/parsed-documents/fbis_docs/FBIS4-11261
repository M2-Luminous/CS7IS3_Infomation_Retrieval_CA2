Padron made this statement following the inauguration of the Parlandino, which includes representatives from Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, at the La Perla Building -- Parlandino headquarters. Following the inauguration, Padron told journalists that the signing of the Cartagena Agreement will commemorate its 25th anniversary in May. The Cartagena Agreement was an extremely slow process during the first 20 years, but it began to take off in the past five years, particularly in the financial arena -- a circumstance no one can deny. Padron stated that in 1992 commercial exchange between Colombia and Venezuela surpassed $1 million; in 1993, it exceeded $1.5 billion; and, in 1994, it is expected to exceed $3 billion, which is considered significant progress compared with other countries. Currently, Colombia and Venezuela are considering moving from mere economic integration to social, cultural, and political integration. Padron explained that the Andean Social Summit, which will be inaugurated at 1100 today on the Senate floor in the presence of President Rafael Caldera and which ends on 22 April, seeks mainly to obtain the approval of the Andean Social Charter. The Andean Social Charter contains alternatives for improving the living standards of citizens of the five member countries that unfortunately have not moved in a parallel manner toward economic development. Padron believes that the charter contains elements fundamental to solving the problem, but, in addition to that, these elements deal with establishing responsibilities which, according to him, set the charter apart from other documents issued by international organizations. Padron added that the Andean Social Charter assigns responsibilities among the international organizations operating in the area and, of course, among the governments and parliaments from the five countries. Padron believes that events of this type lead to popular support for the integration process, which has lacked it. This is why they view lending popular support to the integration process as an objective essential for bringing to life the union of the five countries as epitomized in the dream of our liberator Simon Bolivar. Integrationist Vocation During his inauguration speech, Congress President Eduardo Gomez Tamayo indicated that recently our countries have made significant progress in the area of commercial and economic integration. Gomez said: "We could even say that we have begun to overcome some political differences that limited the integration process in the past. This is the time to surpass difficult circumstances and persevere on the path of integration. We must advance in the identification of policies as Colombia and Venezuela, which have experienced more than promising results in the commercial sector, have done." He also said that the current international situation demands the most determined integrationist vocation from Venezuela. As it is true that the situation has changed, it is also true that today's world requires an innovative vision in various aspects. Gomez noted that the trend toward forming economic blocs is a most pressing circumstance, adding: "Insofar as our peoples consolidate intraregional trade and strengthen their political and cultural relations, we will be able to hope to compete in the world context." The Andean Social Charter The seven subjects the Andean Social Charter is contemplating include social integration and poverty eradication; children, women, and the family; health and nutrition; basic needs and housing; education and culture; productive employment and the informal economy; and jobs. The discussion of these subjects began during the Parlandino meeting in Caracas on 19 April, and their approval is expected at the closing session on 22 April. Regarding education, participants are proposing to their governments the reinforcement of literacy programs. In the area of housing, they are urging the relevant authorities in the Andean nations to implement plans designed to face the housing shortage typical of the region's urban and rural areas. The need to implement health programs ranks among the most critical, especially regarding the decentralization of services. In the area of nutrition, food assistance plans targeting the poor are deemed necessary. Regarding jobs, they recommend that their governments implement policies that lead to the creation of new businesses, cooperatives, and other organizations linked to the informal economy in order to reduce unemployment, specifically in depressed groups in the rural sector. As for children, women, and the family, they propose the implementation of political, economic, and social programs. They recommend assigning human, technical, and economic resources to centers of attention, protection, and development as well as promoting and strengthening the [words indistinct] all children, women, and the family in general. Regarding social integration and poverty eradication, they propose the adoption of policies that facilitate the incorporation of all social sectors in the subregional integration growth-and-development processes.
