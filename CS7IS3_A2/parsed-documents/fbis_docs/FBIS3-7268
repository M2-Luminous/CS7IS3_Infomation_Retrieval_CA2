[22 March] -- Malaysia will consider sending additional soldiers to join the United Nations Protection Force (Unprofor) in Bosnia-Herzegovina if requested to do so by the UN, Armed Forces chief Jen [General] Tan Sri Borhan Ahmad said today. However, he said, there had been no proposal yet to despatch extra peacekeepers to the war-ravaged country. So far, Malaysia's contribution in Unprofor was sufficient alongside the participation of soldiers from several other countries, he added. He told this to reporters after launching the 13th Air Thamal (Thai-Malaysia) joint exercise between the Malaysian and Thai air forces at the Royal Malaysian Air Force (RMAF) base here. Malaysia has sent about 1,500 soldiers to join the UN peacekeeping force in response to the atrocities committed by Serbs on Muslims in Bosnia. Ten RMAF aircraft, including five F-5E jets and three OV-10 reconnaissance planes, are taking part in the exercise, an annual series held on rotation between the two countries to strengthen cooperation in operational procedures.
