The 23 October 1991 Paris accord has clearly stipulated that the Vietnamese communists should withdraw all their aggressor forces from Cambodia and that a quadripartite Supreme National Council be set up to settle the issue of national reconciliation. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] has correctly and meticulously implemented every point of the Paris accord, especially the important clauses. But the Vietnamese aggressors, the Vietnamese communist puppets, and an alliance inside and outside UNTAC [UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia] have opposed the accord from the beginning. II. UNTAC organized elections in violation of the Paris accord. However, the Cambodian people have voted for the FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] Party and the PDK has supported the outcome of the elections the FUNCINPEC Party has won. This is to allow the FUNCINPEC to form a new (?transitional) government, to set up a parliament, to codify a constitution, and to establish a real national government. Nevertheless, the Vietnamese aggressors, who have occupied Cambodia for 15 years, and their puppets as well as the alliance have shown their opposition to this by revolting and separating the seven provinces bordering Vietnam. They have used force and pressure to form a two-headed government. In reality, real state power still belongs to the puppets of the Vietnamese communists. They have repeatedly reorganized the formation [of the government] in opposition to and in violation of the Cambodian people's wishes, democracy, and the 23 October 1991 Paris accord. III. Shortly after the creation of the two-headed government, the Vietnamese aggressors, the Vietnamese puppets, and the alliance marshalled their forces in Cambodia to attack the Cambodian people, national resistance forces, and Democratic Kampuchea [DK]. In August 1993, they began launching military offensives on Phnum Chhat and Stoung [District]. They created all kinds of disasters, burned and plundered the people's property, shot the people dead, and raped their children in the most savage manner. These actions have caused appalling devastation. IV. On 21 November 1993, King Norodom Sihanouk put forth a five-point policy for national reconciliation. The PDK, like the Cambodian nation and people, has fully supported the royal policy. The five points of the royal policy are as follows: A. A total and immediate cease-fire across Cambodia; B. A cessation of all military activities, including mine-laying and so on. C. Return of Preah Vihear Temple, Pailin, and other regions controlled by Democratic Kampuchea to the state and government of the Kingdom of Cambodia; D. Dissolution of the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea and its incorporation into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces; and E. Obligation of the government to offer the posts of co-ministers, deputy co-ministers, and co-state secretaries as well as advisory roles to PDK personages. The king will appoint a PDK personage as his senior privy councillor. In this context, the PDK, on the one hand, should cease having liberated zones and armed forces, while on the other, it should join both the government and army. This is to form an authentic national government and to establish an authentic national army. The Cambodian nation and people as well as the PDK and the peace- and justice-loving countries of the world have supported the royal five-point policy with the aim of achieving national reconciliation. Also, among the people, the movement demanding national reconciliation has become increasingly vigorous. V. The two-headed government, however, does not care about the royal five-point initiative, the national reconciliation, and the desire of the Cambodian nation and people and peace- and justice-loving countries of the world. They are only busy with: A. Allowing the Vietnamese, old and new alike, to flow into Cambodia at will. There are now nearly four million Vietnamese in the country. B. Attacking and attacking. C. Amassing money extorted from the people to buy war materiel to further inflame the war. D. Forcibly drafting the people and their children to serve as soldiers and to die on the battlefield one after another. E. Creating thievery, banditry, and corruption; allowing commodities prices to go sky-high; and generating unemployment, beggary, and all kinds of vices. F. Whatever the two-headed government is called, in reality it is the Vietnamese communist government that assumes 99 percent of state power in Phnom Penh and 100 percent in the provinces. This includes power in the military, police, civilian, and all other sectors. Therefore, it is the two-headed government, in particular the Vietnamese communists and their puppets as well as the alliance that should be held responsible for the survival of the Cambodian nation and people. National problems are becoming increasingly serious as there are almost four million Vietnamese communists nationwide, especially in eastern Cambodia. The presence of over four million Vietnamese has created all kinds of serious national and social problems. Social problems, in particular, have become critical. People are starving; soldiers, policemen, public servants, teachers, and professors have not been paid; the number of beggars are increasing; and the problem of corruption and others have become acute. G. In the face of this serious situation and national and social problems, I wish to appeal to the compatriots: 1. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to stop the war waged by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese communist puppets, and the alliance; 2. To join hands to conduct all kinds of activities to prevent the serious social situation caused by the Vietnamese communist aggressors' occupation of Cambodia, by the power of the Vietnamese communists' puppet, and by all sorts of corrupt practices. 3. To join hands to support the national reconciliation plan of King Norodom Sihanouk; 4. To join hands to carry out all kinds of activities to prevent and do away with the problem of corruption and the problem of nearly four million old and new Vietnamese in Cambodia, and to promote national reconciliation in accordance with his majesty's five-point policy. Our entire nation and people have become more united under King Norodom Sihanouk's national reconciliation banner. The old and new aggressors and their puppets have become terribly isolated, and have already been sentenced by the entire Cambodian nation and people. The cause of our nation and race, which is in the hands of all our people, will certainly prevail over their atheist enemies. Down with the warmongers! Long live the Cambodian nation and people! Long live the king's national reconciliation policy!
