FR941107-2-00032 FR941107-2-00008 Paulista agrees that BIA is warranted in this investigation. However, Paulista contends that the company's ranged public data should not be used to calculate USP. Paulista argues that the use of its ranged public data as BIA would be unprecedented and contrary to the intent of the Department's public summary requirements, which is to provide meaningful summaries of data for the public. Additionally, Paulista asserts that there is sufficient information on the record in this investigation to establish a BIA dumping rate without resorting to the use of ranged data. DOC Position: We agree with the petitioners that Paulista should not be rewarded for withdrawing from the investigation. In order to assign Paulista an adverse BIA rate, the Department cannot rely on the margin calculated in the preliminary determination because the use of such a rate would not comport with the CIT's decision in Smith Corona. While the Department might otherwise rely on the amended petition for purposes of BIA, given the circumstances of this case and the intent of the statute, we do not find that the rates contained in that petition provide an adequate basis for BIA. Section 776(c) of the Act provides for the use of BIA to compel participation. Further, a more adverse BIA is required where a respondent fails to cooperate or significantly impedes the investigation, as in this case. The preliminary margin was substantially higher than the rate found in the amended petition for purposes of initiation. To use the petition rate would, in effect, reward the respondent for refusing to cooperate. Moreover, a precedent could be set which would encourage a respondent to withdraw from a proceeding and remove its proprietary information from the record whenever the margin found in the preliminary determination exceeded that which formed the basis of the initiation ( e.g., Krupp Stahl A.G. v. United States, Slip Op. 93&hyph;84, May 26, 1993). We disagree, however, with petitioners' proposed selection of BIA. Although the Department has used such ranged data as a basis for BIA in the past, the use of such information is a last resort. In this instance, we are not compelled to use the ranged data in order to calculate an adverse final determination rate. There is sufficient data available in petitioners' COP allegation and Paulista's public financial statement to calculate a FMV based on CV. This methodology is consistent with both past practice ( see, e.g., Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, Certain Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat Products, and Certain Cut-to-Length Carbon Steel Plate From Belgium, 58 FR 37083 (July 9, 1993), and with the CIT's holding that respondents should not realize a benefit from noncooperation. Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation In accordance with Section 735(c)(4) of the Act, we are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of silicomanganese from Brazil that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after June 17, 1994, the date of publication in the Federal Register of our preliminary determination. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the U.S. price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The dumping margins are as follows:
