'Abd-al-Rabbuh rejected Israel's "lying version" which said a lone gunman, Baruk Goldstein, shot dead 53 Palestinians at the West Bank mosque during dawn prayers. "The PLO blames the Israeli government and its army for this crime," 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said at a press conference here. 'Aziz al-Hashmami, aged 40, told AFP he was inside the Tomb of the Patriarchs when the shooting started and said that "four to five" gunmen had opened fire as the Palestinian knelt in prayer. 'Abd-al-Rabbuh said Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin telephoned PLO chief Yasir 'Arafat to apologise for the attack. The PLO declared three days of mourning and a general strike in the occupied territories after the massacre of more than 40 Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron. The PLO denounced the shooting as "criminal slaughter" and said the Israeli government was responsible, a PLO statement said earlier. The international community, including the co-sponsors of the peace process Russia and the United States, should act to "put an end to such massacres." It repeated PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat's call for "international protection" for the Palestinians in the territories. The PLO is currently trying to clinch a deal with Israel on launching Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.
