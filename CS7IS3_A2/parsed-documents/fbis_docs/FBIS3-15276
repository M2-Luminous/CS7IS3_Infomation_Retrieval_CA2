Speaking in an interview with ITAR-TASS on Thursday, Chernichenko said that "not crimes have been forgiven but concrete people. Therefore the only goal of that amnesty was to cross out the October tragedy and free their allies." He believes that the decision on political amnesty has put the country before the danger of new conflicts -- "They have released into the streets of Moscow the people who are professionals in staging coups. To hope that they will change for the better would be as silly as to wait for a self-respected wolf to become a vegetarian." The euphoria of democrats over the adoption of the new Constitution was premature. He said the saying "he cried at the wedding but danced at the funeral" perfectly fits the deputies who voted for the amnesty. Chernichenko explained the political failure by the disintegration of democrats. It took them several days to decide their position. They voiced their assessment of the State Duma's resolution on amnesty only on March 2 by saying that the amnesty was a well thought-out political provocation, a frontal offensive against democracy, the ultimate goal of which is to bring revenge-seeking forces to power.
