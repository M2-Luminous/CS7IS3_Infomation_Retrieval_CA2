Jursenas: `There is No Government Crisis'"] [Text] "I get the impression that there is a certain confusion in the ranks of our dear and respected friends on the right. It appears that signatures for referendums are being successfully gathered and that everything is all right. At the same time, they are throwing various accusations back and forth and are resorting to various means, as if they (the rightists) were not convinced how one referendum or the other will come out. Or perhaps they already know the outcome, and are therefore rushing about in confusion in advance," Seimas chairman C. Jursenas stated yesterday at a press conference. According to Jursenas, amendments to the Referendum Law are being actively attacked now. What is overlooked, however, is that it is difficult to organize any kind of referendum on the basis of the currently valid Referendum Law, which dates back to the Soviet era. "Especially interesting is the attempt" to set the president and the Seimas against each other, which is being done by one faction (the Christian Democrats--R.R.) with its memorandum. This memorandum proposes to the president that he make use of specific regulations and articles of the Constitution, especially article 58, which outlines how the president can dismiss the Seimas prematurely. "Some are doing one thing, others are doing something else, but the efforts point in the same direction as they attempt to introduce confusion and set people against each other, in the hope that something might after all come of it," Jursenas said in speaking about the activities of the rightists. Regarding the amendments to the Referendum Law, the Seimas chairman once again stressed that according to the Constitution, only the Seimas can adopt constitutional laws, whereas only regulations, not laws or their instructions, are adopted by means of referendums. In addition, the president's powers cannot be expanded beyond the limits outlined in the Constitution. One would have to change the Constitution itself if the goal were to implement the aforementioned actions. Up to now, no such amendments have been received. Commenting on Landsbergis' assertion regarding a governmental crisis in the country, C. Jursenas noted that talk about a crisis had started back at the end of October 1992, after the first round of elections. In the speaker's opinion, the rightists had instigated a crisis artificially in 1992: the Supreme Council was still able to work successfully. But some people wanted a government constituted differently and they ended up hurting themselves. C. Jursenas said that he saw no government crisis at this time: the Seimas, President, and government are working actively and intensively. Of course, when the country's economic and social situations are difficult, the reaction of some government representatives is inadequate. This is why such broad conclusions are being drawn from this reaction as well as from the fact that certain Seimas members are flustered. With reference to the government as a whole, however, there is no crisis; the impression that there is one is being artificially inflated, relying on the fact that life is hard. Why is it hard? Because the current government inherited the kind of situation that cannot be changed in a year. Finally, a mandate was given for four to five years, so an accounting will come when these years have passed. "We'll talk about all these matters in 1996." And with respect to this government, the Seimas chairman is "more or less pleased." If something needs to be changed, it will be changed. This is already foreseen and presents no problem.
