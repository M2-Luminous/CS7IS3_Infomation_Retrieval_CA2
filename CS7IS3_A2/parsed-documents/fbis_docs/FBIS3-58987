Loeschnak hopes that the judiciary will be able to present an "intermediate result" for a bill of indictment by the end of the month. The interior minister considers it a proven fact that the attacks were carried out by "perpetrators completely familiar with the right-wing scene in Austria, and clearly xenophobic." He believes that the suggestion by Joerg Haider, chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe], that by investigating the right-wing scene the authorities were following a "dead-end road," can only be explained by the fact that this is "unpleasant" for Haider. After all, Horst Jakob Rosenkranz, the husband of Lower Austrian FPOe deputy Barbara Rosenkranz, "was clearly recognizable" on a video together with one of the suspects. This statement led to furious protests among the FPOe. Haider described Loeschnak's attacks as "unjustified." He stresed that, together with the ORF, Loeschnak is attempting to disparage the whole FPOe. Loeschnak admitted that government forces were "surprised" at the strength of the right-wing extremist scene. [passage omitted]
