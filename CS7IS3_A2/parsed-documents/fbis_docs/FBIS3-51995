This agreement to resume the negotiations is a step that must be duly assessed; at the same time, its essence and scope must be defined. The signed document is an instrument and sets a stage that entails permanent and growing application. This is the renewal of a process that opens the doors to difficult and complex phases of dialogue and negotiations. This cannot be downplayed or overestimated. We have a great deal before us; we can achieve a great deal. This framework, as a whole and given its specifications, guarantees the contents of the negotiations. A necessary and essential starting point for the solution to an armed conflict with the characteristics of the Guatemalan conflict is the recovery, as a basis and foundation, of all that is positive from the process that began with the signing of the Oslo Agreement. Above all, the agreed upon agenda in Mexico should be maintained at the negotiations table. The essential political, economic, and social topics, which are called substantive, must not be excluded. The fact that the participation of civilian sectors in the negotiations was agreed upon through an assembly, which will discuss and decide the substantive issues, and that the result of this opinion will be one of the most important for the negotiations between the Government-Army and the URNG represents progress. It carries undeniable political and social weight which undoubtedly neither of the parties can ignore. The civilian sectors, summoned by the Legislative Assembly president, appointed by the Episcopal Conference, will sovereignly decide on the assembly's name, operation, internal policies, and mechanisms. The terms of agreed upon legality and representation do not mean any limitation due to legal reasons; the parties have explicitly agreed upon this. It has also been made very clear and agreed upon to engage in a clean process, not to manipulate or hamper the assembly's work. The term "nongovernment" means those organizations that do not belong to or are not linked directly or indirectly to state structures. The civilian sectors, led by the Legislative Assembly president, whom both parties hope will be Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno, have a constructive stage that its representatives can take advantage of to foster and express their aspirations. [sentence as published] The negotiations must be open and trustworthy for the parties. Through the Legislative Assembly president, mechanisms will be created so that the civilian sectors can have the necessary information. So that certain aspects of the negotiations will not be manipulated, the reserve required by the international organizations is necessary, something we accept. This is not an attempt to hide the issues and results of the negotiations, nor does it constitute any limitation on the civilian sectors to freely express themselves on the issues they broach. The United Nation's nature of moderation, with its powers to convene, as promoter of initiatives and as an adviser, is the most adequate, given the characteristics of our negotiations process to resolve the armed conflict in our nation. The United Nation's moral weight and guaranty of verification of all the agreements, substantive as well as operative, make it essential for the feasibility of the process. An agreement on fulfilling human rights is not excluded from the negotiations. This issue, which should be immediately implemented and verified internationally, is the initial and irreplaceable point of the first negotiation session. It is the first test of political willingness, but, above all, it is a fundamental condition and guarantee for the agreed upon negotiations. An overall agreement is only possible if all of the points on the agenda are satisfactorily resolved. This year's goal, as indicated in the agreement, is to make all of the necessary efforts to attain the signing of a firm and lasting peace agreement. The temporary framework does not present nor condition the contents and development of the negotiations, nor does it mean the negotiation is concluded beforehand. The URNG Command affirms its willingness to continue fighting for all of the people's aspirations. It trusts that within the framework of this agreement, with the guarantees that the various sectors of Guatemalan society should give, these will provide their decisive contribution for the construction of a just and democratic peace. [Signed] URNG Command [Dated] 20 January 1994
