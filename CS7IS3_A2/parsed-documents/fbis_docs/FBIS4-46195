He spoke to Brendan Wright of our northern staff [in Belfast]: [Begin recording] Molyneaux: I regret that [words indistinct] of the warning, the caution which I gave to the prime minister when he met the other three party leaders along with me way back three years ago, when I said that as long as there is ambiguity and uncertainty over the constitutional future of Northern Ireland there will be attempts to achieve a balance of terror. Very regrettably, that is what is now coming about. Wright: Are you saying that you always thought there was a certain inevitability about loyalist paramilitary attacks in the south? Molyneaux: Well, in the south and in Northern Ireland, too, I mean, the weight of their attacks, let's face it, has been in Northern Ireland, not in the south. They've only had one attack in Dublin in the recent years, but look how many you've had in Northern Ireland within the last month. So it's a far, far bigger problem in Northern Ireland. Wright: Now, of course, you don't speak for the loyalist paramilitaries, but do you have any view as to why the UDF [Ulster Defense Force] should have carried out this attack? Molyneaux: Well, I don't know, but it's been that pattern, what I say, a balance of terror. It's part of the pattern of the attacks in Northern Ireland. It can't be separated from that. It's all of a piece. Wright: And what do you think will be the effect of the attack in Dublin? Molyneaux: Well, I think that probably they are bound to be worried, as we all are worried in Belfast, by what has been going on up here in this end of the island, for all of these recent weeks particularly. I think that probably in the minds of people in Whitehall, the draughtsmen of various documents and so forth, they don't really understand the feeling of exclusion, alienation if you like, of people in Northern Ireland and they look at various documents which have been drafted by -- and I'm being racist here -- by Englishmen who don't have a feel for the situation, and when they're read over here in the Shankill Road they look like a sellout and then certain people tell them it's a sellout and that doesn't help, either. Wright: And do you think part of the reasoning behind carrying out this attack might well be to try and force the Dublin government to change their attitude towards Sinn Fein and the IRA? I mean, some people in the loyalist quarters consider the Dublin goverment to be nothing more than messenger boys for Sinn Fein. Molyneaux: Well, it's -- yes, it's not just what I think about it, but they actually have said that that is the position. I mean, those who have carried out the attacks have said that actually in their statements when they claimed responsibility, if you like -- I think that's the term they tend to use -- but they have said that that's the object of it, and who are we to dispute that? Wright: At the weekend, on Friday, you called on loyalist paramilitaries to cease their violence. It's only been a matter of a few days, but do you think your message will get through to them? Molyneaux: Well, I think the fact that -- and despite what has happened and all the regrettable things have happened including the bombing in Dublin -- I think despite all of that it is very encouraging that even as recently as this morning they are saying now that -- and letting it be known -- that their combined leadership, whatever structure it may be, are going to this week to be considering more carefully the statement I made and what lies behind that statement, namely, the routes which were slightly obscure in the declaration which have been more clearly signposted in the clarification document, and it's now easier to point out to people and easier to make them understand that that route always was there, that it's now much more clearly identified.
