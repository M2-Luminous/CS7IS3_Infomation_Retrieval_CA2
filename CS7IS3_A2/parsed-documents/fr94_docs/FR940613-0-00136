FR940613-0-00136 FR940613-0-00017 Subpart D of part 968, encompassing §§968.401&hyph;968.425, is added to implement the Vacancy Reduction Program. Section 968.401 states the policy of the Department with respect to achieving high occupancy rates in public housing, in order to ensure maximum use of available housing resources. Section 968.403 repeats the statutory definition of PHAs to which the Vacancy Reduction Program is applicable, but clarifies that units not eligible for funding under section 14 of the 1937 Act are excluded from this set-aside program, as well. Section 968.405 defines terms that are used in subpart D to the extent these terms are not applicable to the remainder of part 968. Section 968.407 establishes the requirement that eligible PHAs submit a five-year vacancy reduction plan, and specifies the contents of the plan. For purposes of identifying components of a plan that may be identified as eligible for funding, within the limits of appropriated amounts, each submitted plan must be organized in a manner that facilitates review by the Department. For each action proposed to eliminate vacancies, the plan must include a schedule that shows the number of vacancies that the PHA expects to eliminate by the end of each 12-month period during the five years of the plan. When components of a plan involve capital improvements to dwelling units, the PHA must ensure that, after the improvements, the units themselves would meet or exceed the Housing Quality Standards set forth in 24 CFR 882.109, as amended by regulatory requirements concerning lead-based paint hazards. Section 968.410 explains the requirement for an on-site assessment of a participating PHA's vacancy situation, including the composition and responsibilities of the assessment teams and the purpose of the assessments. Section 968.413 establishes eligible uses and limitations on the use of funds available for the Vacancy Reduction Program. Paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) echo the statute establishing the program, but paragraph (b) includes clarifying language that cross-references PHMAP indicators in measuring the progress required under the statute for troubled PHAs. Paragraph (d) establishes that funding decisions would be through a publicly announced process, on the basis of priorities to be established by the Department. Section 968.416 provides that the PHA must comply with HUD requirements in requesting funds against the approved modernization budget. Section 968.419 requires the grantee to be responsible for assuring the quality of work performed using program funds. Section 968.422 establishes periodic reporting requirements for grantees until activities funded under the vacancy reduction program are completed. This section also specifies a schedule for completion of funded activities. Section 968.425 details the process for notifying a PHA of any deficiencies in its compliance with program requirements and specifies the nature of the changes and sanctions that may be pursued by HUD. Section 968.428 establishes requirements to be applied in auditing the grantee's use of funds upon completion of activities funded under the program. Section 968.435 lists program requirements that apply to the Vacancy Reduction Program in addition to the requirements specified in other sections of subpart D and §968.110. Other Matters Environmental Review At the time of publication of the proposed rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without significant change. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Executive Order 12866 This rule has been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866. Any changes made in the rule as a result of this review are identified in the docket file of the rule maintained by the Department and available for review at the above address. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this rule before publication and by approving it certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule implements a statutory program that provides funding to PHAs for limited activities designed to reduce the number of vacant dwelling units in their inventories. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule do not have substantial direct effects on States or their political subdivisions, or the relationship between the Federal Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. As a result, the rule is not subject to review under the Order. The rule merely implements a statutory program that provides funding to PHAs for limited activities designed to reduce the number of vacant dwelling units in their inventories.
