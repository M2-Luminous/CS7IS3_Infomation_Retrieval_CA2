In exchange for this, Ukraine will be financially compensated with aid of $175 million from the United States and at the same time will be given a safety guarantee. This is a major action that has been jointly undertaken by Russia, the United States, and Ukraine concerning the issue of nuclear weapons since the Lisbon Accord signed between the United States and Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus in May 1992. All three parties have made positive assessment of the above agreement. Clinton said that it was a "breakthrough" which has reduced the possibility of nuclear calamities and has ushered in a "new era" in the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship. Yeltsin maintained that the agreement had intensified the nuclear nonproliferation mechanism and pushed forward the process of nuclear disarmament. Kravchuk said that the agreement was the result of compromise made by all parties, which enabled Ukraine to be more secure and obtain the right of equal partnership. No doubt, the Moscow agreement has made significant progress toward solving the nuclear weaponry problem in Ukraine, but many problems have yet to be resolved. Moreover, whether the agreement can be smoothly carried out will depend on the development of Ukraine's domestic political situation and the relations between Ukraine and Russia and between Ukraine and the United States. First, the issue of nuclear weapons has a decisive impact on the stability of Ukraine's political situation. When Ukraine proclaimed its independence, it declared that it would be a nuclear-free country and promised to destroy all its nuclear weapons. Over the past few years, however, there have been different political propositions at home regarding the approval of the treaty to reduce strategic weapons in the first stage and the accession to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty. In some people's opinion, under the circumstances of enormous external pressure and public territorial claims from certain Russian forces, nuclear weaponry is Ukraine's "trump card" in defending its national independence and territorial integrity. They were even more worried about Russia's foreign policy after its new parliamentary election. Therefore, they do not want to give up their nuclear weapons but favor retaining them, at least for a certain period. Other people are of the opinion that the principle of becoming a nuclear-free country should not be changed, but they should be compensated for giving away the nuclear weapons, or the contents of the nuclear warheads should be transformed into fuel for nuclear power stations to alleviate the serious energy crisis. In addition, Ukraine found it difficult to continue maintaining and managing the existing nuclear missiles either economically or technically. If the nuclear arsenal is preserved, several dozen billion U.S. dollars will still be needed to set up a complete system of scientific research and production. That will be beyond their ability, even though they wish to do so. For this reason, the Ukrainian parliament decided last year to approve the treaty with 13 conditions attached to it and called for the nuclear powers, primarily Russia and the United States, to provide a security guarantee and economic aid as compensation. Therefore, after President Kravchuk signed the treaty in Moscow, he still has to make painstaking efforts to persuade the parliament so that the treaty can be endorsed and put into effect. Second, the issue of nuclear weapons is a vital element that has an impact on the relations between Ukraine and Russia and between Ukraine and the United States. Since the disintegration of the Soviet Union, nuclear weapons have all along been one of the major disagreements between Russia and Ukraine. The Russian side maintains that it should be the only successor of the Soviet nuclear weapons, and that those in the Ukrainian territory must be shipped to Russia. What is more, Russia tried to force Ukraine to give in by suspending supplies of petroleum and natural gas to the latter and pressing it to repay its debts. As for the United States, it first tried to make Ukraine submit to its pressure, threatening that, if Ukraine would not settle the nuclear problem, it would not develop other aspects of its relations with Ukraine. Later, it changed tactics by promising to provide Ukraine with aid of $175 million and increasing personnel contacts and consultations with a view to urging Ukraine to hand over its nuclear weapons. As a matter of fact, what Russia and the United States are worried about is the emergence of another powerful and independent nuclear country, apart from Russia, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Hence, they insisted that they would not provide a security guarantee to Ukraine unless it acceded to the treaty. Prior to his current trip to Moscow, Clinton was the first to announce in Brussels that Ukraine had consented to destroy the nuclear weapons. He also made a short stay in Kiev, which was aimed at demonstrating the progress made in nuclear disarmament so as to remove the anxieties of Europe over the nuclear threats on the one hand, and at manifesting the support he had won from NATO members on the other. The public maintains that the solution of the problem regarding Ukraine's nuclear weapons is a major achievement that has been scored through the coordinated position between the United States and Russia. However, the principal purpose of Clinton's current trip was to put his plan of a "partnership for peace" into practice. He made no commitment to security in the Eastern European region, and his promise of economic aid to Ukraine was also much said but little done, which was far from what Ukraine had expected. Judging from this, the changes of political situation in Russia and the United States and whether their policies toward Ukraine as well as the U.S. undertaking of aid and compensation can be carried out will have an impact on whether Ukraine will perform its obligations in a period of time to come.
