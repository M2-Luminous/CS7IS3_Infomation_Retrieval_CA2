The total water withdrawals in the Syrdarya and Amudarya basins increased threefold between 1950 and 1978, from 30 to 103 km[.sup]3[/], with the greatest withdrawal in 1985 (109 km[.sup]3[/]. The irrigated area during this same period approximately doubled. During the last decade of the studied period virtually the entire volume of annual water resources was withdrawn for irrigation. The increase in total withdrawals beginning in 1956 did not immediately exert an influence on the decrease in sea volume and decrease in its level because the five-year period 1956-1960 was a period of high waters. As a result the sea received an additional water inflow which stabilized the sea level and caused some increase which continued until 1960. After 1961 the sea level constantly dropped with a brief interruption in 1969-1970 due to the high waters of 1969. The research revealed the quantitative relations between the decrease in the volume (level) of the Aral Sea and the increase in water withdrawals and unreturned expenditures of river runoff in the sea basin. The relative constancy of the natural level and the volume of the Aral Sea persisted under conditions of a relative constancy of the total withdrawals of river runoff in the range 30-40 km[.sup]3[/] as long as the water consumption in the basin did not exceed 40 km[.sup]3[/]. A further increase in water consumption in the basin caused a continuing increase in the unreturned expenditures of river runoff, resulting in a corresponding decrease in volume and a drop in sea level. The threat of an ecological catastrophe in the Aral Sea basin is entirely evident. Figures 3; references: 10 Russian.
