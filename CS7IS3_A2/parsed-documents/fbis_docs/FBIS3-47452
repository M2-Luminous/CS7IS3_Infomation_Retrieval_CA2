In bilateral framework trade talks on autos and auto parts, Washington has called on Tokyo to ask Japanese automakers to formulate programs for imports of U.S. auto parts beyond fiscal year 1995 so they that these can be used as "objective criteria" to gauge the openness of the Japanese market. Thus, the negative view expressed by the MITI official might affect the unofficial vice-ministerial-level talks on autos and the auto parts trade that are to start on 12 January. In January 1992, when former U.S. President George Bush visited Tokyo, Japanese automakers drew up programs for their procurement of U.S. auto parts under MITI's guidance. They imported or procured locally U.S.-made parts worth $7.24 billion in the first half of fiscal year 1993 (April-September 1993), a 21.1-percent increase from the previous year. Despite this large increase, the senior MITI official thinks that "their procurement will decrease from now on," noting that the emergence of new models developed by the U.S. Big Three is casting a shadow over the sales of Japanese cars in the U.S. market, and that the ratio of parts procured locally by Japanese factories in the United States has already been very high, thus making it difficult for them to purchase more. He believes that expanding the import of U.S.-made parts "will be more difficult than increasing local procurement" because car sales remain sluggish at home and Japanese automakers can no longer afford to buy expensive U.S. parts. MITI has concluded that it is highly unlikely that the amount of U.S. parts procured by Japanese automakers, which is expected to reach about $15 billion altogether in fiscal year 1993, will increase appreciably in fiscal year 1994. The Japanese Government is avoiding getting involved in the U.S.-made parts procurement plans, claiming: "What is demonstrated in the procurement programs are voluntary goals set by Japanese automakers on the condition that their production in the United States should increase by 50 percent." However, the U.S. Government views the procurement programs as Japan's "commitments" and considers them a good example of numerical targets. It is possible that MITI's negative view on the expansion of U.S.-made parts procurement will cause Washington's attitude to toughen in the auto and auto parts trade talks.
