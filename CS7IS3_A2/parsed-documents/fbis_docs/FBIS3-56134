However, first hand information on the event is, so to say, in short supply. This is why our newspaper asked the Belarusian National Bank chairman, Stanislaw Bagdankevich, for an interview. [Koribut] The declaration on the monetary unification signed by the Russian and Belarusian prime ministers last week produced somewhat mixed feelings. On the one hand, it has said that the sides are ready to implement the merger; and on the other hand, the whole range of issues seem quite ambiguous... [Bahdankevich] This document reflects in the first place a general acceptance of the idea of common currency and the mechanism of the merger itself. At the same time, one should admit that we have failed to reach a consensus on several key issues. The most important of them is the setting of domestic prices for energy sources and basic raw materials on the territory of Russia and Belarus. The Russian side proposed a gradual merger, under which the prices for Belarusian enterprises would be lower than elsewhere in the world, and would be gradually increased for local consumers. The position of the National Bank on this is pretty clear -- immediately after the Republic's transition to the Russian ruble, a common mandatory price must be set for energy sources and basic raw materials within a common customs zone. Otherwise, the merger does not make sense since the Belarusian enterprises will prove uncompetitive on the Russian market. There are disagreements concerning the rate of exchange of the Belarusian ruble to the Russian ruble. We examined several options: the one-to-one rate, a rate calculated on retail prices of the "consumer basket" and on the stock exchange data. The latter is advocated by the Russian Ministries of Economy and Finance. The Russian Central Bank is going to bring up this issue again at one of its board meetings. It should be stated that we only talked about non-cash money. As for the cash, this topic will be addressed later. I can only say that we were considering the possibility of freezing portions of deposits for different terms. For example, 25 percent of large deposits could be frozen for three, six, and 12 months. Disputes were also triggered by the mechanisms of financing state budget deficits. It is proposed that Belarus coordinate them with Russia based on the GDP of each state, which is quite a normal procedure. However, the Russian Finance Ministry is inclined to perceive credits earmarked for this purpose as the Belarusian debt to the Russian Federation. We are absolutely against this, seeing them as the government's debt to its population repaid through the pricing system; in our situation -- through inflationary mark-ups [inflatsionnaya dobavka] added to retail prices for goods and services. [Koribut] In our country, reforms in the credit and financial sphere are, as a rule, accompanied by unexpected losses for one and undeserved benefits for the others. Will the National Bank undertake any measures intended to reduce economic losses that might be caused by the upcoming merger? [Bahdankevich] It is impossible to completely eliminate the possibility of economic problems for specific enterprises -- neither through economic nor administrative measures. One should remember, however, that as a matter of fact, we are talking about revaluation -- increasing the value of a currency unit -- and, consequently, about advantages of those with cash on hand, and losses for those who took credits. As a result of revaluation, the former will increase their assets, while the latter will have more money to repay. This is why the National Bank demanded quick credit repayments, the sale of ready goods, and the reduction of raw material wastes, etc. Let me emphasize that substantial losses might be incurred by enterprises that converted their bank credits into hard currency in the hope that they would be repaid by the much devaluated Belarusian rubles. [Koribut] Everyone knows that the National Bank has repeatedly alerted the Supreme Soviet to the need for a gradual and balanced approach to the monetary systems unification. Do you think that many of those fervently advocating the move now will later become its staunchest opponents? First of all, they might be managers who will discover that it is not enough to enter the zone of the ruble -- one must also earn it. [Bahdankevich] At this point, unification displays its positive side. In addition to facilitated and simplified circulation of goods, payment settlements, and travel regulations, there are also macroeconomic advantages, such as the removal of customs duties and the adjustment of domestic prices for raw materials. After all, Russia will remain our prime market for a long time yet. The negative effects include the Republic's slow pace of market- oriented changes, one-sided dependency on Russian raw materials, and low competitiveness of Belarusian products. Under certain circumstances, they could become dominant, with the present negative payment balance that we run with Russia threatening to crash our enterprises in massive numbers. This is why unification provides no grounds for excessive optimism. This is a chance, but will Belarus manage to grab it?
