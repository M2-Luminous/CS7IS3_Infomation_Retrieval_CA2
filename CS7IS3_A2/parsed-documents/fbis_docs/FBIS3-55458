In an interview with the leftist TIESA newspaper, Gylys said the reaction of the two Baltic neighbors was slightly different because Estonia is more reserved about Lithuania's step. Apparently, the Lithuanian minister gave the interview before Estonian President Lennart Meri's view on the matter was made public. Gylys said "although we maintained close relations with NATO, our desire was unexpected to many." The minister said Lithuania's request for NATO membership is based on national security interests and is not directed against anybody. "We move toward an era of politics without confrontation." In Gylys opinion, rapprochement with the alliance is an evolutionary process, while Lithuania's move might only speed it up. "This depends not only on Lithuania."
