Armenia would like to finish the recovery by the end of 1994, but it is premature to talk about deadlines at present, because the experts have yet to estimate the work to be done and determine what additional equipment should be brought to the plant. According to the deputy minister, it is impossible at the moment to estimate how much it will cost to resume operations at the plant in accordance with the relevant Russo-Armenian agreement, which Oleg Soskovets, Russian first vice-premier, and Grant Bagratyan, Armenian prime minister, signed on March 17.
