In the two weeks since Prime Minister Hosokawa's resignation announcement, consultations among the coalition parties were tough. What are your comments on the confusion during that period? [Hata] In view of the reasons for Hosokawa's resignation, members of my party have been discussing the need for a stable administration. Since we once tried to invite a new group to the coalition government with the approval of other parties, I was personally surprised at the latest decision by the coalition. [Sobata] The new administration is supposed to work on a delayed compilation of the fiscal 1994 budget. Do you think the lineup of the Hosokawa administration should be drastically reshuffled? [Hata] I am undetermined on that issue, but I personally think cabinet ministers who provided the budget plan should take the responsibility to pass the budget bill. Even if new cabinet ministers are assigned, they would have no time to review and analyze the budget bill. So, generally speaking, I personally think the enactment of the budget bill had better be done by the ministers currently in charge. [Sobata] However, some members of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] are calling for a full-scale cabinet reshuffle. What is your comment? [Hata] I want to spend more time before finalizing my stance toward the issue. [Sobata] It is often said the coalition government has been led by the so-called Ichi-Ichi line of Shinseito's Ichiro Ozawa and Komeito's Yuichi Ichikawa, and this is the major cause of friction among the coalition parties. Some members of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] are saying that such a tendency may be intensified under the premiership of the Shinseito leader. What is your opinion? [Hata] Many people criticize the Ichi-Ichi line. Recalling the last eight months, it was one of the most difficult periods in the history of Japanese politics. To manage the difficulties with the multiparty government, somebody had to take the leadership, otherwise the coalition government could not do anything. While their roles were highlighted too much, I think somebody had to do that. Ozawa has long been in the center of the nation's politics, and he knows the heavy responsibilities of political leaders. He had to take strong attitudes to set the political trends straight. I felt sorry about that because he is playing a thankless role for us. [Sobata] I would like to ask you about policy issues. Throughout the policy debates among the coalition parties, it was difficult to obtain SDPJ approval to increase the consumption tax. Under such circumstances, do you really think you can carry out tax reform before the end of June? [Hata] Instead of discussing whether or not we can do it, we should think about what the revenue resources for income tax reductions should be. We have to ask the public if the income tax cut should be discontinued next year. The tax cut should be continued, but Japan will soon become an aged society. To manage future problems, can we keep depending on the income tax imposed on young workers? This is the fundamental question. The government relies on direct taxes from individuals by 70 percent, and indirect taxes are only 30 percent of the revenue. I think most people agree that this imbalance should be redressed somehow; even those coalition members who opposed the tax reform plan think some sort of reform is needed. Anyway, we have to determine through much discussion the direction of the tax reform before the end of June and enact legislation this year. This is an agreement of the coalition government, and I think we can certainly reach an accord.
