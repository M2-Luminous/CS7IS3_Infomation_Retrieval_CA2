He told a working conference of the center that the center should do well in services and not seek profits. The premier said that there should be other channels for importing automobiles but they should be subject to macro-economic control. He encouraged automobile importing firms to import more technology in order to upgrade China's auto industry which is on the road to maturity. The China Auto Import and Trading Center, a legal entity, was approved by the State Council in June last year. Since then, it has imported 14,000 automobiles from the United States and formulated relevant marketing rules. It has also carried out bonded businesses for imports and barter trade.
