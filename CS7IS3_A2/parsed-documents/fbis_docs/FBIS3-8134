"Slovakia does not feel immediately threatened, but in the current military-political situation preserves the right and the ability to defend itself against possible military and non-military attack," the text of the doctrine reads. The Slovak Republic wishes to promote its interests by peaceful cooperation with all democratic countries, with emphasis on neighboring countries, the doctrine continues. The aim of this cooperation is to form a European security system without military confrontation. The doctrine also confirms the interest of Slovakia in entering NATO and the Western European Union, and claims the right to share in the activities of the UN as a guarantee of peace and security. The document contains an undertaking to strictly conform to the limits established by international agreements concerning the number of soldiers and the main types of weapons, and to aim at reduction in these respects. The proposal also allows for the civil control of military power by parliament.
