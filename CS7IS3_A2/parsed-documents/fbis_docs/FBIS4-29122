FBIS4-29122 "dreas115aa_94002" FBIS-EAS-94-115 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS U.S. `Ready' To Submit Sanctions Resolution U.S. `Ready' To Submit Sanctions Resolution OW1506103894 Tokyo KYODO in English 0254 GMT 15 Jun 94 OW1506103894 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] New York, June 14 KYODO -- The United States on Tuesday [14 June] appeared ready to submit a graduated sanctions resolution to the UN Security Council over North Korea's continued rejection of demands for inspections of its nuclear facilities, UN diplomatic sources said. The sources said the initial phase of sanctions will include a freeze of UN Development aid for North Korea's free economic and trade zone project in the Tumen river basin along with a halt on economic, scientific and cultural assistance. If North Korea continues to refuse to cooperate with the inspections required under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), a second phase of sanctions would be imposed. These would include an embargo on military exports to Pyongyang, a freeze on North Korean foreign assets, and a ban on the flow of hard currency into North Korea from overseas, the sources said. A third phase of sanctions would include a comprehensive trade embargo and travel ban on North Korea, the sources suggested. Meanwhile, South Korea's YONHAP NEWS AGENCY reported North Korea's envoy to the United Nations Pak Kil-yon has warned that North Korea will leave the NPT if sanctions are imposed on Pyongyang. North Korea threatened to pull out of the NPT in March 1993 over demands that it grant inspectors access to two undeclared nuclear sites. It later suspended its withdrawal decision after high-level walks with the U.S. Pak met with representatives of the 10 nonpermanent members of the Security Council on Tuesday and informed them that North Korea has formally notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) of its decision to withdraw from the monitoring agency. Pak also acknowledged that two IAEA inspectors are still in North Korea. The U.S. State Department on Tuesday confirmed that it has received North Korea's notification that it was pulling out of the agency. YONHAP, quoting Pak, reported Pyongyang will not allow any further IAEA inspections since it has withdrawn from the agency, although the nuclear checks are still required under the NPT. Pak said a resolution to the nuclear stalemate depends on the U.S., insisting that Washington should change its attitude and return to negotiations, according to YONHAP. UN Spokesman Joe Sills said North Korea is still subject to inspection provisions of the NPT despite its withdrawal from the IAEA. According to Sills, North Korea is the third nation to have left the IAEA, following Honduras and Nicaragua. Nicaragua later rejoined the IAEA. There are 164 signatory nations to the NPT, and 121 members in the IAEA, Sills said. U.S. Government officials said the two IAEA inspectors in North Korea were continuing with their activities of monitoring and adjusting IAEA observation equipment at North Korean nuclear facilities. The officials said that it is essential that the inspectors carry out their activities beyond just being in North Korea. They reiterated their concern that the situation could become worse if the inspectors are asked to leave.
