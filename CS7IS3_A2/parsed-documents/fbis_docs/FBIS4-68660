Attendees heard Sergey Yegorov's summary report of ARB activity during the years 1991-1993. Assessing the situation that developed in Russia, the president of the ARB emphasized the "untwisting and self-producing spiral of nonpayments," the "absence of any kind of price regulation," the "excessive level of interest rates," and also the anti-investment climate in Russia. It is his conviction that all of this could have a negative effect on the interests of those sitting in the audience. His report formulated the ARB positions on these problems and the possible ways to resolve them. According to Mr. Yegorov's words, in particular, "the absence of any kind of price regulation threatens to lead to total noncompetitiveness on foreign markets of even commodities of our traditional raw materials export in the near future." Speaking about the activity of the ARB council, Sergey Yegorov noted that, as a result of the association's lobbying of the legislative organs, the commercial banks have already won hundreds of billions of rubles, which more than pays for the support of the ARB organization. The speech of the president also contained a proposal for Viktor Gerashchenko to familiarize the ARB with normative documents before they go into effect, a disagreement with the position of the Central Bank on increasing the limit of the minimum capital authorization, hopes for the development of sound banking legislation, and the creation of a National Bank Board, which would be joined by all organs of economic authority, plus ARB representatives. According to Mr. Yegorov, 5,000 crimes were committed in the financial sphere last year and 20 bankers were killed. The ARB is continuing to work on Security problems in the banking business, both in authoritative structures and among members of the association, which today has on the order of 800 banks. Speaking at the bankers' forum, Oleg Soskovets proposed a number of measures for using the banking system in conducting the industrial policy of the government. In particular, one of his proposals consisted of directing 50 percent of the profit of banks from short-term speculative operations to financing the reconstruction of industry at a favorable rate. There was scanty applause when the deputy prime minister departed. In the second half of the day, Viktor Gerashchenko gave his speech, during which he criticized Presidential Edict No. 1662, which talks about total voucherization with financial vouchers. However, Viktor Gerashchenko was less critical of the president's letter of 12 April, which gives recommendations on procedures for the bankruptcy of enterprises. This letter, in his words, makes it necessary to rethink the relations of the Central Bank with economic agents. Mr. Gerashchenko ended his speech with an answer to the likely criticism of excessively following the recommendations of the IMF. "This policy is being conducted by the government and approved by the State Duma, we cannot conduct any other. But if you do not like it, your voice must be louder," he said in addressing the delegates of the ARB congress.
