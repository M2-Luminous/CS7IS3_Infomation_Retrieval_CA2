The ministry said that as of April 14, work credentials of American journalists are revoked and they are forbidden from entering the territory of the self-styled Bosnian Serb republic. It also said that press credentials and visas of all foreign journalists issued by the UN peacekeeping forces are no longer valid. The move followed NATO air strikes against Serb positions around the UN-designated "safe area" of Gorazde on April 10 and 11. The Serbs accused the United States of siding with the Muslims and being directly involved in the Bosnian civil war, and regarded it as an "aggressor." For a long time, Bosnian Serb authorities have been dissatisfied with the "distorted and anti-Serb reports" filed by U.S journalists. On Tuesday, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia revoked press credentials for the AFP News Agency and the CNN TV Network and denied a WASHINGTON POST reporter's visa to enter Serbia.
