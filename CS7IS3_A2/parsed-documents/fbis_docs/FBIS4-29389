Go ahead." Thus began Assistant to the President Rubin. It was a late February meeting of the United States National Economic Council (NEC). United States Trade Representative (USTR) Kantor led off the discussion, emphasizing that bringing back Super Article 301 of the Omnibus U.S. Trade Law (for designating and applying sanctions against unfair trading countries and activities) was indispensable for pressing Japan for further market opening. Taking the opposite position was Chairman Tyson of the President's Council of Economic Advisers (CEA). She explained that bringing back the article would only invite a backlash from other countries and argued that its effect would be slight. Following the animated discussion, President Clinton settled the issue. "Okay, I understand what you're saying. We'll bring back Super 301 after making it a little more flexible." This is the NEC, which is now involved in nearly all important U.S. economic policies. The circumstances of the NEC's "bringing back Super 301 after four years" were obtained from the testimony of a number of individuals related to the U.S. Government. Under the President, the council consists of approximately 20 individuals centering around Rubin and Deputy Assistant Cutter (NEC deputy chief). The council usually meets in the small, windowless Roosevelt Room in the White House's West Wing. The NEC consists of nearly the same members as the cabinet. The difference is that the council is composed of deputy chiefs from subordinate agencies. These subordinate agencies flesh out the strategic details. On the whole, the NEC has become a powerful policy management squad. How much power does the NEC have in this administration? At a meeting of NEC deputy chiefs in mid-March, Deputy Assistant Stanley Roth, who had just transferred from the Department of Defense to the National Security Council (NSC)/NEC, questioned USTR Kantor: "I'd like you to think about how China and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) view Japan-U.S. confrontation. If relations between Japan and the United States become strained due to trade problems, it will only give China and others an opening. It wouldn't be in the U.S. interest at all." Following the rupture in February in the bilateral summit, not one person raised the "standard of revolt" against the USTR's taking a hard line against Japan. But when Cutter and Deputy Assistant Berger (NSC deputy chief) aligned themselves with Roth's statement, the entire government made a great shift to a soft line against Japan. U.S. Business Planning Board The NEC had originally been a proposal of Republican Senator William Roth, who knows Japan well, during the preceding Bush administration. The aim was "to bring together everything from macroeconomics to trade and technology policy to make economic policy consistent." In other words, the NEC was to be "the U.S. version of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]." President Clinton, although a Democrat, quickly latched onto the concept. Soon after assuming office, he set about establishing the NEC. In late April, President Clinton gave a handwritten letter to Secretary of State Christopher for him to deliver on his trip to Saudi Arabia. The letter pressured King Fahd to place his order with the U.S. company AT&T for the 4 billion dollar telecommunications upgrade the country was planning. The NEC is said to have been deeply involved in this letter, too. The NEC is seen as participating in nearly all large-scale business negotiations, including Motorola's deal for a switching system for mobile telephones in Beijing and orders for Boeing aircraft. The accompanying contracts for U.S. corporations is thought to total some 10 billion dollars (1.1 trillion yen). For government and industry to join together to sell, there naturally has to be a judgment that "comprehensive security" includes not only economics but diplomacy as well. Consequently, the NEC's equivalent in Japan would be not MITI but an organization bringing together the functions of the foreign, finance, and trade ministries. The proper description of the NEC would be the "Business Planning Board of the United States, Inc." Perhaps for that reason, the word making the rounds in Washington is not NEC but "Super NEC." Trade Order Crisis The urgent topic of U.S. economic revival is without a doubt in the background to the Clinton administration's drastic changes. However, criticism has begun. As Brookings Institute Senior Researcher Bosworth puts it, "Government intervention in private enterprise is seen as excessive no matter what." The criticism results from the clear contradiction between the current administration's line and the past U.S. position that consistently attacked Japanese and European "joint public-private practices," including subsidies and industrial policy. In addition, business negotiations tied to diplomacy are dogged with opaqueness. It would be easy for Japan, in order to confront a United States that has established a powerful and centralized organization to increase exports and resolve trade friction, to create the same type of system. With an eye on the goal of protecting the world trade order, however, following the U.S. lead here is not what is required of Japan. Should not Japan promote market opening and play the role of advising the United States?
