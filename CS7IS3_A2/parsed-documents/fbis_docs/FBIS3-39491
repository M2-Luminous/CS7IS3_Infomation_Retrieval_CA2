Especially because the privatizations make it possible, he thinks, to mobilize the means of combating unemployment, which demonstrates the coherence between the government's financial policy and social policy. In this interview to LES ECHOS, he states that the privatizations are not inconsistent with the incentives to consumption recently decided by the government: There is, the economy minister explains, a reserve of liquid savings accumulated in the short-term SICAV [open-end investment companies], which can either be invested in the long term, especially in shares in privatized companies, or be directed toward consumption. At all events, the minister thinks that there is no reason at present to change his diagnosis of growth for 1994, in view of a series of reports showing that the climate is changing. Finally, he explained his thinking on the two plans which the economy ministry is due to implement in the spring: the reform of the Deposit and Consignment Bank, the unity of which he wishes to maintain, and the creation of pension funds. [LES ECHOS] The government has recently reported favorable economic indicators. They still seem firm. Do you still think that growth will reach, or even exceed, 1.4 percent this year? [Alphandery] We have no reason to change our diagnosis for 1994. In addition, 1.4 percent or even 1.5 percent growth is not a high figure. I understand that, in the present climate, in which we are experiencing high unemployment, the signs of recovery give rise to a degree of skepticism. The same thing has been seen in the United States: The transition involves ups and downs. However, since the beginning of the year, we have seen a series of reports which all go in the same direction. The climate is changing. In the enterprises, the prospects are improving, and this is clear in the sector of intermediate goods. Salaried work fell less in the second quarter, the drop was limited to 0.5 percent. With regard to household demand, consumption is still irregular, which justifies the measures taken to help the automobile industry. With regard to housing, demand is finally recovering. [LES ECHOS] However, is there not a risk of seeing Germany, our main client, emerging more slowly from the recession than expected? [Alphandery] Three things can be observed abroad. In the United States, the small increase in the minimum lending rate was decided for internal purposes and only demonstrates one thing: The economy is working well and the only risk is that of overheating. In Japan, the new plan for recovery through lowering taxes is fairly important and should produce results. The recovery in Britain is being confirmed. In all, the international environment will be more buoyant in 1994. The development in Germany is less predictable, although many signs suggest that the climate is improving. However, our scenario is cautious because we predict growth of only 0.5 percent for western Germany this year. [LES ECHOS] But is it not just exports which will lead French growth in 1994? [Alphandery] The foreign order books are doing better and better. There is no doubt that, in our 1994 forecasts, exports are at the heart of the recovery. But the second buoyant element is investment by enterprises. Investments fell so much in 1993 that their stabilization at the present level in 1994 will contribute to speeding up growth. [LES ECHOS] Will the fall in investment over the past three years not mean that French industry will be lagging behind? [Alphandery] This is a possibility which cannot be ruled out. We have lost a good deal of ground. This reflects the unsuitability of the economic policies pursued since the early eighties. If the level of unemployment in France is so high, it is because, structurally, our level of investment and our level of savings are too low. Our production sector is not strong enough given the growing burdens it bears. [LES ECHOS] Is there not a contradiction between the inadequate savings which you deplore and the measures to revive consumption which the government has just taken? [Alphandery] We need long-term savings to fund the investment necessary for a lasting economic development, as we need the situation to be supported by consumption. These two requirements are not inconsistent. Thus, the government, by various measures, is seeking the reduction of the treasury SICAV (around 600 billion francs [Fr] held by households). These savings, which only partly deserve that name, can be transformed very largely into long-term savings (PEA [shareholding savings plan], life insurance, property...) and into greater consumption. I am already observing appreciable results because the withdrawals of investments at the end of the year were large and effectively benefited shares and bonds, and helped support the consumption of households. [LES ECHOS] How do you think short-term rates will develop in the coming months? [Alphandery] For 10 months we have observed an overall reduction in the interest rate curve which was particularly large with regard to short-term rates. With regard to the future, I think that they could be below the long-term rates in 1994. [LES ECHOS] Assuming there is no exchange constraint, would it not be possible to speed up the reduction in short-term interest rates? [Alphandery] If you look at what is happening in the European countries which are reputed to have freed themselves from any exchange constraints, you note that the long-term interest rates in those countries are higher than in France. On the other hand, a degree of stability in the currency seems more capable of guaranteeing a low level of interest rates, as the Netherlands shows, for instance. Hence the importance of pursuing a stable franc policy. [LES ECHOS] Now that we are experiencing a period of calm for European currencies, would it not be possible to imagine a concerted cut in interest rates which all the European countries need? [Alphandery] In this connection, I would like to stress that economic and financial cooperation exists. France and Germany, by jointly presenting coherent convergence programs, made it possible to draw up medium-term policies. With regard to interest rates, I note that the European countries have experienced a marked reduction in the level of these rates for a year, both in short and medium-term rates. With regard to the future, I think that the return to a normal scale of interest rates will also take place in the rest of Europe. It is partly thanks to this fall in interest rates that the economic climate in France is changing. This fall has, in particular, boosted the Stock Exchange and is making the successful completion of privatization easier. [LES ECHOS] In this connection, are you satisfied with the privatization of Elf? [Alphandery] It is a great popular success. Some 3.1 million French people subscribed to it. The total which they requested (Fr38 billion) is considerable: It is the biggest demand ever recorded from individuals during a privatization in France. The privatizations are now well rooted in country. They have received a plebiscite from the French people. With this operation alone, we will have colleced Fr76 billion in less than six months: Fr43 billion in 1993 and Fr33 billion with the Elf privatization alone. This year, we should collect at least the Fr55 billion expected. [LES ECHOS] How was this revenue allocated in 1993? [Alphandery] The distribution was set out by the finance bill last spring: Fr18.7 billion were allocated to employment measures. Fr8 billion to support for economic activity (BTP [Public Buildings and Works sector], urban policy) and Fr16 billion to capital donations for public enterprises. It is clear that there is consistency between the government financial policy and social policy. The privatizations make it possible to mobilize resources for combating unemployment, for social progress, and for employment. In 1994, we are following the same policy. [LES ECHOS] Raymond Barre criticized you for not following an orthodox policy because the money from privatizations should serve to clear the state's debts. [Alphandery] That would be my dearest wish, because Raymond Barre is right. But necessity dictates: We inherited the worst recession since the war. To extricate ourselves from it, we had to make good the public and social deficits: We therefore took resources where they are to be found. We do not have any choice. At all events, I note that the privatizations are a remarkable success in terms of popular shareholding and also with employees of the privatized enterprises. In addition, we have drawn up a privatization technique which is proven: The Privatization Commission gained a reputation for unswerving independence and responsibility in the first operations. I would like to pay tribute to it. [LES ECHOS] In view of the prime minister's growing promises in recent weeks, are you not afraid of a loss of budget control which would make it impossible for France to meet the Maastricht criteria? [Alphandery] Let us not make any mistake about scale. The emergency aid granted to the fishermen amounts to Fr300 million, spending to improve safety in schools amounts to Fr500 million per year over five years. Of course, these are large sums for those who will benefit from them, but, compared with the total budget deficit, this is insignificant. Moreover, there is nothing abnormal about this, because every year unexpected spending has to be included in the budget. The essential thing is to counterbalance this unexpected spending by savings. In 1993, when the government took office, it launched a large sum of new spending while reducing the budget deficit. These two things are not incompatible. The policy which we are following does not take us away from the Maastricht criteria, but brings us closer to it. I would remind you that we have already reduced the budget deficit by Fr20 billion and the Social Security deficit by Fr70 billion. This is a considerable initial effort. This ability to hold the general course of our policy while adapting was again welcomed last week by two big British weeklies known for their critical judgment. [LES ECHOS] What are your plans for the Deposit and Consignment Bank? [Alphandery] I would first like to explain that there is no question of causing an unpheaval in the existing Deposit Bank. Thus, the reform will safeguard the establishment's unity. It will maintain the existing group, and will not lead to a breakup or dismantling of it. It will maintain the status of the staff and the staffing levels. The aim of the reform is to modernize the Bank and to submit its competitive activities to rules equivalent to those of its competitors. For instance, the 1816 statute makes provision for the Bank's director general to be indefinitely fixed in his post, which the governor of the Bank of France is not. Another example: The Bank is not subject to the same controls as other public enterprises and must clarify its relations with the state. One way of doing this is giving some banking and financial activities to subsidiaries. A clarification of the Bank's missions and functioning is therefore necessary. [LES ECHOS] When will the plan be ready? [Alphandery] At the end of March. It should be adopted by the government to be examined by Parliament in the spring session. [LES ECHOS] Do you not think that the approach of the presidential election will hamper any intention of reform? [Alphandery] No, of course not, other issues, of varying importance, are being prepared. I would like to mention in particular the issue of pension funds. In this sphere, I think that the technical dimension is less difficult to handle than the psychological and political dimensions. Thinking is changing. However, some people still have reservations. Consultation has started to detect the concerns of the interested parties and make it possible to define a pension fund system by capitalization which the French people want, as the success of life insurance has demonstrated.
