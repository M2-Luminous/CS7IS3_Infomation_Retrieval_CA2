The agreement underscores the need to promote a culture of harmony among Guatemalans, and it establishes that one of the commission's goals will be to establish, with impartiality and equality, responsibility for human rights violations perpetrated as a result of the internal armed conflict. During a visit to Roosevelt Hospital today, President Ramiro de Leon Carpio expressed satisfaction over the signing of the agreement with the URNG, whereby the Truth Commission will be established. [Begin De Leon recording] A few hours ago, an agreement was signed; it is among the many steps that have been taken, starting with the national peace plan presented by the government. As you know, the national peace plan consists of three parts: reconciliation; the solution of the Guatemalan people's economic and social needs or, in other words, the struggle against poverty; and third, the conclusion of the internal armed conflict. Regarding the first part -- reconciliation and the establishment of a permanent forum for peace -- we agreed to form a temporary assembly of civilian representatives. This assembly will be headed by Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno. With regard to the second part, we are making great efforts to combat poverty, and when the internal armed conflict ends, we will face a new challenge -- the biggest challenge of all -- which will be the elimination of the injustices and economic and social circumstances that are hurting the Guatemalan people. Regarding the third part, I am very pleased to say that starting this year, based on the national peace plan we presented to Guatemala and the international community, we have fulfilled all of the points. In January, we signed the framework agreement, which opened this new phase of the process. In the framework agreement, both sides agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. Subsequently in March, we took a big step forward by signing the General Human Rights Agreement, from which emerged the Commission for Historic Clarification [Comision de Esclarecimiento Historico -- CEH]. This is a very significant agreement, because in the past human rights had hindered the peace process. We also signed the agreement on immediate international verification, which is another big step forward. Today is a historic day for Guatemala because, believe me, never before have we encountered such an inherently complex matter. Today's event is a significant step that truly brings us closer to peace. Before this, we signed a schedule that clearly outlines each phase -- phases we are fulfilling. The international community is pleased with the administration's true political resolve and also with the resolve of the Guatemalan Army, which has unquestionably played an important role in this matter, not only because it is directly involved, but also because of the issues that directly affect the institution. In this case I can say that we are adhering to the schedule and that a historic step was taken today in Oslo on the issue of displaced people, which also was a big step forward. This is perhaps the greatest and most gratifying event for us. I must tell you that the agreement under which the Commission for Historic Clarification will be established has certain characteristics. In the first place -- and this is fundamental -- it has been established that this commission must explain possible human rights violations in detail, but its recommendations and reports will not personalize responsibility or be used to initiate legal proceedings. This is the main issue, I believe, because it is in keeping with the entire philosophy of the agreement. The document does not advocate revanchism; on the contrary, from the very outset it calls for an end to the armed conflict, thereby establishing the foundations for peaceful coexistence with respect for human rights in Guatemala. It underscores that it is necessary to promote a culture of harmony and mutual respect that will eliminate every form of revenge and retribution. This is the central philosophy of this agreement, and it is an essential condition for firm and lasting peace. The CEH was not agreed to intensify our pain or to constantly make us look over our shoulders. Anyone who constantly looks over his shoulder can easily trip and fall. The purpose of the commission is to strengthen peace and make it lasting. Meanwhile, another of the agreement's main goals is the objective of equitable and impartial clarification of human rights violations and violence that took place over a number of years during the internal armed conflict. As for the formation of the CEH, the news agencies have already informed you how we agreed to do this. The UN secretary general will be asked to appoint the current peace talks mediator as a member of the commission. A citizen of irreproachable standing, and one who is approved by both sides, will be appointed by the mediator. Finally, an academician will also be selected by the mediator, in conjunction with the two sides, from a list of three candidates proposed by university rectors. The commission will be installed and will begin to function on the day the firm and lasting peace agreement is signed. It will work for six months and can be extended for an additional six months. This deadline is deemed to be sufficient to conduct an investigation and issue a report. This means that within no more than a year following the firm and lasting overall peace agreement, the commission will present its report. I must stress that the commission will prepare its report within the established period, but, perhaps, the main issue is that we have agreed on a central philosophy that opposes revenge and retribution; on the contrary, it seeks reconciliation, forgiveness, and a new phase in Guatemala by way of a commission that will prepare a report that will prevent us from again experiencing or suffering the violence of the past. It is clear that the commission has duties that prevent the personalizing of responsibilities or taking legal action. During the course of this period we will find the mechanisms with which to make an agreement possible. [end recording]
