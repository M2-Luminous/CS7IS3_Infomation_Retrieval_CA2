FR940711-0-00042 FR940711-0-00008 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;61&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8970; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;21] Airworthiness Directives; Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes, that requires a revision to the Flap Control Unit input wiring. This amendment is prompted by reports of disconnection of the Landing Gear Module electrical connectors, which can result in the loss of the primary, secondary, and alternate control of the flaps. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent the possibility of an all-flaps-up landing due to the loss of control of all flap operations. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, P.O. Box 3707, Seattle, Washington 98124&hyph;2207. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on May 12, 1994 (59 FR 24671). That action proposed to require a revision to the Flap Control Unit (FCU) input wiring. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter, Boeing, requests that the discussion of the addressed unsafe condition that appeared in the preamble to the notice be clarified. In that preamble, the FAA stated that, if the landing gear module connectors become disconnected, all FCU modes of flap operation (primary, secondary, and alternate control of flaps) could be lost. The commenter suggests that the discussion would have been more precise if it had contained information to indicate that the landing gear module includes the ALTN ARM FLAPS switch and the ALTN FLAPS position selector used to control the leading and trailing edge flaps in the alternate mode. The FAA acknowledges this information. This same commenter requests that the proposal be revised to cite the latest revision of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346 as the source for modification procedures. The FAA concurs. Since issuance of the notice, the FAA has reviewed and approved Revision 1 of Boeing Service Bulletin 747&hyph;27A2346, dated May 19, 1994. This revision contains a correction to a type of wire that had been called out in the original version of the service bulletin; this correction ensures that the wire and its associated solder sleeve are metalurgically compatible. In order to ensure that the correct wiring modification assembly is installed on the affected airplanes, the FAA has determined that the revised service bulletin should be cited as the appropriate source of service information for complying with the requirements of this rule. The final rule has been revised accordingly. The FAA has confirmed that no U.S. operators have yet modified any affected airplane in accordance with the original service bulletin; therefore, by citing the revised service bulletin, the final rule will impose no additional economic burden on any U.S. operator. One commenter requests that the compliance time be extended from the proposed 30 days to 90 days, due to a possible parts availability problem. This commenter states that it does not normally stock the required parts and materials to accomplish the proposed requirements of the rule. This commenter has ordered these parts from a supplier and is currently waiting to obtain them. Additionally, this commenter points out that the manufacturer's service bulletin, referenced in the proposal, recommends 60 days for modification. The FAA does not concur with the commenter's request. In developing an appropriate compliance time for this action, the FAA considered not only the degree of urgency associated with addressing the subject unsafe condition, but the manufacturer's recommendation as to an appropriate compliance time, the availability of required parts, and the practical aspect of installing the required modification within a maximum interval of time allowable for all affected airplanes to continue to operate without compromising safety. The FAA points out that the parts required for the wiring modification are readily available; therefore, obtaining them within the proposed compliance time should not pose a problem for any affected operator. Further, the FAA took into account the 60-day compliance time recommended by the manufacturer, as well as the number of days required for the rulemaking process; in consideration of these factors, the FAA finds that 30 days after the effective date of this final rule will fall approximately at the same time for compliance as recommended by the manufacturer. However, under the provisions of paragraph (b) of the final rule, the FAA may approve requests for adjustments to the compliance time if data are submitted to substantiate that such an adjustment would provide an acceptable level of safety. After careful review of the available data, including the comments noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule with the change previously described. The FAA has determined that this change will neither increase the economic burden on any operator nor increase the scope of the AD. There are approximately 300 Model 747&hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 34 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 10 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $200 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $25,500, or $750 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.
