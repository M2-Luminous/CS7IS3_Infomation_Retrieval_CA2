The Duma decided that criminal charges could not be dropped against those who in early October 1993 committed criminal offenses which were not part of what is known as the "Moscow developments" and had not yet turned sixty. The Duma decided that everyone who had committed economic offenses before 31 December 1991, marking the formal breakup of the Soviet Union, were to be pardoned. Also, criminal charges were to be dropped against those who resorted to fraud to appropriate state or public funds and against those who appropriated especially large sums. The Duma instructed courts of justice to see to it that this last decision is carried out.
