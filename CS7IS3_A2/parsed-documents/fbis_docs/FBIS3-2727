K.C. Li, a department chief with the Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), said Taiwan's index of leading economic indicators, which measures economic prospects three months ahead, rose a mere 1.6 percent in February, lower than America's 3.8 percent, Japan's 4.6 percent, Germany's 6.4 percent, Britain's 9.2 percent and France's 2.8 percent. The leading indices of the 12-member European Union [words indistinct] Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development surged 6.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively in February, Li reported. "All these figures show that the Taiwan economy is not recovering as fast as industrialized countries," Li noted. He said one major reason behind Taiwan's slow recovery is that local enterprises still hesitate to make new investments. Li pointed out that although a government economic forecast released earlier this year optimistically predicted that private investment would grow 13 percent in 1994, machinery imports declined 0.9 percent in the January-February period as compared with the year-earlier level. Machinery imports are used to gauge a country's investment activity. Li said relatively high interest rates have undermined investment willingness here. Taiwan's prime lending rate now stands at 7.75 percent, 2 to 3 percent higher than that in many other countries. Difficulties in land acquisition have also discouraged investment, Li said. According to a recent CEPD survey, 758 private companies have been forced to shelve their investment plans since last August because of difficulties in acquiring needed factory land. As part of its effort to encourage private investment, Li said, the government has decided to release at least 2,382 hectares of industrial land in the near future for local manufacturers to house their new plants. Li added he remains cautiously optimistic about Taiwan's economic prospects for the year. Global trade is expected to grow 5.4 percent this year, higher than 1993's 2.6 percent growth. "This is good news for Taiwan's export-oriented economy," Li observed. He further said the New Taiwan [NT] dollar depreciated by an average of 6.36 percent against the US dollar, the Japanese yen and the Deutsche mark in the past few months. The NT dollar is expected to remain weak in the months ahead and this will help boost Taiwan's export competitiveness, he added.
