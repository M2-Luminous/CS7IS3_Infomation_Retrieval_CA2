Income from party dues fell short of expectations by about the same amount, namely 4.770 million leva. According to [BSP leader] Zhan Videnov, the reasons for this were poor financial control and failures to submit proper accounts. The BSP chairman thinks the party must also seek ways to increase its income from economic activities. The BSP had a balance of 2.039 million leva at the end of 1993. Its assets were valued at 25.972 million leva, after deducting the value of some of the party's buildings, its shareholdings in state companies, the BSP library stock, and other assets sequestered under the Party Property Confiscation Act. However, the balance sheet continues to record business inventory items and movable property that have not yet been confiscated or have been seized without any authorizing documents. No accounts and balance sheets were submitted by the regional BSP councils in Blagoevgrad, Veliko Turnovo, Vratsa, Lovech, Kyustendil, and Turgovishte, and by certain oblast BSP councils. In conformance with the law, the BSP will submit its accounts for 1993 to the Parliamentary Commission on Party Property.
