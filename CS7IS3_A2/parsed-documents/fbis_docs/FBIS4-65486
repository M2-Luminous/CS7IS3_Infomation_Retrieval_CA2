"I confirmed to Delors that the fundamental lines of our country's European policy will not change," Martino told the press after his 25-minute meeting with the executive Commission chief. During their meeting, Martino explained the current political situation to Delors, saying that last March's general election "did not represent a victory for the right so much as a victory for an alternating system in which there is a governing majority and a minority which keeps checks on what it does, while preparing to take its place." Answering journalists' questions about a recent statement in which Belgian Deputy Premier Elio Di Rupo criticised the presence of "neo-fascist ministers" in the Italian government, Martino said "I share Di Rupo's opinion: I would never have entered a government with neofascists either. But in this government there are no neofascist ministers. There are five from National Alliance, which is different from the Italian Social Movement, which in its turn was not the Fascist Party." National Alliance was born last year out of the Italian Social Movement, but two out of the five National Alliance ministers joined the new party without ever belonging to the old one. Top-ranking sources at the Commission confirmed that "the foreign minister came to reassure us and dealt with the issue of National Alliance ministers in government. Martino stressed that the "basic lines of foreign policy will not change." According to Martino, a victory for the left in last March's elections would have meant a return to the old power-sharing system of government "similar to the one which recent electoral changes were designed to eliminate." Martino met Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Mahmud Musa yesterday evening for talks on the Mideast situation, and is expected to hold bilateral talks with foreign ministers Klaus Kinkel of Germany, Alain Juppe of France and Douglas Hurd of Britain during his stay in Brussels for the regular monthly meeting of EU [European Union] diplomatic chiefs. The new Italian foreign minister has been dubbed a "Euro-skeptic" by the British press which cites his friendship with former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and his membership of her mainly anti-EU Bruges Group. Martino also focused his attention on economic matters during his official debut in Brussels, saying that the new government would now have to study carefully the decision of its predecessor to place reservations on its approval of the 1995 EU budget. "It is a problem that we have inherited... We have revised our national accounts and gross national product system, something which other countries have not yet done," said Martino. "We are going to end up paying more. We are currently trying to overhaul our finances, which means holding down public spending and therefore stopping it from increasing." Italy recently became a net contributor to the EU, paying more to Brussels than it receives from it. The refusal to approve the 1995 budget gave Italy a lever in difficult negotiations over milk quotas. On the topic of the EU loan to Italy, the third two billion ECU tranche of which can now be released if Italy meets certain economic goals, was also dealt with by Martino who said "it is going to be up to the government and to the treasury minister in particular to decide" whether to ask for the money. "I have always seen this loan as being rather like a letter of intents from the International Monetary Fund which, as everybody knows, is not drawn up and imposed by the IMF but drawn up and requested by governments so that they are obliged to do things that they would have had to do anyway," said the foreign minister.
