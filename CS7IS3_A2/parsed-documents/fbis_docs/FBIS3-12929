[Musa] You are welcome. [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, intensive contacts and consultations are being held under Egyptian sponsorship, with the participation of the parties concerned, in order to resume the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Are there positive signs following the meeting between Egyptian President Husni Mubarak and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat? [Musa] The objective is not only to resume negotiations. The objective is to tackle the problems that resulted from the crime committed in the Ibrahimi Mosque. This crime, committed by the murderer Barukh Goldstein, cannot go unnoticed. There must be measures to prevent similar crimes and ban the aggressions carried out by settlers, extremists, and terrorists against the Palestinians. This is an important and major issue. It is inconceivable that matters should proceed normally in the wake of this crime without securing protection for the Palestinians and without ensuring Palestinian security. This is an important and basic issue. Negotiations can proceed normally when agreement is reached in this regard and when such measures are taken. [Menashe] Your Excellency the Minister, apart from the existing problem between the PLO and Israel, is the atmosphere surrounding other Arab parties to the negotiations opportune to resume talks? [Musa] The crime committed in Hebron by the terrorist settler and murderer Goldstein has enraged all Arabs and the whole world. Thus, the atmosphere is now replete with wrath regarding this crime while we await the measures that will be taken to protect the Palestinians in the occupied territories from people similar to this terrorist murderer. [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, the Israeli leadership, with all its party affiliations, denounced the criminal act that occurred in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque. Despite much sorrow and grief, the peace process should continue. Naturally, Egypt, which is a pioneer in this regard, will redouble its efforts to resume these negotiations. What role is Egypt currently playing to promote the peace process? [Musa] The Israeli Government has indeed condemned this incident. What is important is not only to condemn or show resentment, but also to take measures that will prevent similar incidents. In other words, the settlers who carry arms should be prevented from entering the Arab territories. It is now very clear that the settlements are a serious issue and cannot go unnoticed, and that people should not be left free to kill the Palestinian Arabs in the manner of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. Measures should be taken. Naturally, we in Egypt are convinced that peace can only be achieved through negotiations. The peace process began, and negotiations were about to achieve their objectives. We believe that negotiations are a positive process. However, measures should be taken on the ground to protect the Palestinian people. Do not forget that the Palestinians are living in territories that are occupied and that are not Israeli territories. Consequently, the settlers residing in the settlements should be encircled somehow in order to protect the Palestinians. This is because there is not just the issue of Israeli security but also the issue of Palestinian security on equal footing. This issue is now clear to the masses, to public opinion, and to all of us. It has also now clear that it is the Palestinian's security, and not only the Israeli's security, that is threatened. We want a just and balanced solution. We do not want any trivial thing meant only to say that we signed and negotiated. Hence, in order for negotiations to resume, which is important to us all, measures should be taken on the ground to protect the Palestinian people. [Menashe] Mr. Minister, can we have a hint as to what took place yesterday in the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat, President Mubarak, and your excellency? Strictly speaking, are we proceeding toward the aspired objective despite the obstacles? [Musa] I cannot give you a specific answer because the measures that are being taken in the occupied territories to protect the Palestinian people are a major issue. Everything depends on this issue. [Mu'addi] Your Excellency the Minister, can we expect Foreign Minister Peres' arrival in Cairo to meet with Yasir 'Arafat, or will contacts be held to hold a meeting between His Excellency President 'Arafat and Prime Minister Rabin? [Musa] Nothing has been decided yet on either meeting. [Mu'addi] Your Excellency Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa, thank you very much. [Musa] Thank you.
