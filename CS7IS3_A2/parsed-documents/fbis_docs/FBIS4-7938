"As countries of medium size we should play a bigger role in Europe. Poland and Finland want to find themselves in European organisations which have shown themselves to be effective. Finland has already succeeded, Poland still faces a long road," Walesa said. The talks also covered security. "The stationing of such a numerous (Russian) army in the Kaliningrad region is a worrying phenomenon. It is difficult to explain this phenomenon in peacetime. After speaking to many international politicians I have found that this problem is not enough known to world opinion," Walesa added. He also drew attention to the insufficient aid given by the West to facilitate the changes taking place in east and central Europe. Walesa stressed that these countries needed to be included in the world market economy, something which could not be done while thinking in old categories. Europe needed a new vision. If this did not take place then the lack of political and economic security in the region would adversely affect the rest of Europe. Haavisto gave assurances that Finland would support Poland's efforts to join the European Union.
