FR940602-1-00084 FR940602-1-00013 Appendix III to Part 1918_Container Top Safety (Non-mandatory) Note: This Appendix is non-mandatory and provides guidance to part 1918 to assist employers and employees in complying with the requirements of this standard, as well as to provide other helpful information. Nothing in this Appendix adds or detracts from any of the requirements of this standard. Due to the almost limitless physical possibilities dictated by such factors as vessel design; container type; container stowage; types of container hoisting gear, etc., there may be instances during vessel loading/discharge operations when it is not feasible to utilize container top fall protection devices. As a result, a case by case and event by event approach must be utilized in assessing the feasibility of providing such devices. The following are examples of situations where fall protection may not be feasible: •When hooking up to or disconnecting from an overheight container using ``special'' gear, where attaching fall protection to the cranes spreader bar is not allowed by the owner of the crane (for example a Port Authority). •When handling containers, ``in a chimney stow'' on a break bulk vessel, with ships gear, when a personnel basket is not sufficient to be used as an anchorage point.
