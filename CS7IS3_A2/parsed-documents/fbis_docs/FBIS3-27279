The ANC, which is expected to win the first multiracial election in South Africa, has close ties with Mainland China. There have been indications that once the ANC heads the government, South Africa will switch its diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Peking. According to visiting South African Justice Deputy Minister Shelia Camerer, the National Party would like to maintain close trade links with Taiwan. Since the government will be a government of national unity -- a coalition government -- Camerer said, the National Party, headed by the president after De Klerk, will still be a part of the government. She said the National Party will work hard to maintain South Africa's ties with the ROC [Republic of China], a position which the party will not give up easily. South Africa is the only major country that has maintained diplomatic ties with the ROC.
