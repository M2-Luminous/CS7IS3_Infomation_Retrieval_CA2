[Heinrich] I was not classified so easily in political terms. I did not belong to the Khasbulatov faction, but I know quite a lot about the inner logic of this power struggle. [Pirker] Is the struggle about Russia a personal power struggle or even a gang war? [Heinrich] The personal dimension certainly played a big role. However, it was not the hostility toward Yeltsin, which essentially characterized Khasbulatov's action, but that toward Filatov, who moved from the Supreme Soviet Presidium to the presidential structures and was thus considered to be a traitor. First of all, of course, it was an institutional conflict, with both sides being blamed for the escalation of events. Thus, the president never really managed to empathize with the the parliamentarians, who, for the first time since the Soviet era, had real power. Originally they were on the president's side and advocated reform policy. At the same time, the Supreme Soviet whose deputies were responsible to their constituencies, felt the mood at the grassroots more strongly than was the case at the administrative level. The institutional division of the country become visible for the first time in spring 1992; both sides used populist tactics. However, at that time it would still have been possible to come to an agreement since the monetaristic line of the West was not generally rejected by the Supreme Soviet. Even after 21 September 1993 compromises would still have been possible. One should not ignore the fact that this was also a conflict between political factions, and, naturally, this also has an economic dimension. The Supreme Soviet Presidium is an economic power. I got to know the functioning of the Khasbulatov faction to a certain extent -- dollars, that is dollars earned from Western relief supplies -- played a not insignificant role. What happened in the President's surroundings in this respect is largely known anyway. [Pirker] Is it thus primarily the law of redistribution that determines various people's actions? [Heinrich] It is redistribution without rules. The president's circle has now laid its hands on the building of the Parliamentary Center and has largely rented it to foreign companies. And this has been accomplished under guise of democratic president versus communist parliament. All that is not true. [Pirker] But it was presented in this way in the Western media. Even though they knew better? [Heinrich] I would not say that lies were spread deliberately. There is rather a lack of readiness or ability to assess the events in a differentiated manner. However, there were also foreign correspondents, who wallowed in Moscow's political morass and produced "facts" that corresponded to their ambitions. [Pirker] In addition to the profane aim of enriching its participants, does the Moscow power struggle not also reflect a basic conflict over the direction of the reforms' development? [Heinrich] As I said before: The Supreme Soviet felt the pressure from below against the effects of the reform more strongly. However, it would be wrong to think that Supreme Soviet advocated an antireform line. Even regarding the shock therapy there was no clear line dividing the political factions. People with an antireform image often advocated rather more monetaristic positions then the monetaristic establishment, which helped itself very generously to the state budget -- partly out of restraint to prevent a social explosion, partly to keep the lobbies in a good mood. Thus, the energy lobby, which produces two-thirds of foreign currency revenues, was treated very accommodatingly by Gaydar. Of course, the Supreme Soviet also participated in this policy of excess spending; regions were subsidized to gain political support. The ties between the local nomenklatura and the nomenklatura in companies in the struggle for subsidies has essentially characterized the lobby structure. [Pirker] After the bloody massacre in October, which was supposed to put an end to the power crisis, forces have been regrouped, leading to the conclusion that the winners have not really won? [Heinrich] I agree with that. The radical democrats' strategy to get rid of the opposition has failed. The opposition is now stronger than ever. This is, above all, also expressed in Russian foreign policy, which has now become less ingratiating, at least in its rhetoric, toward the West than prior to October. [Pirker] Does that not mean that the real winner was the army, which now wants to implement its big power ideas? [Heinrich] It is within the General Staff, and not the army as a whole, where the phenomenon of dissolution is becoming rather more intensive. The gap between the army leadership -- which behaves like a privatized company -- on the one hand, and the middle and lower echelons on the other has become even larger. There is an extremely hateful mood; spying on one another within the officer cadre has become some sort of struggle for survival. [Pirker] What are the scenarios for further developments? [Heinrich] One word more on the failure of reform. The reformers -- such as Gaydar and Fedorov -- came from nothing, without any real power bass: the three large lobbies in the energy, agriculture, and large industrial sectors. One cannot pursue politics in Russia outside these structures. The need for reform naturally remains, but another kind of reform. Because the reform pursued so far has not been monetaristic, either: it was either worse than that, or nothing at all happened. The most likely development now is to plod along; the departure of the radical reformers from the government makes the situation a bit easier, because this has defused the power struggle and the Supreme Soviet, too, is in a more constructive mood than had originally been expected. As a result, the prospects for reform have increased. The changed reform strategy will probably be the following: preventing the collapse of companies and establishing financial-industrial associations, meaning that the system is to be made controllable again. For this one needs a broad-based consensus, because the problem thus far has been that none of the presented reform plans has had the necessary legitimacy. One either had to accept cutbacks or try to gain legitimacy by autocratic rule, by attacking the legislature but oppressing the regions, and so on. I hope that it has now been realized that the problems cannot be solved by force, that one has to deal with the opposition in a civilized manner. This would be the optimistic scenario. The pessimistic scenario is that the struggle between the factions will continue unabated. Closing down the enterprises would be simply disastrous. It would be closing down without a structural policy. Structural policy would mean a gradual transition to privatization, to real privatization. A countertrend is exerted, above all, by the mafia, which feeds on the monopolistic structures because it aims at winning the monopoly and not at winning over competition. The end result would be a total crash. However, I believe that things can also be done differently.
