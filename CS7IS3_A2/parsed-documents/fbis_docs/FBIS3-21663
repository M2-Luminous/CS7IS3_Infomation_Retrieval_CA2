He said that the DEA informed him of the impending arrest just two or three days before the arrest. The first arrests were made in Eugene, Oregon. Then, Maj. Gen. Thanat was arrested in Hong Kong. The two arrests were connected to each other. American officials have confirmed that they have evidence. DEA officials asked for our cooperation in arresting a Chinese Burmese named Mr. Lee. Thai police officials arrested him on 9 December and extradited him on 11 December. Most recently, DEA officials arrested the sixth member of this gang in Oregon. None of those arrested there were Thais. The reporter asked if the DEA had identified any Thais as being involved with this narcotics trafficking gang. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that no such information has been provided. He said that he had met with the head of the DEA in Thailand earlier in the day and that they had talked about the Associated Press report that a Thai police official was involved in this. But the DEA official told him that they have no evidence to that effect, unless the suspects implicate others. The reporter asked if this arrest will tarnish Thailand's image. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that this will have a good effect, because it will show the world that Thailand is cooperating and that we are sincere about wanting to suppress narcotics. The United States has praised Thailand for this. The reporter asked is the DEA had confirmed that no Thai police officials or soldiers were involved. Police Lt. Gen. Kowit said that none were involved. But that may not be so in other cases, because nothing has happened yet. As far as this case is concerned, Maj. Gen. Thanat has personal ties to Thais living in Oregon. It's unlikely that others were involved. He confirmed that there is strong evidence against Maj. Gen. Thanat. He was not arrested as a scapegoat as some fear. As the person responsible for overseeing the work of the Office of the Narcotics Control Board (ONCB), Mr. Amnuai Wirawan, the deputy prime minister, said that the ONCB is doing a good job. The arrest of a Thai general abroad has nothing to do with the ONCB. Mr. Amnuai said that with respect to statements by U.S. officials that senior Thai military officers, police officials, and civil servants are involved in narcotics trafficking activities, the ONCB has frequently contacted international organizations concerning suppression activities. It must be admitted that there are some senior Thai officials who are involved. But there are only a few such people. There are a few bad people in every large organization. Steps must be taken to get rid of the "rotten fish." "I don't think that this news will tarnish the image of Thai officials, because there are many good people in the Thai bureaucracy. The Thai Government has constantly helped other countries suppress narcotics. If Thailand had not made those arrests, the damage would have been much greater. The military has never tried to pull strings to help one of its men." The reporter asked if the ONCB will coordinate things with the United States and ask for the names of those senior [Thai] officials said to be involved in narcotics trafficking activities so that action can be taken against them. Mr. Amnuai said that we have always cooperated with them. Thailand has compiled a list of names, too, and some of the names appear on both lists. Some of the names do not appear in the directory of Thai officials but appear abroad. There is nothing unusual about this. Police General Prathin Santipraphop, the acting director general of the Police Department, discussed the statement made by General Chawalit Yongchaiyut, minister of interior, who said that information provided by the DEA indicates that police officers are involved in narcotics trafficking activities. Police Gen. Prathin said that the Ministry of Interior has not issued any instructions. If information is provided, the matter must be investigated. The United States has not said who is on the list. The only names that have been released are the names of those who were arrested. Lieutenant General Anuphap Songsunthon, the 2d Army Region commander, said that the news that a major general has been charged with trafficking in heroin is very disturbing. The Army is a very large organization and so there are both good people and bad people in it. But high-ranking officials should not be involved in such things. Being involved in narcotics-trafficking activities is a very serious matter. But what happened is a personal matter. This has nothing to do with the military. Second Lieutenant Phairot Suwannachawi, a National Development Party member of Parliament from Nakhon Ratchasima Province and an activist in Group 16, said that the units concerned, that is, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the ONCB, and the Police Department, must provide clear and detailed information to show if there are real grounds for charging a general with being involved in heroin trafficking. Otherwise, when senior Thai officials travel abroad, they may not be treated with respect. He said that he once traveled abroad together with a provincial governor and they were both stripped and searched. This is a terrible matter. But this is a personal matter that does not involve the military. He said that he hopes that politicians and the mass media will think carefully before saying anything or criticizing something.
