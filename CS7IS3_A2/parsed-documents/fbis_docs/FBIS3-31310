Although Miron Cosma, leader of the Confederation of Mining Trade Unions of Romania, initially fixed a first meeting with the strikers for 1200, he arrived there from Petrosani 40 minutes earlier. Miron Cosma said that two buses loaded with representatives of the miners from pit coal processing centers will come to Targu Jiu from the Jiu Valley after 1300 to decide on further joint actions. At the same time, he warned that no alcoholic beverages should be consumed, but failed to mention the various mining tools with which some of the strikers are armed, our correspondent Titus Stoichitoiu reports.
