The reestablishment of relations with Colombia, a tour through the Caribbean, and participation in important international meetings were some of the Cuban Foreign Ministry's activities in the year that has just concluded and which characterizes the work that will be maintained in the new year. As a matter of fact, Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will soon begin a tour of the African nations. [Robaina] At the invitation of several Foreign Ministries, I will visit five African countries in early January. [Reporter] Which countries? [Robaina] I will visit Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, Ghana, and [name indistinct] [end recording] Robaina did not rule out a visit to Spain and to other European countries this year. [Robaina] We have another invitation, but I do not know if I will be able to attend in early January. I believe that at the invitation of Spain, I will visit that country and other European countries that [words indistinct]. [Reporter] Are you going to [words indistinct]? [Robaina] Well, I believe there are also possibilities for a visit there, but right now I think the invitation made by the president of our parliament is much more important. I do not think I will have time to visit other places until I complete my visits in Africa and Latin America. Besides, we need many things here, and I have not seen you for a long time because I have been abroad. I want to be here to share with you what I am doing here and abroad. [Reporter] Will you go on your Latin American tour during the first six months of 1994? [Robaina] Yes, the Foreign Ministry has much work to do in the first six months of 1994. Please keep in mind that it is not just the minister who has to work hard when there is a lot of work at the Foreign Ministry. The vice ministers are working in their respective areas. We must continue working on what we started in the Caribbean and do it with the same enthusiasm in Latin America. For many reasons with which you are familiar, we will work on Africa and Europe in the first six months. We cannot do more in that time because as you know, we have two very important events. One is the creation of the Association of Caribbean States [Asociacion de Estados Caribenos], and the other is the Latin American Summit to be held in Cartagena in June. This will give us plenty of work during the first six months of the year. A conference on immigration and the Cuban situation will also be held during the first six months of 1994 in Havana. This is a continuation of the dialogue between the Cubans of the island and those residing in other countries. Since this meeting is being questioned by some anti-Cuban organizations, we asked Robaina for his opinion. [Robaina] It surprises me how some people are talking about an invitation that was never made to them. That really surprises me. In other words, I would like to know who says those people were invited to the meeting. I hear them saying that they accept the invitation and are preparing documents. They even talk about a vague proposal by the Cuban foreign minister. They say that the true and only dialogue was the one made by (?Platform) I don't know how many years ago. Apparently the people saying these things have very little else to do. I feel that the rules of the game for the conference to be held in Cuba during the first months of next year are very clear and have not changed. They are based on absolute respect, mutual understanding, and sharing our (?project). The agenda will cover immigration and family issues, which is what concerns us. Anyone who tries to impose a political agenda on us is wasting his time. I do not think I have to answer for any document because -- honestly -- that document has nothing to do with anything I have proposed. Inasmuch as it has nothing to do with anything I have proposed, it is as if did not exist. I think there are many other things to talk about; for example, how people speak of an invitation that has never been made. [Reporter] Has [words indistinct] been invited? [Robaina] No, we have not invited Gutierrez (Menoya) or any other person in particular. We are preparing the agenda today. Once the agenda has been prepared, we must evaluate a list of participants that will be in line with many (?concepts). If anyone wants to impose such conditions on an agenda of a meeting to which he has not been invited....[pauses] When one gets (?married), plans a party, or gives a speech, one establishes an agenda. Anyone who is interested in something other than what is on that agenda is evidently at the wrong party or meeting. At this time there is no possibility that we will talk about any person in particular. I repeat: We are preparing an agenda in which we have many contacts with representatives of this Cuban community, and we know what things mutually concern us. I think that requires many things. If we want a dialogue and we have a meeting or conference of [words indistinct] so we will have something more than just a meeting, we must create an atmosphere that will allow us to identify, among Cubans, the main issues that concern us. Anyone from abroad who wants to pressure us is obviously wrong. [Reporter] Do you think the internal dissidents will be able to participate in this meeting? [Robaina] I think those who claim to be internal dissidents do not have immigration problems. In this meeting, we are going to discuss the problems with the Cubans who are abroad. They very much like being abroad, and that involves something else. With that community we are going to discuss other groups of issues that have to do with immigration and other topics related to that community, not only the portion of it that is in the United States. There is a very large community in Mexico, Venezuela, the Caribbean, [words indistinct]. There are 65 Cubans in Jordan. Can you imagine that? I believe the community in the United States is important, but the people who are in the Caribbean and Africa are most important. Most of them married students who were training in Cuba and now live abroad, but they want to maintain links with the country. We are referring to the normal communications of a country with its community abroad. We want to do this as much as possible, and that does not mean only those in the United States. If you asked me, I will tell you I have just ordered very serious and complex discussions with representatives of that Cuban community in (?Mexico) and other countries in the Caribbean. They are highly insulted because they say we give all the exceptions and possibilities to those who are in the United States and not to those in other countries. So you can very well imagine that working with the Cuban community abroad is most complex. [end recording]
