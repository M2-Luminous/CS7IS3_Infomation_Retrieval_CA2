The daily says our rational thinking can accept the explanation given by Subrata, director general of press development and graphics, who spoke on behalf of the government yesterday. In this connection, PELITA wonders what the Indonesian press should do next in the current second long-term development plan. The answer is we should take the incident as a lesson as human beings who believe in the almighty God. We should increase our sense of national responsibility as loyal citizens of this republic who respect the laws, Constitution, and democracy based on the Pancasila ideology and the 1945 Constituency. In this case, the Indonesian press, which has a positive role in maximizing and distributing the benefits of development, should be able to consolidate national unity and integrity to enhance the quality of democracy. REPUBLIKA wonders why the unwanted incident, even as Information Minister Harmoko earlier issued several warnings, should have inevitably taken place. The Indonesian press is now enjoying an atmosphere of openness praised by many people inside and outside the country.
