Is this not very little, or does it conceal a subtext? [Rugova] It is not little, because you are aware of the stance of the United States, declared by President Bush and subsequently by President Clinton and his administration, that it will not allow a conflict in Kosova or Serbian aggression in Kosova. I was personally pleased that this statement was also made on the occasion of the conference and before the Bosnia-Herzegovina contact group. As Mr. Christopher said, the problem of Kosova is, of course, the focus of conflict-prevention meansures, and it is important that it was mentioned in this situation, because I also sent a letter to the contact group recently, urging them to consider the issue of Kosova. These are, therefore, matters that should develop and should be watched, but I repeat again that it is of ultimate importance that the issue of Kosova was mentioned here too. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, I believe that your Gandhi-ism is now well understood after a 26-month-long massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina. What may the future show us? [Rugova] Indeed, there has been understanding for what I call a peaceful movement, which some others call Gandhian, others political, and so forth. It is a good thing that it has met with international understanding. Of course, this has yielded its own results. The cause of Kosova has been affirmed, as has the Albanian cause. Albania's opening and involvement in international institutions have also been very important. As for the future, in the situation in Kosova today, we can continue to not respond to provocations, because it is in the Serbian interest to start a conflict, after which we do not know what would happen. You see the case of Bosnia. The war started easily, but is difficult to stop. It is therefore very hard and unpromising for the Albanians, but the organization we have achieved and our parallel systems and institutions have enabled us to survive and to resist, of course with optimism that the issue of Kosova will be solved. However, this will be a process of talks and negotiations. I can say that I expect a better future, but we must work. In politics, I favor tangible action, every day building a little something, so that step by step we create elbow-room under that savage occupation in which we find ourselves. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you think that Britain has abandoned its traditionalist policy after Douglas Hogg's visit to Kosova? [Rugova] Following the contacts we have had with Mr. Hogg, his visit to Albania two years ago, our meeting in London last December, and his recent visit to Prishtina, I can say his visit was very important as a significant gesture. It was not merely symbolic that he came to Kosova, because he visited all the centers, the capital cities, of the former Yugoslavia. I can say that Britain has shown great understanding of the Albanian cause and the issue of Kosova. Britain, as you know, is very well aware of the Albanian problem and the problem of Kosova. One hundred years ago, even at the time of the League of Prizren, Britain had very clear ideas about the unification of the Albanian territories; however, at that time, we were very weak diplomatically and politically. Today, Mr. Hogg said that we was interested in finding some solution for Kosova and in the start of some sort of dialogue and discussion. This was indeed his main aim, like that of many European countries that are interested in mediating and assisting. His presence in Prishtina was therefore important. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, the 26-month-massacre in Bosnia-Herzegovina openly shows indifference at the highest international level. But, on the basis of the results of the Geneva Conference, with regard to territorial relations, what is your prognosis for the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina? [Rugova] It remains to be seen whether or not Bosnia-Herzegovina will remain the same state as it was when it was recognized, whether it will be partitioned according to the Bosniak-Croatian agreement on a federation and later a confederation, or whether this process of internal unification and further confederation will continue. Indeed I think that the international community is making efforts to stop the war once and for all and then see -- but, as we see, it is very difficult. We can say that now that the war has begun it is difficult for the world to involve itself and, of course, states are wary of entering into a conflict whose end is unknown. The question is now whether Bosnia- Herzegovina will be divided or will remain, and whether the international community and the United Nations will remain true to their principles regarding countries or various territories they have agreed to protect. I also see this as a long process. [Bucpapaj] In the light of history, mentioning here the League of Prizren in 1878, 1912, 1945, and so forth, Albania has had many historic opportunities, lost opportunities. Now, thanks to democratic processes, do we have a new historic opportunity? [Rugova] If we look at matters so simply, we might consider these, from the perspective of today, as lost opportunities, but I mentioned earlier the League of Prizren and the years 1912, 1913, 1919, and 1945. It is a fact that today we are in a very different situation, I mean regarding Albanian potential. Kosova, even though occupied, has intellectual potential. The Albanians are no longer 80 percent illiterate as they used to be throughout the Albanian lands. However, today, we are also more-or-less handicapped because we have been invaded and subjugated; Albania has been isolated for 50 years and has been economically backward, i.e., with many problems, without contacts and friends. Friends are very important. However, in the last few years Albania has also revived and has opened up and become stronger. We in Kosova have asserted ourselves as an international entity, and so on, step by step. We must first create sympathy, then friends, and there is the chance today for a comprehensive Albanian policy. We possess diplomacy, which, although young, we are attempting to turn into an Albanian diplomacy. It is important to be organized and to have a thoroughly democratic orientation, because it seems to us that the word democracy has become a slogan for us. We must therefore preserve the democratic mechanisms that operate in Albanian society in Albania, in Kosova under the present circumstances, and in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], because democratic mechanisms ensure that the cause advances in an organized fashion. Today, we must draw lessons from what we may call these past opportunities, although they have their own place in history. Even the League of Prizren created an international precedent and raised demands; the Albanian problem was put forward for the first time, as the Ottoman Empire began to fall apart. In 1912 and 1913, we remained as a movement. It is another matter that we were not prepared and had no historical experience, but now let us draw lessons and not allow such situations to repeat themselves. Let us also take 1945, when territories were divided and redivided, what was Yugoslavia was federalized, and the borders between Italy and the former Yugoslavia were changed. In this sense, we must draw lessons. Even in the efforts we are making today, we must do something for the future. As a generation, this burden has fallen to us, as in 1945, 1913, 1918, and 1986. We have an advantage and must use this opportunity to the utmost. There are therefore many opportunities for cooperation between these democratic mechanisms in Kosova and Albania. Of course, the economic revival coming to Albania is a very important factor. Even in Kosova, under these conditions of occupation, people are making ends meet; there is an economy, and there is human solidarity. Similarly, let us use the diaspora for our common good and organize it. In all events, it is an opportunity. Now I do not want it to remain a mere opportunity, and let us keep it open. [Bucpapaj] Even after Mandela's victory in South Africa, a typically colonial apartheid system like that in Kosova exists in the middle of Europe. Will a limit be reached here? [sentence as published] [Rugova] This is happening. This apartheid is continuing and being strengthened in Kosova. Of course, it will have limits and I hope that it will not persist like in South Africa. This is not a racial apartheid, because both we Albanians and the Slavs are Europeans. However, it is an ethnic racism, and we see tragedy in Bosnia, Croatia, and also in Kosova, where there is emigration because of repression. We are working to ensure that it does not last long, and it is important today that international attention is focused on this apartheid and discrimination in Kosova and has called it by its true name. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, your frequent presence in Tirana suggests the coordination of viewpoints and options with the policy of Tirana. Can you add something here? [Rugova] Perhaps this is not the first time, but it is the first time in 50 years, if not since 1918, that we have begun to work together in the political sphere. This is very important. As you know, since 1918, and indeed since 1912 and 1913 when Kosova was invaded, under Montenegro, Serbia, and the former Yugoslavia we have unfortunately never had positive cooperation with the mother country. Even the war ended without any cooperation, if we look at matters as events. Now we have managed to create this cooperation. President Berisha, myself, and the Albanians in Macedonia now act. It is extremely important that we should meet and contact each other. Of course, in the last few years, I have passed through here almost every month, because that is the way I travel for security reasons. Sometimes I joke that Tirana Airport is the safest in the Balkans, but there is another side to this. It means I travel on Albanian soil. However, it is very important today that we see each other, meet, and create a comprehensive Albanian policy. It is good fortune that President Berisha, the Albanian Government, the parliament and the people support Kosova. There is understanding, and this is guarantee enough. We must continue in this direction. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, do you place any hopes in the results that will emerge from the census of the Albanian population in Macedonia? [Rugova] The problem of elections is still being discussed. I do not know if any decision has been made to announce this census, which was to be held in June. It would be a good thing, and I have spoken with Albanian political parties and groups in Macedonia about this, to be organized, for the Albanian deputies who are in power, and the Albanian ministers too, to make preparations to ensure that there is as little rigging as possible, as little speculation as possible, and for the real figures to emerge. I have asked for, and we are working for, the best possible preparations, whether this census is to be held in June or in the autumn, because it is a census to be held under international supervision and on this census will depend the involvement of the Albanians in the institutional structures of the Macedonian state as an ethnic and Albanian community on its own territory. We must, therefore, be serious. [Bucpapaj] Mr. Rugova, what advice would you give this pluralist and multiparty newspaper in Albania in this tragic situation that has overtaken the Balkans? [Rugova] Since we are all in this maelstrom, I pray to God that we will emerge from this situation as easily as possible, because wars today, as we see in Bosnia, are tragic. The weaponry is not equal, and it is not an equal struggle. As I said earlier, we have found ourselves in a very serious situation and must be careful in everything. As for Albania, I think that the results of the last two or three are very great. We must all understand that we too, beyond the current borders, are concerned and watch Albania in admiration for every effort it is making. I think that a sound basis has been created, and that good democratic, institutional, and economic foundations have been laid. Every month in the last two years, I have noticed changes, economic revival, and willpower among people. Of course, we cannot expect changes within one or two years, but sound foundations are being laid. Albania and all Albanians have now accepted pluralism. Here we must find paths of coordination, harmonization, and agreement. Of course, if we mention the government's position we must realize that these are elections for a four-year or eight-year mandate. The political parties, groups, and associations must make efforts to prove themselves, not to bring down so-and-so or to back so-and-so. They must prove themselves, always within that mighty structure we call the national cause, which I do not wish to remain a slogan, a romantic phrase, or a piece of socialist romanticism, but something tangible. The national cause is very tangible, and we must see each other, meet each other, and travel, breaking down these borders and within them building an Albanian society wherever we are. We must therefore find an understanding, despite the difficulties, and I again say, not as a slogan, that we must work continually. Understanding is the basis of national interests. Among ourselves, we are all of one blood, one people. However, like a family, we must find understanding; otherwise we cannot get on. This is also the basis of democracy and the basis of society, but I believe that we are successfully taking the first step.
