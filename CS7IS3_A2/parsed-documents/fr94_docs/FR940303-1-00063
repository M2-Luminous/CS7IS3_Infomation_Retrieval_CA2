FR940303-1-00063 FR940303-1-00011 FSIS believes that, if the statistical evidence indicates that a production lot is not in compliance with the calcium requirement, the lot must be labeled as MS(S) and meet the requirements for MS(S) in 9 CFR 319.5. In this situation, FSIS believes that the process is out of control, and there is the likelihood that too much calcium has been incorporated in the recovered meat, and, therefore, it should be identified as MS(S). FSIS is proposing that at least one pound of product be sampled each week during production of a lot for conformance with protein quality criteria. Once three consecutive results from 3 production lots are in compliance with the criteria on protein quality (i.e., a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score or essential amino acid content), sampling of production lots can be reduced to a monthly basis. After 6 months, sampling of production lots can be reduced to a quarterly basis. 12 12 This sampling schedule ensures the statistical representation of the production lots is achieved in regard to measuring protein quality. Subsequently, if samples are out of compliance, sampling each week would be repeated until the results are in compliance. A major concern of FSIS is the assurance that consumers receive the quality of meat they expect in terms of the value of protein needed to sustain good nutrition. Therefore, FSIS is proposing that product from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems that does not meet the requirements of the criteria for protein quality must be identified as ``(species) fat'' or ``(species) connective tissue,'' and labeled in accordance with the applicable provisions in 9 CFR Part 317. Protein quality values less than the proposed criteria are comparable to those associated with ``(species) fat'' and ``(species) connective tissue.'' 3. Handling requirements. FSIS is proposing to specify requirements for the handling of material that is to be processed into meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems and for handling such product. FSIS is proposing that the handling of such material comply with the same provisions as are currently prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18 for handling material for mechanical processing. FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. Because meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems consists of particulates of muscle tissue having more surface area than whole muscle cuts, there is a greater potential for bacterial hazards. FSIS has, therefore, concluded that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials used to make the product and for the product itself. FSIS is proposing to adopt the handling requirements prescribed in 9 CFR 318.18. These requirements would provide that material to be processed into meat derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and meat recovery systems be processed within 1 hour from the time it is cut or separated from livestock carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40 ○F (4 ○C) or less, or held indefinitely at 0 ○F (^18 ○ C) or less. Meat from advanced meat/bone separation machinery and recovery systems must be used as an ingredient in a meat food product directly after being processed, except that it may be held prior to such use for no more 72 hours at 40 ○F (4 ○C) or less or indefinitely at 0 ○F (^18 ○ C) or less. List of Subjects 9 CFR Part 301 Meat inspection. 9 CFR Part 318 Incorporation by reference, Meat inspection, Quality control, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Proposed Rule For the reasons set forth in the preamble, FSIS is proposing to amend 9 CFR parts 301 and 318 as follows:
