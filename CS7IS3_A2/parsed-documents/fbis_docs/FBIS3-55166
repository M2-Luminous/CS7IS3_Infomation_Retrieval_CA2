The FCS public relations center announced this today. The functions of the counterintelligence and antiterrorist units are defined and the powers of the FCS have been kept as far apart as possible from those of the law enforcement bodies. An FCS which performs functions outside their specialized service is ruled out. The total staff of the FCS will be 46 percent less than that of the former Ministry of Security. The statute envisions that the FCS will be directly subordinate to the president of the Russian Federation.
