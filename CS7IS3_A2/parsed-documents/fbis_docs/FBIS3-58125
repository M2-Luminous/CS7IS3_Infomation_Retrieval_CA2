But in his traditional New Year's press conference, Mitterrand said: "I would not wish to see a withdrawal of the UN troops because that would amount to abandoning the civilians even more than they are already. "To say to these people, tear yourselves to pieces (...) I could not imagine such a thing," said the French leader, who paid tribute to UN forces in former Yugoslav state who had "sometimes paid with their lives." [passage omitted] Mitterrand backed the use of force to carry out the UN mission in Bosnia but said doing so risked "spreading the infection of war, little by little," adding that "our policy must be sufficiently courageous but also very prudent. "1994 will not go by without some important innovations" in policy on Bosnia, he said. The president expressed measured support for a call by French Defence Minister Francois Leotard for US involvement in the conflict, saying "if there was the need for air cover for UN soldiers, why not?" In a wide-ranging press conference the French leader expressed concern for the rise in Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria, a former French colony, saying "we have the right to be worried about fundamentalist campaigns." And in a passing reference to his health the 76-year-old president, who suffers from prostate cancer, said there was "nothing to report."
