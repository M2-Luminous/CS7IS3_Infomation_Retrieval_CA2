The operation will take place on the PZL MIELEC premises, in cooperation with the Polish Aviation Institute, designer of the aircraft. The upgraded version Iryda M-93 will be provided with an inertial navigation system (SAGEM ULISS) wide field of view HUD [Head-up Display], HOTAS [Hands On Throttle and Stick] pilot interface, full color EFIS [Electronic Flight Information System] and extended attack capability. The first flight tests are due by the end of 1993. Qualification of MAESTRO [Modular Avionics Enhancement System Targeted for Retrofit Operations], the integrated Weapon Delivery, Navigation and Reconnaissance System designed and supplied by SAGEM is in progress to equip the Mirage III fleet of the Pakistani Air Force. Upgrade plans include extension of Air to Air operational performance and introduction of Air to Ground mode, to give the aircraft multimission capabilities. In addition, the aircraft will be fitted with multimode pulse doppler radar. A first production order was issued in June 1993. Two versions are being retrofitted, the trainer/strike aircraft and the multirole fighter. Another version of this system, designed by SAGEM for the Belgian Air Force Mirage V has recently completed with full success an extensive flight test campaign. Full operational clearance was awarded by the customer in May 1993. Production phase has recently started for upgrade of 15 single-seat Mirage V BA and 5 two-seat Mirage V BDs, two aircraft versions are concerned, the trainer/fighter and the attack/reconnaissance. MAESTRO (Modular Avionics Enhancement System Targeted for Retrofit Operations), with the SAGEM Nav/Attack systems for aircraft upgrades as cornerstone, provides capabilities at par with today's front line fighters. If features: Full inertial and GPS [Global Positioning System] performance (SAGEM ULISS or SIGMA) -- TERCOR terrain contour matching for stealth navigation and blind attack (SAGEM EBS 1501 Bubble Memory) -- Wide field of view HUD, FLIR [Forward-Looking Infrared] compatible (SAGEM Group IRIS FLIR), -- HOTAS pilot interface (Hands On Throttle and Stick), -- Air-to-Ground and Air-to-Air fire control including Radar or Laser Rangefinder -- Self protection system (Radar Warning, Chaff and Flares) -- All digital third generation mission planning system (SAGEM CIRCE 20001). SAGEM holds full flight test and qualification. The upgrade is performed within the customer's overhaul facility, enabling an extremely short turn-around and an increase of customer's support capability. The same system and methodology have been applied to a number of other aircraft: Jaguar International, A5, etc.
