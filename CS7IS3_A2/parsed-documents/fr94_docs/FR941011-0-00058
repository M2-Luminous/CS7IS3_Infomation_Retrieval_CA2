FR941011-0-00058 FR941011-0-00016 1. For R T greater than or equal to 0.160, the emission limit is 0.17 kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids. 2. For R T greater than or equal to 0.040 and less than 0.160, the emission limit is 0.17 Ã— 350 (0.l60&hyph;R T ) kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. 3. For R T less than 0.040, no emission limit applies. R T is the solids turnover ratio. This is the ratio of the volume of coating solids added to an EDP system during a calendar month divided by the total volume capacity of the EDP system. Prime coat systems other than EDP systems would be required to comply with a single numerical emission limit of 0.17 kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids. This revision is not a relaxation of the original prime coat standard since it does not reflect a change in the technological basis upon which the original standard was based. It does reflect a better understanding of the operation and performance of this technology based on an analysis of additional data which were not available at the time the standard was originally developed. Consequently, this revision does not result in any environmental, energy, cost, or economic impacts. Information collection requirements contained in this regulation (60.393) have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. and have been assigned OMB control number 2060&hyph;0034. I. Background On October 5, 1979, pursuant to Section 111 of the Act, standards of performance to limit emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from new, modified, and reconstructed automobile and light-duty truck surface coating operations were proposed (44 FR 57792). Final standards limiting VOC emissions from prime coat operations to 0.16 kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids were promulgated in the Federal Register on December 24, 1980 (45 FR 85410). On February 19, 1981, General Motors Corporation (GM) petitioned the Administrator to convene a proceeding under section 307(d)(7)(B) of the Act to reconsider the prime coat standard. The basis for the petition was new data, which had become available following promulgation of the standard, on the performance of the technology which served as the basis for this standard. The basis for the standard promulgated on December 24, 1980, was cathodic EDP prime coat systems which use low-VOC content waterborne materials. An EDP system consists of a large tank filled with coating material. Metal parts are submerged in the tank and a voltage is applied to help deposit the coating solids onto the parts. The low-VOC content cathodic EDP technology was quite new at the time of promulgation; and data on only one system, which had operated for less than 1 year, were available. Following receipt of GM's petition for reconsideration, data and information on the performance of this technology were solicited from GM, Ford Motor Company (FMC), American Motors Corporation (AMC), Volkswagen Corporation (VW), Chrysler Corporation, Nissan, Honda, Inmont, and Pittsburgh Plate Glass Corporation (PPG). Analysis of the additional data received confirmed that the promulgated standard did not accurately reflect the performance of cathodic EDP prime coat systems. Consequently, a revised standard of 0.17 kg VOC per liter of applied coating solids (6-month average using the best 6 months out of a 7-month period) was proposed on July 29, 1982. A public hearing was not requested. The official public comment period closed on September 27, 1982. II. Comments and Changes to the Standard Six comments were received on the proposed revised standard. Three were from automobile manufacturers, one from a coating manufacturer, one from an industry trade association, and one from a State regional control agency. A significant amount of additional data on the performance of EDP prime coating systems was included with these comments. These data covered the performance of 37 cathodic EDP prime coating systems using 10 different low-VOC content prime coating materials over approximately 3,000 weeks of operation.
