The project, with an estimated cost of 1 million U.S. dollar, was an outcome of a recent China visit by Indian National Dairy Development Board Chairman V. Kurien and Managing Director Amrita Patel who was in Nanning to attend a seminar on buffalo milk production. During their stay in Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang Minority Autonomous Region, Kurien and Patel held discussions on dairy development based on buffaloes with local Chinese officials. The proposal mooted envisages that the Indian side would provide design and other administrative knowhow to China, the sources said. India is also reportedly to have expressed its willingness to give 300 elite buffalo embryos and 50,000 doses of frozen semen from elite buffalo bulls in order to boost dairy development in the region. A diplomat in the Chinese Embassy confirmed that the project is still waiting for approval by both the governments.
