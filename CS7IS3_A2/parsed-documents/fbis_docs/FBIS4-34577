Acting Foreign Minister Carlos Cordero said: "We have cooperated and will continue offering aid to the Haitians, but at this time it is impossible to receive them." After noting Panama's current high unemployment rate (15 percent), Cordero said a mass influx of Caribbean refugees would only worsen the Panamanian people's economic and social situation. Last week the Panamanian Government denied press reports announcing the arrival of refugees in Panama. Recently, President William Clinton suggested to the nations of the region that they receive Haitian citizens who are fleeing the island because of the serious political crisis that threatens to end in a U.S. military invasion.
