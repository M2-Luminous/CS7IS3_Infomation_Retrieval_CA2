Figueroa] [Text] Narcotics Division Chief Ramiro Yarvis of the Judicial Technical Police (PTJ) has said "clandestine ports" all across the country are being used by drug traffickers to smuggle drugs. Yarvis indicated that Darien Province, currently the site of an operation to destroy coca plantations, is just one of the areas in which drug traffickers harvest the drug. He added that Colombian guerrillas protect the coca plantations in Darien, where hostile and remote terrain makes entering the jungle difficult. He admitted that other drug laboratories in Darien may not have been destroyed. Yarvis said the technical and personnel resources available to state security agencies, the PTJ, National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service are virtually incapable of combating this problem. "There is a huge number of clandestine ports being used to smuggle drugs," he noted. Former National Customs Director Rodrigo Arosemena told reporters that a bill to authorize the destruction of drugs 24 hours after they are seized is necessary to stop drug traffickers who are flooding the country with drugs.
