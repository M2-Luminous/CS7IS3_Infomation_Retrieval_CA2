For Pact for Italy leader Mario Segni, the present prime minister will have to hand over the reins. "Nowhere is it written," he reasons, "that it is necessarily Silvio Berlusconi who has to form the government. In the majority of the Right, which has won and which should provide the prime minister, there are other individuals and, hence, other possible governments." "It is absurd to call new elections if the government falls," Segni went on to warn, even venturing to suggest a possibly benevolent attitude of his group toward a new government "headed by a different person and who would not pose the serious problems of incompatibility (as posed by Berlusconi), and who would not promote exponents of a Right which is discredited in Europe." Senator Francesco Cossiga gave a more articulate forecast. "If the government fails to pass the Senate," the former president of the Republic stated, "resignation will be necessary" for Berlusconi, who will have to hand over "to the person whom we have to get used to seeing as the head of the opposition, that is PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader Occhetto." If the PDS too fails to win a vote of confidence, for Cossiga this would open the way to the formation of a "government of national unity, with a short program and led by an individual acceptable to both Left and Right, or a government which would take the country into the elections." This last possibility, for the former head of state, should not be "absolutely dramatized, because in the system which we have chosen early dissolution is a built-in part of the mechanism when the majority expressed by the people does not function." "I hope that the Senate will find the votes, because -- [Interior] Minister Roberto Maroni states bluntly -- who will take on the responsibility of bringing down the government, to which there is no alternative, whatever Segni says. He knows that the only alternative is new elections." But new elections, in the opinion of the new interior minister, would be an unpopular step, which people would not understand. "From all sides, including those who voted progressive, I sense a desire, " Maroni confesses, "to get the government started off in order to then assess its actions. Everyone's real wish is for governability."
