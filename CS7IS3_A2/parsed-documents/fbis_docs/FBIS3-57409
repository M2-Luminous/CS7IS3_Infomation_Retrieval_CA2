However, the program "Radio Pressing Issues" broadcast a traditional interview with him. The conversation was recorded on Monday [17 January]. "The national defense structures have been assigned 130 million litai from the budget this year, which is 1.6 times more than last year," said the head of the government. In his opinion, this sum is insufficient to create good service conditions for soldiers and to feed them properly. However, one should not forget that our state national defense system is only shaping up, and there are shortages in many places. The prime minister reminded everyone that we received aid from the Swedes and the Danes. Therefore, the community has developed a feeling that we are dependents. Without such assistance from our neighbors, however, the independent emergence of a completely new structure of our state would be very difficult. According to A. Slezevicius, after Lithuania has expressed its desire to become part of the collective security system (NATO), new demands will also be put on the Armed Forces. The standards of technology and tactics differ considerably. Therefore, according to the prime minister, we must think about the quality of our Army when seeking membership in this organization. A joint Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuanian peacekeeping force that is being formed now will be a certain test to our Army. In the opinion of National Defense Minister Linas Linkevicius, the Army's quality depends on its commanders' training. That is why dozens of Lithuanian officers are constantly studying abroad. Recently, 30 young officers left for a training course in Denmark. Our traditional ties with Sweden, which L. Linkevicius visited a few days ago, and with other states of the Baltic region provide experience in forming the national defense system. The minister does not rule out the possibility that in the future the Lithuanian Army will be recruited on a mixed basis -- from professional soldiers and conscripts. Such a system can be accomplished in stages. L. Linkevicius claimed that Lithuania's current Army is depoliticized, while the Riflemen's Union and other structures are operating outside the national defense system. According to the minister, the National Defense Ministry maintains relations with them and believes that it is necessary to have contacts with the community. The opinion of the prime minister and the national defense minister on the notorious story of Army equipment is as follows: It is too early to make any conclusions. How will the national defense system spend the money allotted to it this year? The defense doctrine and its functions define the amount of finances to be assigned to it. Minister L. Linkevicius assured that the money would not be wasted. The defense doctrine will also reply to the question whether the Lithuanian Army is not too large for a small country. The defense of borders alone will require a constant number of 5,000 guards. [passage omitted]
