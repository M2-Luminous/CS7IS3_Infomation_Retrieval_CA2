Relatively many have experienced losses. In particular, year after year those with major losses have depended on state subsidies to get by. This has become a huge burden for Lhasa. It has gotten so serious that fiscal revenues are out of breath. In line with the establishment of a socialist market economy, what is the present situation of enterprise production (operation) in Lhasa? According to Lhasa Economic Committee statistics, from January to September 1993, the total accumulated gross output value of industrial enterprises in Lhasa (in fixed 1990 prices) was 26.1082 million yuan, up 4.17 percent over the same period of 1992, and accounting for completion of 74.70 percent of the annual plan; of which, 13 industrial enterprises subordinate to Lhasa city accounted for 15.0163 million yuan, completion of 80.47 percent of the annual plan. County-subordinate industrial enterprises completed 450,200 yuan, up 105.76 percent over the same period in 1992. From January to September, industrial enterprises throughout the city accumulated total product sales reaching 27.7651 million yuan (excluding county-subordinate industrial enterprises). Of which, the Chengguan District Minority Handicraft Industrial Enterprise accounted for 11.6031 million yuan, up 28.17 percent over the same period in 1992. From January to September, industrial enterprises throughout Lhasa had clearly improved economic results, realizing profits of 2.09 million yuan (excluding county-subordinate industrial enterprises), up 29.81 percent over the same period in 1992. Twenty-six minority handicraft industries in the Chengguan region had rather good economic results, realizing profits of 1.402 million yuan, up 38.13 percent over the same period in 1992. From January to September, two Lhasa-subordinate transport enterprises transported a total of 6,474.3 tons, up 17.61 percent over the same period in 1992. They had a weekly transport volume of 4.92 million ton-kilometers, up 23.93 percent over the same period in 1992, for a total income of 1.361 million yuan, up 79.31 percent over the same period in 1992. Economic efficiency is clearly up. The enterprise production situation is pleasing. For many years, because they were fettered by the old system, enterprises in Lhasa were unable to break out thoroughly from "big rice bowl, iron rice bowl" conditions. They were unable to motivate fully the enthusiasm of enterprise workers. Furthermore, the dependent mentality of enterprises to "wait, depend on and demand" was rather serious. There was much talk of objective causes, little search for subjective differences. The subjective capabilities of enterprises could not be brought into play. Reliance on government was rampant. Some enterprises even relied on state fiscal subsidies or bank loans to get by. This was a burden on state finances. Enterprises owing bank loans had no way to repay on time. The burden became more serious year after year and enterprises became ever poorer. They have never been able to stand on their own feet. Given the difficulties and problems enterprises face, in the process of implementing the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's southern tour and the party's 14th Plenum, the Lhasa Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Lhasa people's government summarized enterprises' existing problems. They believe that to get enterprises out of difficulty requires great effort to further deepen enterprise reform and strengthen the operational mechanism of enterprises while improving economic results. Toward this end, they formulated specific implementing methods to enact the State Council's and Autonomous Regions' regulations regarding transforming the operational mechanisms of state-run industrial enterprises. To deepen enterprise reform, leading cadres of the Lhasa Committee and the Lhasa government along with sectors managing enterprises actively transformed functions, performed services well, deepened survey research on each enterprise, grasped major current problems of enterprises and helped them resolve major contradictions. To reform enterprise work methods, they implemented reforms aimed at leadership and guidance, leading enterprises toward the market to participate in market competition and enhance competitiveness. At the same time enterprises throughout Lhasa commonly held big discussions on "liberating thinking, changing thought patterns, seeking differences, seizing good opportunities and deepening reform." Thus they made enterprises recognize that reform was the only way out. Based on minority handicraft industry market economy development trends, the Chengguan Regional People's Government and Economic Committee transformed and merged 34 former minority handicraft enterprises into 26. They expanded the enterprise scale of production (operations) and went after hot selling products, enhancing the enterprises' ability to adapt to and compete on the market. At the same time various enterprises further perfected internal contract responsibility systems. According to a survey, 13 Lhasa-subordinate industrial enterprises and 26 minority handicraft industries all implemented various forms of contract and target responsibility systems, putting each economic target concretely on the workshop, the small group and the individual. They thoroughly reorganized the "big rice bowl," smashed the "iron rice bowl," turning pressure into a motive force and fully motivating the enthusiasm of enterprise management personnel and production (operation) workers. After smashing the "big rice bowl," transport enterprises tightly captured good opportunities in the transport market. They actively organized resources, "putting down their bowls to find rice [searching out work to do]," making rational allocations, fully uncovering potential and thinking of every possible way and means to improve existing transport equipment utilization rates and make transport production good for the future. Due to deepened reform and ferreting out enterprise potential, they further enhanced the role of subjective enterprise potential. In a timely manner various enterprises seized economic markets, actively introduced technology, increased the colors and varieties of products and augmented vitality. The output value and efficiency clearly rose in five Lhasa-subordinate industrial enterprises: the Lhasa wood article plant, carpet factory, handicraft and artworks plant, food and oil processing plant, and clothing company. In particular, by the end of September 1993 the food and oil processing plant had already surpassed its entire annual production task and each economic target. At the same time, various enterprises actively began movements to save energy and expenses and create income. Under conditions of the changeover from the old to new economic system, intense market competition, higher prices on various raw materials, and a shortage of circulating funds, enterprises throughout Lhasa strive to reduce product costs, do all they can to shrink nonproduction expenses, expand product sales and reduce inventories. Product costs fell to various degrees and economic efficiency rose at five enterprises: the Lhasa mining company, cement manufacturing plant, wood articles plant, handicraft and art products plant, and the East Wind sideline food products plant.
