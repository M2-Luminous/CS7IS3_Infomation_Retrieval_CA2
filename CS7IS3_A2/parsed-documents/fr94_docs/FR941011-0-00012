The capacity for each identifiable location will be determined by the Secretary. The total capacity of all locations may not exceed the capacity stated in the current license. An identifiable location is a fully functional public warehouse as determined by the Secretary. The annual fee a licensed warehouseman is assessed may be adjusted by the amount Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) pays, if CCC has a storage contract or agreement with the warehouseman. (b) An inspection fee for each original and amendment inspection. (c) An inspection fee at the rate of 100 percent of the annual fee charged warehouses without a CCC storage contract or agreement, in all cases where the license has been suspended and the warehouseman has requested reinstatement. No fee will be charged if the Secretary determines that the suspension was not justified. (d) A fee for each inspection requested by the warehouseman at the rate of 100 percent of the annual fee charged warehouses without a CCC storage contract or agreement.
