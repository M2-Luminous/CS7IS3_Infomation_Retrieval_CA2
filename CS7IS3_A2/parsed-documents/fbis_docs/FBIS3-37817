He held talks in Delhi with the Indian Republic's Naval Commander Admiral V.S. Shekhawat, was received by Defense Minister M. Mallikarjun, visited naval bases in Vishakhapatnam and Bombay, and also visited a warship. It is no secret that in the past two years the level of military-technical cooperation between Russia and India has seen a decline and that the rupture of economic links between the countries of the CIS and the transfer to a new system of interstate calculations account for much of this, Gromov said. Therefore, the talks and meetings that have been held here have centered on problems connected to the resumption of bilateral ties on the basis of agreements arrived at during Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to India in January 1993. These documents are now being qualitatively implemented where they relate to military-technical cooperation, in particular in weaponry matters and orders for spare parts, mechanisms, and materials. Furthermore, there are opportunities for organizing the exchange of experience in the tactics of the art of war and in personnel training. The Russian military leader expressed hope that the creation in Moscow of Rosvooruzheniye with the aim of settling all matters from the sale of arms through to their technical servicing and use in one package would provide for the smooth functioning of deliveries. We have taken it upon ourselves to work more closely with this new structure in order to meet our obligations to India, he said. The commander in chief praised the level of maintenance at Indian bases, ships, and training equipment and the training of servicemen. All categories without exception -- from admiral to sailor -- display a conscientious attitude to the fulfillment of their duties. There are elements that we could adopt during the transition to the construction of Russia's Armed Forces on a new, professional basis. The entry into Bombay of a detachment of the Russian Pacific Fleet consisting of the large Admiral Vinogradov antisubmarine vessel, the large Admiral Vilkov landing vessel and the Viktor Kolechitskiy tanker was timed to coincide with Gromov's visit. By agreement with the command of India's Navy, the first Russian-Indian exercises since the dissolution of the USSR were held in the Arabian Sea, during the course of which, according to the admiral, individual elements of military activity were tested: The establishment of communications, joint maneuvers, work with aerial and underwater targets, and the use of helicopters. A decision was made to conduct similar maneuvers in the future.
