The attacks intensified after NATO aircraft had begun overflying Serb positions between Gorazde and Cajnice this afternoon. This encouraged Muslim forces to attempt to carry out infantry onslaughts in several places along the separation line. The command of the Herzegovina corps said that for their attacks, Muslim forces have been using facilities in which representatives of international humanitarian organizations and the UN are accommodated. Fire from anti-aircraft guns and machine-guns has been opened from the hospital building, schools, and other institutions. The command of the Herzegovina corps today resolutely denied reports broadcast by Sarajevo media that the Serb army used chemical weapons, stressing that this has been done by Muslim forces which have a factory for the production of the banned chemicals in Gorazde. Despite the fierce attacks, the Serb forces today managed to preserve their front lines, the command said.
