Addressing a news conference at Islamabad Airport today on her return from a week-long tour of Davos, Geneva, Zagreb, and Sarajevo Ms. Benazir Bhutto said the image of Pakistan in the international community has been enhanced. We were able to project the positive image of Pakistan on the question of investment climate, our just stand on Kashmir, and on expression of solidarity with the Bosnian Muslims. Pakistan has achieved the objective of drawing world attention toward human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and the plight of the Bosnian Muslims. The prime minister said according to her promise to the people of Pakistan and Kashmir, she presented the Kashmir case before the Human Rights Commission. It is Pakistan's basic policy to repeatedly arouse the world conscience over Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir. Replying to questions on threats from Indian leaders, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said no amount of threats or intimidation can deter us from our principled stand on Kashmir and support to the Kashmiri people's right of self-determination. We are fully capable of defending our integrity against any aggression, she added. To another question, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said while agreeing to the talks with India, we have sent a powerful signal to New Delhi that Pakistan believes in talks. We also wanted to tell the world that there is a government in Pakistan, which despite strong domestic pressures, is capable of taking even unpopular decisions in the larger interests of peace. Pakistan, she added, cannot be expected to be engaged in talks with India in an atmosphere where the Kashmiri people may feel that we are colluding with Indian repressions. She said a resolution is being moved in the Human Rights Commission for violations in Kashmir. Pakistan has conveyed to the world that it is not a matter of number to win maximum votes, but it is a matter of principle. She said special envoys are being sent to various countries to muster support. On the investment climate, Ms. Benazir Bhutto was hopeful for a boost in foreign investment in Pakistan in the wake of the new atmosphere of political and economic stability prevailing in the country. She said foreign investors are also going to open a Pakistan Trade Center in Zurich to get international market for Pakistani products. On her visit to Sarajevo, the prime minister said she and Turkish Prime Minister Madam Tansu Ciller succeeded in diverting world attention toward the plight of Bosnian people. Narrating the woeful human rights situation in Bosnia, Ms. Benazir Bhutto said people are getting sick and weak. They have no food, no medicine, no water, and no electricity. We salute the brave people of Bosnia who are living in a very difficult situation, but are fighting for their independence and territorial integrity.
