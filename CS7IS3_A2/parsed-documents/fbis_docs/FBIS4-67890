According to SANKEI SHIMBUN, there are two types of the new missile. This was discovered in February at the North Korean Sannudong Research Development Institute through the U.S. reconnaissance satellite. Each type consists of two-stage rockets [kakkak idanisikuro toeoitta]. The U.S. intelligence authorities stated that the new missile was named, Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2. They estimate that the first stage is 18 m long and its diameter is 2.4 m and the second stage is 14 m long and its diameter is 1.3 m. SANKEI SHIMBUN reported: ``If the shooting range is 6,000 km, Guam as well as all of Japan, including Okinawa, can be a target. AIR SPACE DAILY reported that if North Korea is successful in developing this missile, it will emerge as a big military power in the East Asian region.'' SANKEI SHIMBUN also reported: ``Great Britain's military journal, JANE'S DEFENSE WEEKLY, reported that the missile North Korea is developing has a shooting range of over 2,000 km. However, this is the first time it is revealed that its shooting range is in fact 6,000 km. If North Korea completes the development of this missile, the entire East Asian region would be greatly threatened.''
