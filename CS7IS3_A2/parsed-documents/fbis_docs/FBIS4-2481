In light of their own actual cases regarding ideological understanding and work, members of the study group talked freely. During the closing session, provincial party committee Secretary Wang Maolin delivered an important speech on theoretical study for leading cadres. The provincial party committee central study group's main purpose in organizing this intensive study class was to enable its members to emancipate their minds, change their concepts, and to explore a general policy for Hunan Province to embrace the market economy. The provincial party committee demanded that members participating in the intensive study class concentrate on reading the original text of the works and documents, thoroughly study and understand the essence of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, as well as the basic content and important significance of the central authorities' decision, and conduct research on special topics with reference to the reality in Hunan as well as the specific tasks assigned to them. On the afternoon the study class closed, Comrade Wang Maolin delivered a speech. He said: Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the important theoretical foundation on which to build socialism well, and the theoretical ground for our party to formulate its line, principles, and policies. Our comrades holding leading posts, especially those holding high-level leading posts, must properly implement the party's line, principles, and policies and do a good job in performing the duties that the party and the people have entrusted to them. Without studying Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics well, they will not be able to perform their duties well, thus they will fail to accomplish the tasks the party and the people assign to them. Wang Maolin demanded that everybody conscientiously read the original text of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, in a thorough and down-to-earth manner, with close reference to actual cases, try to understand the works' spiritual essence, and apply the theory to actual work. Members of the standing committee of the provincial party committee, the principal comrades in charge of the provincial people's congress and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference provincial committee, vice governors, and the secretary general of the provincial government attended this study class organized by the central study group of the provincial party committee.
