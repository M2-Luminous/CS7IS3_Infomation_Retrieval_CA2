FR940620-0-00011 FR940620-0-00004 Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. One commenter supports the proposed rule. Two commenters request that specific references to page numbers and revision dates of the Boeing 767 Airplane Maintenance Manual (AMM), which are specified in paragraph (f) of the proposal, be removed from the proposed rule. Boeing recommends that the proposed AD specify only the ATA Chapter-Section-Subject, pageblock title, and task title. Boeing explains that the AMM's are customized for each operator to reflect all of the equipment in that operator's fleet. Therefore, the number of pages for any given procedure is variable, depending on the number of different equipment configurations documented in an operator's AMM. Boeing also indicates that AMM procedures are revised periodically for non-technical reasons. Boeing adds that changes to the structure of the procedures are necessary to accommodate an upgrade of the publishing system that is currently under way, which, in addition to repagination, will necessitate the issuance of revised AMM pages. Boeing also requests that a reference to a specific Temporary Revision (TR) number, which is specified in ``NOTE 4'' under paragraph (c) of the proposal, be eliminated from the proposed rule. Boeing explains that because of the customization of AMM's for each operator, multiple TR's may be issued to address a technical concern. While changes to the procedure can be identical for all operators, the page layout of each operator's AMM can require a unique TR to allow the operator to correctly integrate the TR into the AMM. Since each unique TR has a different number, the specific TR referenced in the proposal only applies to the AMM's for three operators of a possible 18 operators. Additionally, TR's are removed from an operator's AMM and destroyed when the data is incorporated in a subsequent regular revision. The procedural changes in the TR cited in the proposal were incorporated into the AMM in November 1992, and instructions were provided in an AMM transmittal letter to remove the TR. Therefore, it is probable that operators no longer have the TR that was cited in the proposed rule. Boeing concludes that the net effect of specifying AMM page numbers, AMM revision dates, and TR's in the AD would be that operators may be unable to use the procedure contained in the AMM to perform certain tests required by the AD. Each operator would be required to maintain an obsolete version of the procedure, or to request FAA approval of an alternative method of compliance with the AD that would allow the use of the current version of the AMM. The FAA concurs partially. In light of the information submitted by the commenters, the FAA finds that specific reference to the TR cited in ``NOTE 4'' under paragraph (c) of the proposal should not be specified in the final rule. Accordingly, ``NOTE 4'' has been removed from the final rule. Additionally, the FAA's objective in proposing periodic operational checks of the sync-lock device, as specified in paragraph (f) of this AD, is to ensure the integrity of the locking function. However, since the issuance of the proposal and receipt of Boeing's comments to the proposal, Boeing has submitted to the FAA separate procedures for accomplishment of the operational checks of the sync-lock integrity. Therefore, these procedures have been defined in paragraph (f) of the final rule, and the AMM references specified previously in paragraph (f) of the proposal have been removed from the final rule. The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, on behalf of its members, states that, while ATA members are not opposed to accomplishing the proposed checks as part of their maintenance programs, these members are opposed to accomplishing the checks as part of the requirements of an AD. The commenters believe that the requirement for operational checks is equivalent to issuing a Certification Maintenance Requirements (CMR) item by means of an AD.
