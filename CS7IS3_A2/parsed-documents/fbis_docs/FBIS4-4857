"Economic indicators are increasingly showing the evidence (that the economy is on the rise) and corporate sentiment is gradually improving," said Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), at a regular news conference. But Hayami, calling the yen's advance against the U.S. dollar "excessive," said, "the current dollar-yen level will have an adverse effect on export-oriented companies." "The U.S. Administration apparently hopes the yen will post a further gain in the face of a `triple' decline of stocks, bonds and dollars," Hayami said.
