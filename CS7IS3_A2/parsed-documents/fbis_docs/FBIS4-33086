Rodriguez begins by stating that efficiency is not a hollow slogan and that the struggle to attain efficiency has barely begun. Sexto states that slogans are good for mobilizing the masses, but that "in the economy, slogans are harmful. The economy is not advanced by slogans because we run the risk of their becoming hollow. Slogans can be a mask behind which many people hide their lack of effort or efficiency." Sexto stresses that efficiency is vital to all societies and to overcoming the dire situation Cuba is experiencing. He adds that development is the result of efficiency, and praises the Cuban Workers Federation's economic efficiency assemblies' goal to motivate every worker. Rodriguez adds: "In order to make efficiency a viable, truly attainable goal, the concepts and mechanisms that direct our economy must change, the concepts and mechanism that today direct our economy." He states that it is important to embark on this path with firmness, "ensuring that in the future we will not regret having taken this path." Sexto agrees, noting that the current assembly process seeks to tap the workers' "subjective reserves" to solve collective problems. Sexto also agrees that: "In order to attain efficiency in Cuba, certain changes in the economic organization must be made. I believe certain principles that have been followed for many years must be changed because one way or another, they have conditioned our widespread inefficiency. We must admit that Cuba has done tremendous work over the past 35 years, but I believe that work could have been even greater. I also believe that a certain widespread inefficiency has limited that work because the model and concepts used to direct our economy promoted inefficiency." He goes on to say that only through autonomous management will the enterprises become efficient: "...although the word autonomy scares many people. These people are those who, today, we identify with the bureaucracy, and for whom autonomy represents a loss of power." Sexto and Rodriguez agree that it is difficult to pinpoint these people because they are people who are trying to defend the Revolution, but who go about it the wrong way. Sexto again emphasizes the importance of autonomous management for achieving efficiency, citing Ranchuelo's Cigar Factory as an example. This factory produced the cigars, but did not market them. That was done by another enterprise, which owed 4 million pesos to the factory. The factory, therefore, had to seek bank loans to meet its payroll. The marketing enterprise had no incentive to quickly pay the factory. Rodriguez focuses on the individual workers' role in attaining efficiency. Sexto notes that the worker's existence is fully independent from the result of his labor. "You well know that in Cuba, the egalitarian concepts that have tried to make all workers equal have also created a schism between the worker and his labor. Whether the lathe worker does good or bad work, his job is not affected. If the factory is unprofitable, his job is not affected. He continues to get the same salary. His life is not changed." Sexto reiterates that a link must be established between performance, and salary or living conditions. Rodriguez agrees, noting the example of an enterprise in which a manager did not receive a salary for two months because of his inefficient performance. Sexto again stresses the importance of the link between performance and salary. Rodriguez closes by reiterating that efficiency is not a hollow issue.
