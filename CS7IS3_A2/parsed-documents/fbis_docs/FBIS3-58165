[Ruehe] Mr. Siegloch, I think that all Europeans can be satisfied, for now it is clear that Partnership for Peace is not a substitute for NATO membership, but that it makes a step-by-step entry possible. It does not discriminate against anyone; yet, it offers the possibility to differentiate. That means that those countries that are seeking membership -- and it is also in Germany's interest that our eastern border is not for ever the external border of NATO and the European Union -- now have the opportunity to closely cooperate with NATO and prepare themselves for membership. [Siegloch] Still, Poland and others were hoping for a quicker NATO membership. Has this Clinton message also taken Yeltsin's situation into account? [Ruehe] Well, one could not expect that it would pave the way for membership right now. The important thing is that NATO is now fundamentally opening up and that the would-be members will now use the time for working their way toward NATO -- for example, to create military structures that will make real membership possible. For German politics, it was also important that one does not have to choose between Moscow and Warsaw, because then one would have done everything wrong right from the start. We need partnership with Russia, between NATO and Russia, but we also need the possibility of expanding NATO by those countries that are seeking such membership. [Siegloch] Military cooperation has been offered. What could that look like? [Ruehe] There are very concrete proposals. As early as this year -- and those who are seeking membership can pursue that with particular intensity -- there should be joint exercises. I think we will also participate in such programs. We should then coordinate armament systems to make them compatible; the full range of possibilities will be explored for such countries that want to work their way toward NATO. I am in favor of initiating concrete programs very soon -- sometime this year -- with, for example, Poland, Hungary, the Czechs, and Slovaks. [Siegloch] You have mentioned joint exercises. Let us imagine a scenario of a real conflict in the East. What would happen then? Would NATO stand idly by or would it intervene? [Ruehe] I think that what the U.S. vice president said on behalf of the President is right, namely that U.S. security is linked to the security of East Central Europe. This applies, at least, equally to West Europe, too. It means that as long as there is no full membership, there can be no full guarantee. However, West Europe can, of course, not at all be indifferent to what is going on at its eastern border. At the moment, I see no danger of a military conflict. Still, the political revolution is not over yet in Europe. Its climax was in 1989, and we are well-advised to strengthen this major anchor of stability, NATO, in the future, too, and the Germans must continue to make an important contribution with its Bundeswehr. By the way, many of our neighbors in East Europe are hoping for cooperation, particularly with Germany. [Siegloch] That means that there will not be any security guarantees in the real sense for the East and Central European countries? [Ruehe] No, not in the form that exists among NATO member states. However, there will be continually improving and intensifying cooperation. Besides, there will also be joint peacekeeping missions, even before membership. I think that this will also indirectly enhance security. Anyway, the security of the Poles has a lot to do with the security of the Germans. This applies for West and East Europe as a whole. [Siegloch] One short question on the timeframe. Membership not until the next century? [Ruehe] I do not think that one should put it off artificially for so long. I see a possibility still in this decade, and, thus, also in this century. [Siegloch] Thank you very much, Mr. Ruehe.
