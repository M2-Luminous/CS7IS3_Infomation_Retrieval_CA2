As early as last year, the presence of a Namibian embassy in Israel would have been unthinkable because of SWAPO's [South-West African People's Organization] open criticism of the Jewish state. Shortly after independence, the Namibian Government formally established diplomatic ties with the Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] at the ambassadorial level and continued its campaign of open support for the organization of Yasir 'Arafat. A brief statement issued last week on decisions made at the first cabinet meeting in Windhoek for 1994 notes that the cabinet has decided to empower Minister of Foreign Affairs Theo Ben Gurirab to establish full diplomatic ties with Israel. The cabinet has also given its permission for a high-level Israeli business delegation to visit Namibia within the next three weeks and for ministries to hold talks with the delegation on "areas of interest" for Namibia. The cabinet has taken note of the policy objectives being pursued at this stage, concerning the Middle East and especially the negotiations between the PLO and the Israeli Government. In his New Year's message to the diplomatic corps last week, the president, Mr. Sam Nujoma, referred to the agreement between Israel and the PLO as one of the top "achievements" of 1993. He said that the prospects of self-government for Palestine is closer than ever before following the signing of the peace agreement. Israel and the PLO signed the historic agreement on Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and Jericho in Washington on 13 September. In the agreement, Israel and the PLO undertook to officially recognize each other.
