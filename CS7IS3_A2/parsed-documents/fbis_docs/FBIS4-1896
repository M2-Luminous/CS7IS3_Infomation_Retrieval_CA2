FBIS4-1896 "drchi065_p_94007" FBIS-CHI-94-065 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Central-South Region Farmers Protest in Guangdong's Huiyang County Farmers Protest in Guangdong's Huiyang County HK0504053594 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST in English 5 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 HK0504053594 Hong Kong SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST English BFN [By Stella Lee] [Text] Angry protests are continuing in Huiyang County, near Shenzhen, over the amount of compensation offered to farmers whose land is being developed in an urban renewal programme. Yesterday, dozens of landowners from Xinhua village petitioned the county Government over the issue and accused their village representatives of corruption. They say they are concerned because their land was confiscated last year but so far they have not received the government compensation they were promised. They suspect that someone in their village may have already received the payments and not passed them on. A strong force of Public Security Bureau officers supervised the protest yesterday, following a violent clash between villagers and police last week. This time, however, the officers turned their attention to reporters trying to cover the demonstration. Officers checked the identity of anyone going into the village. Hong Kong reporters were detained for four hours for failing to seek permission from the authorities to conduct interviews in the region. They were eventually escorted to the border and put on trains back to the territory. About 30 Xinhua villagers had gone to the Huiyang government building at about 9.30 am with banners saying they wanted their compensation. One of the Xinhua villagers said: "Our agricultural lands were sold last year, but we have not been given any compensation so far. "We believe the village representatives are corrupt and we want the Government to investigate." Another villager said the county Government had promised to send representatives to the village on Friday [1 April] to hear the complaints. Similar tales emerged from Baigang village where rioting took place last week when hundreds of angry residents mobbed nearby Xiachong police station in protest at "unsatisfactory" compensation. The farmers said yesterday that each had been given only $1,600 over the past three years as compensation for their 900 hectares of land, although they estimated they were owed between $6 million and $7 million by the Government. Last week's riot started on Thursday night when about 80 villagers staged a demonstration at the police station demanding the release of one of the farmers who had been accused of blackmail. Daya Bay Public Security Bureau head Chen Xinde said staff had used no force until the villagers tried to damage the office. Five villagers were arrested for causing damage and attacking public security officers. One villager, Chen Rongchao, was shot in the leg twice by the public security officials as they were trying to arrest his brother Chen Rongsheng, another blackmail suspect. Chen Xinde said the shooting was carried out in self-defence when Chen tried to attack his staff. His family said they did not know at which hospital he was being treated and so could not check on his condition. Residents said police fired warning shots to disperse the crowd and that sporadic fighting had taken place. Some of the police station's windows were smashed. The farmers accused the village representatives of trying to suppress an organisation formed by one of the brothers which called for a clear account of the compensation issue. Other organisers were in hiding yesterday.
