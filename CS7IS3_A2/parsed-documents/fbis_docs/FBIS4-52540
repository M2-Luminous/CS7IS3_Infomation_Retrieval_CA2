On 6 May traitor Kim Yong-sam appeared in the site celebrating the so-called workers' day. At the site, babbling that we are continuing instigation activities toward the South without renouncing a nuclear development program and that we are pointing long-range missiles at the South he clamored that the South Korean people should renounce a dreamy view on reunification. On 7 May Yi Hong-ku, minister of the puppet unification board, held a so-called unification and security policy coordination meeting. At the meeting he clamored that it will be inevitable for the UN Security Council to impose sanctions in case we refuse to accept additional inspections, that stern countermeasures should be taken, that an international alliance system will be further strengthened, and the like. He also urged us to observe the Armistice Agreement, like a thief turning on their owner, and expressed the will to oppose a new system for guaranteeing peace that we have proposed recently. These shameless remarks by traitor Kim Yong-sam and rascal Yi Hong-ku which reverse black and white are none other than the splittists' sophistry which makes the world's people laugh. Traitor Kim Yong-sam clamored that our missiles are aiming at them. He carries his distortion of facts too far. Who aims at whom? Everyone knows that over 1,000 nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea today are aimed at our Republic on a continuous basis. Patriot missiles and Apache attack helicopters which were introduced from the United States recently are now deployed in the central frontline sector near the Military Demarcation Line. At the same time with the deployment of these weapons, U.S. Defense Secretary Perry came to South Korea and returned home after reaffirming on the spot the preparedness for attack by U.S. forces and the South Korean puppet army. Such being the situation, traitor Kim Yong-sam's behavior is too shameless. What we cannot but see more seriously is that he urged the South Korean people to renounce their view on reunification, babbling that it is a dreamy one. This shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam's remarks that he would make every effort to achieve national reconciliation and reunification and to build a peaceful, reunified fatherland by uniting the divided fatherland into one are an out- and-out lie. This also shows that he is not interested in the country's reunification at all. Traitor Kim Yong-sam is a more vicious splittist and flunkeyist nation-seller than successive military fascist dictators. Next, as soon as he assumed the post of the puppet unification board, the rascal Yi Hong-ku held a so-called unification and security policy coordination meeting. At the meeting he clamored about sanctions against us at the UN Security Council, the international alliance system, and the like. Although he is the minister of the board, he completely revealed that he is a national traitor and splittist who, regarding the nation as an enemy, is driving the country into permanent division. As was already reported on 3 May, answering questions raised by reporters, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said that proceeding from our consistent position to show the irreproachability [kyolbaeksong] of our nuclear activities under the special position in which we have temporarily suspended the taking effect of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, we have not only decided to conduct the replacement of fuel rods this time thoroughly under the surveillance of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA], but also immediately issued entry visas for the five inspection members suggested by the agency. At the same time, we have made clear that all fuel rods replaced will be placed under the control of the IAEA and that measuring them will be permitted at a time when the nuclear issue is settled in a package deal at DPRK- U.S. talks in the future. This is an expression of our Republic's greatest generosity and sincerity. This is why the broad social opinion of the world positively appraises this proposal of ours and why it is urging the United States not to cling to pressure but to sincerely come to the table of the DPRK-U.S. talks. This notwithstanding, Yi Hong-ku is still taking a hostile attitude toward us by clamoring about sanctions, the cooperation system, and the like. This is indeed an antinational and antireunification crime. With regard to Yi Hong-ku's remarks that urged us to observe the Armistice Agreement while opposing our peace-guaranteeing proposal, it is not us but the United States and the South Korean puppets who has violated the Armistice Agreement. The peace in Korea has been in danger because the United States has been reinforcing its force of arms in South Korea for more than 40 years since the Armistice Agreement was signed, and because the South Korean puppets are perpetrating the new war provocation maneuvers together with the United States. Meanwhile, the present armistice mechanism can play no role in preventing a new war on the Korean peninsula at all. This is why we have put forward a proposal for a new system of guaranteeing peace. Nevertheless, opposing this proposal, the puppets are calling for us to observe the Armistice Agreement. This is indeed a reversed logic. All facts mentioned above reveal once again that the South Korean authorities are vicious splittists and bellicose elements seeking only confrontation and war. These rascals will receive due stern judgment from our people without fail.
