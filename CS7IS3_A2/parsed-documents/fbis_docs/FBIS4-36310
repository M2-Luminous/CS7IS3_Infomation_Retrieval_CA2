Barzani and Talabani held a meeting the day before yesterday in Irbil, capital of the Kurdish region. It is the first meeting since the armed confrontations broke out early in May. [passage omitted] The two Kurdish leaders' agreement includes three clauses: -- A total cease-fire in all areas, including the areas adjacent to the border with Iran in al-Sulaymaniyah Governorate (where Patriotic Union of Kurdistan militias clashed with groups of Kurdish Islamists) -- To form an operations room for the border areas, to consolidate the cease-fire there. This room should include representatives from Barzani's party, Talabani's party, the Unified Iraqi National Congress, the Kurdistan Front, and the Islamic Movement of Kurdistan. -- To hold similar meetings later to solve outstanding problems, fully normalize conditions, and eliminate the effects of last month's events in various spheres. Independent Kurdish sources believe that Barzani's and Talabani's meeting "was necessary to halt the Kurdish fighting." However, they warned of the eruption of "further clashes" in the future "if the two parties do not backtrack on their monopolization of power" in Iraqi Kurdistan "and reorganize conditions to form a (local) parliament and a government in which all parties are represented."
