In addition, visits by personnel and other kinds of exchanges have continued to increase. In the favorable situation of the further development in cross- strait relations, there unfortunately occurred the malignant criminal case of robbery, arson, and murder at Qiandao Lake at the end of March which killed 32 compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. I express my profound condolences to the murdered compatriots and my deep sympathy to their family members. Wang Daohan said: Leaders of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to the "Qiandao Lake case" after it happened, and the relevant Zhejiang authorities put in full efforts with an earnest and responsible attitude to crack the case. The criminals have now been arrested, and the judicial department will severely punish them in accordance with the law. Meanwhile, the relevant mainland authorities have properly dealt with the aftermath of the incident, taking into consideration the overall situation of safeguarding the development of cross-strait relations. The relevant mainland experts gave a detailed account to personnel of the Strait Exchange Foundation [SEF] and relevant Taiwan experts on how the case occurred and was cracked. In addition, they answered various doubts of the Taiwan side about the case and also arranged for Taiwan experts to visit the scene. This has demonstrated the mainland's sincerity in making the greatest efforts to explain the truth of the case to the Taiwan side. Wang Daohan said: After the case occurred, compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait shared the same sorrows and regrets, and Taiwan circles have also put forward many opinions and suggestions. We feel that in the powerful tide of thriving cross- strait exchanges and unstoppable economic cooperation, the "Qiandao Lake incident" was only an unexpected and unfortunate case of murder and that it should not affect the normal development of cross-strait relations. Furthermore, it should not be used by a small number of people with ulterior motives as an excuse to oppose the mainland, block cross-strait exchanges, and advocate Taiwan independence. The two sides of the Taiwan Strait should value the overall interests of the Chinese people and rationally, calmly, and objectively treat the case and various problems arising from it in the course of handling the incident, as well as earnestly draw a lesson from it. The mainland side will continue to tighten security controls to ensure the security of Taiwan compatriots who visit the mainland. Wang Daohan said: The successful convening of the Wang-Gu [Wang Daohan-Koo Chen-fu] talks one year ago has played an active role in promoting the development of cross-strait relations. In accordance with the agreements signed at the talks, the ARATS and SEF have established a systematic communications channel which has played an important role in enhancing understanding and mutual trust as well as in minimizing differences. With the continued development of cross-strait relations, it should be said that there are bright prospects for ARATS-SEF cooperation, and compatriots from the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are placing high hopes on the ARATS and the SEF. The two sides should further strengthen their communications channel, particularly in strengthening high-level contacts, increasing dialogue, eliminating misunderstandings, resolving differences, and promoting cooperation. Only with this can we comply with the wish of compatriots on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait and shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted by history.
