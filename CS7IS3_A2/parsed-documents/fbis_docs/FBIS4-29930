The YOMIURI SHIMBUN quoted a diplomatic source in Seoul as saying the proposal is a "two-stage comprehensive deal" in which the two countries would form diplomatic ties after North Korea cleared up international suspicions over its nuclear program. North Korean President Kim Il-song seemingly showed a more progressive attitude at his two meetings with Carter since he rated the proposal positively. The source was quoted as saying that in the first of the two stages, Washington would provide economic support and allow the establishment of representatives in each country in response to Pyongyang's remaining in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and accepting special and routine inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The economic support would include financial and technological assistance for North Korea's changing of heavy-water reactors to light-water units, according to the paper. The source said that in the second stage, after Pyongyang had accepted special IAEA inspections of two undeclared atomic facilities to allay suspicion about its nuclear development program, the United States would be willing to open diplomatic ties with North Korea, according to the paper. It is the first time for the United States to present a proposal that includes normalization of diplomatic relations with North Korea. The source said that Carter apparently put the proposal to Kim Il-song at their first meeting on Thursday. He speculated that Kim Il-song allowed the IAEA inspectors to stay in North Korea and mentioned his country's return to the NPT in response to the first stage.
