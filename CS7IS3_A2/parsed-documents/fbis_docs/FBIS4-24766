He told an extraordinary session of the DSP's central executive committee that he would quit his post at the party convention next week, the local press reported. Ouchi, 64, had been under pressure to step down and take responsibility for helping to create Kaishin. The DSP is likely to select its General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa as Ouchi's successor, the local press quoted party sources as saying. Ouchi, who is health and welfare minister in the government, has said he wants to concentrate on his duties in that post after formally quitting as party chairman. The DSP, Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) and three other parties formed Kaishin, an inter-party voting block, shortly after Shinseito leader Tsutomu Hata was elected prime minister on April 25 in succession to Morihiro Hosokawa. Kaishin, the brain-child of coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa, was viewed as the first step in a long-awaited political realignment in Japan. But the DSP, angry that Kaishin had been formed without its being consulted, quit the coalition and thus left Hata with a minority government.
