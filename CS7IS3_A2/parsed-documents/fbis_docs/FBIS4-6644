Kono, president of the major opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), said in a statement that the coalition ignores the people through its prolonged negotiations, and that the situation has already passed the permissible point. He said the coalition should have the courage to disband rather than conceal differences in policies. After the dissolution of the coalition, parties should again discuss policies and decide on a new government, he said. Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa announced on April 8 that he will resign over his alleged shady financial deals and delays in Diet deliberations on the fiscal 1994 budget. During nearly two weeks after Hosokawa's announcement of his resignation, the ruling parties have not chosen his successor due to internal power struggles and differences over key policies for a new cabinet. Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, head of the coalition's core party Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], is regarded as the most probable successor to Hosokawa. Kono also said Japan should have a "definite policy" before sending its finance minister to a series of international monetary meetings in Washington this weekend. On Sunday, finance ministers and central bank presidents from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations are scheduled to meet in the U.S. capital. The LDP president urged a speedy beginning to Diet deliberations on fiscal 1994 budget bills, saying the obstacles to debate disappeared now that Hosokawa announced he would step down. The coalition government submitted the bills to the Diet in early March, but the LDP insisted on discussing Hosokawa's financial transactions first and has refused to start budget debates. Kono said Hosokawa's questionable deals should be discussed further at a Diet committee, but not at the Budget Committee where the budget is tabled, noting that he will continue to be head of a political party, the Japan New Party. Hosokawa had been under fire over suspicions about shady fund-raising through a 100 million yen loan from a scandal-tainted trucking firm and a stock purchase.
