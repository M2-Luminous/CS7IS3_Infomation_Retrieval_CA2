FR940106-2-00004 FR940106-2-00003 Forest Service Environmental Impact Statement for the Mad River Water Withdrawal and Sugarbush South Snowmaking and Trail Improvement Project; Green Mountain National Forest; Towns of Warren and Fayston; Washington County, VT AGENCY: Forest Service, USDA. The Forest Service is the lead agency for preparing the Environmental Impact Statement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and U.S. Department of Interior_Fish and Wildlife Service are cooperating agencies. ACTION: Notice of intent to prepare an environmental impact statement. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service will prepare a Draft and Final Environmental Impact Statement to determine whether to authorize additional snowmaking capability and trail improvements at the Sugarbush South Ski Area as proposed by Snowridge, Inc. Authorization of the trail improvements and snowmaking would implement a portion of the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, approved on July 14, 1983. The proposed use and activities are consistent with the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest and the current Special Use Permit for operation of the Sugarbush Ski Resort. Authorization would require an amendment to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area so that the Master Development Plan identifies the water source for snowmaking and the schedule for water withdrawal. The Master Development Plan would also be amended to accurately show the approved trail configuration and anticipated development schedule. Sugarbush is a winter sports complex operated by Snowridge, Inc. and located on both private lands and National Forest System lands. There are about 2,100 acres at Sugarbush South, the area where this project is proposed. Of that 2,100 acres, about 1825 acres are National Forest System lands. The purpose of the actions proposed by Snowridge, Inc. is to improve the quality of winter sports recreation opportunities at Sugarbush South by installing snowmaking equipment and facilities that would provide coverage over at least 70% of the ski trails, and by constructing widening, and grading the trail system so that there is improved skier traffic flow and safety. Improved trail design would also offer a better mix of opportunities for novice, intermediate, advanced, and expert skiers. Additional snowmaking is needed because Sugarbush South currently has snowmaking coverage on only 38% of the ski trails. Natural snowfall is inconsistent and often inadequate during a typical Vermont winter. Predictable snow coverage is needed if Sugarbush is to consistently provide quality winter sports recreation opportunities, be attractive to skiers, and remain competitive with other major ski areas in New England. Increased snowmaking will also relieve skier traffic congestion problems and improve skier safety by providing more opportunities for skiers to disperse over many trails. Trail widening is needed so that snow grooming equipment can be used and to relieve ``bottle-necks'' where skiers merge. Trail construction is needed to improve inter-connections among trails, improve skier traffic flow, and increase the number of intermediate and advanced trails so that the variety of skier experiences available is better geared to families and groups made up of skiers with different ability levels. The proposed action is to: (1) Construct and operate a water withdrawal facility on the Mad River including a removable weir, a permanent Parshall flume and two intake structures; (2) Withdraw for snowmaking use an estimated 300&hyph;420 million gallons of water per year (the estimated average is 380 Million gallons per year) from the Mad River under a schedule which will prohibit withdrawals that would reduce flows to less than the February median flow rate (0.79 csm); (3) Construct and operate a 13-acre water storage pond located adjacent to the Mad River and having a capacity of approximately 55 to 60 million gallons; (4) Construct and operate pumping facilities adjacent to the water storage pond; (5) Construct a 15 foot wide, 1,800 foot long gravel access road from Highway 100 to the pond site; (6) Construct and operate about 3.3 miles of buried 16-inch pipeline to transport water from the storage pond to the snowmaking facilities at Sugarbush South; (7) Construct and operate a new snowmaking facility located in the vicinity of the existing vehicle maintenance shop. This is a building housing the pumps, compressors, and control system used for snowmaking; (8) Install approximately 90,000 feet of buried pipelines and hydrants along 24 trails at Sugarbush South and operate for snowmaking; (9) Use water from the Mad River source and the existing source on Clay Brook for snowmaking on an additional 157 acres of ski trails; and (10) Widen 24 trails, widen 2 lift lines, construct 6 new trails, and grade several existing trails. Total widening and trail construction will add 100 acres of skiable terrain. Both the Forest Service and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have decisions to make with respect to the proposal. The Forest Service must decide whether to authorize the project under the Special Use Permit and whether to approve amendments to the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must make a decision as to whether to issue a permit under Section 404 of the Clean Water Act to authorize the Mad River water withdrawal structures, holding pond, access road and fill.
