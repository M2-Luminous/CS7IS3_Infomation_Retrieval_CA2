The factory should also produce antipersonnel and antitank mines, he added. Helme explained that the factory could cooperate with the oil shale mining firm "Eesti Pdlevkivi", which intends to build an explosives factory for its own needs. The intended factory might also service and repair arms or produce weapons for Estonia's defence forces, he added. Cooperation offers have been received from Israel and South Africa. The production of ammunition would reinforce Estonia's international position, Helme stressed, but pointed out that the Baltic market would be insufficient for a larger factory.
