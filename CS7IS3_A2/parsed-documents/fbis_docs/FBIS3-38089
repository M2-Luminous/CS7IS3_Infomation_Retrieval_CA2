Oleg Soskovets told ITAR-TASS that the meeting focused on cooperation between the two countries to exploit offshore oil deposits. Norway has unique experience in this area and the future of the Russian generating industry lies precisely in this kind of extraction of oil and gas. A month ago, Russia and Norway signed a memorandum on cooperation in oilfield development. This is now being put into effect and a legal framework is being drawn up. Norway is interested in partnership with Russia and is planning close cooperation with it also as part of the European energy charter. Our interest is in management experience in oil and gas extraction with foreign investment, Oleg Soskovets stressed. Commenting on the outcome of his meeting here on Saturday with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn Godal, he said that Norway is closely following the reform process in Russia. The Norwegian foreign minister was told that no changes to the Russian government's reform policy are planned and that the reforms are irreversible. It was also stressed that Russia is in a special situation by virtue of its involvement in the CIS. This refers primarily to the credits for fuel purchases that Russia extends to CIS states because of economic and political circumstances. These credits are considerably more than the aid being planned by the G-7 and the IMF. This circumstance defines the specific nature of relations between Russia and the other CIS states, the first deputy prime minister emphasised. [passage omitted]
