Local market vendors, students and other businessmen showed up in front of the parliament to denounce the Thai Bunrong business consortium for the exhorbitant rents it planned to charge for use of a recently completed shopping mall. [passage omitted] Another group carried a banner proclaiming, "Students for Sam Rangsi," while others carried signs echoing the minister's recent call for "good investors to come" to Cambodia "and drive out the bad." The minister had backed local business groups in their protest against the Thai group. A representative of the Khmer Patriotic Youth Association said his group was at the gathering because the fight was not only for local interests, but also symbolic of defending national interests. [passage omitted] Thai Bunrong group chairman Theng Bun-Ma had published an open letter in a local paper, which his group owns, accusing Sam Rangsi of being a "low grade individual," and addressing him as "the Minister of Destroying Economics and Finance." [passage omitted] In his letter, Theng Bun-Ma further accused the minister of being ungracious, saying he should not criticise officials of the previous administration as he owed his presence in Cambodia to them. [passage omitted] Separately, elsewhere in the capital, military police tried unsuccessfully to evict a group of over 20 soldiers and their families who were squatting on state land which has been rented out for development. The heavily armed soldiers, loyal to the former military wings of the royalist FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Indpendent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party and the small Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party, threatened to defend themselves if they were forcibly evicted. "We have fought for many years on the battlefield and we are not afraid of dying here," said one soldier, brandishing a M-16 assault rifle. Police General Kong Saran, however, said the soldiers and their families had just arrived on the site Tuesday after having travelled from northwest Cambodia. A government official said he suspected there was "a political background to the issue," adding that the squatters might be part of a deliberate attempt to highlight the problem of the sale of state property.
