The Foreign Ministry spokesman also hoped that the U.S. Government will conscientiously keep its promise. On 16 May, a U.S. State Department spokesman issued a statement reiterating: It has been the United States' long-standing policy that Tibet is part of China. Neither the United States, nor any other countries, regards Tibet as a sovereign nation. The United States does not recognize a Tibetan government-in-exile. The Foreign Ministry spokesman said: "We appreciate this statement by the United States. We hope the U.S. Government will conscientiously keep its promise." The spokesman said: Everyone knows that Tibet is an inalienable part of China. Tibetan affairs are entirely China's internal affairs which do not tolerate interference by any other foreign countries. The spokesman reiterated: The Central Government's policy toward the Dalai Lama and his followers has been consistent and specific, and it has never changed. There have been avenues for contacts between the Central Government and the Dalai Lama's representatives. The door of negotiations has always been open. The spokesman indicated: As long as the Dalai Lama recognizes Tibet as an inalienable part of China, completely renounces the proposition for "Tibet independence," and discontinues the activities of splitting the motherland, the Central Government is ready to negotiate with the Dalai Lama at any time. Any issue, except "Tibet independence," is negotiable.
