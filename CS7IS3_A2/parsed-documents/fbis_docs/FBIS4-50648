Mainland assets worth more than three billion dollars have been squirrelled away in these firms, which also generate profits that go back into private pockets rather than to the state, they said. Hong Kong and Chinese financial watchdogs are impotent to combat the fraud, which is masked by a thick-woven web of personal contacts and exploits differing financial controls in the British colony and the Communist mainland. The fraud entails so-called "nominee" firms which are set up in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese. There are around 2,000 at present, either publicly listed or wholly privately-owned. Reliable sources in the Hong Kong banking world said many of these "nominee" firms had been loaded up with assets from some of the 50 Chinese state-owned firms which have now registered in Hong Kong and comprise seven percent of the market's capitalisation. "In my estimate, at least three billion dollars in assets have been swindled," a Japanese banking official, whose company has widespread business interests in China, said. The asset transfer goes via a so-called "backdoor listing," in which a shell company is set up by an individual, and then the Hong Kong-listed state firm buys into its capital and hands over some assets, such as factories, office buildings and land. In this way, the transferred assets become "joint ventures," a status that gives them big tax advantages in China and also protects them from being sold, should China ever decide to privatise its state sector. Profits from the venture are recycled into secret bank accounts, used for property or stock speculation in Hong Kong, or "reinvested" as share options in the nominee firm, sources said. A Chinese Communist official in charge of overseeing Chinese firms in Hong Kong said he was bitter and frustrated at the extent of the scam. "Money now rules these state-owned enterprises," he said. "They no longer think of the welfare of the party or the state." The sources said a core of figures, known as "taizidang," or princelings, was most active in the scam, many of them the offspring of party leaders and political chiefs surrounding paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, who opened up China's economy. Hong Kong financial regulators say they cannot interfere in the activities of these firms, as under Hong Kong law nothing illegal has been done because assets are on Chinese soil. Speaking for mainland businesses in the territory, Chao Suicong, vice chairman of the Chinese Enterprises Association in Hong Kong, said: "All our members have been approved by the state, and they follow Chinese policy and Hong Kong law." "So far, we haven't heard of any of our members stealing state assets." Despite this official serenity, the Chinese government is showing signs of deep disquiet at the scent of corruption and its dwindling stock of state assets. According to official estimates, cited by XINHUA news agency Sunday, cheap sales of state assets have cost the country 60 billion dollars over the past decade. The State Council, or cabinet, has now issued a circular tightening regulations governing transfer of state property, requiring all assets to be accurately evaluated and banning all transfers at an "unrealistically low price" or on credit. It also requires all sales of property by local state firms to be approved by city administrations above prefectural level, while deals involving large enterprises and those under central management must be forwarded to the State Council. The move intends belatedly to reassert central control over the behemoths, analysts said. State firms which have a listing in Hong Kong report not to their nominal ministry as other state enterprises do, but to their local governments -- a factor that has boosted regional political power as well as cronyism.
