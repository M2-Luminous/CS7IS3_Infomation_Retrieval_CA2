He said such trips might provoke a "flare up of political passions" in and around this semi-autonomous republic within Ukraine, even though "nobody wants to steal Crimea from Ukraine overnight", or infringe on the right of "the Crimean people to express their will in deciding the peninsula's status". Ukraine fears what it sees as an "unfavourable outcome" after the first round of the Crimean presidential elections on January 16 revealed that a candidate representing the pro-Russian circles was in the lead. Zatulin said Ukraine was unlikely to call off the second round of elections, a conclusion he drew after two days of talks with the Russian ambassador to Kiev and the Ukrainian ambassador to Moscow. "There is no danger that the second round of the presidential elections in the Crimea can be aborted", Zatulin said. However, as a precaution, the Ukrainian parliament last week voted for an amendment to the Constitution giving Kravchuk power to annul any decision made in Ukraine or its "Crimean autonomy" if it runs counter to Ukraine's Constitution, laws or presidential decrees. In other words, Leonid Kravchuk is authorized to veto an unwelcome outcome of the presidential elections in the Crimea.
