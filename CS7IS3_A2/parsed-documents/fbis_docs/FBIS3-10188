There is little to commemorate in the first real military NATO action, the consequence of which was the destruction of four Serbian fighter planes, besides the unprecedented characteristic of the event, and the fact that the Serbs now know that the ultimatums issued by the NATO in the name of the United Nations are backed by the force of weapons and the will to use them. The incident served to demonstrate that NATO will not hesitate to use its operational superiority to maintain the exclusion zones established by the UN peace forces free from air strikes. In other words, the determination of one of the parties to comply with the public threats it has made is now known. What is not known is how far the other party will go in this confrontation of wills. Since World War II the Yugoslav Armed Forces, made up mostly of Serbs, have prepared themselves for low-intensity war. This is what the Serbian militias have been doing in Bosnia, never engaging in a frontal battle against a superior enemy and never hurrying to close the siege. The policy followed by the Serbian leader in Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, is in keeping with this military doctrine. Even Russia expressed support for the NATO action -- without, however, condemning its traditional Serbian allies. Karadzic went to Moscow to hold a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev. They agreed to open as of 7 March the airport of the besieged Muslim city of Tuzla for humanitarian missions. Karadzic is playing the game well. He obeys the NATO ultimatum which had established that date to open the airport; has offered the Russians the chance to once again emerge as a decisive and essential player in any political-diplomatic arrangement in the Balkans; and at the same time he is telling his followers that it is yet not time to end the fight -- to the point that after the downing of the four Serbian airplanes Karadzic's militias bombed Tuzla, aiming at a hospital, a grocery store, an ammunition factory, and one of the landing strips of the airport. The downing of four Serbian airplanes boosts the credibility of President Clinton's foreign policy, but does not represent a guarantee that there is a solution at hand for the Bosnian problem. After two years of hesitation, the Western world powers agreed on something in imposing restrictions on Serbian forces. These restrictions, however, are mild, and do not stop the massacre or the taking over of territory, and much less do they guarantee free traffic for the UN peace forces in Bosnia. There is not enough basic will to impose conditions for a minimally fair and lasting solution to guarantee peace in Europe.
