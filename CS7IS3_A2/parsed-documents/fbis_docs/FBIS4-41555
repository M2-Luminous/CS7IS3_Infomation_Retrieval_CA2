Vice-President of the Kurchatovskiy Institute Ponomarev-Stepnoy told ITAR-TASS the theoretical part of the project is nearing completion and the first experiments will be carried out using simulators in a year or two. The project aims to develop a multi-tier system of nuclear plant protection with the help of which all radioactive emissions will be "trapped". Even if the worst happens and the reactor active zone melts as it did in Chernobyl, specialists are sure that the heightened radioactivity will never leave the boundaries of the reactor proper. The problem of safety in nuclear-power engineering is one of the most acute now when Russia is marking the fortieth anniversary of its first nuclear power station. In the first six months of this year, sixteen incidents were reported at nine Russian nuclear power stations (down from nineteen in the same period last year). If the world average emergency protection incidents are to be viewed as a unit, Russia's index equals 0.79. And although most of such incidents entails no irradiation or pollution of the environment, and the number of incidents is decreasing from year to year, researchers and engineers are far from resting on their laurels. Disruptions are unavoidable in principle in the operation of nuclear power stations, as in any technical system. This is why the main task is to minimise their effects. It is simply impossible to give up nuclear power engineering. The 29 nuclear power units in Russia provide approximately 13 per cent of all the electric energy consumed in the country, its share being 25 per cent in central Russia, more than forty per cent in north-western Russia and up to 70 per cent in the Kola Peninsula. Russia is now carrying out a set of measures to ensure greater safety of its nuclear power plants. Many of them are being modernised, new equipment is being installed, including simulators to upgrade the skills of the operators. At the beginning of the twenty-first century many units which will have exhausted their resource by then will have to be shut down and dismantled. This refers first of all to the Leningrad and Kursk power stations, where the Chernobyl-type reactors are being used, and the Novovoronezh and Kola nuclear power stations, which use the water-water reactors. Vice-President of the Rosenergoatom concern Yevgeniy Ignatenko said in an interview with ITAR-TASS that a new generation reactors will replace the old ones, including on fast neutrons. A special decision will have to be made every time, proceeding from the price of the reactor and its effectiveness.
