"We do not tolerate dogs of war," he told reporters during an election campaign swing through the southern Orange Free State. Mr Coetsee was reacting to earlier radio reports which quoted UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi as saying thousands of South African troops were aiding Angolan Government troops in the north-east of the country. Mr Coetsee said any SADF [South African Defense Force] members tendering their services to Angolan Armed Forces were in contravention of the Defence Act for showing allegiance to a foreign army.
