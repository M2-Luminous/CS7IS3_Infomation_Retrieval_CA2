[Begin Kozyrev recording] We are against the use of aircraft, and we have a proposal that the use of aircraft should be forbidden in the strictest terms in all conflict areas. In particular, we were among the initiators of the adoption of the resolution on a flight-free zone, i.e. on the nonuse of aircraft in Bosnia. Hence, whichever side used these aircraft, it has to proceed from the assumption that full responsibility lies with the violator of, in this case, the Security Council resolution. Certainly this episode is yet more evidence that the road in Bosnia should lie not in the escalation of violence, in the use of aviation etc., but only in looking for a political settlement.
