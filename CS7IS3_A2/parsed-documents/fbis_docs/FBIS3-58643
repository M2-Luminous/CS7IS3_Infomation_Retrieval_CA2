It cost the former U.S. secretary of state many sleepless nights (and an even bigger belly) after the Yom Kippur war to achieve the disengagement of the Israeli and Syrian troops on the Golan Heights. Kissinger had to shuttle seemingly endlessly between Damascus and Jerusalem. He had to fight for every centimeter in order to wrest the signature from the two enemies. Clinton now planned to write history in a single afternoon. That he honored the Syrian president by spending five and a half hours with him was no direct gain for peace but, for the time being, only for Al-Asad, whose country is still on the State Department's list of terrorist states. It will not be easy to figure out what result was achieved. Al-Asad wraps himself in ambiguous silence. What he allegedly said the world only gets to know from U.S. sources. Al-Asad himself made the following statement: If Jerusalem "has sufficient courage to react to this kind of peace, a new era of security and stability will emerge in which normal, peaceful relations will exist among all." The U.S. diplomacy described this immediately as a success, because the word "normal" is the magic formula for which Israel has been waiting for such a long time. As is common practice in Middle East diplomacy, Israel's first reaction was demonstrative reservation. They want to know what "normality" means, and whether Al-Asad can define the term himself. So far, only Clinton has said that it means open borders, diplomatic relations, and free trade. Those who know the rules of the game may assume that Al-Asad will only provide more information once Israel takes another step. One week ago, the head of government, Rabin, sent an equally cryptic signal: "So far I have only mentioned a withdrawal from the Golan -- and not from the entire Golan." No changes are planned in this respect, he added. "Yet when the question arises, we must discuss it." During the weekend -- if talks are resumed -- the Israelis and Syrians should tell each other in Washington what they really mean. At best, these talks will produce a verbal minuet: "If normalization, then withdrawal in principle" (in Hebrew) and "if withdrawal, then normalization in principle" (in Arabic). In practice, this will probably take a decade: Alternately a little withdrawal, a little normalization. Clinton wants to accelerate this procedure by offering U.S. peace troops for the Golan. If Congress should approve that, Clinton would personally become the broker and guarantor of peace. This risk is even higher than the reverence he paid to Al-Asad in Geneva.
