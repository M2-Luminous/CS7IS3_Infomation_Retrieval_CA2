The embassy officials have said that they are not prepared to start a debate on the Montreux Agreement just because of the accident. However, they also said that they are prepared to help Turkey on matters related to the traffic in the straits. Embassy officials have announced that they will not make an official statement on the incident. Nevertheless, it has been ascertained that the Russian diplomats have discussed several points on the Bosphorus in the assessments that have made thus far. They are as follows: 1. The accident is the result of development. Traffic accidents claim the lives of many people every day. However, highways are not being closed down. In view of that, a single incident must not be allowed to create a state of confusion. 2. Russia is prepared to do everything it can to contribute toward the maintenance of safe passage through the straits in Turkey. Reconsidering the Montreux Agreement, which provides for free passage through the straits, just because an accident has occurred in the Bosphorus, is not necessary. Therefore, we are not prepared to reconsider the agreement. 3. A delegation arrived in Turkey in connection with the new rules and regulations on the sea traffic in the straits and the Sea of Marmara at the end of February. We will wait to see the outcome of its work in order to be able to make a careful assessment on the matter. 4. The question of traffic in the straits is not a Turkish domestic affair. It is an international matter. 5. Each and every vessel that traverses the straits contributes toward the safety of the traffic because the ships have to pay a certain fee to cross the straits. The funds that are raised in that way are used for the straits. 6. A debate is being held on how Azerbaijan's and Kazakhstan's oil will be transported to the Western countries. One of the options is to transport their oil to Novorossiysk in Russia. The oil will then be transported in large tankers through the straits in Turkey. However, considering the matter an "imposition by Russia" would be wrong. Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are independent republics. In view of that, they will have to decide. That is not a matter on which Russia should decide.
