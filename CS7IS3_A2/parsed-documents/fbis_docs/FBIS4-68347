Last year an attempt was made to unite the democratic left of Russia. This movement was headed by Lyudmila Vartazarova, the current chairman of the SPT [Socialist Labor Party]. Her personality is as out of the ordinary in the party milieu as it is mysterious. There were rumors to the effect that this female intellectual from Moscow, a doctor of economic sciences and a person from the "backwaters" of academia, was being paired as a vice president in the possible early presidential elections with Air Force General Rutskoy and then "general of the military-industrial complex" Yu. Skokov. The future elections may serve up some kind of surprise in her person. [Timofeyeva] Does it appear paradoxical to you that the motherland of "real socialism" has not produced an authoritative left-wing democratic party since the disintegration of the CPSU, actually, until now? The leaders of the giant party have gone to all kinds of quarters: Some went into commerce, some turned liberal, others--orthodox communists and nationalists, leaving the leftist idea an orphan.... [Vartazarova] This is not quite true. When after the troubled wait for a "paddy wagon" in August 1991 I decided to check who was still alive for thinking and for work, and who had not ultimately been "annihilated," I was happy to learn that there were such people even among the former party elite, for example, First Secretary of the Russian Communist Party Valentin Kuptsov. We tried to bring back the leftist idea and cleanse it of lies and mistakes together with him and other like-minded people. [Timofeyeva] What is the "leftist idea?" Is it social democracy or socialism, or perhaps social liberalism? [Vartazarova] Yes, in the broader meaning of the word. Everything that unites people around the ideas of justice, freedom and equality, democracy, and solidarity may be classified as the notion of the leftist idea, adding to it reinforcement of the regulatory role of the state in the economy and greater social protection for the people. [Timofeyeva] Your colleague and SPT cochairman, the historian and essayist Roy Medvedev, who was considered the domestic precursor of "socialism with a human face," distinguished between social-democrats, socialists, and communists as early as the stagnant 1970's. [Vartazarova] Of course, there is a difference between us. There are many leftist parties in Russia. With the exception of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, they are not all that big, and some number altogether three or four dozen people. The SPT of Russia is a liberal party emphasizing the issues of freedom and entrepreneurship. Pavel Kudyukin's United Social-Democrats advocate the idea of self-management socialism while sharply restricting the centralizing role of the state. [Timofeyeva] How are you, the Socialists, different from the Communist Party of the Russian Federation of Gennadiy Zyuganov? [Vartazarova] Unlike the Communists, we have socialism as our goal rather than communism. We consider relations that ensure distribution of the social product in proportion to the quantity and quality of socially necessary labor, rather than on the basis of the need to be just. We come out in favor of a socially oriented mixed economy and do not believe that the market is a concession of the period of transition. Both economic pluralism and the market are features of socialism. However, in view of the fact that modern production calls for a considerable concentration of material and labor resources, we have a preference for various forms of collective ownership. This makes it possible for the members of the labor collective to act as co-owners of their enterprise. Unlike the Communists, we do not maintain that class solidarity is the only one: It is merely one of the types of solidarity. Besides, we do not have a preference for the ideas of patriotism over the ideas of internationalism, but see them in their harmonic integrity.... [Timofeyeva] How do your principles of justice and equality go along with freedom and democracy? Will you be able to strike a balance between them? [Vartazarova] There is the notion of "solidary responsibility." This is when you are free to do everything you like but in the process should relate your actions to the interests of those around you. I like a particular parable on which I reflect continuously. A man went out to hunt in the mountains. A misstep caused an avalanche which destroyed a hut and claimed the lives of the people residing at the foot of the hill. The question is: Who is to blame? On one hand, it was his free choice and an absurd random occurrence. On the other hand, there were the grave consequences of this freedom, and the need to think about how our words may resonate. This is how the strategy and tactics of the SPT are structured--we walk on a razor's edge: between freedom and necessity, freedom and responsibility, law and morality.... [Timofeyeva] Your party is sometimes accused of excessive altruism, "eggheadedness," and the inability to put your best foot forward. For some reason, few people know that representatives of 19 parties with a socialist orientation from the CIS countries, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Poland, and Bulgaria gathered for your Fourth Congress...and that you held an authoritative international conference on prospects for the development of the socialist idea throughout the world.... [Vartazarova] This is true, we did not engage in self-promotion. However, we did not set this goal, either. We did what we considered necessary. We are now busy with our own business. We have developed and adopted a new party program, and prepared a program for urgent measures to stop the crisis in the country, "New Priorities--the Negotiating Process--Crime Security," and forwarded it to the Duma. We will try yet again to gather all democratic left-wing forces, this time at the Second Congress.... [Timofeyeva] What about your participation in the future presidential campaign? There have been rumors that they saw you as a vice president together with Rutskoy, and then with Skokov. [Vartazarova] This is the first time I have heard of this. Our party conducted negotiations with the Civic Union; we joined the Coalition of Civic Forces, one of whose tasks was to achieve accord in our society. However, this idea quietly passed away later. Subsequently, we negotiated with Yuriy Skokov about forming a centrist movement in Russia, and I became a member of the Accord for the Motherland committee in September 1993. Unfortunately, this committee also gave its soul to God.... This is it. Our party may support someone running for president, but only after we familiarize ourselves with his program and come to know him well. We will not select a pig in a poke.
