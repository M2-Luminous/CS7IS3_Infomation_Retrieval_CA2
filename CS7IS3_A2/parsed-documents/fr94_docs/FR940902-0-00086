FR940902-0-00086 FR940902-0-00010 Summer Youth Employment and Training Program Subpart G of part 628 covers the Summer Youth Employment and Training Program (SYETP under title II&hyph;B, effective with calendar year 1994. It reflects the policy of closer integration for youth between academic fundamentals (such as reading and mathematics) and work requirements. A number of commenters raised issues related to the SYETP authorized under title II&hyph;B. Several commenters requested broad flexibility in the scope of the objective assessment and ISS required for summer program participants. Some expressed the fear that these requirements will result in a reduction of the number of SYETP participants due to the increased burden on current staff. The Department recognizes that the achievement objectives and resulting service strategies for summer youth differ from what might be expected in the adult program and that the corresponding assessment processes would vary accordingly. Section 253(c)(1)(A) of the Act states that SYETP programs shall include objective assessment of the basic skills and the supportive service needs of each participant. The SDA may use school records on math and reading levels to determine basic skills. Similarly, the fully developed ISS, described in subpart E, is not required for a participant who is enrolled only in the SYETP, as is reflected in §628.515(b)(2). For those participants transferring to the year-round program under title II&hyph;C, the full objective assessment and ISS would be required. The results of any post-title II&hyph;B participation test should be used as part of the assessment process when transferring the individual to a program under title II&hyph;C. Within the limits imposed by any applicable state or local privacy laws or rules, SDA's are encouraged to make as much use as possible of existing information from schools and from title II&hyph;B participation in developing the full objective assessment for a transferring participant, as well as sharing available JTPA information with school counselors and other appropriate school officials. A few commenters addressed the inability of SDA's to provide the required basic and remedial education services without reducing the number of youth served or other services to youth. While this is a difficult tradeoff in some areas, the Department is bound by the emphasis in the amendments to provide educational services to participants. In some instances, it may be necessary to reduce the number of participants served in order to get high-quality experiences under title II&hyph;B. Coordination and leveraging of resources is recommended to allow more participants to receive educational services. In order to more closely conform to sections 251 and 253(a) of the Act, §628.701(a), on Program Goals and Objectives, is amended. The ``enhancement of basic educational skills'' is added to the list of possible SDA goals and objectives. Other additions include ``encouragement of school completion or enrollment in supplementary or alternative school programs'' and ``improvement of employability skills including provision of vocational exploration opportunities and exposure to the world of work, and enhancement of youth citizenship skills.'' A few commenters spoke of various difficulties involved with the determination and documentation of eligibility under the National School Lunch Act. Guidance on eligibility verification pertaining to the determination and documentation of eligibility under the National School Lunch Act will be developed in consultation with the Department of Agriculture and will be provided outside of these regulations. See the further discussion of this subject in the section pertaining to programs under title II&hyph;C. For the reasons discussed previously, in connection with eligibility for the education coordination grant program, the Department has determined that the criteria for eligibility, as they relate to the ``economically disadvantaged'' eligibility criterion and alternatives for in-school youth, should be consistently applied across programs under parts A, B, and C of title II of the Act. Therefore, in addition to eligibility for free lunch under the National School Lunch Act, the Department adds participation in a compensatory education program under title I chapter I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and in a schoolwide program, as specified at section 263(g) of the Act, to the criteria at §628.702 of the final rule. In response to commenters who raised the issue of the perceived limitation of 500 hours on the duration of work experience for youth and its effect on the summer program, the Department refers to the discussion of work experience that appears in connection with §627.245 and the fact that the limitations on duration of work experience are removed. Section 628.705(d), dealing with concurrent enrollment, is amended to clarify that 65 percent of the total number of title II&hyph;C participants shall have one or more barriers to employment. This is necessary because no such additional barrier to employment requirement exists in title II&hyph;B. The SDA must decide who is enrolled in title II&hyph;C programs from title II&hyph;B or elsewhere. A new paragraph (e) on follow-up services is added to §628.705. Section 253(d) of the Act requires that followup services be provided for participants if the ISS indicates that such services are appropriate. Title II&hyph;B funds may be used such follow-up services up to one year after program participation, including when this coincides with title II&hyph;C participation when determined appropriate during participation in the title II&hyph;B program and recorded in the participant record. All supportive services in section 4(24), except financial assistance, are included in followup services. Appropriate followup activities for title II&hyph;B participants include counseling, mentoring, or tutoring. Finally, with the enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, there were amendments to the program under Title II&hyph;B. The Department believes that these are important changes and wishes to call attention to them in this rulemaking process. Therefore, some of the statutory provisions have been directly included in this final rule at §628.
