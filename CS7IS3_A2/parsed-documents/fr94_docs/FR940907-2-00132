ACTION: Concept release. SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') solicits recommendations on the Commission's role in using the ratings of nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (``NRSROs''). Because of the expanded use of credit ratings in the Commission's rules, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to examine the process employed by the Commission to designate rating agencies as NRSROs and the nature of the Commission's oversight role with respect to NRSROs. DATES: Comments should be received on or before December 6, 1994. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to submit written comments should file three copies thereof with Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549. All written comments should refer to File No. S7&hyph;23&hyph;94. All comments received will be available for public inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room, 450 Fifth Street, N.W., Washington, DC 20549.

Introduction and Background In recent years, the credit ratings issued by agencies that are recognized as nationally recognized statistical rating agencies (``NRSROs'') have attained an increased level of importance within the context of the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission looks to the credit ratings issued by NRSROs in a variety of contexts, and for different purposes, to distinguish among various grades of debt and other rated securities. The increasing utilization of credit ratings as a component in Commission rules, in turn, has prompted a number of domestic and foreign rating agencies to seek NRSRO status. Currently, the Commission's rules do not define the term ``NRSRO,'' nor is there a formal mechanism for monitoring the activities of agencies that have been recognized as NRSROs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to issue a concept release soliciting comment on the appropriate role of ratings in the federal securities laws, and the need to establish formal procedures for designating and monitoring the activities of NRSROs. A. The Development of the Term ``NRSRO'' In 1975, the Commission adopted the uniform net capital Rule, Rule 15c3&hyph;1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which in part also incorporated the use of ratings issued by NRSROs in connection with certain provisions of the net capital rule. 1 Rule 15c3&hyph;1 requires broker-dealers, when computing net capital, to deduct from net worth certain percentages of the market value (``haircuts'') of their proprietary securities positions. Haircuts serve as a safeguard against the risks associated with fluctuations in the price of each broker-dealer's proprietary securities. Broker-dealers' proprietary positions in commercial paper, nonconvertible debt securities and nonconvertible preferred stock are accorded preferential treatment under the net capital rule, in the form of reduced haircuts, if the instruments are rated investment grade by at least two NRSROs. 2 The Commission did not attempt to define the term in the context of the net capital rule and, in using the term subsequently in other regulatory contexts, the Commission generally has stated that the term should have the same meaning as it does for purposes of the net capital rule. 3 1 17 CFR 240.15c3&hyph;1. See Adoption of Amendments to Rule 15c3&hyph;1 and Adoption of Alternative Net Capital Requirement for Certain Brokers and Dealers, Exchange Act Release No. 11497 (June 26, 1975), 40 FR 29795 (July 16, 1975). 2 See 17 CFR 15c3&hyph;1(c)(2)(vi)(E) (haircuts applicable to commercial paper that has been rated in one of the three highest categories by at least two NRSROs); 17 CFR 15c3&hyph;1(c)(2)(vi)(F) (haircuts applicable to nonconvertible debt securities that are rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs); 17 CFR 15c3&hyph;1(c)(2)(vi)(H) (haircuts applicable to cumulative, nonconvertible preferred stock rated in one of the four highest rating categories by at least two NRSROs). 3 See, e.g. , Rule 2a&hyph;7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, 17 CFR 270.2a&hyph;7 (the term ``NRSRO'' is defined to mean any NRSRO ``as that term is used in Rule 15c3&hyph;1.␣.␣.␣.''). B. Expanded Use of the Term ``NRSRO'' and Utilization of the Ratings Assigned to Securities by NRSROs Over time, the NRSRO concept has been incorporated into other areas of the federal securities laws and Congress itself employed the term ``NRSRO'' in the definition of ``mortgage related security.'' Pursuant to Section 3(a)(41) of the Exchange Act, which was added by the Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984, 4 a mortgage related security must, among other things, be rated in one of the two highest rating categories by at least one NRSRO. 5 Although Congress did not define what it meant by an NRSRO, its reliance on the term used in Commission rules is significant because it reflects a congressional recognition that the ``term has acquired currency as a term of art.'' 6 4 Pub. L. No. 98&hyph;440, §101, 98 Stat. 1689, 1689 (1984). See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(41). 5 In 1989, Congress added the term NRSRO to Section 1831e of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which prescribes the permissible activities of savings associations in defining the term ``investment grade.'' 12 U.S.C. §1831e(d)(4)(A). Under Section 1831e(d)(4)(A), any corporate debt security is not of ``investment grade'' unless the security is rated in one of the four highest categories by at least one NRSRO. 6 H.R. Rep.
