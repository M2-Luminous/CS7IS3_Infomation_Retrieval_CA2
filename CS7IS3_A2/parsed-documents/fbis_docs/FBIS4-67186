He noted that the counternarcotics effort is an urgent, long-term proposition. According to Wang, despite some successes during the past three years, cultivation and trafficking of drugs have not been eliminated, and Xinjiang has seen the number of counties and cities with a drug trafficking problem increase from 40 to 53. In addition, traffickers have become better organized and developed more extensive networks, and their methods have become increasingly devious. Therefore, Xinjiang must improve its counternarcotics propaganda, and the region will focus its counternarcotics effort on cases involving large sums of money, trafficking routes and hubs, and deeply-involved criminals. At the same time, Xinjiang will counter scattered and sporadic trafficking, uncovering traffickers through patterns of drug use and destroying underground trafficking networks. Wang also stressed the development of a counternarcotics responsibility system involving the registration of drug users.
