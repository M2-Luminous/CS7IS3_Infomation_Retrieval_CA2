Perez de Cuellar appears to embody a growing search for an alternative to Alberto Fujimori. Yet underneath Perez de Cuellar's growing electoral popularity other things are happening. The most important are perhaps the simultaneous appearances in the M&O poll of Fernando Belaunde, with 16 percent, and Alfonso Barrantes, with 10 percent of voters' preferences, while between 29 and 31 percent of those polled preferred to remain undecided rather than voice support for Fujimori. Some clear conclusions may be drawn from the latest polls, especially from that of M&O and earlier ones conducted by Imasen. The first is that party figures have improved their standings, but not to the point of being perceived as alternatives. Yet no one should minimize the 16 percent obtained by Belaunde, simply through hard work, province meetings, and statements, with very few televised appearances. Another lesson is that in a clean election, Javier Perez de Cuellar -- if he wants to -- would be the next president. The preference of voters in Lima has gone beyond rational estimates, and to this extent it has eroded the argument that his popularity could collapse during a hectic electoral campaign. We are entering ground similar to that held by Fujimori in 1990, or to that of the no-vote in 1993. Another evident lesson is that Fujimori continues to lose in Lima, which has been his stronghold, and therefore he would also be losing his position as leader in the first round in 1995. Some people claim that Fujimori expected this loss, and that it will be compensated for through votes that will be recovered in key provinces. Yet these provinces still appear to be mobilized against him rather than for him. The unusual sight of leading foreign and domestic businessmen trading their own as well as state assets is not exciting Peruvian voters. On the contrary, it appears that such trade is perceived only as something that is happening while jobs and salaries continue to decline. No one is associating the expression "social expenses" with the word "job." Going back to the polls, it is no longer surprising to note that while Fujimori maintains his popularity, the voters' preference for him has declined. The people want Fujimori to reach 1995, but not 1996. The fact of the matter is that now that the elections are 12 months away, the figures that count now are those concerning voters preferences, not popularity rates. In other words the electoral campaign is, already in its initial stage, worsening the power vacuum that forced Fujimori into military tutelage. Someone might say that we have already had a military coup. The fear persists, however, that Fujimori may want to use the force of arms to compensate for his loss of popular support. Thirteen days before the second anniversary of the Fujimori-Hermoza coup, this thought can only be worrisome.
