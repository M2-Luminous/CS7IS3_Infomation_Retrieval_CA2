Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington peace talks, will hand these proposals to the Israelis today. This source disclosed that the proposals, on which agreement was reached after the Palestinian leaders met on Sunday and Monday, include: First, disarming the Israeli settlers and allowing an international presence [tawajud dawli] in the self-rule areas. In a message to Israeli Prime Minister Rabin, which 'Urayqat will deliver, 'Arafat pointed out that these proposals are in line with the Declaration of Principles agreement. He said that the Cairo agreement provides that the Israeli army will protect the settlements while the Palestinian police will be responsible for security in the self-rule areas. The source said that 'Arafat's proposals did not specify the type of international presence, UN forces or observers, but was content with the phrase "international presence." The Palestinian source said that the second proposal requests restructuring certain settlements that are close to Palestinian population centers or those where extremist Jews live, such as the Netzarim settlement near Gaza, which 'Arafat proposed merging with the Gush Qatif settlement in south Gaza and Qiryat Arba' in Hebron. 'Arafat also proposed that Palestinians purchase these settlements. The Palestinian source noted that the third proposal requests Israel stop expropriating Arab land and building new settlements. He pointed out that 'Arafat has become convinced that the current crisis between Israel and the PLO can only be solved through direct dialogue between them, not by bringing other parties into the crisis. He said that intensive diplomatic efforts are under way in Cairo, Washington, and other capitals to convince both parties to reach a compromise and return to the negotiating table.
