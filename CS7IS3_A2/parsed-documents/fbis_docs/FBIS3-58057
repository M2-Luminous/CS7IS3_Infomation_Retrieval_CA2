After his meetings yesterday with the major parties, Ciampi this morning met with delegations from the Network, Green and Communist Refoundation parties. In the afternoon, after a working lunch with the director of the International Monetary Fund, Ciampi will receive representatives from the Italian Social Movement, Sudtyroler Volkspartei [South Tirol People's Party] and Union Valdotaine [Valdostan Union]. The traditional government parties yesterday urged Ciampi to stay at his post and delay a vote until combined European Parliament and early elections can be held in June, while most of the smaller opposition parties, as well as the Left Democrats, the Northern League and the Italian Social Movement want elections as soon as possible. The no-confidence motions were submitted by Federalist Party leader Marco Pannella and were signed mostly by members of the four governing parties -- Christian Democrats, Socialists, Social Democrats and Liberals. The premier's resignation in fact would prevent the president from dissolving parliament until a new coalition cabinet is formed.
