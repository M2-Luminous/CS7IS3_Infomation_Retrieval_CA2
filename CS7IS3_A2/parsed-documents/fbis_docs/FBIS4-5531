Noting that the international situation now demands the bonds of friendship and solidarity be further strengthened between the two parties and two countries striving for national independence and independent development of the country, he expressed the belief that the delegation's current visit to Korea would make a new contribution to the development of friendly relations between the two countries.

He noted that they learn a lot of things from the great leader President Kim Il-song, the most distinguished man in the present time.
