An informed Egyptian source has confirmed that U.S. diplomats have been persistently exerting pressure over the past few months during several meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo and Washington to form a new committee in the People's Assembly to deal with human rights. The source said that the discussions revealed that the notion goes beyond the concept of human rights to what the Americans term the protection of the minorities' right to hold religious rites and to protect religious freedom in Egypt. Egyptian officials rejected the U.S. ideas because of their inherent dangers threatening the Egyptian people's single national fabric and the sectarian seditions they might inflame, particularly since religious rights in Egypt are already protected and waves of terrorism and bigotry are threatening all Egyptians without exception. Groups in the United States have tried to exploit the Dayr al- Muharraq incident in an attempt to incite international public opinion against what they termed the persecution campaign against Copts in Egypt and to demand international protection for the Copts on the pretext that the government is not protecting them and not bringing those who attack them to trial. Coptic leaders in Egypt have rejected these attempts and His Holiness Pope Shanudah III issued a statement stressing that Egypt's Copts are not a minority and he does not want any party to label them as such. He said that the Copts are part of Egypt's national fabric. In an interview with AL-AHALI, the pope stressed that the cohesiveness of the homeland's sons is a guarantee of stability against terrorism. The crisis resulting from the minority rights conference -- which the Ibn-Khaldun Center for Development Studies is organizing in cooperation with the London-based International Society for the Protection of Minorities' Rights -- continues to create problems. The Sudanese and Iraqi governments have told the Arab League, through private channels, that they are opposed to discussing the problems of the Kurds and south Sudan at the international conference scheduled to be held in Cairo next month while the international coalition forces are undertaking what they term the protection of Kurds in northern Iraq. This undertaking in fact threatens Iraq's territorial integrity, while the Iraqi people remain under siege. Khartoum has also protested the presence of John Garang in Cairo and the discussion of the south Sudan issue at an international conference. In a last attempt to save the minority rights conference, Dr. Sa'd-al-Din Ibrahim announced that the issue of Egypt's Copts has been removed from the agenda and that the conference will be amended by adding peoples' rights to minority rights. According to AL-AHALI's information, UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd- al-Majid, and Egyptian Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa will not, as previously announced, attend the conference or send messages to it. AL-AHALI's information also confirms that many of those invited to attend have turned down invitations to attend, send papers, or participate in its sessions.
