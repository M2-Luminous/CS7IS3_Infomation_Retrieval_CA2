"The president is waiting for an authorised assembly to be established, to which he will deliver his authority," said presidential spokesman Abdul Aziz Morad. Morad rejected demands of rival faction leader Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar that Rabbani must resign at the end of June, saying the president's legitimacy rested on the Kabul grand national assembly held in December 1992. The establishment of a transitional government to settle the two-year-long Afghan factional power struggle, which has been proposed by a peace commission based in the western provincial capital of Herat, had Rabbani's support, Morad said. However, he said there was no contradiction between the power of the president and the power of the proposed Supreme Council to be set up in Herat. "The president's authority is totally separate from the authority of the Supreme Council," stated Morad. The proposed Supreme Council would set up an interim government which, within nine months, would pave the way for convocation of a grand assembly, itself responsible for drafting a constitution and deciding on the future leadership of Afghanistan. It is to this grand assembly that Rabbani is most likely to transfer his authority, should it ever be convened, but as Hekmatyar has threatened more military action if Rabbani does not resign by June 28 the chances of the peace process working appear slim. Neither Hekmatyar nor Rabbani have announced their intention of attending the Herat conference yet. The prime minister wants a "preliminary" meeting in Kabul first while the president would go "if the necessity existed." Kakojan Niazi, a spokesman for the Herat-based peace commission, said it was hoped a meeting between Rabbani and Hekmatyar representatives would take place in Kabul, in order to thrash out details of the proposed Herat peace conference. In the capital Sunday -- a public holiday in observance of the Muslim religious anniversary of Ashura -- there was little military activity, although locals reported continued fighting between the Shi'ite Harakat-e Eslami faction and Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami in south Kabul.
