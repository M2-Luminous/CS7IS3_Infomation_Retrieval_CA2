FBIS4-41392 "drsov122_b_94005" FBIS-SOV-94-122 Daily Report 22 Jun 1994 RUSSIA NATIONAL AFFAIRS Political Issues Shumeyko, Rybkin Interviewed on Elections Shumeyko, Rybkin Interviewed on Elections LD2206182694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1531 GMT 22 Jun 94 LD2206182694 Moscow INTERFAX English BFN [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by Nikolay Zherebtsov and Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir Shishlin] [Text] Presidential aide Georgiy Satarov has said the idea of extending the tenure of office of both parliament and president, proposed by the speaker of the upper house - the Council of the Federation - Vladimir Shumeyko is not new. Satarov told IF [Interfax] Wednesday morning that back a month ago, when President Yeltsin met with the group of State Duma members called the "December 12 Liberal-Democratic Union", State Duma member Irina Khakamada asked Yeltsin about his attitude to the idea of extending parliament. Satarov said the President replied he was not against that "on the condition the State Duma and the Council of the Federation proved effective". That idea has been discussed as a possibility in professional circles for a long time", Satarov said. The presidential aide said that when I. Khakamada asked the President about the idea of prolonging his own term of office, Yeltsin replied: "Don't touch the 1996 elections, please". Satarov said he would not comment on the President's statement. The presidential aide believes that if the idea of extending powers gains the upper hand, amendments to the current Constitution will most probably be made through a referendum. "However, the subject of holding the referendum will remain open until both houses of parliament have approved of a law on the referendum", Satarov said. In an exclusive interview granted to Interfax on Tuesday Shumeyko said it would be expedient to postpone both presidential and parliamentary elections for two years. The speaker of the upper house said he had discussed that with the President, who, Shumeyko said "does not object in principle to prolonging his tenure of office". "He (Yeltsin) sees this as a normal way out, because what the country needs today is a period of stability", Shumeyko said. According to Shumeyko the speaker of the lower house, the State Duma Ivan Rybkin is for that proposal, too. "Members of parliament are politicians", the speaker said. "Once a person becomes a politician, he must decide whether to go on with his or her political career. If politicians know their term is about to expire, they will keep the forthcoming elections in mind whenever they walk to the speaking stand. We should be concerned about different things now, about the state. We have put Russia on the track of reform and the first stage of reform ended on December 12 1993. Now we must take care of fostering the state". Shumeyko recalled that the Constitution had established a four-year term for both houses of the Federal Assembly, whereas the first Council of the Federation and State Duma were elected for a transitional period of two years. "Why should there be a transitional period of two years, and not four?" Shumeyko asked. He believes it would be enough to amend the second section of the constitution ("Final and Transitional Provisions") to double the term of the first parliament. Shumeyko said the first two chapters of the Constitution could be altered in no way other than calling a referendum, whereas the others could be amended by parliament. "The Constitution does not specify how the second section can be changed", the speaker of the upper house said. "Since nothing definite is stated, the legal practice requires the general procedure, that is a referendum. The referendum would be far less costly than new elections". Shumeyko said that if the first Federal Assembly were extended alongside the presidential term (1996 elections would then be canceled), the period of stability in Russia may last 2-3 years. The speaker of the lower house of the Russian parliament told IF on Wednesday one should be very cautious about the idea of extending the powers of parliament. "We've got to show the people we are worthy of the extension", Rybkin said. The State Duma Speaker said neither house of the Federal Assembly was as efficient as necessary yet. He said that the country still had no budget and "some politickers seek to capitalize on that". Rybkin said he was referring to those who had earlier worked in the government and then took senior posts in both houses of parliament. Rybkin even ventured the guess it would be reasonable to re-elect parliament as early as next year. "The people, aware of their bitter experiences, would elect totally new people", he said. Interviewed by IF earlier, Rybkin said the idea of extending parliament and the president would be realistic under three conditions: "if the economy develops signs of stabilization within the next two or three months; if an appropriate legal network is formed, and if both houses of the Federal Assembly prove efficient". "These pre-requisites seem to be in the making and the march of events looks constructive", Rybkin said. He added he would be happy about the extension of both parliament and the president provided all the mentioned conditions were met.
