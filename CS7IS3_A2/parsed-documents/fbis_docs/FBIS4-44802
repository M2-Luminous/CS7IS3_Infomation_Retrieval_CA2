To shore up their positions, suppliers have just joined forces in GO-EDI, an information exchange club created under the aegis of SimproFrance. Suppliers of EDI (electronic data interchange) products and services have just teamed up in a club christened GO-EDI (EDI providers group). Their goals are to share information on how standardization is progressing, to adapt their products more rapidly, and analyze the market both in France and abroad. Participants include Axime Ingenierie, BT France, Bull, IBM/CGI, EDS, General Electric Information Services, and Transpac. "Those seven players account for 80 percent of the market," reckons Christrophe Viry, head of EDI studies at SimproFrance. Consulting Is Half the Market "This resolutely open club, which will not tolerate any form of bureaucratese, has been created to help boost your EDI sales," wrote Bernard Stoven, secretary-general of SimproFrance, to market players. The EDI market, which SimproFrance estimates at 425 million French francs [Fr] in 1993, is having real trouble getting off the ground. SimproFrance counts between 90 and 120 suppliers, depending on whether distributors of software package are included. Over 8 out of 10 are based in Ile-de-France, where most of the demand is concentrated. In an apparent sign of a more mature market, many of the suppliers surfaced less than three years ago. In 1991, for instance, 30 new players came into the French market, or three times as many as the year before. EDI in France breaks down into three categories: consulting, bundled software, and valued-added networks and services (VANS). Consulting (studies of timing and feasibility) comprises the traditional business of helping EDI user companies lost in the thicket of standards, procedures, and products. SimproFrance has counted 55 firms, which racked up sales of Fr145 million last year, operating in this niche, which takes in both big consulting firms (Coopers & Lybrand) and small ones of fewer than five people. Examples include ABX Consulting (two people), Euroedi (3 people, Fr2 million), HB Technologies (3 people, Fr2.5 million), and Logcom (3 people, Fr1.5 million). Also active in consulting are the big software package or service companies such as CGI, Unilog, Sligos/Marben, Bull Ingenierie, EDS, Digital, and SG2, whose consulting work supports product sales. "Of the 55 companies that do consulting, only 30 are not tied to a bundled software or value-added services line," notes Christophe Viry. Thirty companies offering 45 products in France racked up sales estimated by SimproFrance at Fr100 million in 1993 (for 5,659 units sold) in the second component of the EDI market, software packages. Four companies control over half the sales. Polysoft, one of the oldest publishers in the market, wrote Fr4.8 million worth on 1,500 titles; General Electric Information Services markets 1,100 titles; Sedinov, created in 1988, offers 800 titles; and Transpac and its EDI 440 line, which has been on the market since 1983, boasts 650 titles. Most of the bundled software has been written in France, with only 40 percent of it imported from abroad, mainly from the United States and Northern Europe. "And foreign products are not penetrating," observes Christophe Viry, who explains, "The Americans did not make the Edifact standard a priority, and most of their products, which are relatively old, still run on DOS. Their only aces are a competitive price and the availability of titles, which number in the thousands." There are many fewer players in the third area, VANS. Just 13 companies market 18 services. VANS is the stronghold of carriers (BT with EDI*Net, France Telecom with Atlas); suppliers of vertical services such as Bull/Athesa with Allegro for commerce, and Brio for building and public works projects; and software houses (Axime Service, SG2, Sligos). According to SimproFrance, the provision of such services generated sales of Fr200 million in 1993, for about 9,500 mailboxes. General Electric is still number one in VANS (one third of the market), ahead of Transpac (26 percent), and Bull (12 percent). Together, the three serve over 70 percent of all subscribers. On the demand side, the craze among French companies has a long way to go before it catches up to that of English-speaking or Northern European users. Comments Christophe Viry, "An EDI show there attracts at least a hundred exhibitors and 10,000 visitors, while in France it is hard to come up with 30 exhibitors and 2,000 visitors." On the supply side, the increasingly competitive environment has sent prices tumbling. The average cost of a product for PCs is Fr14,500, or 15 percent less than in 1992. In addition, the position of players has been made more fragile by the reliability and efficiency of products, which have squeezed regular earnings from consulting and assistance. The rise of both Windows (currently 20 percent) and Unix (50 percent) products is also making DOS versions (66 percent) shakier. Boxed Material: A 1994 EDI Product Guide SimproFrance, a public organization assigned to research and develop ways to cut costs and turnaround times in commercial transactions, has just published the 1994 edition of its "EDI Product Guide." The modestly-priced (Fr120), 160-page handbook features a series of standard forms showcasing the products of 62 firms. Products are divided into four categories: software packages, communications modules, value-added networks and services, and consultants. Each product is accompanied by a description, a statement of the company's marketing policy, prices, and persons to contact.
