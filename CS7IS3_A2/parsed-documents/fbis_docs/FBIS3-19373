Senem particularly stressed that he gathered his impressions during extensive meetings with people from Hakkari, Van, and many other places. This is what he said in short: "There is no election atmosphere or campaigning in most of the southeastern provinces." Lawyer Senem's impressions are similar to the ones gathered by Mehmet Bedri Gultekin, deputy leader of the Labor Party (IP) and candidate for the post of mayor of Diyarbakir, who toured Diyarbakir and a number of other cities in the region at around the same time. Gultekin told AYDINLIK: "A depressing atmosphere prevails in the region. People are afraid to talk about the issues. Their primary concern is personal security. Everybody is worried if he will be able to return home safely at night. The masses have been sidelined from politics; there is no debate on choices or any exchange of views." Ostensibly, they [the Turkish authorities] are opposed to the division of Turkey and, according to their claims, are doing their utmost to prevent division. What are they doing? They allocated almost one-sixth of the budget, that is 150 trillion Turkish lira, to procure arms, cannons, rifles, bullets, helicopters, warplanes, and radars. They have mortgaged Turkey's budget to the slogan "We will not allow division." It is calculated that 20 percentage points of the 70 percent inflation is due to military spending. The government acted with such devotion that it even threw the parliament into flames and reshaped it as the 12 March Parliament. The number of yearly unsolved murders stands at 150. The counterguerrilla has been given the tools to destroy society's moral fabric. The shadow a coup is getting thicker and hangs over the regime. And all this is being done to prevent the division of Turkey! Result: a geography of empty rural regions and cities with a flood of street vendors and people. We now have Diyarbakir, Batman, Bismil, and many other cities that are on the verge of population explosions and explosions of misery and poverty; we have mountains cleaned of villages, people, and forests. How fortunate that they are against division! It is fortunate that they have taken so many measures to prevent division! Imagine what would have happened had they been separatists! It is the free-market policy that is dividing Turkey. We have always been defending this truth. We always said that two different laws and administrations are in force in the two regions [western and eastern] of Turkey. Who can claim anymore that the state of emergency regime in the region is simply a temporary "emergency" measure? Millions of people have been under martial law and the state of emergency for the last 10 years. To put it figuratively, the existing economy-based division creates the same economic contradiction that one would observe between Greece and Bangladesh were they placed next to each other within the same borders. Now Turkey has entered an election atmosphere. The country's western part is vibrant with American-style shows, whereas there is no sign of this atmosphere in the east and southeast. "No election campaign is going on in most southeastern provinces." Any person traveling from Turkey's west to east could clearly see the minute-by-minute deepening psychological rift and the changing atmosphere. There is no need for further analysis! Now, even the elections are divided! There are elections in the west and only silence and indifference in the southeast! This is where the emphasis on a policy of violence has brought the country. The state can now watch its masterpiece with delight and pride.
