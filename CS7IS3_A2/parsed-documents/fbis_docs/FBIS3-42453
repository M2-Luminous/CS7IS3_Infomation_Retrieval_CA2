Antonov, candidate of military sciences and docent, Colonel (Rer) I. Shapkin, candidate of technical sciences and docent, and Major V. Gladkov] [Text] This method makes it possible to estimate the volume and effectiveness of camouflage measures. Calculation of the labor intensity of engineer camouflage measures, taking into account the specific conditions and the tactical situation at hand, is done by the formula: W=W[.sup]m[/]x(1-K[.sup]nc[/])-W[.sup]tsc[/], (1) where W[.sup]m[/] is the labor input (volume) of camouflage measures, in man-hours; K[.sup]nc[/] is the extent natural camouflage is used for concealing objects; W[.sup]tsc[/] is the volume of tasks carried out in the interests of the large unit (unit) by forces and assets of the senior chief, in man-hours. The extent of natural camouflage is used for concealing objects is determined by assessing the concealing properties of the terrain of the corresponding area according to a topographical map and calculating by the formula: K[.sup]nc[/]=N[.sup]obc[/]xK[.sup]cp[/]/N[.sup]tu[/], (2) where N[.sup]obc[/] is the number of objects concealed by natural camouflage; N[.sup]tu[/] is the total number of objects in the large unit (unit); K[.sup]cp[/] is the indicator of the concealment properties of the natural camouflage (Table 7.1). Table 7.1.

After making the calculations, the chief of the engineer service of the large unit (unit) must assess the effectiveness of the planned camouflage measures. The following are considered the basic criteria of effectiveness: Probability of detection of single and group objects; survivability of troops (objects). A tank, infantry fighting vehicle [BMP], gun, and so forth are considered single objects. One method of determining the quantitative probability of detection of single objects is according to a nomograph (Figure 7.1). The probability of detection of an object by aerial reconnaissance is determined depending on the type and conditions of conducting reconnaissance and the camouflage technique. Figure 7.1. Nomograph for determining Example. Determine the probability of detection of a tank in a pit camouflaged by local means on the terrain with a degree of cover of K[.sup]ct[/]=15 percent (determined according to a map) by aerial and photo reconnaissance from medium altitude. The course of accomplishing the task is shown in the nomograph by a broken line. As a result, the probability of detection is P[.sup]o[/]=0.65. Group objects such as a subunit, unit, or large unit usually become the targets of reconnaissance and destruction. For these objects, it is important to assess the effectiveness of engineer camouflage measures not only according to the probability of detection but also according to survivability. According to the nomograph (Figure 7.2.), the probability of detection and the survivability of a group object over time are determined depending on the time of the year, degree of cover of the terrain, and the nature of measures conducted for camouflage and fortification. Figure 7.2. Nomograph for determining Example. A motorized rifle unit occupied an assembly area that was prepared with fortifications. It was summer. The degree of cover of the terrain was K[.sup]ct[/]=20 percent. The equipment had been camouflaged with natural camouflage and standard screens; personnel were in dugout shelters. Determine the probability of detection (P[.sup]o[/]) and survivability (q) of the unit 10 hours after occupying the area. The course of solving the task is shown in the nomograph by the broken line. As a result, the probability of detection is P[.sup]o[/]=0.56, and q=0.8. After determining the method (technique) of camouflage and simulation, the chief of the engineer service makes the decision to involve units (subunits) to perform engineer camouflage and simulation measures. Subsequently, as part of the monitoring group he determines the completeness and quality of the tasks performed.
