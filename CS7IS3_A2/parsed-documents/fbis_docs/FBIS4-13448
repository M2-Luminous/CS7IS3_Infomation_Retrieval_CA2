During the meeting, the foreign minister received a message to President Hafiz al-Asad from South African President Frederik de Klerk. The foreign minister also received another message from Mr. (Korreth), head of the judiciary council in South Africa [title as heard], in which he invites President Hafiz al-Asad to take part in the celebration scheduled to be held on 10 May 1994 to inaugurate the new South African president. The talks dealt with developments in South Africa after the abrogation of the apartheid system and the racial segregation laws, and the establishment of a democratic system guaranteeing equality for all citizens in accordance with the new constitution. The talks also dealt with the Arab-Israeli conflict and developments in the peace process. In this regard, the two sides' viewpoints were in agreement on achieving a just and comprehensive peaceful solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict based on the implementation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and on Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan, the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and southern Lebanon. Auret said a peaceful solution can be achieved through the continuation of the peace talks, and not through acts of violence, deportation, and the Israeli authorities' demolishing of Palestinian houses in the occupied territories. He stressed that the stands of South Africa will be balanced, and that henceforth, its old relations with Israel will not be at the expense of its new relations with the Arabs. The talks during the meeting also dealt with the future prospects of the relations between Syria and South Africa after the abrogation of apartheid, and in light of lifting the Arab and international embargo on dealing with South Africa. The foreign minister and Mr. Auret expressed their mutual concern about establishing good relations between the two countries in the political, economic, trade, tourist, and other fields. Within this framework, the two sides agreed to resume contacts between the two countries until diplomatic relations between them are established. Attending the meeting were Raslan 'Allush, assistant to the foreign minister, Dr. Hani Habib, director of the Economic Department, and Mustafa al-Hajj 'Ali, director of the Africa Department at the Foreign Ministry.
