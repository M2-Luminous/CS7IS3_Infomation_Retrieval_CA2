Introduction Advanced technology has played a central role in bringing about the dramatic technological innovations witnessed in recent years. Technologies introduced into Japan from the United States and Europe clearly played a major role in Japan's economic development following World War II. Japan could never have attained its current level of prosperity without that technology. However, we are now being pressed to come up with ways of dealing with new issues such as technology-based frictions between the United States and Japan, and problems related to labor shortages, an aging society and environmental protection on a global scale. And to overcome these problems, it is vital that we not simply rely on the full mobilization of existing advanced technologies, but rather make technological breakthroughs, cultivate these new technologies and put them to the widest possible use. In this vein, the database constructed under the auspices of the Social Applications of Nuclear Technology Accumulation (SANTA) project, called the SANTA database, provides technology information services aimed at transferring nuclear technology to the private sector. This database was put together and is maintained by the Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute (JAERI), and contains advanced technological information on that portion of the results of JAERI's overall nuclear research and development efforts considered most likely to benefit society as a whole, and particularly, that information on those advanced nuclear technologies that could be utilized or applied in non-nuclear power industrial fields. Up until now, considerable technology developed by JAERI has been transferred to private firms operating in nuclear-related fields, but with the exception of radiation and RI technologies, very little of JAERI's advanced nuclear technologies have been put to use in non-nuclear power fields. But nuclear technologies comprise comprehensive science and technology systems that stand at the pinnacle of all science and technology fields, from the basic fields of physics and chemistry to electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and so on. And since nuclear technology is the systematic accumulation of many years of scientific and technological research, it can be put to use in a variety of different fields, and has value as a kind of quasi-public property that could not possibly be maintained by any individual private firm. Based on this kind of thinking, JAERI felt compelled to promote the use by the private sector of technologies that it has produced, and as one means of achieving this, constructed the SANTA database and is using this database to make its technology information widely available online. JAERI commissioned the Nuclear Data Center (NDC) to develop the SANTA database, construction of which was completed at the end of fiscal year 1992. JAERI began providing SANTA database services in April 1993 as one of the menu selections available with G-Search, an integrated database service offered via Fujitsu's nationwide network FENICS. In addition to the SANTA database, G-Search also offers newspaper/news article information, and has been providing Nuclear Code Information Service (NUCIS) database services for some time now. At the behest of JAERI, the SANTA database is currently being operated and managed by NDC, but inquiries concerning the technology information contained therein and/or requests for detailed documents and other materials related to that database should be directed to JAERI's Planning Office. 2. Database Contents Before explaining the contents of the SANTA database, I would like to discuss JAERI's ``Technology Catalog'' and the sources of the information contained in the SANTA database. The ``Technology Catalog'' was produced prior to the development and operation of the SANTA database, for use as both a PR publication designed to transfer advanced nuclear technology held by JAERI to the private sector and as a medium for introducing the various technologies available. This catalog is put together in an easy-to-understand fashion, and makes use of one A4 size page, complete with color graphics, for each and every technology introduced therein. Each such page contains the name of the technology, an approximately 400-word descriptive outline of the kind of technology it is and the special characteristics it possesses, plus anywhere from 2 to 5 photographs, graphs and/or drawings that visually portray that technology (Figure 1 shows one of the pages that comprise the ``Technology Catalog.''), and is compiled with other similarly configured pages to produce this technology-information catalog. Figure 1. A Sample Page from the ``Technology JAERI first began gathering together the data for producing this catalog in November 1990. JAERI made its Planning Office the secretariat for the data collection effort, and this office solicited pertinent technological data from research institutes and then sorted and arranged the data it received. Naturally, the technology data collected in this way was not limited to just that information that would be incorporated into the catalog, but rather included numerous other bibliographic data as well. This additional information comprised rather detailed data elements that supplemented and explained the contents of the catalog, as well as codes selected from among a list of classification codes that had previously been assigned to the various technology application fields to make it easier to retrieve related data. The SANTA database was constructed by arranging data elements comprised of the data gathered from various research institutes for incorporation into JAERI's original ``Technology Catalog,'' the rather detailed supplementary data and the retrieval codes. In the future, JAERI plans to solicit registered data twice a year -- once every six months -- and use this newly solicited data to keep the SANTA database updated. In addition to the titles, technology explanations and related graphics (drawings, graphs and photograph) titles and explanatory descriptions (photographs, drawings and other image data per se are not incorporated into the database) taken from the ``Technology Catalog'' discussed above, the data elements contained in the SANTA database consist of explanatory remarks that provide all-inclusive detailed explanations of the technologies, names of principal materials and devices, software titles, free terms, the existence of domestic patents and/or patent application numbers, the existence of foreign patents, the names of companies, universities and other related parties and their classifications for that technology developed jointly, plus the names and codes of JAERI divisions/departments/offices in charge of developing JAERI technologies, the names of the individuals in charge of that development, the year/month development was completed, and retrieval-facilitating codes specifying the technological fields, and old and new applications for the technologies. As technology codes, the SANTA database uses International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, which are internationally unified classification codes for patent materials. As application codes, the database makes use of Koiki Patent Classification (KPC) codes (``Koiki'' is Japanese for ``wide area'' or ``broad range''). These KPC codes focus on high-interest themes, and are used to supplement the IPC codes. And as codes for specifying new application fields, topical technology themes coded into fixed keyword formats are used to specify new technology fields that are difficult to retrieve using patent classifications, such as optical IC's, microcomputers, etc. KPC and fixed keyword codes are both being used as retrieval words in the Patent Online Information System (PATOLIS) provided by the Japan Patent Information Organization (JAPIO). In addition to the above items, the SANTA database also contains codes for services that JAERI can provide in order to transfer those technologies to the private sector, database management information known as ID numbers, and the date the data was registered and/or revised. The principal technology fields covered by the SANTA database include nuclear fusion, radiation measurements/control, operation and management of accelerators and nuclear reactors, nuclear reactor fuel and materials, radiation applications, nuclear reactor safety and environmental safety. These technologies can be put to use in a diverse number of fields such as pharmaceuticals, chemicals/foodstuffs, aircraft/railway car/automobile parts, chemical plants/electronic equipment/vacuum equipment and environmental fields such as water processing and emissions control. The database currently contains roughly 50 data elements on technologies such as silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fibers, biodegradable polymers and high resolution quadrupole mass spectrometer. The silicon carbide-based ultra heat resistant ceramic fiber discussed in Figure 1 above as a sample page of the Technology Catalog is a material with heat resistant and high strength functions produced as a result of research on radiation uses. The Research Development Corporation of Japan (JRDC) is continuing to test this technology and has plans for commercializing it in the near future. The next challenge for this technology will be to use the new fiber to develop a composite material of ceramic and a heat resistant alloy with enhanced heat resistant properties. If this can be achieved, then possible applications of this type of ultra heat resistant material are numerous, in everything from space planes and Japan's own space shuttle (HOPE) to nuclear fusion reactors, gas turbines for use in thermal power plants and jet engines. And once processing technologies are improved, this new material might also be applied to the construction of automobile engines, enabling the realization of ultra low fuel consumption automobiles, and thus contributing tremendously to protecting the global environment. 3. Retrieval Operations Retrieval operations for the SANTA database are menu driven, which means the user specified the type of data he wants to retrieve by selecting the appropriate retrieval item(s) from among a list of such items that is displayed on the menu screen and then selecting the output function to output the results of that retrieval operation. Two retrieval methods are available, one that uses free term searches and another that employs classification code searches. Free term searches enable the user to input words of his choosing to search through articles and indices contained in the database to retrieve data from six locations providing him with technology summaries, descriptions of Technology Catalog entries, graphics titles, principal devices names, principal material names and other keywords. Classification code searches are targeted at data elements stored as classification codes in database records, and require the user to input known codes and symbols to extract codes incorporating the matching data he is seeking and enable him to retrieve seven types of data including information on the existence of domestic (Japan) patents and technology codes, etc. Classification code searches require that the user know the classification codes beforehand. These classification codes include retrieval system menu-driven codes for carrying out searches to determine the existence or non-existence of domestic patents, to search related categories and to search for data on service provision methods. And for users who are not familiar with the contents of codes used to search for JAERI organizational codes and technology field codes there is a code reference function included on the HELP menu. The following is a typical example of a SANTA database free term retrieval operation that uses words taken from articles contained in the Technology Catalog to search out information on ceramic fibers. (1) Retrieval System Inputs (Figure 2) [1] Input menu item 2, ``Search for keyword under `catalog entry descriptions''' from the search item and process selection screen. [2] First, input the search word ``ceramics'' in full-size katakana in accordance with instructions given following the star symbol on the menu. [3] Inputting ``ceramics'' will initiate the search, and the number 8 will be displayed at the bottom of the screen, indicating that there are a total of eight data elements related to ceramics contained in the database. Figure 2. Retrieval System Input Example (2) Attaching Conditions to Searches (Figure 3) [1] Input 1 for ``Attach further conditions and search (AND).'' [2] Input 2 once again for ``Search for keyword under `catalog entry descriptions'.'' [3] When you input the search word ``fiber'' in kanji characters, the retrieval system searches for records related to both ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and displays a ``1'' at the bottom of the screen, indicating that one data element was found. Figure 3. Retrieval System Input With Conditions (3) Outputting the Full Text of the Technical Information (Figure 4) [1] The above operations have made it possible to retrieve technical information related to ``ceramics'' and ``fiber,'' and now it is time to output that information in full-text format. Using the same menu screen that was used to attach conditions, input ``P'' for ``Output search results.'' [2] A menu will be displayed asking you whether you want to ``Display title only'' or ``Display full text.'' At this time, input 2 for ``Display full text.'' [3] The next menu screen will ask you to specify the level of the output. At this point, simply hit RETURN, and the full text of the record retrieved via the above operations will be output and displayed on the screen. Figure 4. Specifying Full Text Output (4) Outputting Titles When you wish to output just the titles of the data you initially retrieved or of the data you retrieved after attaching conditions to your search operation, after inputting ``P'' for ``Output search results,'' input 1 for ``Display titles only.'' Next, specify the desired output level. If you wish to output all the titles contained in the data you have retrieved, simply hit RETURN. This will display all the titles. (5) Ending Retrieval Processing Pressing RETURN will return you to the output format selection menu screen. Next, input ``OFF'' to end database operations. This will return you to the previous screen, at which time you can continue to input ``E'' until you return to the G-Search top menu, or you can input ``T'' to return directly to the top menu. (6) Using the HELP Function The HELP function comprises seven menu screens. Four of these menu screens function to display lists of codes which serve as references for the codes used in classification code retrieval operations, such as technology field classification codes. Other HELP functions include those for menu-driven retrieval methods, a function for explaining output methods, a function for displaying the process involved in retrieval operations and a function for deleting temporarily maintained search result data. All these functions can be used as required. At present, SANTA database services do not include selective data provision services (SDI) nor services for distributing data via means other than online. However, for the time being, all costs related to utilizing SANTA database services are being born by JAERI. This means that users can avail themselves of SANTA database services, i.e. access and retrieve data, absolutely free of charge (but this does not include the charges for membership in the G-Search system). JAERI hopes that this will help promote the transfer of nuclear technology to the private sector by encouraging users to take advantage of SANTA database services. 4. Conclusions SANTA database online information provision services have really just gotten underway. Briefly put, the special characteristics of this database are the fact that it was clearly designed to provide technological information services aimed at transferring to the private sector JAERI-maintained advanced technology produced as the result of nuclear power-related research and development, and that it does so via simple, easy-to-use, small-scale retrieval operations that display full text data in Japanese, and all this free of charge to the user. Two technical tasks remain for the SANTA database. These are: 1) equipping the database with the capabilities of storing and providing online image data such as photographs and graphs designed to make the technological information being provided easier to visualize and understand, and; 2) enabling the SANTA database to link up with an as-yet-unfinished JAERI patent information database in order to better explain the contents of foreign and domestic patents covering the technologies registered in the SANTA database. However, even more important than tackling these tasks is the need to raise the recognition level of the SANTA database and get more users, both private individuals and corporate representatives, to utilize its services more often. And to accomplish this, it is vital to make the data contained in this database as complete as possible. That is, JAERI must promote its research and development efforts with renewed vigor so that more numerous technological data can be registered in the SANTA database, thereby making it a more complete database in terms of both quality and quantity. The point of contact for inquiries related to G-Search is Fujitsu F.I.P. (Tel: 03-3433-2251), and for inquiries concerning the contents and/or utilization procedures for the SANTA database is the section in charge of promoting nuclear power technology applications, Planning Office, JAERI (Tel: 03-3592-2102).
