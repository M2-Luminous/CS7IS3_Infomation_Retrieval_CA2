He is devoted to his work and a patriot to his service. Below are his thoughts on this service which he expressed in an interview granted in response to a request submitted by the editors. [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, if you do not mind, I will start off with an old humorous saying: "Firemen do nothing but fall into and out of snoozing." [Olkov] There is an element of truth in that saying. The truth is, it came about at one time in a rural area, where long intervals would pass before a fire would break out. People were lulled into a false sense of security, and firefighters themselves would become lax. However, someone eventually would take it into his head to "put the torch" to something, and a breeze would come along to help the fire burn down half a village. Today, a time of technical revolution, the situation is different. At one time, the means of starting a fire were a match or flintstone. Now, no matter where you go, there are these means: electricity, gas, fuel, oils. Just look at the numbers: There are 5.5 million fires occurring every year in the world; that is more than 500 fires an hour. In this connection, incidences of fire in industrially advanced countries are increasing by 5 percent a year, with the damage caused growing by 10 percent. People lose their lives. In the month of January in Moscow alone there were 34 deaths and 37 persons suffering burn injuries. [Altunin] It may be said that your service is highly involved with fires, what with fuel stored in depots and bases and highly flammable liquids present there. How do you cope with that? [Olkov] It is not easy. What we have is described by the words in the song: "We are standing on a rim of fire." We - firefighters and fuel people - are subjected to conditions peculiar to us. While most people can get along with putting out fires with water, we have in our inventory special apparatus and means, equipment to lift and deliver foam, foam generators, and various powders. In addition, we are organized differently. For example, take the mutual cooperation with firefighting teams of the MVD, activities which are governed strictly and responsibly in compliance with the respective orders issued by Russia's ministers of defense and internal affairs. Plans for combined operations also exist. It is quite a matter for firefighters to work in casemate tanks. They use special tools - ones that do not produce sparks. In the former ZakVO [Transcaucasus Military District], for example, why did a fire and then an explosion occur in a casemate? Safety rules were not observed. One enlisted man died, three suffered burns of various degrees of severity, and the fuel burned up. We are involved with lightning protection. To do this work, one must possess knowledge and know how to perform special calculations. But what can happen? Commanders, in their desire to "take their chances" in the good old Russian way, weld some pieces of a pipe together and stick it into the ground without much ado. This was the case in the ZakVO when lightning entered a casemate space to set off saturated fuel vapors, thus wreaking havoc on a fuel tank. We also provide static electricity protection for filling and draining devices, pipelines, and pumping and storage tank facilities. This also pertains to a fuel truck, which should drag a chain on the ground. [Altunin] Is there something new with which to extinguish fires? [Olkov] The traditional substances are the chemical and air-mechanical foam mixtures. At our recent training sessions held in St. Petersburg, we demonstrated the Shlem fire-extinguishing substance, a "light water" type, which is delivered by hose directed to the base of the tank, directly to the fuel layer. Combustion abatement of the kerosene in the 25 cubic meter tank started five minutes after inflammation (the same time required for firetrucks to arrive), with the flames extinguished in one minute. What is noteworthy here is that the new substance is simple, inexpensive, and, most important, the fluorine-containing foam is inert with respect to petroleum products, does not mix with the latter, is not contaminated by hydrocarbons, and does not harm the environment. [Altunin] How do you organize your work? [Olkov] We observe all the rules. We mount firefighting guards to provide a 24-hour watch; they maintain a log by entering into the latter all their observations and call out a firefighting team in the event a fire breaks out. If an occurrence is serious, they contact local teams and report to me. [Altunin] Have there been any serious occurrences recently? [Olkov] Knock on wood, no. Since I took over my post - in 1989 -there have been no major fires. [Altunin] How demanding are you of commanders in your inspections of fire safety in military units? [Olkov] We demand, without exception, that fuel depots and bases be equipped with fire warning systems; aboveground tanks, with stationary fire extinguishing equipment; and that firefighting teams be kept up to strength. Nonetheless, Minister of Defense Order No 450 presently in effect is often violated. Teams are made to do irrelevant jobs and trucks are used to deliver water for flushing drainage systems. There is poor supervision over manpower required for observing monitoring devices and checking on the condition of electric power systems. I tell you frankly that everything depends upon the commander. For example, Colonels A. Makarov and A. Kustov and Lieutenant Colonel A. Remeshevskiy took over facilities where there were many violations, but they soon took matters in hand such that their bases are in excellent shape with respect to fire safety. This cannot be said in the case of the enterprises commanded by officers A. Pobegayev and V. Bogatov. My subordinates and I accept no compromises in our inspections - that is the kind of service in which we are. All one need do is realize that a single spark is sufficient to start a flame, and a big one, at that! [Altunin] Does the Central Directorate's leadership support you in your demands? [Olkov] Absolutely. And in deed, not word. The directorate chief, among other things, remains constantly in strict compliance with the defense minister's order, which stipulates that fire safety constitutes a major criterion in performance evaluation. Any unit given the "unsatisfactory" rating is rated "unsatisfactory" in general, regardless of the ratings it earns in other areas of activity. [Altunin] Are there any problems? [Olkov] The principal one is that of understrength firefighting teams. The defense minister's order calls for at least 12 men per team, but some of them consist of only four. How much can be done with that kind of manpower? Putting out a "small" fire, perhaps. We are thinking about modern firefighting teams in garrisons and introducing alternative service (something which does not yet exist) - something must be done. [Altunin] Yevgeniy Pavlovich, now for the last question. Many servicemen have an automobile, dacha, or garage, and they constantly face a problem: Where and how to store fuel? [Olkov] I am fully aware of their difficulties; it is a fact that motor fuel prices are rising every month and everyone wishes to stock up. The men often store fuel in amounts you could not imagine. They forget about safety measures, and the consequences are fires. Just look at Moscow, at its fire-damaged balconies and burned-down garages; they are places where fuel is traditionally stored. The fire safety rules (PPB) strictly forbid the storing of fuel-filled containers on balconies, loggias, and in corridors. Storage in garages is permitted, but in amounts not exceeding 20 kg of motor fuel and 5 kg of oil in metal (never polyethylene) containers that are tightly sealed. It is forbidden to paint motor vehicles in parking areas or garages, refuel vehicles, wash parts in kerosene or gasoline, and dump used petroleum waste products into sewer systems or in the proximity of a garage. In the case of dachas and small houses located at small garden plots, fuel may be stored only in facilities so designated, with the metal containers tightly sealed, in amounts up to 10 kg. In this connection, it must be kept in mind that the use of gasoline in kerosene, Primus, and pressurized-kerosene stoves is strictly forbidden. The approved product is lighting-grade kerosene, which is sold in special outlets located in villages and rural settlements.
