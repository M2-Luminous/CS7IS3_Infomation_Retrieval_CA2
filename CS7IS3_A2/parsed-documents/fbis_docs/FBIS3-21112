Several proposals could lead to joint endeavors, mainly in civil aeronautics but also in the military domain... In the civilian sector, three new joint Europe-Japan projects (with or without American participation) are under consideration. By order of size and feasibility in time, they are: - the YSX regional transport aircraft, with a capacity of 70-80 passengers; - the future very large capacity aircraft (600-800 seats); - the second-generation SST (successor to the Concorde). The YSX project is dear to the hearts of the Japanese. Prefeasibility studies for this aircraft, which would take the place of the YS11, are being carried out by Japan Aircraft Development (a subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Kawasaki) with support from MITI [Ministry of Industry and Trade]. The Japanese have already held discussions with the Chinese on joint construction of the aircraft. In September 1993, a delegation from the Japanese Aeronautical Industries Group (SJAC) visited China at the invitation of its counterpart, the China National Aviation Industry Corporation (AVIC). The two entities agreed to promote exchanges between the two countries, and in particular to launch discussions on development of this 70-80 seat plane. The two Asian partners are also looking for one or two western partners. Possible candidates include Boeing, the Franco-Italian ATR, and Sweden's Saab. Boeing's participation would come as a surprise, since the American airplane builder dropped out of the regional aircraft market a little more than 2 years ago by selling off its Canadian subsidiary De Havilland. But Boeing has made Japan virtually a private preserve. The Japanese builders are closely involved in Boeing manufactures, particularly in production of the 767 and the future Boeing 777; the Japanese are junior partners in production of the latter, supplying a large part of the fuselage. Plus there is the forthcoming 737-X, which the Japanese selected after toying with the idea of developing their own 150-seat aircraft. If Boeing is ready to "get aboard" the YSX, it is probably just to keep an eye on what Japanese builders are planning with other firms. All the same, the Americans are taking it very seriously. Dean Thorton, president of Boeing Commercial Airline Group (BCAG), traveled to Japan in October 1993. He reaffirmed his company's interest in the YSX project and according to our information actually entered into negotiations with Japan about the program. Since January, the negotiations begun by Thorton have been pursued by Ronald Woodard, his successor as head of BCAG. Finally, it was learned a few days ago in the Japanese press that European builders ATR and Saab might participate in the program. These two partners would lend technical credibility and an extraordinary marketing base to this program, leaving Germany's DASA [Deutsche Aerospace] and its Fokker subsidiary out in the cold. Sources at Aerospatiale and ATR confirm the discussions now under way, noting that other partnerships are also under consideration and the question has not yet been decided. The two other civilian programs that might give rise to joint ventures with Japan are less far advanced. The giant 600-800 seat aircraft is the subject of discussions between European and American firms, which are going to meet in March to decide whether to pursue feasibility studies. If the project gets a go-ahead, it is clear the Japanese manufacturers will be participating. For two reasons: The first is that they are ready to contribute substantially to the financing--and lots of money will be needed. According to latest available figures, it would cost 90 to 120 billion French francs [Fr] to develop a super-jumbo aircraft! The second argument for Japanese participation is the fact that Japanese airlines comprise most of the estimated 500-plane market for jumbo carriers. It is difficult to imagine Japan Airlines or ANA opting for such an aircraft if their country were excluded from its manufacture. It is always possible, however, that European and American builders will decide not to work together. In that event, they would be fighting to cut a deal with their Japanese partner. About a year ago, Airbus Industrie made some overtures along those lines to Japan. Boeing did not appreciate it. There remains a third domain of possible cooperation between western firms and the Japanese: the second-generation supersonic transport. The Japanese are very excited about the Concorde's successor, especially the technological potential of such a program. Kawasaki, Mitsubishi, and Fuji have joined the American-European study group working on the feasibility study. This SST would carry 250-300 passengers and have a range of 10,000 to 12,000 km traveling at twice the speed of sound. It would thus go twice as far as the Concorde and carry twice as many passengers. But no one knows whether the fare would be half as expensive. According to Boeing, for success to be assured, the average fare (all seating classes combined) for a supersonic flight could not be more than 20 percent over the average subsonic fare. In this domain, the Europeans have the advantage of all their technological experience with the Concorde, while the Japanese have the financial resources and desire to work in the most advanced technologies, and the Americans have a fierce determination not to let Europe continue enjoying a monopoly in this field! Besides the benefits presented by cooperation in civil aeronautics, Japan also has enormous potential in the military domain. Little by little, Japanese military defense spending has steadily grown. It has now even outstripped France's [military] budget, one of the largest in the world. With the recession, Japan has slowed down the growth in its defense spending, which is virtually pegged to Gross Domestic Product). The military budget each year is equal to about 1 percent of GDP. For fiscal 1994, the Defense Agency's budget is equal to about Fr250 billion (4,730 billion yen), up 1.95 percent over 1993. The Navy fares best (up 3.5 percent) in the current budget, since Army spending has increased only 2.9 percent and the Air Force is suffering a 2.8 percent cutback. Japan's commitment to self-reliance in arms manufacturing presents certain opportunities to European and French industries. That explains the initiative of 20 French enterprises that sent a mission of 30 engineers to Tokyo late last year as part of a delegation led by GIFAS [French Aeronautics and Space Industries Group]. The purpose: to introduce the most advanced French technologies and persuade the Japanese to quit thinking of the United States as their only possible industrial partner. In the field of helicopters, for example, Japan will soon be facing two important decisions. The first concerns a medium-size transport helicopter eventually to be equipped with rocket launchers. Eurocopter is offering the Cougar, to be built in partnership with Kawasaki, which if the deal goes through would build it in the archipelago under license. The competition is Sikorski, which in partnership with Mitsubishi is offering the Black Hawk. A decision is expected in March 1994. The order could be for as many as 40 of the craft. Helicopter Market The other major decision concerns the OHX observation helicopter, 100 of which are to be built. This would be a helicopter designed and manufactured entirely in Japan, with Kawasaki as prime contractor and engines provided by Mitsubishi. Many French outfitters are competing to equip the Japanese craft. Sextant Avionics, in partnership with a Japanese licensee, would be among the best placed to succeed. In general, French industry is following closely the efforts of Japanese industry to break free of reliance on the Americans. The latter are chary--and we would be no less cautious--about turning over their technology, and they intend to continue keeping a close eye on new Japanese developments. This is the case too in the domain of warplanes. In the FSX program, the airframe is being built in partnership with Lockheed and the engines in partnership with General Electric. GE has agreed to let Ishikawajima Harima (IHI) manufacture the F110 GE engine under license, but the US Government and Congress have refused to lift restrictions on some technologies incorporated into the engine. Mitsubishi has completed fabrication of the first left wing built entirely of composites. Lockheed is building the right wing. Japan is also working on countermeasures for the FSX. Besides its own electronic defense system, the Japanese craft will benefit from protection provided by a specialized aircraft. This is the F-15 J, which would carry an ultra-powerful countermeasures system (using active-antenna radar) in a nacelle housing. Overall, Japan's technological needs will continue growing. Anxious about the nuclear threat posed by North Korea and the increasing power of China, Japan cannot afford to lower its guard. Numerous psychological and juridical obstacles must still be overcome before Japan plays a more active role in the Asian region. Indeed, as recently as last December Keisuke Nakanishi, director general of the Japanese Defense Agency (and quasi-defense minister), was forced to step down because he was a little too quick in calling for revision of the 50-year-old law that determines Japan's defense posture. He wanted Japan to be able to respond pragmatically to the demands of the post-Cold War period. But in the meantime there's nothing to stop Japan from developing areas of excellence in defense electronics and space technology. So its advances and innovations will need to be followed attentively.
