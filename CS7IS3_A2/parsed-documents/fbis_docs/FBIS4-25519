Zhou Nan made the statement while meeting and feting key personnel in charge of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants Association [CCSA] which is the largest organization of government functionaries in Hong Kong. He said, "When handling issues on government functionaries, including their appointment, promotion, welfare, and remuneration, the Chinese Government will strictly abide by relevant provisions of the Basic Law. There will not be a so-called `major reshuffle' let alone such an issue as `settling accounts afterward'." Zhou Nan expressed his hope that the Hong Kong Government functionaries will make more contributions to serve the society, ensuring a smooth transition of Hong Kong in 1997, and to safeguard Hong Kong's long-term stability and prosperity. Meanwhile, he also hoped that the CCSA will further exercise its influence in this regard, and will continually unite the broad masses of government functionaries so that they will retain their posts and continue to serve in Hong Kong after 1997. Speaking at the banquet, Zhou Nan commended the CCSA for its continuing efforts to fight for the rational rights and interests of government functionaries for a prolonged period, and affirmed the CCSA's contributions to Hong Kong society. He also indicated his appreciation for the CCSA's stance that government functionaries should be "apolitical" and for its practical, steady, earnest, and responsible work style. CCSA leaders commented on the CCSA's celebration of its 80th founding anniversary in 1994. They also expressed their views on issues including government functionaries' pension saving fund, their appointments and working conditions, their localization issue, and their transfer to another administrative system.
