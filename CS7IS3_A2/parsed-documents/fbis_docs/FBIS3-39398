The above is stressed by the International Association for Protection of Human Rights in Cyprus. The association adds: The report ignores the decisions of the United Nations and other international organizations regarding the Turkish invasion and the illegal pseudostate. It also ignores the decisions of the Council of Europe's Committee on Human Rights, which in 1976 and 1983 decided that Turkey was guilty of mass and continuous violations of the Greek Cypriots' human rights in the occupied part of Cyprus. In substance, the association notes, the State Department's report recognizes the division of Cyprus as permanent, gives legal status to the Turkish Cypriot "administration" and indulgence to the Turkish troops, deceives on basic issues and distorts the facts against the Cypriot people. Especially on the pseudostate, there is reference to "free elections" and respect of "human rights." The association also stresses that the report becomes even more scandalous if one bears in mind that it follows similar reports in past years, and the fact that the real events were always very well known. The inaccuracies and distortions of previous reports have been pointed out by a delegation of the association to the U.S. Embassy in Cyprus in order to avoid a repetition in future reports.
