Dr. Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister, said this when he submitted a report on the Washington agreements to the Croatian Parliament's Chamber of Deputies. Here is a report by Jasminka Dudic: [Dudic] With the Washington agreements we are entering a new era of relations with the world. It is our view that we have real prospects and guarantees that we will in future resolve our aspirations and difficulties with the help and support of the international community. The doors to inclusion in both the Council of Europe and the EU, entry into the Partnership for Peace initiative, and financial support from the world are opening for us, Dr. Granic said. After recalling the road of the Croatian president and of our foreign policy which led to the Washington agreements, Dr. Granic stressed that the path ahead of us will not be simple and that now, in the negotiations on the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia- Herzegovina, the Serb side should also be included. Speaking about the resolution of the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the reintegration of the UNPA [UN Protected Area] zones, Dr. Granic also said: [Begin Granic recording] We have firm guarantees that the sanctions, the possible alleviation of them, or even their substitution will be and will remain a crucial means for achieving a just and satisfactory solution both in Croatia and in Bosnia- Herzegovina. In other words, sanctions will continue to remain in place as a punishment but also as a stimulus and as a signal to the Serb side, in other words to Belgrade, that this is now an exceptionally favorable moment for the achievement of a global solution and for a new leaf to be turned. [end recording] [Dudic] The Croatian signature on the Washington documents is an expression of the continuity of Croatian state policy vis-a-vis the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the legitimate aspirations of the Croat people. However, on the consequences of the unpreparedness of the international community to put a stop to the Serb aggression and ethnic cleansing, Dr. Granic said: [Begin Granic recording] These have led to phenomena of the exacerbation of the circle of distrust and a conflict of interests even amongst the victims of the Greater Serb aggression. The violation of international and war law, which has occurred on both sides and which further deepened tensions, should not be forgotten either. Serious clashes took place between members of the Croat and Muslim Bosniak nations, and these became ever more destructive both for the relations between these two nations and also for the future of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a state, for the unity of the Croatian nation, and for the position of the Republic of Croatia in the world. In the struggle against the Serb aggressor, the Croat nation in Bosnia-Herzegovina developed its own armed forces as well as its own institutions of power in the form of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, and it expressed its awareness that future resolutions of its position must be developed, starting from the principles of full respect for its sovereign will in those areas where for centuries it has been the majority population. The Republic of Croatia was not able to remain indifferent to the other sides in respect of the ever more explicit danger for the whole of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [end recording] [Dudic] The foreign minister also dwelled in detail on the strategic importance of the agreements and documents signed and said, among other things, that the preliminary agreement starts clearly from the separate identities of two states which do not intend to rush into the immediate creation of a confederation, but go for cooperation in the economic and defense fields. The Croatian leadership will persevere in its policies to achieve the reintegration of the UNPA zones, in other words the peaceful option, but, Dr. Granic stressed, we cannot accept the continuation and intensification of the current situation for the forseeable future. He repeated Croatian demands connected with changes to and the greater effectiveness of UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]. He also stressed that in future we will link the process of the normalization of relations with the FRY with progress in the process of the reintegration of temporarily occupied territory into the overall systems of the Republic of Croatia. At the end of his address, Dr. Granic once again recalled that the basic aims of our overall policy -- including our foreign policy -- remain unchanged and that in this process we are remaining faithful to a firm orientation toward Europe. A debate on the report on the Washington agreements is under way in the Chamber of Deputies.
