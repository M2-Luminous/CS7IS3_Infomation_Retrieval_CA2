It was founded by three financial institutions. The Bank of China is the principal shareholder. Along with it, blocs of second-rate shares are held by the most significant members of the Bank of China group in Hong Kong and Macau--Jincheng and Xinhua. The Bank of China owns 100 percent of the stock of the latter banks; therefore, it is possible to assert that the Moscow institution is a subsidiary bank of the Bank of China in Russia. The statutory capital of Elos comes to $10 million. Mr. Du Wan You, vice president of the Bank of China in Moscow, observed self-critically that "by Russian standards, we are a small bank." However, the potential of the Chinese institution in Russia hinges on two factors. Direct relations with the Bank of China are the first factor. The bank was founded at the beginning of this century. Although it remained in quite a lamentable condition until the end of the 1970's, by the end of 1992 the Bank of China came to rank 19th in the world. The Bank of China has 448 foreign branches in the main financial centers of the world with a staff of more than 16,000. Correspondent relations have been established with more than 4,000 banks in 150 countries of the world. A few hundred banks maintain relationships with the Bank of China on the basis of the continuous mutual transfers of funds. The Bank of China in Moscow operates in close contact with the head office, amounting in fact to its branch in Russia. This makes it possible for Mr. Du Wan You to say that his bank would transfer monetary funds to any point in the world within one to three days, depending on the time zone. Active commercial relations between the two countries are the second factor strengthening the position of the Bank of China in Russia. Suffice it to say, the Bank of China (Elos) is the only Chinese financial institution in Russia. Out of a multitude of Russian banks, only the Foreign Trade Bank operates in China at present. The Bank of China is owned by the state. For this reason, it now operates within the framework of Beijing's official policy, which is geared toward expanding the trade in Chinese products in Russia in every way possible. Mr. Du Wan You stressed: "As a bank, we must generate profits. However, our main objective is to solve the problem of bilateral settlements and facilitate economic cooperation." This is understood full well in the Russian power structure, which explains the ease with which the Bank of China obtained all the necessary licenses in April of last year." [quotation marks as published] Chinese companies and trading firms have become the main clients of the Bank of China in Moscow. Elos has already begun extending credit to Chinese legal entities. At present, the Central Bank of Russia is considering the issue of performing ruble-to-yuan conversion operations. There are virtually no Russian firms among the clients of the Bank of China. At present, Elos accepts deposits in U.S. dollars and effects currency transfers and exchange. A special subdivision exists that provides consulting services aimed at finding partners in the Chinese and Russian markets. In the long term, the Bank of China intends to embark on investment, fiduciary, and leasing operations, as well as operations with securities. As of now, the Bank of China has established correspondent relations with two dozen Russian banks. Mr. Du Wan You noted the quite warm attitude toward the Chinese bank on the part of Russian commercial banks. In his opinion, market adaptation is proceeding quite successfully. Thirty people work for the Bank of China in Moscow, of whom only 10 are Russians. This circumstance, which is rare in foreign banks, explains a certain delay in the development of services. The management of the bank continuously notes that at present its employees are mainly getting used to the Russian market and studying it. In particular, a lack of knowledge of the situation hinders the beginning of credit extension to Russian firms. For the time being, the Bank of China is not planning to open branches in other cities of Russia for the same reason. In principle, it is necessary to open branches in St. Petersburg and the Far East. However, this is not expected in the foreseeable future. At present, the Bank of China has a representative office in Kazakhstan.
