Therefore, it is expedient to prolong the state of emergency regime in several districts of the region, expiring on March 31. "The Russian peace-keeping force is the main security guarantor in the region," the president claimed. There are various opinions on the state of emergency regime in the North Ossetian official quarters and among multinational population of the republic, ranging from its repeal to preservation and extension, provided the temporary administration is transformed and functions of subordinated to it military units are changed. This issue will be debated by the North Ossetian Parliament next week.
