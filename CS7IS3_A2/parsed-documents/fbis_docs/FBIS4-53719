The opening was initially planned for after the nuclear problem was solved. However, business firms from seven Western countries, including England, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong, not to mention China, have concluded investment contracts with North Korea. This was confirmed on 20 May. North Korea expressly stipulated in the relevant laws and regulations concerning the opening of the special zone that it would guarantee the free passage of ROK nationals and ROK cargo. Besides, North Korea asked China to include 10 representatives, from different spheres of ROK business firms that advanced into China, in a 50-member Chinese economic delegation that will visit North Korea late this month. Thus, North Korea was positive in inducing investment of ROK capital and technology. According to this, the ROK Embassy in China on 20 May advised each ROK firm that advanced into China to actively prepare for their advance into North Korea by taking advantage of business collaboration with Chinese enterprises. Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the North Korean External Economy Commission in charge of the external opening policy, visited China last month. He conveyed the master plan on the opening of Najin- Sonbong zone to the Chinese Government, and asked for China's cooperation. Following this, representatives of the Najin-Sonbong zone exchanged a protocol with representatives of Hunchun City, Jilin Province, China, on 6 April on concrete agreements between the two sides on the opening of the zone. According to the protocol of agreement obtained by TONG-A ILBO, North Korea and Chinese authorities agreed to jointly develop the Najin-Sonbong special zone and the Hunchun-(Jiaohe) District in China, which is adjacent to Najin-Sonbong zone, into visa-free entry and tariff-free international free trade zones, and to conduct joint-ventures in essential facilities, including ports and roads. The two sides also agreed that the Chinese capital invested in the zones will be compensated with the interest earned by the operation of the zones and with marine products. This protocol noted an additional article on the passage of ROK nationals and ROK cargoes into the Najin-Sonbong zone, stating that "South Korea is included." According to a North Korean source in Beijing, after the exchange of the protocol, the North Korean side dispatched to China Sok Hui-hyon, director of a department in charge of external opening, and conveyed a concrete plan stating that "in the event that ROK personnel from a China-ROK joint-venture firm wants to visit the zone, an invitation will be extended to him if a request is forwarded 15 days prior to his visit so that he can travel freely to the zone." The North Korean side has already discriminated between the residents who are permitted to live permanently in the 746.2 square km special zone from those who will be sent to other places. North Korea moved from Pyongyang 600 new households of residents with a strong party spirit into this zone. Meanwhile, North Korea informed the Chinese side that it will allow the establishment of field liaison offices from seven countries, including China, in the Najin- Sonbong zone, and will open on a full scale the passage of foreigners and foreign cargoes in Najin and Sonbong ports starting in June, when construction of buildings in the wharfside is completed.
