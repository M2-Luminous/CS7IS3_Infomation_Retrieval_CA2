Inscriptions for the steel eighth company from Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, and Zhang Zhen were read at the meeting. Zhou Ziyu, deputy director of the People's Liberation Army [PLA] General Political Department, presented a copper horizontal board engraved with the words "Steel Bastion in the South Sea Outpost" to the company on behalf of the three General Departments. A general order of the military region party committee conferring a first-class merit citation on the company was also read at the meeting. In his speech, Chi Haotian, Central Military Commission [CMC] member, state councillor, and defense minister, first extended warm congratulations from the CMC and three General Departments to the company. He said: The steel eighth company has grown to maturity under the kind concern and assiduous training of the party Central Committee, the CMC, and older-generation proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao met cordially with the company's representatives to National Day celebrations on six occasions. CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin, during his inspection of the Zhuhai Special Economic Zone on 24 June 1990, wrote an inscription for the company. Recently, CMC Vice Chairmen Liu Huaqing and Zhang Zhen also penned inscriptions for the company. In the past three decades, the company has lived up to the expectations of the party Central Committee and CMC, always preserving and developing the army's fine traditions and constantly strengthening its construction in an all- around manner. It has stood erect at the outpost in the South Sea with a healthy image of mighty and civilized troops and made important contributions to safeguarding and building the special economic zone. Chi Haotian said: Currently China is at a crucial historical juncture. We must seize the opportunity, deepen reform, open up wider, promote development, and maintain stability, wherein lies the overall interests of the work of the whole party and whole country. The PLA, as the pillar of the people's democratic dictatorship, must serve and be subordinate to these overall interests by carrying out the sacred mission of safeguarding national security and ensuring safe milieus for reform, opening up, and modernization. In the face of the heavy responsibility entrusted upon us by the times, all army officers and men should foster a steel conviction and will toward the cause of the party and army. The steel eighth company's spirit reflects precisely and vividly such conviction and will. Energetically displaying the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the "64-character" pioneering spirit put forth by chairman Jiang Zemin, the company has always acted like a steel knife whose blade cannot be turned both during the years of war and socialist construction -- invincible when assaulting or defending against fully armed enemy forces; determined and never wavering in the great cause of reform and opening; and rejecting corrosive influence and never tainted by offensives of decadent ideas and sugarcoated bullets. So long as we develop the eighth company's spirit, we will be able to adhere to the party's basic line for 100 years and steadfastly advance reform, opening up, and the socialist modernization drive; and will be able to carry out difficult and rigorous training for crack troops and continually improve their fighting capability to meet combat requirements. We must learn from the steel eighth company's advanced experience and develop its noble spirit, and must strive to turn the PLA into a stronger and more modernized revolutionary regular army. In his speech, Xie Fei, member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Guangdong provincial committee, lauded the eighth company as heroic troops with a glorious tradition. He said: The steel eighth company epitomizes the PLA's feature in our times, demonstrating that the people's army is an invincible and civilized army. The company's footprints symbolize the army's exploits, showing that the people's army not only had an illustrious yesterday but has continued to and will create a brilliant today and tomorrow. He urged local governments to emulate the company in further promoting the building of socialist spiritual civilization and the development of reform, opening up, and modernization. In his speech, Shi Yuxiao, Guangzhou Military Region political commissar, called on all commanders and fighters of the military region to learn from the eighth company; to arm their minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics; to inherit and carry forward the army's fine tradition of hard struggle; to always bear in mind the army's fundamental duties; to train hard for tough military skills; to strive to strengthen the construction of party branches; and to mold a "fighting bastion." Leaders of Guangdong Province, the Guangzhou Military Region, and Guangzhou and Zhuhai cities attended the meeting.
