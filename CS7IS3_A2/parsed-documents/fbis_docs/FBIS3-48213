The ministry will finalize the system by June and present its proposal to the National Assembly in autumn for introduction next year. Businesses with more than five employees must join the national pension scheme. Contributions of 6 percent of wages are shared by the employee (4 percent) and his employer (2 percent) according to the national pension law. Anyone else who wants to join the system may, but they must pay all 6 percent themselves. According to a tentative plan drawn up by the ministry, about 995,000 households in farming and fishing villages and 650,000 non-farming or fishing households in rural areas will be obliged to join the national pension scheme. In rural areas, contributions and pensions will be paid on a per household basis instead of an individual basis. Pensions are payable from the 60th birthday of the head of the household. An official said, however, that the ministry is still studying whether to share the contributions. The government also has to decide what percent of income -- 3 percent or 6 percent -- rural people should pay toward their pensions.
