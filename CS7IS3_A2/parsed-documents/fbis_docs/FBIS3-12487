The statement places direct responsibility for the massacre on the Israeli Government because it is responsible for the safety of the Palestinian people under occupation. The statement says that the Ibrahimi Mosque compound is more akin to a military barracks in view of the presence of a large number of Israeli forces there who allow groups of settlers to perpetrate their crimes. The statement continues: While condemning this repugnant crime, the Palestinian popular organizations call on our Palestinian people to consolidate their national unity, escalate their brave intifadah, and respond to the settler herds by all means in retaliation for the innocent souls of the massacre's martyrs. The statement adds: We also call on our people in the diaspora to embark on every initiative in support of the steadfastness of our people under occupation. Furthermore, we call on the Arab nation to bear its pan-Arab and historic responsibility toward our people under occupation and provide all forms of assistance to enhance their steadfastness and their adherence to their land and sanctities. In addition, we call on Arab governments to lift the boycott from our people's leadership, the PLO, the Palestinian people's legitimate sole representative. The statement says: In the face of this repugnant crime, the Palestinian popular organizations call on the PLO Executive Committee to halt the talks at once and to insist on the removal of settlements from all the occupied Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, before returning to the negotiating table. What sort of talks and what peace can there be in the shadow of massacres, killings, and destruction? The popular organizations have noted the international reaction to this disgusting crime and the fact that this reaction has been week and limited only to condemnation and denunciation. No practical measures and steps to provide protection for our people under occupation have been adopted, nor have the Israeli authorities been forced to implement the resolutions of international legitimacy. The popular organizations call on the United States and its president, Bill Clinton, as a cosponsor of the peace conference and in view of its international responsibility during this stage to cease its unlimited aid to the Israeli Government and to force it to implement the Security Council resolutions relating to the Palestinian people's rights, especially withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the occupied Palestinian Arab territories. Moreover, we call on the UN Security Council to adopt immediate and practical measures and send international forces to protect our Palestinian people from the attacks of aggressors, just as in other parts of the world. The Palestinian popular organizations appeal to all parties, international organizations, and human rights committees to condemn the perpetrators of this horrible crime and to pressure their governments and their international agencies to press Rabin's government to withdraw its forces and end the occupation. In view of their faith in a just and comprehensive peace, the Palestinian popular organizations believe that there will be no peace in the shadow of occupation and settlements. They also believe that this peace will not be achieved unless our people attain their inalienable rights -- the right of return, self- determination, and establishment of their independent Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital -- under the leadership of the PLO, our legitimate sole representative.
