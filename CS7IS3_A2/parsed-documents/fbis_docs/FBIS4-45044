King Fahd had noted while visiting Medina in 1403 Hijra [H] [1982] that the number of visitors to the second most important shrine in the Islamic world is constantly rising. He consequently ordered a comprehensive feasibility study for a mosque expansion that would accommodate the current and future needs of the ever-expanding number of visitors, while utilizing the area surrounding the mosque. The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques laid the cornerstone for the expansion project on a visit to Medina. Actual work on the project began the following year. The King underscored his special interest in the project by making annual visits to the Prophet's city in order to personally monitor the progress of construction and learn about any problems that are encountered or modifications and supplemental plans that are needed. The Project The basic elements of the expansion cover a lot more than the modern enlargement of the original shrine and essentially include an extension to the mosque itself; improvements to the surrounding courtyards; the construction of restrooms, washing facilities, and underground parking facilities; and the upgrading of nearby roads and those leading to the shrine such as the primary beltway, the Bab-al-Salam highway, and the second beltway and its intersections. Enlargement of the Shrine The shrine itself was enlarged with a main extension whose cornerstone was laid by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques in 1405H [1984]. The extension encircles the main mosque and connects to it from the north, east, and west. It covers an area of 82,000 square meters or five times the area of the original building. This brings the mosque's current area to 98,500 square meters aside from a marble-covered area of 67,000 square meters. The expanded mosque, its interior, and its annexes have a peak capacity of a quarter of a million worshippers. This maximum capacity rises to a million worshippers when the surrounding courtyards are utilized. The expansion project, which has logged a total cost of about 30 billion riyals, has required the expropriation of more than a 100,000 square meters of property in the vicinity. This segment of the construction includes 27 moving domes, each approximately 4 meters in height and 14 meters in inside diameter, that glide on rails affixed to the extension's roof. The open-air areas of the mosque's main hall have been supplied with 12 electrically-controlled mobile sun-shades. Also completed during the same stage of expansion were seven main northern, eastern, and western gates as well as two others to the south. Eighteen escalators handle traffic within the shrine. The main entrance to the extension is King Fahd Bin 'Abd-al-'Aziz's Gate located in the center to the north. The extension has seven domes and is flanked by two minarets. The expanded mosque therefore boasts 10 minarets, of which six are new and rise to a height of 104 meters, which is 32 meters higher that their original counterparts. At their height, these minarets are probably the tallest in the Islamic world. The extension's interior installations have been decorated with designs that duplicate those of the first Saudi expansion, including mantels, wrought iron windows and screens, copper-inlaid wooden doors, pillar capitals, and gilded chandeliers, as well as round and decorative marble works. The pillars have special crevices at the base to hold copies of the Koran and to accommodate air conditioning vents. Automatic systems control the mosque's lights, sound systems, and air conditioning. Other systems control emergency lights, pollution monitors, and fire detectors. Special rooms contain lighting controls, circuit breakers, and distribution consoles. This segment of the construction also includes mechanical systems for potable water coolers, rain drainage, sewers, ventilation of the lower floors, and some of the largest air conditioning tunnels in the world. Cooling ducts run along 7 km of service tunnels connecting the central air conditioning station with the mosque's interior. The air conditioning station was deliberately built far from the mosque for several reasons, such as sparing more property from expropriation and distancing worshippers from the noise generated by the station. The Mosque's Courtyards That segment of the project sought maximum utilization of the courtyards surrounding the mosque by preparing them to accommodate worshippers as needed at times of peak attendance. The courtyards have an area of 225,000 square meters covered with marble and granite in colorful and coordinated designs. Of the courtyards, an area of 135,000 square meters has been designated for prayer and is capable of holding some quarter of a million worshippers. This number may be increased to 400,000 when all the courtyards are utilized. The mosque and its immediate surroundings are therefore capable of accommodating nearly a million worshippers at peak times. Parking is located directly under those courtyards to the north, east, and west. The parking facility consists of two underground levels covering a total area of 39,000 square meters. This state of the art underground facility has a capacity of 4,500 cars and is served by 126 well-equipped stands with three driveways leading to the upper level and three others leading to the lower level. Public Roadways The expansion effort also covers the roads leading to the shrine, and especially Bab-al-Salam, which is intended to provide visitors with fast access to the shrine. It is a 64-meter-wide dual expressway that is 5.9 meters long, with an 18-meter extension at its intersection with the second ring road [beltway]. The main expressway running in both directions is supplemented by two or three service roads in either direction. The highway connects Pilgrim City to the west of Medina with the holy al-Madani shrine near the Bab-al-Salam gate. The highway is supported by vital installations such as bridges and overpasses. The completed expansion works ordered by the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques are the most ambitious such projects in the history of the mosque since it was founded by the Prophet. Future needs have been kept in mind; the extension was constructed to support the addition of upper floors, when needed, as befits the stature of the second mosque of the Islamic world.
