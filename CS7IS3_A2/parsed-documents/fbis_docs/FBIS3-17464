According the embassy statement made public today, information published recently in the Lithuanian mass information media might create an impression that Sweden was stopping its entire assistance to the Ignalina nuclear power station because of legal problems with Belarus. This is not true. According to the statement by the Swedish Embassy, the Swedish Government has allocated about 120 million Swedish kroner to finance 20 various projects linked with the Ignalina nuclear power station. Nineteen of these projects are not influenced by the fact that Belarus has so far failed to sign the Vienna convention on responsibility for nuclear accidents and pass corresponding laws. The project influenced by the Belarusian stance is valued at about 10 million Swedish kroner. The Swedish Embassy hopes that Belarus will eliminate legal obstacles and this project, important to the reactor, will be soon fulfilled.
