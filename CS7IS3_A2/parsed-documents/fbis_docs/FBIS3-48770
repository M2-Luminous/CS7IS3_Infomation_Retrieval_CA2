The compromise plan calls for replacing the current multi-seat constituencies for the House of Representatives with a combination of 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation seats to be allotted based on the popular vote in 11 electoral units, the sources said. On the equally controversial issue of political fund-raising, the two sides agreed to allow individual politicians to designate one body for gathering political donations from enterprises and groups, they said. Despite prospects that the compromise might undermine the original purpose of stopping rampant political corruption, the bills are likely to be enacted before the end of current Diet session on Saturday, the sources said. Hosokawa's coalition government moved to bridge the gap between itself and the LDP by agreeing to amend the government's four-bill reform package, which was voted down by the House of Councilors last Friday. The package passed the more powerful lower house last November. After the joint council of both houses of the Diet established for the purpose approves the compromise, the government-proposed bills may be passed Saturday, the final day of the current Diet session, and then revised in the next session starting Monday. The council is made up of 10 members from the coalition who voted for the bills in the lower house and 10 legislators from the opposition who opposed the package in the upper house. Hosokawa and Kono talked at the Diet building for about two hours Friday evening after Takako Doi, speaker of the lower house, urged the two rivals to come to terms on the issue. Ichiro Ozawa, co-leader of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the second-largest but most influential party in the ruling coalition, also attended the meeting along with LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori. Doi proposed passing the bills without setting a date for implementation and then discussing revision of the package in the next Diet session, the sources said. The compromise plan ultimately agreed to was revealed to reporters during a break in the meeting when both Hosokawa and Kono visited Doi to report about the plan. During the break, Mori told reporters that the two sides had agreed not to accept Doi's own proposals for dealing with the problem.
