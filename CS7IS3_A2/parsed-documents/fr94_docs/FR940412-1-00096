FR940412-1-00096 FR940412-1-00012 §148.300 Radioactive material; low specific activity. Except as authorized under §148.305, radioactive materials that may be stowed or transported in bulk are limited to those radioactive materials defined as low specific activity materials in 49 CFR 173.403(n). §148.305 Radioactive material; surface contaminated objects. Solid objects of nonradioactive material having radioactive material distributed on their surfaces are authorized for shipment only if_ (a) The nonfixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm2 (or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm2) does not exceed 0.0001 microcurie/cm2 (4.0 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 10 ^ 5 microcurie/cm2 (0.4 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters; (b) The fixed contamination on the accessible surface averaged over 300 cm2 (or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm2) does not exceed 1.0 microcurie/cm2 (40,000 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters and low toxicity alpha emitters, or 0.1 microcurie/cm2 (4,000 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters; and (c) The nonfixed contamination plus the fixed contamination on the inaccessible surface, averaged over 300 cm2 (or the area of the surface if less than 300 cm2) does not exceed 1.0 microcurie/cm2 (40,000 Bq/cm2) for beta and gamma emitters or 0.1 microcurie/cm2 (4,000 Bq/cm2) for alpha emitters. §148.310 Seed cake. (a) Seed cake, except as provided in paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section, must be carried in accordance with paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. (b) Prior to loading, the seed cake must be aged in accordance with the instructions of the shipper. (c) If the seed cake is solvent extracted, it must be_ (1) Free from flammable solvent as far as reasonably practicable; and (2) Stowed in a mechanically ventilated hold. (d) Prior to loading, the shipper must provide the master of the vessel or person in charge of the barge with a certificate from a competent testing laboratory stating the oil and moisture content of the seed cake. (e) The seed cake must be kept as dry as reasonably practicable at all times. (f) For a voyage with a planned duration greater than 5 days, the vessel must be equipped with facilities for introducing carbon dioxide or another inert gas into the hold. (g) Temperature readings must be taken at least once in every 24 hour period. If the temperature of the seed cake exceeds 55 ○C (131 ○F) and continues to increase, ventilation to the cargo hold must be discontinued. If heating continues after ventilation has been discontinued, carbon dioxide or the inert gas required under paragraph (f) of this section must be introduced into the hold; except, if the seed cake is solvent extracted, the use of inert gas must not be introduced until fire is apparent to avoid the possibility of igniting the solvent vapors by the generation of static electricity. (h) Seed cake must be carried in accordance with the terms of a Special Permit issued by the Commandant (G&hyph;MTH) in accordance with subpart B of this part if_ (1) The oil was mechanically expelled; and (2) It contains more than 10% vegetable oil or more than 20% vegetable oil and moisture combined. (i) This part does not apply to solvent extracted rape seed meal pellets or soya bean meal that_ (1) Contains not more than 4% vegetable oil and not more than 15% vegetable oil and moisture combined; and (2) As far as reasonably practicable, is free from flammable solvent. §148.315 Sulfur. (a) This part applies to sulfur in the form of lumps or coarse-grain powder only. Fine-grained powder (``flowers of sulfur'') may not be transported in bulk. (b) After the loading or unloading of sulfur to which this part applies has been completed, the vessel's decks, bulkheads, and overheads, if containing sulfur dust, must be swept clean or washed down with fresh water. (c) A cargo space that contains sulfur or the residue of a sulfur cargo must be adequately ventilated, preferably by mechanical means. Each ventilator intake must be fitted with a spark-arresting screen. §148.320 Tankage; garbage tankage; rough ammonia tankage; or tankage fertilizer. (a) This part applies to rough ammonia tankage in bulk that contains 7% or more moisture by weight and garbage tankage and tankage fertilizer that contain 8% or more moisture by weight. (b) Tankage to which this part applies may not be loaded in bulk if its temperature exceeds 38 ○C (100 ○F). (c) During the voyage, the temperature of the tankage must be monitored at intervals sufficient to detect spontaneous heating.
