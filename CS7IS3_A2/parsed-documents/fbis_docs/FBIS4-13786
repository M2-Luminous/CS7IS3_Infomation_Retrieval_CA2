The congress is being held with a view to appointing the provincial executive committee and the secretariat of the federation. Abdelkarim Benmoufaq reports: [Benmoufaq] The congress was opened by UGTA secretary general Abdelhak Benhamouda. He delivered a lengthy speech on the occasion, in which he dealt with workers' difficulties in light of the fall in purchasing power. Soaring prices and a deterioration in the country's general situation, he said, has negatively effected workers and is a threat to their future. In another development, he pointed out the plots hatched to harm the UGTA because it had worried many people because UGTA had been able to absorb and bring together workers and bring about a qualitative development on many issues that concerned the workers' stratum. He also stressed UGTA's determination to continue a real and effective trade union struggle now to try to protect workers' interests and defend their rights. [passage omitted]
