Nabil Fahmi, an aide to the Egyptian foreign minister and head of the Egyptian delegation to the arms control talks, yesterday visited Israel for a meeting with David 'Ivri, director general of the Defense Ministry and head of the Israeli delegation. In this first-of-its-kind direct meeting between the Israeli and Egyptian representatives to the arms control talks, the sides were able to attain understandings that will prevent unnecessary bickering in the upcoming meeting in Cairo planned later this month between all the countries participating in the multilateral arms control talks. The controversy between Egypt and Israel has centered on Egyptian diplomatic efforts to disarm Israel of its nuclear capacity and its demand to raise the nuclear issue in the multilateral talks as soon as possible. Israel, on the other hand, demands to start the process by implementing confidence-building-measures between the region's countries, and to delay the nuclear issue until stable peace arrangements are implemented in the area.
