FR940919-0-00031 FR940919-0-00009 Emission Limitations (lb/MMBTU) Under 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 ( b )(1) and ( b )(2) 1‚ê£ 1(1) Low sulfur coal only 1(2) FGD on unit 4 Units 1, 2, and 3: Beginning January 1, 1992 3.57 3.57 No later than December 31, 1993 3.13 3.13 No later than December 31, 1995 2.7 3.19 Unit 4: Beginning January 1, 1992 3.57 3.57 No later than December 31, 1993 3.13 3.13 No later than December 31, 1995 2.7 0.60 Unit 5: Beginning January 1, 1992 1.2 1.2 24-hour average (New Source Performance Standard) 1.10 1.10 No later than December 31, 1995 1.10 1.10 USEPA also notes that the rule is a SIP-strengthening measure, since the new emission limits in the April 18, 1994 submittal represent a decrease in total SO 2 emissions from what is required under the current SIP. IV. Modeling Issues The State is required to submit a modeled attainment demonstration to show that the emission limits set forth in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1(b)(2) will provide for attainment and maintenance of the NAAQS. The dispersion modeling information within the original July 22, 1991 submittal contained issues of some initial concern to USEPA in that the modeler for the PSI Gibson SIP revision may not have used the most current version of the Industrial Source Complex (ISC) model to demonstrate that the new Gibson County limits would protect the NAAQS. USEPA evaluated supplementary information submitted on April 18, 1994, and determined that PSI Gibson's modeling results indicated that an appropriate refined dispersion model was used. Because PSI Gibson's modeling was performed according to USEPA guidance which has since been revised, USEPA is accepting the modeled attainment demonstration for the April 18, 1994 submittal under its grandfathering policy. 1 1 USEPA's grandfathering guidance is described in a June 27, 1988, memorandum from the Director of the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards to the Regional Air Division Directors. Grandfathering is neither mandatory nor automatic, and USEPA wishes to make clear that its acceptance of the modeling analysis in the April 18, 1994 submittal will not apply to any other analysis of Gibson County to support any future regulatory action. Future SIP revision requests submitted to USEPA must demonstrate attainment of the NAAQS through modeling performed in accordance with current USEPA modeling guidance. This SIP revision currently complies with USEPA's 1985 stack height regulations. It should be noted, however, that on January 22, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit remanded to USEPA the exemptions for boilers originally designed to vent from common stacks. If USEPA's response on the remand modifies the applicable provision, then USEPA will notify the State of the need to reexamine the Gibson County SO 2 emission limits for consistency with the modified provision. V. Rulemaking Action and Solicitation of Public Comment For the reasons discussed above, USEPA is approving 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 (Gibson County Sulfur Dioxide Emission Limitations). This rule affects only the PSI Gibson facility. It sets forth two emission reduction schedules to limit the facility's SO 2 emissions. PSI Gibson has chosen to comply with the second emission schedule, which requires the use of an additional flue gas desulfurization system and will result in lower total SO 2 emissions than would the first reduction schedule. The emission limits in 326 IAC 7&hyph;4&hyph;12.1 have been shown to protect the SO 2 NAAQS. The USEPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because USEPA views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. However, in a separate document in this Federal Register publication, the USEPA is proposing to approve the requested SIP revision should adverse or critical comments be filed. This action will be effective on November 18, 1994 unless adverse or critical comments are received by October 19, 1994. If the USEPA receives such comments, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by the publication of a subsequent rule that withdraws this final action. All public comments received will then be addressed in a subsequent final rule based on this action serving as a proposed rule. The USEPA will not institute a second comment period on this action. Any parties interested in commenting on this action should do so at this time. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective November 18, 1994. This action has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the Federal Register on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225), as revised by an October 4, 1993 memorandum from Michael H. Shapiro, Acting Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation. The OMB has exempted this regulatory action from Executive Order 12866 review.
