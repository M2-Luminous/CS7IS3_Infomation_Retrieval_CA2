FR941005-1-00012 FR941005-1-00003 For reasons set out in the preamble it is proposed to amend Subchapter A, chapter I of Title 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows: PART 110_CONTRIBUTION AND EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS AND PROHIBITIONS 1. The authority citation would continue to read as follows: Authority: 2 U.S.C. 431(8), 431(9), 432(c)(2), 437d(a)(8), 438(a)(8), 441a, 441b, 441d, 441e, 441f, 441g, and 441h. 2. Part 110 would be amended by revising section 110.11 to read as follows: ยง110.11 Communications; advertising. (a) Definition . For purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section only, ``direct mailing'' includes any number of substantially similar pieces of mail but does not include: (1) a mailing of fifty pieces or less by any person; or (2) mailings by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 or 114.5. (b)(1) (i) General Rule . Except as otherwise provided in this section, whenever any person makes an expenditure for the purpose of financing a communication that expressly advocates the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate or that solicits any contribution, through any broadcast station, phone bank, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, poster, yard sign, direct mailing or other form of general public political advertising, that communication or solicitation shall clearly state who paid for it. If authorized by a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate or an agent thereof, but paid for by some other person, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is authorized by such candidate, authorized committee, or agent. If not authorized by a candidate, authorized committee of a candidate or its agent, the communication or solicitation shall clearly state that it is not authorized by any candidate, candidate's committee, or agent. For purposes of this paragraph, it is presumed that a communication or solicitation by a political committee that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate contains express advocacy. (ii) Exceptions . The requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section do not apply to: (A) bumper stickers, pins, buttons, pens and similar small items upon which the disclaimer cannot be conveniently printed; (B) skywriting, watertowers or other means of displaying an advertisement of such a nature that the inclusion of a disclaimer would be impracticable; (C) checks, receipts and similar items of minimal value which do not contain a political message and which are used for purely administrative purposes; or (D) communications by a corporation or labor organization to the corporation's or labor organization's restricted class under 11 CFR 114.3 and 114.5. (2) For a communication or solicitation paid for by a party committee pursuant to 2 U.S.C. 441a(d), the disclaimer required by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall identify the committee that makes the expenditure as the person who paid for the communication, regardless of whether the committee was acting in its own capacity or as the designated agent of another committee. (3) A solicitation other than one covered by paragraph (b)(1)(ii)(D) of this section by an unauthorized political committee that does not refer to a clearly identified federal candidate need only state who paid for it. (4) For purposes of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) of this section, the term ``expenditure'' includes a communication by a candidate or party committee that qualifies as an exempt activity under 11 CFR 100.8(b) (10), (16), (17), or (18). (c) Placement of Disclaimer . The disclaimers specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section shall be presented in a clear and conspicuous manner, to give the reader, observer or listener adequate notice of the identity of the person or committee that paid for, and, where required, that authorized the communication. A disclaimer is not clear and conspicuous if it is in small type in comparison to the rest of the printed material, or if the printing is difficult to read or if the placement is easily overlooked. (1) The disclaimer need not appear on the front or cover page of the communication as long as it appears within the communication, except on communications, such as billboards, that contain only a front face. (2) Each communication that is included in a package of materials but that is also intended for separate public distribution shall include a disclaimer. (d) (1) Newspaper or magazine space . No person who sells space in a newspaper or magazine to a candidate, an authorized committee of a candidate, or an agent of the candidate, for use in connection with the candidate's campaign for nomination or for election, shall charge an amount for space which exceeds the comparable rate for the space for non-campaign purposes. (2) For purposes of this section, ``comparable rate'' means the rate charged to a national or general rate advertiser, and shall include discount privileges usually and normally available to a national or general rate advertiser.
