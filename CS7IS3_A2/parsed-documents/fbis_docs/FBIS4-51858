Pointing out that the scheme of the Japanese Government is causing a serious crisis in the peace and stability not only on the Korean peninsula but also in Northeast Asia including Japan, the statement said: It is well known to the world that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has made consistent efforts for peace and denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and for the building of a prosperous Asia, taking independence, peace and friendship as its diplomatic idea. Ignoring this fact, the Japanese Government, while following the U.S. policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK, is trying to enact the law at any cost allegedly to cope with "a case of emergency on the Korean peninsula", regarding the campaign over the "suspected nuclear development" by the DPRK as the best chance. This shows that its hostile policy toward Korea has been carried into extremes. The Japanese Government should ponder over what serious consequences will be entailed if it persists in its hostile policy toward Korea motivated by the intention to stage a comeback to Korea and in restrictions on and suppression of Chongnyon and Korean residents in Japan, evading its responsibility for the past colonial rule over Korea.
