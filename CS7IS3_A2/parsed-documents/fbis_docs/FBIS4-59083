[Sayf] Like any other Yemeni citizen, we are calling on the Yemeni leaders to resort to reason and to stop the military operations that are harming innocent civilians. Children, women, and men are daily falling victim to these operations. Villages and numerous civilian installations are being destroyed. We call on them to stop this, resort to reason, sit at the negotiating table, talk as brothers about the differences, and try to reach solutions that satisfy all the parties, spare Yemen more fighting, try to salvage what could be salvaged, and avoid letting Yemen enter a dark tunnel with the outcome known only to God almighty. ['Abd-al-Tawwab] Are you calling for a dialogue among family members? [Sayf] The one family that could find credible solutions based on the Pledge and Accord Document. ['Abd-al-Tawwab] What do you say about Egypt's efforts? Some people are now criticizing Egypt and saying that it has not intervened. [Sayf] On the contrary, Egypt has always been the first to intervene to find solutions to many crises faced by the Arab countries. Egypt has always been first. It was first in the Yemeni crisis through President Husni Mubarak's envoy who shuttled between Sanaa and Aden in an attempt to reach a peaceful solution for the crisis in Yemen. Even after the fighting erupted, Egypt took the leading role when it called on the Arab League to hold an extraordinary session to try to stop the fighting and to call on the warring parties to resort to dialogue to resolve their differences. ['Abd-al-Tawwab] As a Yemeni citizen living in Cairo, I am asking you about Egypt's efforts. There have been contacts between President Mubarak and Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and with Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid even after the fighting erupted. Do you think Egypt's stance is the correct one? [Sayf] Egypt's stance has been very sound. Contacts have taken place between Mubarak and President Salih and Vice President al-Bid, even during the fighting. Egypt's role is needed in these times. I believe that Egypt is the leading Arab country. The Arab nation suffers many setbacks whenever Egypt and its role are absent. ['Abd-al-Tawwab] In whose hands is the solution? [Sayf] The solution is in the hands of the Yemenis but with the help of their Arab brothers. ['Abd-al-Wattab] Several days ago, Egypt was the scene of the signing of the Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement and there was great joy for the Palestinians, some of whom are in Yemen. Do you think this is the right time for this Yemeni crisis, when the brother is killing his brother and tanks and planes are on the attack? [Sayf] You feel real pain when you see reconciliations taking place everywhere, meetings, and the signing of agreements here and there, while the world is daily watching the bloody fighting in Yemen, which is claiming the lives of many innocent people who have no interest in the fighting. I hope the Arab efforts will be effective and that more contacts will be held with the Yemeni leaders to put them back on the right course. ['Abd-al-Tawwab] I thank you for this interview and ask: What is your message through the Cairo radio network to the brothers in Yemeni? [Sayf] I can say only this: Pray to God to guide our Yemeni leaders, inspire them to achieve an end to this bloody fighting, and make them resort to reason and hold dialogue because we can reach very good results through dialogue. We might not achieve any results through fighting. The damage could be more grave if the fighting continues in this way and claims more victims.
