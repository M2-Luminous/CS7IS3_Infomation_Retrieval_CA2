Is it still possible to keep to this schedule? ['Arafat] We, the Palestinians, are ready. As always, the obstacles are coming from the Israeli side. Let me give you an example. On 31 March we signed an agreement according to the terms of which Israel undertook to accelerate negotiations on the autonomy of Gaza and Jericho. Article 6 of this agreement stated that the Palestinian police force was to be deployed one week later. A few days ago we were about to send in the first wave of this force when the Israelis objected on a number of pretexts. They also suspended the Cairo negotiations to attend the Holocaust commemoration ceremonies. Why then, did they not also suspend the economic committee negotiations under way in Paris? I regret to say that the Israelis are maneuvering to avoid having to precisely and honestly apply what we decided on. In this same agreement signed last week, Israel accepted to accelerate the process of withdrawing its troops. However, last Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister Mr. Peres announced that the negotiations -- not the withdrawal -- could be completed by the end of the month. Clearly, this is maneuvering. [Thedrel] Would you go as far as to break off negotiations if the deadlines are not met? ['Arafat] That will up to the PLO bureau to decide. Remember Israeli Prime Minister Mr. Rabin's slogan: "No fixed deadlines." In December, at our meeting in Cairo, Rabin promised me the Israeli withdrawal would begin in 10 days. Several months have gone by and we are still at the same point. Mr. Rabin did not keep his promise, but nonetheless I agreed to continue with the negotiations in Oslo, Davos, Cairo, etc. Each time, we reached agreements which were then not respected. Now we have reached an impasse situation. The deadline of 13 April is almost upon us and I can still not see any concrete results on the ground. When 13 April has passed, we will have to take a very close look at the situation and face up to our responsibilities. We will have to tell our people the truth. The Israelis are currently destroying the peace process and its credibility. These delays and hesitations are playing into the hands of the extremists. [Thedrel] But by issuing an ultimatum to the Israelis, are you not also playing into the hands of the extremists? The Hamas Islamic fundamentalists have enjoined you to call off the peace negotiations for the past year. ['Arafat] I do not take orders from Hamas. I was elected by the Palestinian National Council, not Hamas. It is my duty to ask the international community and the Security Council to shoulder their responsibilities and not to leave me standing alone against the Israeli government's maneuvering . [Thedrel] How do you plan to defeat Palestinian extremism? ['Arafat] I will be able to reply to that question when I am in Jericho. For the time being, that is Israel's responsibility. [Thedrel] Why did you not personally condemn the Afula attack last week? ['Arafat] The PLO condemned it. What distinction do you make between me and PLO? I am the one who gives the orders. Do not forget, either, that Palestinians were killed at Afula also. [Thedrel] Can the current obstacles be overcome rapidly? ['Arafat] Yes, if there is the will to do so. If this region, which is very important strategically, does not find peace , it will be thrown into confusion. However, if we do manage to find peace, it will signal the start of a whole new era.
