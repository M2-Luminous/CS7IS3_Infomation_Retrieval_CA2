But it took a Swedish businessman only 20 minutes to pack his bags and leave the country after threats from one of the city's Mafia-like organizations drove him to flight. Molds and other equipment, computers, fax machines, and telephones worth 3 million kronor in all were left behind in the industrial plant. "Four years of hard work and then everything has to end like this just because we happened to get in the way of extraneous interests," said a spokesman for the D-boats company in Taby. Six Hundred Plastic Boats In 1990 D-boats formed the Fibertec joint venture company with the Majak fishery kolkhoz in Tallinn. Last year Fibertec produced around 600 plastic boats of various sizes, primarily for the Swedish market. At first all went well. There was a good atmosphere at the factory--in spite of some language confusion and an unsettled political situation with increasingly vociferous Estonian demands for independence and liberation from the Soviet Union. But after Estonia became a sovereign state, law and order was seriously undermined. Various crimes can be committed almost unchecked because of widespread corruption among customs agents and policemen. A fact that the highest police leadership now openly acknowledges. Infiltration Swedish authorities and ministries have tried through many different channels to speed up and support the construction of a functioning society based on law with aid for institutional sovereignty. But neither white gloves, deterrents, nor the transfer of advanced information has helped; corruption has spread, and organized crime is infiltrating farther and farther into spheres of power. According to Fibertec's former administrative chief, an Estonian, it began when one of Tallinn's metal gangs, which earn incredible sums from the export of primarily stolen scrap metal, wanted to acquire the Majak partner's attractive deep-water port in the Kopli district south of the center of the city. One of the gang's members, a karate instructor, had a lifetime membership in the Majak kolkhoz. Using big bribes and explicit threats, the gang succeeded in getting the kolkhoz members to not only approve incorporating the kolkhoz but also elect the karate instructor as its managing director. After that things moved quickly. All the chiefs of the former kolkhoz's satellite companies were kicked out, and soon it was the turn of Fibertec and D-boats. "One day a tough gang came and said they were going to sell the industrial buildings and that we had to get out. Our production chief, Lars-Olof Berntsson, protested and said Majak could sell only its own share," someone in the D-boats management told SVENSKA DAGBLADET. Warning From Enforcers A few weeks later the production chief was warned about the gang's enforcers and their methods by his own personnel. "Berntsson was advised to return home immediately. He fled to the Swedish Embassy before leaving Estonia head over heels." No one in the company dared get in touch with the Tallinn police, but a report was filed with the Swedish police. Several people have also been questioned closely about what happened. "Here we sit and we were not able to take a single ore with us. We think it is irresponsible of the government and the Export Council not to warn Swedish businessmen who are considering investing in Estonia about the increasingly powerful crime gangs," said a company spokesman. Staffan Sodersten, the Export Council's marketing chief, is well aware of the development not only in Estonia but also in Latvia, Lithuania, and Russia. "It has clearly worsened just in the past year and it is shocking how fast it has happened. But we cannot very well advise people against doing business in Estonia, although we urge them to be extremely vigilant," Sodersten said. Case Not Unique Threatened Swedish businessmen who are forced to flee from Russia and the Baltic states have become a dismal reality in the wake of poverty. "Unfortunately the case in Tallinn is not unique. We have also acted via the Swedish Embassy in Moscow," said Christine von Sydow of the Foreign Ministry's trade section, who is responsible for the mixed commissions that administer the free trade agreements with Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Aid To Be Maintained Von Sydow said she would not advise Swedish businessmen against making investments in Estonia and the Baltic region either. "But we communicate the anxiety we feel about the grave situation via many different channels. I do not believe in withholding aid as a `punishment,' but rather in intensifying support in order to hasten an improvement in the legal system." Alar Streimann, trade counsellor at the Estonian Embassy in Stockholm, insists that there is no threat to Swedish firms in Estonia. "If someone has problems they should report the matter to the police so it can be investigated. A corrupt police system? There is no proof of that, but the police are poorly equipped."
