Listing the factors that keep the Balkans under pressure he named the troubled historical past of the region, the large number of minorities coexisting for centuries in its area, the communist totalitarian regimes that concealed the smoldering tensions without solving their causes, as well as factors extraneous to the region, such as power interests. What should be avoided in this particularly complex social and political background is the domino effect, he suggested. "We must not allow the Yugoslav conflict to spread to other places, so as equally dangerous would be the involvement of the great powers in this conflict." "The Yugoslav crisis has already put international and world organizations to a severe test, (United Nations, CSCE, NATO and West European Union). They have some merit in keeping the conflict under control, but have also displayed serious limitations of their capacity to settle the conflict." Speaking of the risk factors in the Balkans, yet without ignoring those that prompt the optimistic approach, the speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies commended the political and diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia, which have led to many important results. Adrian Nastase also referred to Romania as a Central-European country, as a state that could become an important center of stability in the Balkans. "We have a considerable economic and military potential if compared to other states in this region, and what is more important, we cherish the strong desire of contributing to the diplomatic settlement of the conflict." In Mr. Nastase's view, the steps to be taken towards normality should be the fortification of democracy and market economies in all Balkan states, the development of concrete joint cooperation projects regarding their common future, a close cooperation between the Black Sea riparian countries, a similar scheme among Danubian countries provided the embargo against Yugoslavia is ended, the association to regional or sub-regional cooperation structures of the newly emerged entities in the ex-Yugoslav space, and, of no less importance, the initiation of an international conference for a scrutiny of all these issues with the purpose of coming up with ideas for new projects on peace prospects in the Balkans.
