ACTION: Notice of determination not to revoke countervailing duty order. SUMMARY: The Department of Commerce is notifying the public of its determination not to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain stainless steel cooking ware from the Republic of Korea. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia W. Stroup or David Mason, Office of Countervailing Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202)482&hyph;2786. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published in the Federal Register (58 FR 69342) its intent to revoke the countervailing duty order on certain stainless steel cooking ware from the Republic of Korea (52 FR 2140; January 20, 1987). Under 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii), the Secretary of Commerce will conclude that an order is no longer of interest to interested parties and will revoke the order if no domestic interested party objects to revocation or no interested party requests an administrative review by the last day of the fifth anniversary month. On January 7, 1994, the Department received an objection to our intent to revoke the countervailing duty order from Farberware, Inc., a U.S. producer of the subject merchandise and an interested party within the meaning of 19 CFR 355.2(i)(3). Because the requirements of 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4)(iii) have not been met, we will not revoke the order. This determination is in accordance with 19 CFR 355.25(d)(4). Dated: March 30, 1994. Roland L. MacDonald, Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Compliance. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8259 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;P
