The judge determined that Marzel will serve his term immediately after he completes his current term in detention. The judge pointed out that over the past 14 years, Marzel was convicted 10 times on similar charges. Ever since he became an adult, this person has been violating the law, and his acts indicate that he has no regard for the authority of the law and the establishments of the state. His criminal record, the judge said, calls for severe punishment. Our correspondent Aviv Bushinsky reports that upon coming out of the courthouse, Marzel claimed that he is being discriminated against.
