Speaking at the inauguration ceremony at a retraining centre for the demobilised military in Moscow on Wednesday, Kinkel said that relations of strategic partnership should be established between Russia and NATO. He stressed that after many years of confrontation Russian-German relations are developing on the basis of principles of good-neighbourliness, friendship and partnership. Kinkel said that the money spent by the German side to build the centre and establish a re-training programme for the military returning from Germany is a good investment in Russian-German friendship and partnership. The German Government said it would allocate 200 million DM [German marks] to fund the programme and 7.800 million DM to finance housing construction for the military. By the end of the year the Russian military should receive 36,000 new apartments. Kinkel noted that Germany wants the Russian troops to leave it as friends. It is also seeking to ensure the integration of democratic Russia into the international community, he added. The German foreign minister said that Germany is looking forward to a meeting with President Boris Yeltsin, Defence Minister Pavel Grachev and Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev on August 31, 1994 when the last Russian troops will leave German soil.
