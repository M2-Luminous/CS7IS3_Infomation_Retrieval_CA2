Addressing a cross-section of citizens of Bomi, Grand Cape Mount, and Lower Lofa Counties in the palace of the executive mansion yesterday, the chairman of the Council of State, Professor David Kpomakpor, said since ECOMOG has the peace enforcement power under the Cotonou Accord, the subregional force can exercise this power to prevent an escalation of hostilities. Prof. Kpomakpor, in his statement, expressed dismay over the continued fighting between the warring factions which, he noted, is claiming more innocent lives. He said it was disheartening for the factions to [words indistinct] hostilities after the signing of the cease-fire accord and the seating of the Transitional Government. The LNTG [Liberian National Transitional Government] chairman declared that the current fighting in Liberia was an exercise in futility and must be brought to an immediate halt. Prof. Kpomakpor emphasized that the Council of State will meet ECOMOG and ULIMO [United Liberation Movement for Democracy in Liberia] to discuss relevant matters pertaining to the current fighting in some political subdivisions of the country, following which appropriate actions will be taken. We have now reached a point in our history when Liberians must put aside all differences and resolve to work together in realizing the [word indistinct] aspirations of our people, Chairman Kpomakpor said. On their part the citizens expressed concern over the prevailing rift among elements of the defunct [as heard] ULIMO in their area. The citizens are, therefore, calling on the State Council to ensure the speedy deployment of ECOMOG troops there. The citizens observed that the internal conflict in ULIMO borders on ethnic matters and requested the council to convene a meeting of the chiefs, elders, and leaders of the ethnic groups involved -- the Krahns and Mandingos -- to prevail on those fighting to stop the (?killing) and surrender their arms to ECOMOG.
