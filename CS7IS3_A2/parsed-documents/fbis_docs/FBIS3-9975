Among the groups writing were the following: the Sun of Justice for the Liberation of the Haitian People, OSJLPH, [Organisation Soleil Justice pour la Liberation du Peuple Haitien, also known as Soley Jistis pou Liberasyon Pep Ayisyen, OSJLPA], the Organization for the Defense of Youth, ODEJ, [Organisation de la Defense de la Jeunesse], and the St. John Bosco basic church communities. The letter's signatories reproached President Clinton, among others, for his indifference in the face of the current climate of deterioration in the country, including an upsurge in acts of violence, both in the capital and in the provincial cities. The 14 people's organizations wrote the following: We deplore your silence about the horrors (?being committed) in Haiti. By acting thus, you send a conspiratorial signal to the Haitian military and to the armed civilians who continue to slaughter the population. Remember that Americans of Haitian origin voted for you because they were convinced that your presence in the White House would inaugurate a new era for Haiti. Mr. President, one cannot avoid noting that again today you are putting pressure on President Aristide to appoint a new prime minister, but the current climate is not really appropriate for that, the signatories of the letter pointed out. They further demand the departure of General Cedras, the disarming of the paramilitary groups, and the return of President Aristide on a specific date.
