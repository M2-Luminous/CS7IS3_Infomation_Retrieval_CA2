FR941021-0-00142 FR941021-0-00021 Barge industry representatives contended that the visual signal provided by high level indicating devices is, in some ways, superior to the audible signal provided by overfill alarms, which only sound when an overfill is about to occur. High level indicating devices, when properly installed and utilized, provide the person-in-charge (PIC) of the loading operation with a continuous reading of how the later stages of the loading operation are progressing. The Coast Guard will allow the owners and operators of tank barges to select one of three alternatives: (1) an overfill alarm on each tank which includes circuitry to sufficiently identify which individual tanks overfill system is alarming, (2) an automatic shutdown system for the entire barge and transfer facility, or (3) a high level indicating device installed on each tank, such as a stick gauge. Two of the comments also recommended that the Coast Guard allow portable stick gauges, which would be moved from tank to tank, as the tanks were sequentially topped off. This recommendation assumes that tanks will always be sequentially topped off, which may not be the case. Accordingly, the Coast Guard will require that when stick gauges are used, they must be permanently installed on each tank. Six comments stated that a stick gauge was inadequate to warn of an imminent spill when the PIC was off the barge or performing other duties. These comments favored alarms and automatic shutdown systems. However, the Coast Guard finds that audible alarms are just as ineffective as stick gauges if the PIC is not in the immediate vicinity of the transfer operation. The Coast Guard encourages the use of systems which automatically shut down the transfer pumps before an overfill spill occurs; however, the Coast Guard does not require these systems to be used, for several reasons. The requirement would be cost-prohibitive for some owners and operators; it would require additional maintenance; and extra people would be needed to perform this maintenance. Additionally, industry standards for the necessary shoreside and barge interface would need to be developed. Developing these standards would be time-consuming. Over the next 5 years, the Coast Guard will monitor the effectiveness of high level indicating devices. If at the end of this period, the Coast Guard determines that the overfill spill record of tank barges equipped with these devices is not essentially as good or better than the overfill spill record of other tank vessels covered by the regulations, the Coast Guard may remove the provision in the regulation allowing use of high level indicating devices as substitutes for overfill alarms. Two comments recommended requiring only one overfill alarm on a tank instead of two as required by the NPRM, because only one alarm is needed to alert the PIC to act to prevent an overfill. The Coast Guard has decided to allow as an option, the use of one high level indicating alarm or one alarm with an independent visual or audible device installed on each tank, which must function as an overfill device for each tank on a tank barge. Its purpose is to warn the PIC that immediate action must be taken to prevent a tank overfill and oil spill during loading operations. Section 155.480 has been revised to reflect this. Some comments recommended technical specifications for the overfill devices. Presently, the Coast Guard does not find a need to develop technical specifications for overfill devices. Many of the devices that meet the requirements of the regulations are already in service as high level indicating devices aboard tank vessels. The Coast Guard finds that cross referencing its performance criteria to those provided in the vapor control regulations is the most efficient manner of setting these regulatory requirements. Vessel owners and operators should utilize devices which conform to the flag state or classification society inspection criteria and are most suitable for their vessels' operating environments. Training Four comments stated that trained, professional tankermen are essential on board tank barges to prevent oil spills, and that the Coast Guard should establish requirements to improve PIC performance rather than require new equipment. One comment stated that only qualified people who have received proper training should be allowed to use the required overfill warning devices. The Coast Guard strongly encourages owners, operators, and tankermen's services to provide complete and adequate training in the proper use of high level indicating devices, but the setting of training requirements exceeds the scope of this rulemaking. Another comment stated that tankermen on unmanned barges may not be as familiar with the barge as tankermen on manned barges. Tankermen on a manned barge are often assigned to that barge on a long-term basis. They become intimately familiar with their barges; whereas, tankermen on unmanned barges are temporarily assigned to a barge only for a loading or unloading operation. Regardless of whether a barge is manned or unmanned, it is the duty of the tankerman to conduct safe and pollution-free transfer operations. At this time, the Coast Guard regulations in 33 CFR 156.120 do not require specific training for the PIC to perform an oil transfer operation; however, each individual is required to meet the qualifications for a PIC found in 33 CFR 155.710, and each vessel owner and operator must keep a list with names of each person currently designated as PIC for transfer operations. While the Coast Guard agrees that the competency and training of tankermen is crucial to spill prevention, it finds that additional specific training requirements are not appropriate for this rulemaking; however, changes to these requirements have been proposed in a separate rulemaking (54 FR 42624; October 17, 1989).
