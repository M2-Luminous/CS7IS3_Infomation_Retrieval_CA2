According to some information, Yuriy Baturin, the Russian president's national security adviser, has reported in detail to Boris Yeltsin the circumstances of the criminal case against the scientist who had allegedly revealed a state secret about the development in Russia of new types of chemical weapons, and the president "adequately reacted to the prosecution's being unconstitutional." Yuriy Baturin explained that a criminal case under Article 6 of the Criminal Procedure Code may be dismissed in connection with changed circumstances. He regards as such "changed circumstances" the adoption of the new Russian Federation Constitution under which "everyone has the right to freely look for, receive, pass on, produce, and distribute information by any legal means. The list of information constituting a state secret is determined by a federal law." Since no open list of information about state secrets has been published, this circumstance may be cause for dismissing the case against the scientist, something Russian human rights activists and the liberal press insist on.
