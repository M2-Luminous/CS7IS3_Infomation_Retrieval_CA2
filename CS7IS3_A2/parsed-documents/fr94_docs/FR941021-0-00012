(x) Hardware items used for assembling or fastening housing components shall be 300 series or passivated 400 series stainless steel or hot dip galvanized in accordance with ASTM A l53&hyph;82 (1987). Other materials will be considered by REA on an individual basis. (xi) Aluminum components shall be fabricated from alloy types 5052 or 6061 or other types that have been recognized as having acceptable corrosion resistance and formability and weldability features. (xii) Nonmetallic parts must be resistant to solvents and stress cracking and shall be compatible with metals and other materials such as conductor insulations and filling compounds used in the manufacture of cable. Plastic materials must be noncorrosive to metals and resist deterioration when exposed to industrial chemical pollutants, ultra-violet rays, road salts, cleaning agents, insecticides, fertilizers, or other detrimental elements normally encountered in the outdoor environment. (xiii) Housing door seals and gaskets may be manufactured from rubber or synthetic rubber-like elastomer materials. Seals and gaskets shall exhibit a high degree of weatherability with an effective life of at least 30 years in the outdoor environment. The material shall be tear resistant and have a low compression set. (6) Housing finish requirements. (i) All interior and exterior surfaces of housings shall be free from blisters, wrinkles, cracks, scratches, dents, heat marks, and other defects. (ii) There shall be inherent design provisions to prevent objectionable deterioration of the housing such as rusting, exposure of fiber or delamination. Secondary protection, such as galvanizing over steel per ASTM A 526/A 526M&hyph;90 or anodizing over aluminum, shall be provided to ensure reliability over the projected 30 year design life of the housing. (iii) Painted metal housings shall have a minimum gloss of 60 (60 ○ specular) in accordance with ASTM D 523&hyph;89. (iv) All painted surfaces shall have a uniform color and texture in accordance with ASTM D 3928&hyph;89. Nonmetallic housings shall meet recognized industry standards concerning optical appearance for gloss and haze as applicable for the material. (v) The colors of housings that REA will consider for acceptance shall be as follows: ␣ 1Color 1Standard Gray-Green Munsell 6.5 GY 6.03/1.6 ␣ Munsell 4.4 GY 6.74/1.5 Green Munsell 8.8 G 2.65/5.3 Orange Federal Standard 595A ␣ Color Number l2246 ␣ Munsell 0.15YR 5.26/13.15 Chocolate Munsell 5.27YR 2.40/2.60 ␣ Color Number 835 (7) Installation requirements. (i) The design of the housing must provide for a logical and normal installation sequence, i.e., excavation, installation of a foundation or base and anchoring devices, addition of hardware, installation and bonding of cables, splicing, addition of service, and final closing. (ii) No special tools or equipment other than that usually carried by outside plant technicians and construction crews must be required for installation of the housing. Security devices are the exception to this requirement. (iii) Installation hardware shall maintain housings in an erect and stable position when subjected to normal storm loads. Pad-mounted designs must accommodate precast or cast-in-place reinforced concrete or other suitable prefabricated material. Brackets, inserts for fastening, conduit openings, or other items necessary for a pad-mounted installation must be provided. The manufacturer shall provide detailed drawings or a template for locating inserts, conduit openings, or slots for cast-in-place pad construction. (e) Performance criteria and test procedures for housings _(1) General information. (i) The housing manufacturer shall perform adequate inspections and tests to demonstrate that housings and housing components comply with REA requirements. (ii) Testing shall be performed at a room temperature of 24 # 3 ○C (75 # 5 ○C). Temperatures for testing performed at other than room temperature shall be determined as near the center of the product under test as practical.
