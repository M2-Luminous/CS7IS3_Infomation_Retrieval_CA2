President Li Teng-hui issued a message of greetings to mark the occasion, exhorting the Armed Forces to carry forward the Huangpu spirit, to shoulder heavy responsibility, to safeguard national security, to be the cornerstone of social stability, to be the means for building and reforming the nation, and to be the backup force for national unification. President Li said: The founding of the Republic of China [ROC] is aimed at building a wealthy, strong, and unified country to enable all Chinese countrymen to be blessed by the Three Principles of the People. Although this goal has been initially achieved in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, our compatriots on Mainland China are still living under Communist totalitarian rule. Our country is still in a divided state and is still being ruled separately. Moreover, Communist China's threat against Taiwan -- our national rejuvenation base -- has always been there. President Li pointed out: Therefore, currently our work, on the one hand, should be aimed at building up the Armed Forces and heightening combat readiness to ensure Taiwan's security, and at gaining the initiative in developing relations with the mainland. On the other hand, we should endeavor to sustain Taiwan's economic development and to promote democracy and constitutional rule, so that we may use a more spectacular "Taiwan Miracle" to induce a peaceful change on the mainland and to pursue national unification in a democratic way so the people can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth. Therefore, the Armed Forces' tasks not only have not been reduced because of the end of the period of mobilization for suppressing the Communist rebellion; on the contrary, the nation's reliance on the Armed Forces will increase as the country carries out national building and reform in all fields. President Li said: This year marks the 70th anniversary of the founding of the nation's Armed Forces. Over the last 70 years, to fulfill Dr. Sun Yat-sen's wishes and to rescue the nation from great dangers, the Armed Forces, under the leadership of late President Chiang Kai-shek, have successfully carried out the Northern Expedition with a small army against larger ones, and have won the War of Resistance Against Japan with a weaker army against a stronger one. And, over the last 40 years and more, our officers and men of the new generation have smashed Communist China's repeated armed provocations in the Taiwan Strait. They not only have strengthened the national rejuvenation base to provide a secure and stable environment for developing the "Taiwan Miracle," but also have laid a foundation for achieving national unification in a democratic way so the people can enjoy freedom and equal distribution of wealth.
