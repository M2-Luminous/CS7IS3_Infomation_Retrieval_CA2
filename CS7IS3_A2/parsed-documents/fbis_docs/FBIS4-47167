Rubets, head of the Plant Protection Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association, by V. Onenko; place and date not given: "The Fields Are Sensing a Premonition of Trouble. M. Rubets, Head of the Plant Protection Administration of the Ukrahrokhim Association Responds to Questions from the SILSKI VISTI Correspondent"] [Text] [Onenko] Mykola Maksymovych, spring field work is in full swing. What is the phitosanitary situation in the fields? [Rubets] Poor. According to our signalling and forecast service, not many ests died out during the winter. The situation is greatly complicated by a shortage of fuel and lubricants. Because these are scarce, many farms have begun to "simplify" farming techniques. In short, there will be many more weeds, pests, and pathogenes in the fields than in earlier years. [Onenko] Are there enough pesticides to combat these pests? [Rubets] No. There is a shortage of herbicides for applying to the soil when sowing corn, and many farms have planted sugar beets without applying herbicides. We do not have enough fungicides and insecticides to control plant diseases and pests. [Onenko] Did the Ukrahrokhim services fail to do their job? [Rubets] Judge for yourself. Last year, our specialists worked out plans that provided for the production this year of 50,000 metric tons of domestic plant protectants, which would have allowed us to meet 60 percent of the demand for these products in agricultural production. There were plans to put manufacturing lines into operation at Ukrainian chemical enterprises, where the necessary pesticides could have been made from imported active agents. But very little has been done. The Radykal Plant in Kiev started production of copper oxychloride and [utal]. The Pervomaysk Khimprom Production Association (Kharkiv Oblast), which specializes in manufacturing fungicides, is now setting up the production of insecticides and herbicides. However, this is a mere drop in the ocean; the country's chemical enterprises are meeting only 20 percent of the demand for pesticides. We do not expect any improvements in the situation anytime soon, because most of the projects developed by our specialists have been shelved due to the meagerness of the budget allocations for the purchase of the necessary active agents abroad. [Onenko] Are we then compelled to use the services of foreign companies once again? [Rubets] We can expect very little from them, although I do not mean to reproach our foreign partners. Companies in the United States, England, Switzerland, Germany, and other countries have plenty of pesticides and are prepared to sell them. The problem lies elsewhere: the state treasury is empty; there is no hard currency for centralized purchasing of the essential plant protectants. The scraps of hard currency that we receive from time to time from the tender committee of the Cabinet of Ministers are simply not enough. To buy only the minimum amount of the plant protectants we need this year, we need at least 120 million dollars, and 50 million of this sum before 1 May. Ukrahrokhim has been issued only 15 million dollars. You cannot buy very much for this sum. [Onenko] Perhaps the government should make the decision to sell some resources abroad and use the revenues from this sale to purchase the necessary pesticides? A similar measure last year helped to alleviate the situation somewhat. [Rubets] Yes. But the situation has now changed, and not in our favor. The price of our metallurgical and chemical products, which we once sold at a profit on the world market, has now fallen below its production cost. Who is going to trade at a loss? [Onenko] And what about the credit lines promised Ukraine by the United States for buying products needed in agricultural production? [Rubets] Last year, they helped us a great deal. On the credit lines that had been opened, American firms supplied Ukraine with 94 million dollars' worth of protectants. If this were the case today, we would have far fewer problems with our supplies of pesticides. In addition, the country owes these companies large sums of money. As a result, our foreign partners are in no hurry to meet us halfway. [Onenko] What debts are you talking about? [Rubets] Ukrahrokhim had nothing to do with them. This is money owed by Ukrahrobiznes for pesticides delivered to Ukraine the year before last. The foreign firms are quite justified in setting the government of our country, which vouched for Ukrahrobiznes at the time, the following condition: first pay your bills, and then we can talk about concluding agreements regarding our selling you new batches of compounds. Unfortunately, this matter has still not been settled. [Onenko] The situation is critical. Yet, for some reason, existing reserves are not being used. One such reserve would be to inspect and use the plant protectants that have been lying in storage from past years. Why are these not being used? [Rubets] Your suggestion is quite proper. We have already inventoried and recorded these pesticides. We submitted proposals to the State Interdepartmental Commission for Testing and Registering Plant Protectants and Growth Regulators and Fertilizers, which agreed to extend the deadline for the use of these substances. The commission's decision was supported by the opinions of more than thirty experts, all respected cientists. But the Ministry of Public Health has taken a rather odd stand on this matter. It has refused permission for their use and has handed over the pesticides to an interdepartmental committee of experts at the Institute of Labor. I should add that the pesticides had already been subjected to expert analysis by the same Public Health Ministry's Institute of Hygiene and Toxicology. Is it possible that the ministry's top officials do not trust their own scientific institution, which has a great eal of experience in this field? While the papers are passed back and forth between offices, the deadline for using these vitally needed pesticides will pass.
