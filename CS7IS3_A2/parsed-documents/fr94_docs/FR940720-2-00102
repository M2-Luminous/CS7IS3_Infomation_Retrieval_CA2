FR940720-2-00102 FR940720-2-00068 Local Public Document Room location: Salem Free Public library, 112 West Broadway, Salem, New Jersey 08079. Attorney for licensee: Mark J. Wetterhahn, Esquire, Winston and Strawn, 1400 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20005&hyph;3502. NRC Project Director: Charles L. Miller. Rochester Gas and Electric Corporation, Docket No. 50&hyph;244, R. E. Ginna Nuclear Power Plant, Wayne County, New York Date of amendment request: May 13, 1994, as supplemented June 24, 1994. Description of amendment request: The proposed amendment would revise the Ginna Station Technical Specifications (TSs) Section 6.0 ``Administrative Controls,'' to be consistent with the criteria contained in the NRC Final Policy Statement of Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors, and NUREG&hyph;1431 ``Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants,'' September 1993. The proposed amendment would also relocate to other programs and documents, several TS requirements in accordance with this criteria. The May 13, 1994, request supersedes the request of March 23, 1992, published in the Federal Register on November 25, 1992 (57 FR 55589). Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: 1. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The changes are consistent with the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG&hyph;1431 and have therefore, been previously evaluated by the NRC. Implementation of these changes is expected to result in a significant human factors improvement and enable RG&E [Rochester Gas & Electric] and the NRC to focus on the most important requirements without any reduction in safety. The changes which do not duplicate NRC guidance in NUREG&hyph;1431 are currently addressed by existing technical specifications and regulations, the Ginna Station license, plant procedures, or the QA [Quality Assurance] program. 2. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. The Administrative Controls section contains those requirements that are not covered by other technical specifications which are considered necessary to assure safe operation of the facility. The majority of changes are consistent with the Final Policy Statement on Technical Specifications Improvements for Nuclear Power Reactors and NUREG&hyph;1431 and have therefore, been previously evaluated by the NRC. [*␣*␣*]. 3. Operation of Ginna Station in accordance with the proposed changes does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. All requirements removed from technical specifications are relocated to other programs and documents. These alternative programs and documents are controlled by existing regulations which provide a more appropriate vehicle for addressing changes and compliance. There were no administrative control requirements which were removed from technical specifications and not addressed by other regulations. Therefore, there is no significant reduction in a margin of safety. The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this review, it appears that the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) are satisfied. Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request involves no significant hazards consideration.
