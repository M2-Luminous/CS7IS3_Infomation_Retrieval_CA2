Dr. Sha'th said that this round has achieved considerable progress despite the difficulty it faced in the beginning. Meanwhile Shahaq said that the round was positive and fruitful and that the two sides were very close to signing an agreement on the implementation of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho. At their news conferences, they said that the new round which is to start next Sunday will be that last. While Nabil Sha'th expects a final agreement to be signed between 2 and 5 May by the Palestinian president, brother Abu Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat], and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin, General Shahaq was more reserved and did not give a date for the signing. [passage omitted] Shahaq said that the two sides are awaiting the results of the meetings of the economic committee in Paris to include them in the resolutions which have been finalized in order to reach a general agreement. [passage omitted] Meanwhile the heads of the Palestinian and Israeli delegations to the economic talks in Paris have decided to hold consultations with their presidents because of the obstacles which they cannot overcome through negotiations. Sources in the two delegations said that Avraham Shohat, Israeli finance minister and head of the Israeli delegation to the economic talks, has indeed left Paris this morning for Israel. The official spokesman of the Israeli delegation, Eric Gordan, said that Shohat will attend next Sunday's Israeli cabinet meeting. Meanwhile, Samir Hulaylah, member of the Israeli delegation, said that brother Abu-al-'Ala', director of the PLO's Economic Department, will also leave Paris for Tunis where he is to brief the PLO leadership on the progress of the economic talks. Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' are expected to return to Paris on Monday afternoon. The two delegations could not reach an agreement on customs policy and on matters regarding Palestinian manpower.
