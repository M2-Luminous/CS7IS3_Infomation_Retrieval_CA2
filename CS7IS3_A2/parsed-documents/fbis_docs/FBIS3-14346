Andoni] [Text] Israel has agreed to the deployment of a lightly armed 50-man Norwegian observer unit and an equal number of a Palestinian police force in the city of Hebron but the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) is seeking to expand the unit to two multi-national battalions including senior Egyptian officers. Israel will respond to the Palestinian proposals when the talks, which were adjourned in Cairo yesterday, resume after the two delegations deliberate with their two respective leaderships. The PLO is also awaiting a response to the deployment of a 8,000-9,000 Palestinian police force in Jericho and the Gaza Strip. PLO officials in Tunis expected the Palestinian force to cross from Jordan and Egypt by April 13, the agreed upon date for Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Israel has suggested speeding up the withdrawal in return for resumption of Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, but the PLO wanted to get security guarantees that will end the curfew in Hebron before going back to the negotiating table. "The way things are moving the actual beginning of the implementation will be delayed for two or three weeks, but we cannot resume negotiations without seeing real change in the situation on the ground especially in Hebron," a PLO official said. According to Tunis-based PLO officials, Israel has not officially conceded to demands to evict 450 Israeli settlers from the centre of Hebron. "The Israelis could not give a word or any promises regarding the settlers," said one PLO official. The Israelis have implied, however, that the government was considering specific measures. PLO officials said that the Israeli negotiators refused to elaborate. Israel, the officials said, will be studying a suggestion, initially put forward by Norway, that it take unilateral measures without prior public announcements, but the PLO prefers that a third party, most probably Norway, will act as a guarantor to ensure follow-up of whatever process the Israeli government decides to start regarding the settlers. Meanwhile, PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat, who has personally insisted on the participation of senior Egyptian officers in the foreign observing force, is satisfied with Israel's acceptance of the principle of foreign observers but he wanted to make sure that it will be a prelude to international protection for Palestinians across the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. The officials said that Israel had stipulated that light arms will be confined to pistols only--something that seems to satisfy the PLO leadership's demands at this point. But what PLO leaders seem to fear the most is for Israel to use the siege on Hebron as bargaining chip to pressure Hebronites and the Palestinians to drop other demands concerning the settlers and the settlements. Critics of Mr. 'Arafat argue that he has not held out long enough to make Israel budge, and that if he does not take a firm stand, lifting the curfew on Hebron will be used by Israel to extract Palestinian concessions. Furthermore, the 20-hour siege of Hebron last week, when the Israeli army blasted a hideout for Hamas members and destroyed or damaged neighbouring houses in the process, has presented the PLO with a challenge of how secure protection of Palestinians against Israel army clampdowns. A United Nations Security Council resolution passed two weeks ago, reaffirmed the applicability of the Forth Geneva Convention, that practically bans an occupying power from conducting such clampdowns on people under occupation, on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem. It was unclear so far, based on contacts with PLO officials in Tunis, whether that tentatively agreed upon deployment of foreign observers will be authorised to prevent Israeli violations of the Geneva convention.
