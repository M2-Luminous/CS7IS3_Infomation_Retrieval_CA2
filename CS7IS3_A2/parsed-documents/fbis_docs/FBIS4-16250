The Belarusian Ministry of Defense is eager to take military counterintelligence under its wing and turning it into a puppet special service. It cannot be ruled out that the republican KGB's military counterintelligence directorate will also be dissolved. A development of events whereby the matter will be restricted to internal reform of the directorate is also possible. The question of replacing the leadership of military counterintelligence is also on the agenda. Its present head Valeriy Kez, deputy chairman of the Belarusian KGB and a professional counterintelligence worker with experience of work in combat situations behind him, is no longer to the liking of influential persons in the government. What factors brought about this situation? Matters are in a better shape in military counterintelligence than in many other law enforcement structures. Here are just two examples. In May last year, on the basis of material prepared by counterintelligence workers, criminal procedures were instituted against 10 border guards who had been systematically stealing video equipment and other valuables from trains. It is quite interesting that a further 68 guardians of the Motherland's borders are being brought as witnesses in these cases. A little more than one year ago, thanks to military counterintelligence work, a trade transaction involving the sale, with the agreement of the Ministry of Defense, of the "Igla" portable antiaircraft missile complex by the state-owned foreign trading firm "Belarusintorg" was thwarted. This weapon, incidentally, has no counterpart in the world in its combat qualities and, according to international classification, can also be a terrorist weapon ("Igla" is highly compact, and capable of destroying more than just aerial targets). Military counterintelligence is a structure having everything necessary for autonomous existence: intelligence, counterintelligence, analysis, and investigations subdivisions. It is quite capable of becoming an autonomous federal organ under the control of the Supreme Soviet or the government. The experience of Ukraine, where military counterintelligence was merged with territorial subdivisions of the security service, followed by the reverse process, is sufficiently indicative. Nor did Russia take the risk of handing over military counterintelligence to the Ministry of Defense. Belarusian reformers are driven by other motives. Their complaints against military counterintelligence are political rather than professional. It is perfectly obvious that publicizing the negative aspects of the activity of the Ministry of Defense and the Border Guard Troops is not to the liking of their leaders, Pavel Kozlovskiy and Yevgeniy Bocharov. The latter has found an original way out of the situation by creating, with the tacit consent of the Council of Ministers, his own special service -- the Special Active Measures Service [otdelnaya sluzhba aktivnykh mer]. Today high-ranking functionaries are seeking to make the law enforcement organs not simply an instrument in the struggle for power, but actually an instrument protecting the interests of one political grouping or another. The first blow to the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] and the KGB was dealt in January this year. Using the arrest and extradition to Vilnius of two leaders of the Lithuanian Communist Party, who had been hiding for a long time on the republic's territory, as a pretext for creating a scandal, the government lobby settled its accounts with power ministers Vladimir Yegorov and Eduard Shirkovskiy. They were too autonomous for the Council of Ministers and permitted themselves unheard-of audacities, such as appealing to the leaders of the republic in connection with interference in their activity by Gennadiy Danilov, "[Prime Minister] Kebich's right-hand man." At that time Danilov occupied the post of state secretary for combatting crime and for national security. Following publication of the letter from Shirkovskiy and Yegorov by the mass media the prime minister promised to abolish the State Secretariat. But matters went no further than a change of names: The former State Secretariat is now called Administration for Coordinating the Activity of Administrative Organs. Danilov himself took up the post of government secretary, with undefined duties and unlimited powers. Yegorov was replaced by Vladimir Danko, who made himself famous by declaring in one of his first press conferences his membership of the Communist Party. At the moment it is hard to say anything definite about Gennadiy Lavitskiy, the new KGB chairman. But he and Danko are far more loyal to the Council of Ministers than their predecessors. It would appear that military counterintelligence is again in hot water. The scandal over the theft of documents from a car belonging to Iosif Seredich, chief editor of the parliamentary newspaper, is being used as a pretext for firing Valeriy Kez. This scandal may not have provoked widespread reaction. But these documents contained not only information on crimes committed by the border guards, but also on certain unofficial links between Border Guard Troops Commander Yevgeniy Bocharov and Hryb, Danilov, and Lavitskiy. The evidence was passed to a journalist by a military counterintelligence officer fired from the State Security organs on the instruction of the KGB leadership. These documents were deemed unclassified on the basis of the results of an official investigation in December. But one month ago the Council of Ministers instigated a new investigation, whose conclusions turned out to be diametrically opposite. The Belarusian KGB Collegium, at its session in the second half of March, refused to adopt a decree on Kez' resignation. Now the solution of this question has been left to the discretion of the relevant parliamentary commission. According to available information, this commission is already preparing to replace Kez. It is expected that Colonel Valentin Simirskiy will become head of military counterintelligence. For the past five years he has led the Russian 1st Tank Army military counterintelligence department. It is interesting to note that, at the time when Simirskiy was serving in a formation of the Russian group of forces in Germany, Danilov's daughter was also posted there. A strange situation, is it not: The daughter of a high-ranking government functionary serving in the army of another state? In this case military counterintelligence will evidently cease to ask unnecessary questions. Many military counterintelligence officers, tired of the intrigues developing around their department, have submitted separation requests. Work in the security services of commercial structures awaits them. Certain counterintelligence workers are still hoping for a dignified solution to the question, but they too will leave if the Ministry of Defense or anyone else make a "puppet" of the special service. The collapse of the military counterintelligence service will hardly be to the benefit of sovereign Belarus. But when state functionaries allow considerations of personal benefit to get the better of state interests, it is hard to expect a different development of events.
