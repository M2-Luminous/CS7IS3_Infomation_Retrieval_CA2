Substances capable of forming solid solutions with periclase, which have lattice defects and thereby accelerate diffusion processes, significantly affect solid phase sintering. Effective activity has been observed in oxides having greater valency than magnesium. There appears to be contradictory evidence in the case of interaction of magnesium oxide with CeO[.sub]2[/] and Nd[.sub]2[/]O[.sub]3[/]. In the present work with these oxides, phase composition of calcined samples was controlled with a special device and lattice parameters were deduced from profile lines obtained by scanning diffractometry. Microstructure was studied with both reflected and transmitted light. The results of the investigation led to the development of a technology for the preparation of a vacuum-tight structured periclase ceramic which functions successfully while in contact with melts and vapors of high-melting alkali metals and carbons. Stable metal-ceramic structural materials of the ceramic-alloyed steel-ceramic type, capable of being used in electronics and magnetohydrodynamics, were prepared by thermal-compression welding under vacuum.
