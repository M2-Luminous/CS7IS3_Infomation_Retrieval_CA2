"Our policy in Jordan has always been that we are committed to the Palestinians' right of return," Mr. Hammad told a group of Jordanian journalists, adding that when the Kingdom was assured of this right, "we simplified the crossing procedures at the bridge while still maintaining our commitment to that right. "Our principle of countering Israeli attempts to empty the territories of Palestinian citizens was finished with this signature (by the PLO and Israel)," he added. Mr. Hammad said that initial statistics showed that movement across the bridge had already indicated a decrease in the number, by almost half, of Palestinians who cross the bridge into Jordan, an indication which he interpreted to mean that the measures did not backfire as was feared by some Jordanians. Conceding that the PLO-Israel agreement will have to be implemented in stages and after tough negotiations between Israel and the PLO, and that Jordan cannot merely rely on Israeli good intentions, Mr. Hammad stressed that the "principle of return is there." "The preliminary indications, until now, is that these measures have contributed to increase the return of Palestinians to the occupied territories and not the other way around," Mr. Hammad said. Some Jordanian politicians and analysts have warned that facilitating the crossing into Jordan from the West Bank may encourage Palestinians living under occupation to flee to the Kingdom where they may later lose their right to return to their homeland. The minister was careful to point out that these regulations will continue to be "updated and amended to go along with the developments across the bridge." He said that if Jordan continues to receive guarantees that protect the Palestinians' rights of staying in their homeland, "Jordan may feel that there will be no need for the department of inspection and control." The department was established in 1982 as the authority at the Ministry of Interior directly in charge of the affairs of West Bank citizens and those carrying family reunification papers for the occupied territories. Mr. Hammad pointed out that the new crossing measures, issued at the instructions of His Royal Highness Crown Prince Hasan when he met with the secretary-generals of the different ministries two weeks ago, are a mix of easing up of measures adopted in 1988, when Jordan severed legal and administrative ties with the West Bank, and others that were taken since then. He said that one of the procedures that was stopped by the new regulations was taking travellers' documents at the bridge to make them visit the inspections and control department to follow up on their cases. "We initially took these measures when Israel allowed only 10,000 to 15,000 Palestinian labourers, out of around 120,000 to work in Israel," Mr. Hammad explained. "Israel at that time started giving young Palestinians exit permits but after making them sign a commitment not to return for a number of years," Mr. Hammad said, pointing out that Jordan's measure at the time was to guard against Palestinian youth running away to better working conditions only to find that they had lost their right of return. He said the Ministry of Interior had already prepared studies on ways to facilitate the crossing of the King Husayn Bridge in anticipation of any improvement on the Palestinian front. "When His Royal Highness raised the issue with us we were prepared to take the necessary steps," Mr. Hammad said. "We announced the easing up of procedures at the bridge but we continued to guard the principle that has always guided us and that is to protect the rights of the Palestinians," he said. "We want our procedures to be humane and civilised," he added. Election Law Mr. Hammad told the group of Journalists that his ministry had prepared the "administrative and technical mechanism" for a new election law but had not yet prepared a draft for the division of voter districts or the number of parliamentary seats, which, he said, "will be determined by the final arrangements for civil districts." "We do not know yet whether the Kingdom will be treated as one voting district or whether it will follow the division of civil districts," Mr. Hammad said. He also said that anyone who enjoys a Jordanian nationality "will be allowed to vote regardless of his origin and whether he is residing in Jordan or outside." In an answer to a specific question on whether Jordanian nationals who also carry Palestinian reunification papers--which amount to a residency in the occupied territories--will be allowed to vote in the next elections, Mr. Hammad stressed that those who "carry the Jordanian nationality will be able to vote regardless of where they reside and those in the West Bank are no exception if they carry the Jordanian nationality." He pointed out that this excludes holders of the two-year passports since that passport is a travel document and not proof of nationality. He said that the new "administrative and technical" amendments include allowing citizens to register according to their national numbers given to them by the Civil Service Commission and not by their family books as had been the practice in the 1989 elections. An important amendment to the Elections Law, Mr. Hammad said, is that the voting and the vote count will be conducted at the same centre and ballots will not be moved to the governor's office to avoid "criticism or unfounded charges." He said that the principle of finding a mechanism which will allow Jordanian expatriate communities to vote in their areas of residence is being studied, but that the final decision over "whether registration has to be made in Jordan or whether it can be done in Jordanian embassies outside has not been reached." On his meeting he had with the heads of political parties in the Kingdom last Thursday, Mr. Hammad said that the two and a half hour encounter served to "strengthen the relationship between the Ministry of Interior and the secretary generals of political parties." He said that some of the participants asked that the government "help allocate funds for the operations of political parties," while some others argued against the concept. "I asked them to put their request in a memorandum signed by all of them and that I would carry their request to the government," Mr. Hammad said. The minister also pledge to provide the political parties with any information they need on agreements signed by Jordan or protocols with other countries. "Each party will appoint a representative who will stay in touch with the ministry over information requests," he said. On requests for air time on Jordan Television or the inclusion of their papers' editorials on the "press briefs programme" carried on JTV, Mr. Hammad said that he explained that since the parties have their own newspapers they could work to "provide something different" in those papers since television time "would be completely taken up" if all 22 political parties were vying for equal time. He said that the secretary-generals complained about the small percentage of Jordanians who are willing to become members of political parties. "But I told them that this problem cannot be blamed on the government. Let them come up with something new and practical, and they will see better results." On complaints that the government "has been intervening in the running of professional associations," Mr. Hammad said that he told them "that they are the ones interfering in the work of the professional associations by politicising bodies that should be working on improving conditions for their members." On specific complaints of intervention in the associations, Mr. Hammad said, "I advised them that problems like this should be taken to courts where the law can be the decisive word."
