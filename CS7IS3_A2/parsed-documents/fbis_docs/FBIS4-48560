Announcing these in a press release, the Electoral Commission said in the presidential race, the final results are as follows: Mr. Bakili Muluzi, 1,404,754 votes; Dr. Kamuzu Banda, 996,363; Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, 552,862 votes; Mr. Kampelo Kaluwa, 15,624. In the parliamentary election the distribution of seats is 84 seats for UDF [United Democratic Front]; 65 seats for MCP [Malawi Congress Party] and 36 seats for Aford [Alliance for Democracy]; the rest of the contesting parties did not win a single seat. The Electoral Commission has also nullified the results in two constituencies in Nsanje, namely, Nsanje north and Nsanje southwest. This follows the commission's investigation of complaints of irregularities in these constituencies. The commission discovered that at one station figures kept by all monitors did not agree with the official figure and that some important documents like ballot paper counterfoils, original forms for results, were missing. In another station, the ballot papers used during the elections were missing. The elections in the two constituencies will be rerun. The Electoral Commission will announce details of the by-elections later.
