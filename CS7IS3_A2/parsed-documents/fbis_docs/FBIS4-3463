As a result, major progress was achieved in various fields of work. A total of 222,080 cases were tried and concluded in the year, an increase of 11.01 percent over the previous year; of which, 1,932 cases were concluded by the provincial higher people's court, up 10.34 percent. They played their due role in safeguarding social stability, promoting the struggle against corruption, and serving the interests of reform, opening up, and the establishment of a socialist market economy. The following is a report on major aspects of their work for your examination and deliberation: 1. Firmly Implementing the Policy of Dealing Heavy Blows to Serious Crimes, Safeguarding Social Stability, and Cracking Down on Corruption To Create a Fine Environment for Reform, Opening up, and Economic Construction For the past year, Jiangsu's situation in public order was stable. However, there were still factors threatening social stability and affecting economic development. Serious criminal offenses rose, major serious cases became more prominent, and social evils spread despite repeated bans. In light of this, courts at all levels consistently regarded the struggle against serious crimes as their primary task, made full use of their functions of dictatorship [zhuan zheng 1413 2398], and promptly launched intensive efforts to deal heavy blows to serious crimes and special drives to improve public order. A total of 23,331 criminal cases of first instance was received during the year, 22,066 cases were concluded, and 26,807 criminals were sentenced, roughly the same as the previous year. Of the convicted, 2,647 were sentenced to prison terms of more than 10 years, life imprisonment, or death (including death with reprieve), up 3.64 percent over the previous year. This satisfied the demand to impose stricter sentences in accordance with the law. Courts also stepped up their efforts to target their campaign against prominent problems in public order. Particularly beginning last June, they swiftly implemented the guidelines of the third meeting of the Central Commission on Politics and Law and the provincial conference on judicial and public security work and launched a concentrated attack on serious crimes from June to September. A total of 7,045 criminal cases endangering public order were tried and concluded in accordance with the law, and 8,666 criminals were convicted. Of the convicts, 499 were given sentences heavier than life imprisonment. Special efforts were made to crack down on major targets. During the four months, 4,409 culprits of serious crimes were punished, including gangsters and thugs in the transportation sector, key elements of criminal gangs, murderers, robbers, rapists, major ruffians, kidnappers who killed hostages, and major burglars. This effectively deflated the swollen arrogance of criminal elements and curbed the momentum of the outbreak of heinous crimes. We decided to take investigating and handling major cases as the breakthrough point in dealing heavy blows to serious economic crimes and in promoting the deep-going development of the anticorruption struggle. During the first half of the year, the number of cases of economic crimes handled by people's courts declined by 51.14 percent compared with the same period in the previous year. Following the major arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the provincial party committee on launching struggles against corruption, people's courts at various levels stressed cracking down on economic crimes in the struggle against corruption. Taking the trial of major cases as the breakthrough point, people's courts strengthened efforts to crack down on crimes. In the second half of last year, the number of cases concluded increased significantly, increasing by 206 percent as compared with that of the first half of the year. Various people's courts handled 1,753 cases of economic crimes of various kinds; concluded the trial of 1,595 cases; and passed sentence on 1,390 people, of which 21 were sentenced to life imprisonment and death (including suspension of execution). Various people's courts gave prominence to the trial of major and serious cases of crimes in enforcing macrocontrol and launching the anticorruption struggle, including cases of bribery, embezzlement, and smuggling. In the whole year, various people's courts handled 647 cases of serious economic crimes, involving more than 10,000 yuan in each case, and punished 672 people who received more than 10,000 yuan of illegal income per person. While punishing criminals, people's courts at various levels also carried out the task of comprehensive management of social order. They vigorously strengthened the trial of civil cases, and concluded 98,684 cases of civil disputes in first instance, of which marriage and family disputes accounted for 53.17 percent. They also made efforts to prevent aggravation of contradictions, and handled 1,719 cases to transform contradictions. They also strengthened the trial of administrative cases to maintain social security and state administrative order and to protect the lawful rights and benefits of citizens and legal persons. People's courts concluded the trial of 747 administative cases in the first instance. They improved procedures to facilitate the people's lodging complaints, seriously handled a large number of people's letters and visits, and promptly handled 3,976 cases of complaints lodged by the people. They actively handled cases of mitigation of punishment and parole, including 8,957 cases of mitigation of punishment and 892 cases of parole. Concerning crimes committed by juveniles, they attached importance to educating juveniles and handled 2,009 cases of crimes committed by 2,787 juveniles. They invited 613 people from educational, trade union, youth, and women's organizations to take part in adjudication. They further strengthened the establishment of juvenile courts. Thirteen peole's courts set up juvenile courts to provide all-out judicial protection for juveniles. 2. Employ the Function of Trial To Adjust Economic Relations and Serve Macrocontrol and the Establishment of a Socialsit Market Economic Structure Last year was a year of relatively fast economic development in this province and also a year of change from the old to new economic system. Using the function of adjudication to strengthen the adjustment of economic relations was a prominent task of the people's courts. Judging from the handling of various economic cases in the whole province, there were three special features: First, the number of cases related to the market economy increased. Various people's courts handled 85,926 cases of economic disputes in the first instance, increasing by 27.53 percent as compared with the previous year. Of this, the number of cases of disputes in procurement and marketing, loans and rentals, contract operation of enterprises, leasing operation of enterprises and compensatory trade contracts all rose by more than 50 percent. Second, the amount of money involved in those cases rose by a great extent. Various people's courts concluded the trial of 75,672 cases of economic disputes in the first instance, involving a total amount of 5.025 billion yuan or 156.12 percent more than the total amount of money involved in those cases in the previous year. Third, new types of cases emerged constantly. Those special features and changes reflected the deepening of the reform of the economic structure and the development of the socialist market economy in this province. Correct and prompt handling of cases closely related to strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control ensured the implementation of the policy of exercising macroeconomic regulation and control. After the Central Committee issued its Document No. 6 and after the provincial party committee held its economic conference in mid-July, people's courts in Jiangsu intensified their efforts in handling cases about macroeconomic regulation and control. From July to the end of the year, they finished examining 61,124 cases of this nature, including 21,074 cases of economic disputes involving 2.319 billion yuan. People's courts especially intensified their efforts in handling disputes over securities, stocks, fund raising, bills, and loans -- problems occurring while putting banking operations in order -- and particularly cases concerning loan liquidation and collection, creditor's rights, and debts. People's courts also assisted enterprises to liquidate debts and helped enterprises, banks, and other units retrieve 1.033 billion yuan. People's courts' efforts in regulating the market's economic relations promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system. People's courts stopped illegitimate competition through handling cases and protecting legitimate competition. We also strictly dealt with cases of producing and marketing counterfeit and inferior goods; censured infringement of patent rights, registered trademarks, and copyright as well as defamation of enterprises' reputation and names. We handled a total of 363 cases of this nature. People's courts in Jiangsu also intensified handling new cases occurring during the formation and development of various forms of markets. Our accomplishment in handling 5,078 cases concerning credit, securities, bills, interbanking loans, technology-related contracts, labor disputes, real estate, and other problems occurring in the financial, labor, technology, information, and real estate markets in 1993 expedited Jiangsu's market development. We also intensified our efforts in handling cases relevant to the replacement of state enterprises' operating mechanisms and our accomplishment in handling 9,546 cases concerning disputes over enterprises' contractual operations, stock system, partnership, merger, lease, and sales pushed these enterprises to the market. People's courts in Jiangsu also kept pace with rural reforms and served rural economic development. Our efforts in handling 34,303 cases on rural contracts, disputes between village and town enterprises, and socialized services in rural areas ensured the revitalization of all economic sectors in rural areas. Earnestly implementing the central policy of reducing peasants' burdens, we tried 9,736 cases about peasants' excessive burdens. Our efforts in handling economic cases involving foreign nationals or countrymen in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan facilitated the development of Jiangsu's export-oriented economy. We accepted a total of 44 of these new cases in 1994, or 38 more than those accepted in 1992. We fully exercised our judicial jurisdiction and our impartial arbitration protected the legitimate rights and interests of both sides. Attaching great importance to handling disputes among foreign-funded enterprises, we finished handling 444 cases of this nature, which involved 106 million yuan. By doing this we created a good judicial environment for foreign businessmen. We also prompted the government to change its administrative functions by actively proceeding with the handling of administrative cases closely related to the market economy. We finished handling 461 administrative cases regarding business management, tax collection, banking management, urban construction, foreign exchange control, and environmental protection; and we supported administrative organs in controlling and stopping unwarranted fee levies, prorations, and fines as well as infringement of enterprises' operating autonomy. We intensified law enforcement and made continual efforts in enforcing verdicts that had been pronounced. In 1993, people's courts at all levels enforced verdicts on 79,398 cases, or 86.32 percent of all verdicts. Not only was this 12.84 percentage points higher than that a year ago as well as the highest in recent years, but it also exceeded the 80 percent target. The provincial higher people's court also intensified its efforts in providing people's courts in Jiangsu with macroscopic guidance and in coordinating the handling of major, complex, and difficult cases. Thanks to support from local party committees, people's congresses, and governments, people's courts in various parts of Jiangsu launched joint or special campaigns of varying sizes between regions, provinces, or cities to enforce verdicts; and we also made constant efforts in exploring and improving enforcement methods to improve enforcement efficiency. 3. Vigorously Explore Ways To Reform the Work of Law Courts, Persist in Strict Law Enforcement, and Comprehensively Raise Judicial Levels In the face of conspicuous contradictions -- increasingly heavy tasks, progressively increasing number of various cases year after year, and a serious shortage of judicial personnel -- law courts at all levels vigorously explored ways to reform methods of hearing civil and economic cases and to improve work efficiency. Focusing attention on reforming court trials, they further stressed a litigant's responsibility to produce evidence, thereby shifting the focus of judicial activities from a venue outside the court to the court and from conducting investigations outside the court for verification of evidence to producing and questioning evidence during trial. Many law courts experimented with the method of directly opening a court session after a case was placed on file in accordance with the law; their experiment enabled our reform of judicial methods to take a step forward. The economic disputes mediation center enjoyed new development of its work. Giving convenience to its clients by doing a quick and highly efficient job, it solved 9,694 cases of economic disputes involving a total amount of 1,237 million yuan through mediation. The figures posted an increase of 209 and 363 percent, respectively, over the previous year. The mediation center further improved its standardization. Law courts at all levels further enhanced their consciousness of law enforcement, cultivated the mentality of "giving top priority to quality," and strived to make every case they handled pass the examination of history. In particular, they made sure that all big, important cases they handled become "iron [incontestable] cases." Sixty defendants in criminal cases were pronounced not guilty in accordance with the law. They insisted on conducting public trials; public trials of 97.94 percent of various cases were conducted by law courts across the province. They further improved their internal mechanism for law enforcement; established and improved various systems for handling cases; and paid close attention to their implementation. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court drew up "Interim Provisions on Investigating and Determining the Responsibility for Cases Which Have Been Given Wrong Verdicts." The provisions played an important role in ensuring strict law enforcement after they went into effect in the whole province. A total of nine cases and nine persons were investigated for handling cases in violation of the law in the whole year. We strengthened supervision over court trials and improved guidance for judicial work. When law courts at the higher level discovered mistakes in the court decisions pronouced by those at the lower level, they resolutely corrected them in accordance with the law. In the whole year, law courts at the higher level wound up a total of 11,086 various cases in the second instance; they changed court decisions pronounced on 1,938 cases by those at the lower level or requested that a trial be conducted again for some of them. We conscientiously handled cases lodged by procuratorial organs in protest of verdicts rendered, and corrected verdicts which were indeed wrong in accordance with the law. We wound up a total of 60 cases protesting verdicts given, and changed the verdicts for 32 cases or requested that a trial be conducted again for some of them. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court persisted in conducting survey and study of the new situations and new problems confronting judicial work under the conditions of a market economy, and improved job-related guidance for courts at the lower level. It drew up a total of 13 various standardized documents suitable for legal guidance. 4. Vigorously Strengthen the Building of the Contingents of Personnel of Law Courts and Lay a Sound Foundation in the Grass-Roots Units To Guarantee That Judicial Work Is Carried Out Effectively In compliance with the new requirements on the contingents of cadres raised by our reform and opening up and by the new situation under a socialist market economy, people's courts at all levels persisted in attaching equal importance to judicial work and the building of their contingents of working personnel; comprehensively enhanced the political integrity of cadres and police and improved their professional quality; and achieved marked successes in building their contingents of working personnel. The Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court commended 19 advanced collectives and 47 advanced individuals throughout the year. Among them, 13 units earned a collective award of merit, second class, and four individuals award of merit, first class. We improved ideological and political work by making education in the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics our central task. In particular, after the publication of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and the convocation of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court issued a special circular on plans for study. Law courts in the whole province looked upon the task as an important one for building ideology and for theoretical education and handled it accordingly; they implemented Comrade Deng Xiaoping's basic thinking as well as the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee in various court tasks by closely integrating their implementation with the actual conditions of judicial work. They aggressively launched the anticorruption drive to promote the building of a clean and honest government. Law courts across the province conscientiously carried out the plans adopted by the Second Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the Seventh Plenary Session of the Jiangsu Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and the Supreme People's Court on launching the anticorruption drive; conducted intensive study; and checked up on efforts to put banking operations in order, to help enterprises liquidate debts, to make corrections, and so forth. In the second half of the year, we organized law courts across the province to conduct a general inspection of law enforcement and promotion of a clean and honest government with the anticorruption drive playing the dominant role. While urging law courts at all levels to conduct self-inspection and to correct themselves, the Jiangsu Provincial Higher People's Court and all intermediate people's courts assigned a total of 110 persons to form inspection teams to check up on law courts at two levels in 11 cities. The implementation of the "five prohibitions" ruled by the central authorities and the "three requirements" raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee was made possible through the anticorruption drive and through the general inspection of law enforcement and promotion of a clean and honest government. The 61 enterprises run by law courts in all areas already either had their business operating licenses revoked or terminated their connection with law courts; all 37 personnel who had bought and sold stocks completed the procedures for the transfer of their stocks; the two persons who had accepted money and negotiable securities worth a total of 1,600 yuan offered to them as a present returned what they had taken; and money accepted from convicts as a pledge for their probation and as fees for their exemption from re-education were all returned. Law courts investigated and punished 34 cadres and police who had violated the law and discipline. We persisted in strict management of the court and conscientiously changed our work style. After the first session of the eighth provincial people's congress, the Provincial People's Higher Court, based on the views and proposals put forward by the people's deputies, promptly issued the "Circular on Earnestly Drawing People's Deputies' Views To Further Improve Judicial Work" to courts across the province, putting forward solutions. In the light of views voiced during the re-election of the people's congresses on judicial work, courts at all levels unfolded widespread activities to strengthen and reform their work as well as to rectify their work style to bring about marked improvements in law enforcement and work style. Courts in such cities as Yancheng, Xuzhou, Yangzhou, and Lianyungang took the initiative to support and cooperate with people's deputies in their appraisal activities, earnestly examining and rectifying themselves and implementing rectification and reform measures one-by-one in accordance with the deputies' views. We persisted in integrating academic education with on-the-job training, strengthening the upbringing of qualified judicial personnel proficient in the four areas of law, economics, market, and foreign language. Over the past year, 36 more cadres obtained graduate or post-graduate degrees, 290 judicial personnel were awarded the legal profession certificate of the part-time Law University under the court, raising the provincial ratio of court cadres and policemen with qualifications in higher education to 52 percent. We conducted eight provincial on-the-job professional training courses, training 748 key personnel from the judicial profession. We paid serious attention to the basic building of the grass roots to further strengthen the work of the people's court. In line with the principle of replenishing the grass roots, we set up 12 more people's courts to bring the total number of people's courts in the province to 566. We further improved the work of the leading group for people's court work to strengthen leadership; conducted regular investigations and study to sum up and exchange the people's courts' work and development experiences and promptly resolve existing difficulties and problems; strengthened professional guidance and upgraded the professional skill of people's court cadres by setting up contact stations and organizing joint handling of cases and court sessions for the purpose of professional discussion and study, rotational professional training, etc.; unfolded activities for standardization in the people's courts and established and improved various work and management systems; and vigorously conducted activities to produce advanced and excellent work performance. The provincial people's higher court organized a provincial appraisal of advanced people's courts, commending 42 people's courts and awarding the collective merit citation, second class, to three people's courts. During the year, people's courts across the province handled all kinds of cases -- 100,051 in all, accouting for 50.74 percent of all court cases in the province, and mediated and dealt with 10,464 simple disputes. The major problems and difficulties in judicial work in 1993 were: A small number of courts lacked initiative in giving full play to the judicial function of serving the establishment and development of the socialist market economic system; loose law enforcement continued to exist, with quite a number of local courts emphasizing entities over procedures, poorly handling some cases, taking excessively long periods to settle some cases, and impairing the social effect of case handling; under pronounced local as well as departmental protectionism, the difficult situation in enforcing court decisions and rulings on financial and civil cases was not fundamentally changed; unhealthy social practices interfered with judicial work rather seriously, with a handful of cadres and policemen failing to withstand the challeges of reform, opening up to the outside world, and the market economy and violating the law and discipline more frequently and seriously than in past years; quite a number of courts, especially those in northern Jiangsu, faced a shortage of case handling funds and continued to be weighed down by the heavy task of building courts at two local levels which restrained judicial work to a certain degree. Fellow deputies! In 1994, courts at all levels in the province will persistently follow the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee and will stress the proper trial of serious and major cases and the improvement of the way of trial, in further, comprehensively strengthening various judicial work, strictly enforcing the law, upgrading the administration of justice, and serving to safeguard social stability, promoting clean administration, and accelerating the establishment of a socialist market economic system. We will continue to carry out the struggle of "dealing heavy blows to serious crimes" to sternly crack down on serious criminal acts and economic crimes; give further play to the judicial function, and vigorously regulate economic relationships to better serve the socialist market economy; deepen and improve court reform and persist in strict law enforcement; and conscientiously strengthen efforts to beef up the ranks to upgrade the caliber and standard of law enforcement. In this new year, we will strive to make a mark in dealing heavy blows to serious crimes, produce results in dealing with serious and major cases, make great progress in regulating economic relationships, and comprehensively upgrade the administration of justice. I believe people's courts at all levels across the province will certainly be able to accomplish the various judicial tasks the new period has entrusted to them, by working under the leadership of the party committees and the supervision of the people's congresses and their standing committees and by relying on the support of the vast number of people across the province and the unity and struggle of all their cadres and policemen.
