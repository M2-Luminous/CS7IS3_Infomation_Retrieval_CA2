"If it turned out, however, that the idea of a united Europe could become unreal and illusory, and all my conversation partners had these fears, then we would of course have to think of forming something that represents Central Europe in the political sense, that is more intense and even institutionalized cooperation," he said. He added that he hoped this would not be necessary and that the idea of a united Europe would remain a reality. Kucan said his invitation to the summit, which began on Friday [15 April] and ended this afternoon, implied great recognition of Slovenia and positive appraisal of the fact that the country's reforms allow it to cooperate with other Central European countries in their striving for integration. Kucan was joined by the presidents of Slovakia, Germany, Austria, Hungary and Poland and Czech President Vaclav Havel, who initiated and hosted the event.
