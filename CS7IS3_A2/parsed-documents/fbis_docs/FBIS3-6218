Japan is shelving the decision on whether to restrict or keep allowing the services, an official at the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry said, noting that global attention is fixed on Japan and the United States. "We are seeking a compromise measure...but Japan cannot move alone on an issue that requires international adjustments," said Hirokazu Suda, director of the ministry's tariff division at the ministry's Telecommunications Bureau. The comments came after an industry official last Friday quoted government sources as saying that the ministry had virtually dismissed the Japanese industry's petition as it found the U.S. firms' services posed no problem under current rules. Suda admitted that the services cannot be restricted under the current law, but said, "it's just that the law was not made to encompass such a new, advanced service." He described the services as "abnormal." But with the services already spreading, user benefits of a service that was invented amid the global trend toward deregulation cannot be ignored, he said. "We just have no idea yet, and don't know which countries will come up with a good solution," Suda said. KDD and other common carriers should also review their services and rates, he said. Three Japanese common carriers led by KDD, which formerly monopolized Japan's international phone services, lodged the petition in January requesting the ministry to probe the "call-back" discount services which they claimed use their lines unfairly, free of charge. The move followed a similar complaint filed with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) last autumn by American Telephone and Telegraph Co. against U.S. discount phone firms exploiting call-back and other such systems. Under the call-back system offered in Japan, users call a switching center in the United States and hang up after two rings. After a few seconds, the center calls back and the users dial the actual number they want to call, the country of origin of the call now being the United States. In the U.S., cut-rate operators use lines offered with discounts to large-lot resellers by common carriers. Suda said Japan is gathering information from the FCC, which is also having difficulties in ruling on the issue. The FCC is also probably watching what Japan will do, he said. France and Germany are focusing attention on Japan because U.S. discount rate operators have also entered those two nations, he said.
