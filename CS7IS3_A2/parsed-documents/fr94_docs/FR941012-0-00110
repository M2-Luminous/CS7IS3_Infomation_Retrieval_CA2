FR941012-0-00110 FR941012-0-00011 At paragraph (e)(1)(iv) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that when the head of any shock, impact-driven or driving tool begins to chip, it shall be repaired or removed from service. The proposed rule would have required that tools be repaired when ``any mushrooming'' occurs. A similar requirement was contained in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. The State of Washington opposed the proposed provision, stating that the language was too restrictive (Ex. 5&hyph;34, 9&hyph;10). The State said that as soon as a plastic wedge if firmly struck there will be some small amount of mushrooming. In the final rule, OSHA has clarified this provision by requiring that the tool be repaired or removed from service when it begins to chip. OSHA believes that this language more accurately describes the hazard that arises over time with these tools. Over time there is a tendency for the steel in these tools to become brittle and chip. When a tool has reached that point, continued use of the tool can cause metal fragments to chip off the tool and fly into the air, thereby endangering employees. The metal fragments could be small enough to strike the eye or large enough to cause a sizeable laceration. At paragraph (e)(1)(v) of the final rule, OSHA is requiring that the cutting edges of each tool be sharpened in accordance with manufacturer's specifications whenever they become dull during a workshift. OSHA received little comment on this provision. One commenter stated: With regard to the sharpness of cutting tools, we have had some interpretive problem in California where fire suppression agencies who have been requiring various tools to be razor sharp rather than sharp enough to do the task for which they are intended. The result has been unnecessary cuts to employees who have inadvertently had incidental contact with such tools. We would suggest that the word ``adequately'' be inserted between the words ``kept'' and ``sharp'' to provide a more ``moderate'' meaning to this requirement. (Ex. 5&hyph;55). The need for tools to be inspected and sharpened as necessary is well-recognized and has been a part of OSHA's and ANSI's logging standards from the start. OSHA believes that the final rule adequately addresses the commenter's concerns. OSHA has added to the final rule the requirement that tools be sharpened according to the manufacturer's specifications. This addition has also been supported by other commenters (Ex. 5&hyph;51, 5&hyph;53, 5&hyph;55). At paragraphs (e)(1) (vi) and (vii) OSHA is requiring that each tool be stored and transported so it is not damaged and will not create a hazard for an employee. These provisions require that racks, boxes, holsters or other means shall be provided and used for transporting tools. These provisions parallel requirements contained in the proposed and pulpwood logging standards. The proposed rule specified that tools be secured during transport but did not require that storage containers be provided. In addition, these provisions as proposed were included in the 1978 ANSI logging standard. OSHA received only limited comments on these provisions. Two commenters stated that the storage provision was unnecessary and, at most, should be limited to cutting tools (Ex. 3&hyph;53 and 5&hyph;55). The other commenter said that the proposed transportation provision was not protective enough (Ex. 5&hyph;7). This commenter stated that outside boxes or storage units should be utilized especially for crew vehicles, because tools can bounce around when transported in such a vehicle, particularly when the vehicle is operated on off highway roads or trails, and could injure employees who are riding with the tools. OSHA believes that provisions for proper tool storage and transportation are necessary to protect employees from injuries. Such provisions have been in OSHA and ANSI standards for many years. In this regard, however, OSHA also believes that it is not necessary to require that tools be stored outside of passenger areas during transport if there are appropriate containers or other means to adequately secure the tools. Therefore, in the final rule OSHA has clarified that employers must provide and use some means, such as racks, boxes or holsters, of securing tools during transport. Chain Saws
