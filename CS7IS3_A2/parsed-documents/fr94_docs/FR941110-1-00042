FR941110-1-00042 FR941110-1-00010 The record indicates that most Walla Walla Sweet Onion growers and handlers are not sufficiently large to finance promotion and research programs on an individual basis. In addition, public funds to finance such projects are scarce. Heretofore, the Walla Walla Sweet Onion industry has attempted to operate and fund research and development projects under voluntary programs. Eventually, these programs ceased to operate because of inadequate support and financing. Witness testimony unanimously supported a marketing order program to be financed by all handlers, to strengthen consumer demand through promotion of the commodity and reducing costs through production research. Witnesses also testified that market research, in the form of data collection and analysis, would be an essential part of an overall marketing and promotion strategy. Currently, limited data is gathered with respect to Walla Walla Sweet Onions. To effectively promote and market Walla Walla Sweet Onions, proponents testified that additional knowledge of market conditions and access to complete data is necessary to make prudent decisions for focusing promotional efforts and promoting the efficient allocation of resources. The record indicates that many onions sold as Walla Walla Sweet Onions do not have the same mild flavor and other characteristics of Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in the proposed production area. Several witnesses testified that often such onions were identified as Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in other states or areas near the Walla Walla Valley. Testimony indicates that the growers of the Walla Walla Valley have spent time and effort attempting to market the Walla Walla Sweet Onion as one they believe has unique characteristics because of the area in which the onions are grown. These growers believe that such efforts have been offset by growers and handlers selling onions produced outside the proposed production area as Walla Walla Sweet Onions. Testimony indicated that 40 percent of the onions sold and described as Walla Walla Sweet Onions were grown outside the proposed production area and, therefore, were not true Walla Walla Sweet Onions. In summary, a number of problems were identified in the record that could be resolved through a marketing order that would enable the Walla Walla industry to work together collectively. Identifying varieties that have good seedling survival rate, a low susceptibility to cold damage, good eating quality, and increased storage capability would add stability to the supply and quality of the Walla Walla Sweet Onion crop, and could increase yields and reduce costs. The marketing order program could assist handlers in solving mutual post harvest handling problems, in the interest of increasing the quality of their offerings, reducing costs and increasing returns. Finally, authorizing industry financing of promotion and advertising programs would enable the industry to increase consumer awareness of its unique commodity, strengthen demand and increase sales. In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that there is a need for a marketing order for Walla Walla Sweet Onions grown in designated parts of Washington and Oregon. The order would meet many of the needs of the industry and would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act. 3. A definition of the term ``production area'' should be included in the order to delineate the area in which Walla Walla Sweet Onions must be grown before the handling thereof is subject to the marketing order. Such term should include designated parts of Walla Walla County, Washington, and Umatilla County, Oregon. The area defined in the proposed order comprises what is generally recognized as the Walla Walla Valley of Washington and Oregon. The counties included are contiguous and share essentially the same growing, harvesting and marketing conditions with respect to Walla Walla Sweet Onions. While production of Walla Walla Sweet Onions is currently concentrated in the two counties of Walla Walla and Umatilla, onions of all types are grown throughout the proposed production area, as well as adjacent areas. At the hearing, a witness proposed revising the definition of production area appearing in the Notice of Hearing to include an area north of the Touchet River in Washington. However, testimony indicated that this area is dry land of a different soil type. Further, it does not have a history of Walla Walla Sweet Onion production, so that onions produced there may not have the same quality attributes as others from the proposed production area. The area as defined accounts for much of the current sweet onion acreage in Washington and Oregon and, according to record evidence, is generally recognized by the onion trade and consumers as comprising the Walla Walla Sweet Onion region of Washington and Oregon. This is because of the unique soil and growing conditions in the highly localized area. Furthermore, the production area as defined in the marketing order is the smallest practicable geographic area to which the order should be applied, consistent with carrying out the declared policy of the Act.
