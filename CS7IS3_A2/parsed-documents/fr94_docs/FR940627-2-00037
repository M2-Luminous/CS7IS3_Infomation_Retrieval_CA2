As increasing social, economic and personal stresses place greater numbers of families and children potentially at-risk and as the numbers of actual at-risk children and families have continued to expand, many State, local and Tribal governments have implemented or are actively planning to initiate family preservation and support programs as a way to strengthen vulnerable families. There is also widespread hope that these family-centered services will reduce foster care caseloads and out-of-home care costs. Family-centered services are responsive to certain legislative mandates of Public Law 96&hyph;272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, and are central to the legislative intent of the new Subpart 2 of title IV&hyph;B of the Social Security Act, Family Preservation and Support Services. The term ``family-centered'' encompasses both family preservation and family support activities. Family support entails community-based preventive services designed to: alleviate stress and promote parental competencies and behaviors that will increase the ability of families to successfully nurture their children; enable families to use other resources and opportunities available in the community; create supportive networks to enhance child-rearing abilities of parents; and help compensate for the increased social isolation, economic deficiencies and vulnerability of families. Family preservation involves helping families maintain the safety of children in their own homes; alleviate crises that might lead to the out-of-home care of children; avoid the unnecessary out-of-home placement of children; reunify with their children and youth already in out-of-home care; deal with issues that arise in both pre and post-adoption periods; and obtain services and other supports responsive to their multiple needs in a culturally appropriate manner. Child welfare agencies need to develop and/or enhance their capacity to plan, manage, operate and monitor family-centered services, and build collaborative working relationships with community-based organizations providing family support programs. The National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will help child and family service agencies develop expertise in all phases and aspects of administering family-centered services by providing training and technical assistance itself or by providing a referral to an appropriate alternative resource. The National Resource Center for Family-Centered Practice will focus most of its activity on the preventive end (i.e., prevention of family dysfunction/foster care) of the continuum of services for children and families. In addition to meeting the minimum requirements detailed previously, applicants need to: •Demonstrate the capacity to articulate a family-centered approach, encompassing family preservation and family support, and integrate family-centered concepts into the field of child welfare. •Describe a plan for collecting, reviewing and disseminating analyses of existing research and other appropriate information on the relative merits of different program approaches. •Describe a plan for providing techniques and strategies that will assist child welfare decisionmakers in assessing numerous options for the development and implementation of family-centered programs and services. This plan should also consider the planning and developmental needs for post-legal adoption family support and family preservation program services. •Demonstrate knowledge of community-based family support programs and describe a plan for fostering effective linkages between these family support programs and public child welfare agencies.
