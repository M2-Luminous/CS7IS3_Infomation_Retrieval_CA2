The CEPD estimated that the index would stand at 26 for May -- about the same level as April. The CEPD, Taiwan's highest economic planning agency, uses a five-color rating system to measure economic prospects. A red light means the economy is overheated, yellow-red signals brisk economic growth, green indicates steady expansion, yellow-blue shows economic slowdown, and blue means recession. A CEPD official said despite lackluster production capability and exports for the month, the economy would get a green light on the strength of the booming stock market.
