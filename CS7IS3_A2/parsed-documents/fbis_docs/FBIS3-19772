In an address to the International Affairs Institute, which also served as an occasion to review his tenure as Italy's diplomatic chief, Andreatta observed how "there is a fundamental intolerance towards institutional questions" in European Union member states, "even among the original members. When the question was raised to prepare for the inter-governmental conference to modify the institutions almost no one, except Italy, appeared in favor of speeding up the time table." The Italian diplomatic chief went on to add how only now, with the conclusion of membership negotiations with Sweden, Norway, Finland and Austria, "have we, in a most casual way, been able to guide things towards a commitment in Corfu (the EU summit ending the Greek duty presidency in June) where government chiefs will appoint their permanent representatives to the committee which must prepare the inter-governmental conference." Andreatta then went on to list some possible alternatives for institutional change, including "...an Upper House, one of government representatives, with a leadership in which some Member States, given their size and presence in the EU, become permanent members" as well as members "which represent the continuity of action." Andreatta's proposal is that of the "hard core" approach which has been under discussion for several months, in which several states push forward and even go beyond the path set down in the Maastricht Treaty on European Union. "At present," the foreign minister observed, "the debate on the hard core must take into account Britain, which is irreplaceable in Europe." The Italian diplomatic chief went on to recall how some of "the most important steps we have taken in the last decade have been thanks to Britain. Sometimes Britain's opposition has helped the European Community move forward.... I would not like the hard core approach to leave out one of the most original and important Member States." According to Andreatta, the 1996 inter-governmental conference on institutional reform will represent a turning point for building a united Europe and "the series of duty presidencies, between Germany's and Italy's, will set the pace for those which must govern these processes." "But the times are not easy ones to modify and accelerate the European process" Andreatta concluded, in reference to the intolerance to institutional reform "...but occasions like these, which could even lead to failure, must be exploited and those with more to offer should perhaps try to offer more."
