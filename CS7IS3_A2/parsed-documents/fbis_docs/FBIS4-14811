Until Fall, as President's Press Secretary Said, Or Forever?] [Text] The pent-up storm potential of criticism of the "marriage contract" the Americans have drawn up with former members of the Warsaw Pact, known as the "Partnership for Peace" program, has been eased by a statement by the president's press secretary Vyacheslav Kostikov, who declared that Yeltsin will not rush to join Russia to the Atlantic alliance. Before making a final decision the president will hold consultations with all political forces. The process of joining NATO has been put on hold for six or seven months. Establishing partnership relations with NATO of an indeterminate quality and unclear status constitutes a "political step" for Russia, Kostikov said, and therefore "public consent" has to be reached first. The document prepared within the bowels of NATO fails to mention key problems, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for International Affairs, has said. Who will defend whom? In what circumstances? On what terms? It is not clear how equal the command of this complex international organism will be. What if Moscow objects to any joint actions planned in Brussels, but which have to be carried out by all members? Will Moscow have a voice that will be heeded? The scope of the enlarged NATO's powers also remains unclear. Will it be confined to "peacekeeping" operations or might there be a question of operations "to establish peace," that is, coercive measures using armed force? How does the NATO sphere of interests tie in with the process of European cooperation within the CSCE framework? The CSCE has an internationally recognized mandate to ensure security and stability but at the same time it has no mechanism for peacekeeping activity. NATO on the other hand has no such mandate, but it does have force of arms. What is to be done with the slowly developing CIS collective security structure? Russia is not pressing for the dissolution of NATO, but it cannot predict how this alliance will behave toward the CIS. The sixth question concerns a demand common to all the bloc's members -- to arrive at uniformity in the armaments system. How far will standardization undermine the positions of Russian manufacturers of military hardware? Lastly, the financial situation -- amid industrial decline and inflation will Russia be able to bear the burden that will be asked of it? There is every indication that the postponement decision was viewed with understanding in the upper echelons of NATO.
