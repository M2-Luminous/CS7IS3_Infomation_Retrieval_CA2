FBIS4-66818 "jpnea027___94059" JPRS-NEA-94-027 JPRS Near East & South Asia 12 April 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Sait Resigns From Muslim League, Plans New Party Sait Resigns From Muslim League, Plans New Party Press Conference 94AS0279B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA in English 12 Apr 94 p 4 94AS0279B Bombay THE TIMES OF INDIA English CSO [Text] New Delhi, April 11 (PTI)--Mr Ebrahim Sulaiman Sait, the ousted president of the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML), today announced that he would launch a new party here on April 23. Mr Sait told a press conference that it was finally resolved to launch a new party, after extensive consultations with various Muslim organisations, both political and non-political, including past and present leaders of the IUML and even the Jamait-i-Islami. Mr Sait said he had convened an all-India political convention to be attended by over 500 delegates here on April 23 to decide on the name, structure and flag of the new party which would be "well-knit, coordinated, broadbased and secular." Mr Sait's faction had split from the IUML after he was ousted as president of the party he led for 21 years and was replaced by Mr G.M. Banatwala. Mr Said today reiterated his charges that the elections of the president were "sudden, not on the agenda and manipulated." Mr Sait said he was "pained and anguished" to announce this departure from the IUML, but it was inevitable because the Kerala unit of the IUML refused to quit the Congress-led government. The Sait faction had been pressing its Kerala unit to quit the Karunakaran government after the demolition of the Babri Masjid, saying there should be no truck with the Congress. All Muslims rejected the Central government's package following the demolition of the Babri Masjid, namely acquisition of the disputed land, reference to the supreme court by the President and the formation of two trusts to build a temple and mosque each, Mr Sait said. The Kerala unit of the IUML was supporting this package and toeing the government line and their "action is sheer political dishonesty and hypocricy" which has led to the party's complete "alienation, especially among the youth," Mr Sait claimed. Before launching the new party, a 25-member high powered committee would hold two days of meetings to deliberate over the name, modalities and structure of the new party and make its recommendations for the approval of the session. The convention has been sponsored by 75 leading personalities of the Muslim community from different states who will decide about the theme and conduct of the convention, he said. Mr Mohammad Sulaiman, former president of the Uttar Pradesh state Muslim League, Dr Bashir Khan Ahmed, former office-bearer of the Delhi unit, and Mr Mansoor Ahmed Khan of the Delhi unit, also attended the press conference along with Mr Sait. Mr Sait said he held two consultative meets with Muslim leaders of the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi and Rajasthan on March 6 in Delhi and another one in Madras with representatives and leaders of Muslim organisations of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Lakhswadeep Islands. In a statement read out at the press conference, Mr Sait said, "Such a step (of forming a new party) became inevitable because of sheer power-mongering, regardless of the interests of the community." "A coterie which was controlling the Kerala unit of the IUML was sacrificing all principles of truth and justice and was blindly following Congress culture and the Congress line," he said. It was a tragedy that even the national leadership of the IUML had fallen prey to the "misguided and detrimental policy of toeing totally the line of the Kerala state Muslim League," he added. Mr Sait said that he had given the Kerala unit two months time to withdraw from the United Democratic Front (UDF) government and as that time had expired, he was announcing the launch of a new party. He, however, ruled out resigning from the IUML or his Lok Sabha seat forthwith. He said mass resignations from the party would come by and by, and said he would not quit his Lok Sabha seat "because my constituents do not want me to."
