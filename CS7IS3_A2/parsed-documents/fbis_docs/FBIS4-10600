[Morelos], 10 Apr -- After vindicating the struggle of Emiliano Zapata, "which is still alive," President Carlos Salinas de Gortari warned there will not be setbacks in the constitutional reforms drawn up in favor of the Mexican countryside. Salinas also stressed that large landholdings will not reappear in the country, particularly at a time when farmers are facing an unfavorable international situation. During the ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the death of General Emiliano Zapata, which was held at the Teopanzolco Municipal Auditorium, the president emphasized that the ejido [a form of land tenure] is not going to disappear, adding that the laws have been adapted to the new times the country is experiencing. Salinas remarked that the struggle of the southern leader [Zapata] is still legitimate, and in Mexico we must reverse the circumstances of misery and poverty still prevailing in the countryside. Accompanied by Morelos State Governor Antonio Riva Palacio Lopez, the secretaries of agriculture and agrarian reform, Carlos Hank Gonzalez and Victor Cervera Pacheco, respectively, Agrarian Ombudsman Arturo Warman, and the leaders of the largest peasants organizations of the country, President Salinas said significant progress has been made in the countryside, but the work is not over yet. "We still have a lot to do, but we are not going to ease up; on the contrary, we are going to redouble our effort and increase benefits for peasants. From the government of the republic, we will work harder and with greater dedication and determination," Salinas underscored. He said he had come to this area to commemorate an anniversary of sadness and hope: "The 75th anniversary of the injust and unacceptable death of Emiliano Zapata and also 75 years of commitments and work in favor of Mexican peasants." Salinas said many of the aspirations of Emiliano Zapata have come true and evidence of this is the exceptional agrarian reform. Nevertheless, he explained, Mexico has changed and new problems and opportunities appeared along with this change, so it was also necessary to promote changes in the law, institutions, and practices. Salinas asserted these changes were proposed by the very peasants, "because the previous instruments were inadequate for the country we had." He mentioned his government has continued to support the banners of transformation in favor of peasants. The president added that is why greater legal assurance has been given to land ownership and freedom to decide and, above all, to reaffirm the patrimony of their children." The president recalled the modifications to Article 27 of the Constitution and said to this end that intense talks were held with peasant organizations and the very men and women of the countryside. This, he said, allowed the ejido and communal property to become part of the Constitution, while it permitted ejidatarios [land holders] and communal property owners to decide on what fit their needs best. Salinas said the assembly, which is a democratic organ where ejidatarios and communal owners issue their views, was strengthened. This reaffirmed the ejido is not going to disappear, but on the contrary will be strengthened as a fundamental expression of social property in our fatherland, the president explained. He then spoke about large landholdings and said that since that time it was banned from the Constitution; "large landholdings are not going to reappear; they have disappeared from the history of our fatherland." Later Salinas recalled that in January of this year, 200,000 land titles of Procede [expansion unknown] were delivered and 200,000 more were delivered today here in Morelos, where now two out of every three ejidatarios own titles to their land. Also today the executive delivered new contributions to the countryside because he said his government has decided to definitely modify the way in which peasants are supported. Thus, during the Autumn-Winter cycle, Salinas asserted that approximately 700,000 peasants will receive in their hands a direct support check, such as the ones he presented today to Morelia peasants. Salinas said that 3.5 million peasants will receive direct support for the Spring-Summer cycle, while "in the past 2 million received nothing. Today, they will have this addition to their family income guaranteed. He also recalled that in all this process to reactivate the Mexican countryside, the problem of overdue credits was resolved and accepting their word, more than 1 million peasants received support from the country. He added that we have also modified commercialization mechanisms and are now working on productive infrastructures, "but we have not finished yet. We will continue moving forward with firmness and determination." He then noted that the international situation is not favorable for farmers and that Mexico must reverse the conditions of neglect and poverty that still prevail in many rural areas. He stressed that the government will not slow its pace and will redouble its efforts and will achieve more benefits for the Mexican countryside. He said that the government "will work harder, with more dedication and enthusiasm. We will not stop." In his speech, Governor Riva Palacio said that today we remember the sacrifice of the hero of Anenecuilco, who struggled to give land to the Mexican peasants, "but for us his immolation means that he won a place in history and glory that the fatherland reserves for its children who give everything seeking justice for others." Riva Palacio added that we are happy because this celebration takes place within the framework of the delivery of 15,831 agrarian titles. He added that this makes a reality of the modernization of the Mexican Constitution, in order to align with the current world, based on programs derived from the Ayala Plan, which reflects the thoughts and ideals that inspired Zapata's struggle to achieve justice for peasants, reforms, liberty, justice, and law. He said that those thoghts and ideals are present in the adjustments that serve as a basis for the new agrarian reform. He stressed that those ideals were also made a reality through Procampo with the delivery to rural producers of 3,000 certificates of payment which, as direct encouragement, permit the competitiveness in a different market without affecting the income the Revolution gave them for working the land. In that manner, Riva Palacio said, an act of agrarian justice has been made by granting titles and economic support that will enable Mexican peasants to receive justice and to project themselves into Mexico's future of democracy, and liberty.
