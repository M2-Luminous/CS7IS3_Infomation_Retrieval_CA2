It is called the United People [Pueblo Unido], and it comprises the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], the Labor Party, and the Liberal Republican Party. According to Ernesto Perez Balladares, presidential candidate for the alliance, the purpose of this electoral merger is to present a program to resolve the country's most pressing problems. Perez Balladares also stressed that the possible reentry of the former military into politics would pose danger to the country. [Begin recording] [Perez Balladares] I respect the right that members of the military or former members of the military have to participate in politics and party politics. Nevertheless, I must call attention to the fact that it is dangerous if they unite as a power bloc or somehow again become a determinant force. Even though this may only be the start of what could be the return of such a force, I must draw attention to it, because the desperation to attain power could lead someone to resort to something we all wish to forget and leave in the past. [Unidentified reporter] Dr. Ernesto Perez Balladares, is the purge, so to speak, which evidently has been taking place within the PRD, designed to ensure that civilian forces lead the party? [Perez Balladares] I believe we have instituted an internal democracy, which is very evident to the great majority of the Panamanian people. This internal democracy has caused individuals or people who disagree the party's main ideals to be cast aside by the very dynamics of democracy. I do not think we have had... [pauses] I do not like the term purge, but we have had a continual influx of internal democracy. This is also proof positive that we have pledged to maintain this internal democracy and to make it effective nationwide the day we come to power. [end recording]
