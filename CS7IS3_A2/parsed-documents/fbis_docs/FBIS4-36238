Citing Jordanian Prime Minister 'Abd-al-Salam al-Majali, these source said that Damascus has made further steps conditional on an Israeli Knesset announcement of the abrogation of the decision under which Israel annexed the Golan Heights. The decision was issued in January 1981. Syria has also demanded that Israel publicly recognize UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 on the principle of exchanging land for peace, as well as Resolution 425 calling for Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon. The timetable for the Israeli withdrawal remains the subject of dispute because the Jewish state is talking about seven years while Syria insists that the period should not exceed three years, according these same sources. If Israel meets Syria's conditions, Damascus will be prepared to raise the level of bilateral negotiations -- something that has been demanded by Israel. Only then will U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher resume his shuttle tours between the two states. In another development, Syria is demanding a piece of land known as the Palestinian Golan Heights in the Syrian al-Hammah area. It was annexed to the Syrian Golan Heights in 1938 and then was occupied by Israel along with the rest of the heights during the Six-Day War. Israel, however, refuses to withdraw from it.
