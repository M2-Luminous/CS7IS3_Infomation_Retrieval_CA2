About 50 more Hong Kong affairs advisers will be appointed in Beijing after the Easter holiday next month, a Chinese government official said. Chan said the Chinese had approached him in an informal way, indicating their intention of inviting him to join the body. This was to avoid embarrassment had an official invitation been turned down. Chan told the Chinese that he preferred not to accept an offer, saying it was a personal decision. "I don't think I need to explain why," he said. Chan left the civil service last June after a 27-year career to become managing director of Kowloon Motor Bus. Yeung, who also resigned last year, gave the same reason for not accepting Beijing's offer. "I've made it public that if I am asked either by the Chinese government or the Hong Kong government to give my personal views on any matters to the extent possible, I will do so if I can without taking any further position," Yeung said. "I don't need any title." A locally-based Chinese official refused to confirm Chan and Yeung's rejection but said it was a matter for individuals whether to accept. China has invited several former civil servants to be advisers, including Sir David Akers-Jones, the former chief secretary, and Wong Ying-wai, the former administrative officer.
