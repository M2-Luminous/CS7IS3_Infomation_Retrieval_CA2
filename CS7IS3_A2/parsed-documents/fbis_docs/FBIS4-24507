C. Chiang and Sofia Wu] [Text] Seoul, May 31 (CNA) -- Negotiators from Taiwan and South Korea are meeting here to discuss resumption of bilateral fruit trade, which has been suspended since the two countries severed diplomatic ties in August 1992. Chen Wu-hsiung, head of the Taiwan delegation to the meeting, said Taiwan is willing to import Korean pears and apples in exchange for Korea's importation of its bananas, oranges and litchis. Chen, a department director of Taiwan's Council of Agriculture, arrived in Seoul Sunday [29 May] for the talks, which began Monday. Chang Shao-chun, Taiwan's deputy representative in Seoul, also took part in the negotiations. Li Yong-le, director of the Farm Produce Distribution Bureau, is heading the Korean delegation to the talks. Pressured by its fruit growers, South Korea is eager to resume fruit trade with Taiwan. Before Seoul switched diplomatic recognition to Beijing, Taiwan allowed imports of a specified amount of Korean pears and apples annually in exchange for Korea's purchases of a similar amount of its bananas. "We hope to include our oranges, litchis or mangoes in future fruit exchanges," Chen explained. The two sides reached consensus on some basic principles during Monday talks. They will discuss technical details Tuesday. If all goes smoothly, Chen said, a formal agreement will be signed at the end of the talks. Diplomatic sources here said south Korea hopes to resume fruit trade with Taiwan as soon as possible. Taiwan used to be Korea's major apple and pear market. The Korean Government also hopes the resumption of fruit trade can pave the way for the re-opening of direct airlinks between the two countries, which were also suspended following the breakup of diplomatic ties, the sources said.
