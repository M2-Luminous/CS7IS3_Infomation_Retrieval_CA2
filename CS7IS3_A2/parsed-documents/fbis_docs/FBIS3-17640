Several observers are convinced that the intensified activity of Azerbaijan's military forces at the front lines is linked with the multilateral talks that are being held in Moscow with the mediation of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. NKR experts are also participating in the talks. Obviously, Azerbaijan's leaders wish to direct a new wave of pressure on the NKR. The NKR Defense Army Headquarters has disclosed that bloody clashes took place at several important heights close to Alkhanly in Fizulinskiy Rayon yesterday. Some 38 Azerbaijani officers and men were killed and dozens of troops were wounded in the fighting. Azerbaijan also lost military equipment and armored vehicles.
