AIDS From Abroad"] [Text] In Odessa Oblast, which, unfortunately, continues to be Ukraine's leading region regarding the number of persons infected with the HIV virus (more than 100 persons, or more than one-half of the total number of cases in the country), another three carriers of the deadly disease have been revealed. They are young sailors from a fishing vessel that returned to the Illichivsk port from overseas. The disease was detected accidentally: One of the sailors had been hospitalized following an entirely different diagnosis. He was examined for AIDS and tested HIV-positive. As a result, the entire crew of the vessel was examined and another two carriers of the virus were revealed. Medics are now conducting difficult searches for those who had contacts with the HIV carriers.
