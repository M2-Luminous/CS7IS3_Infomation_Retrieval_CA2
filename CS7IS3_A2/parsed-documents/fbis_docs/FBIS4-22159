Conversion programs approved by the government for 1993-1994 are being rolled back since credit resources have been provided only for the first quarter of this year. Besides this, we are not meeting the requirements of the Order of the President of Russia of 6 November 1993 "On Stabilization of the Economic Situation of Enterprises and Organizations of the Defense Industry and Measures to Support State Defense Orders" having to do with development of weapons programs for the period up to the year 2000, establishment of conditions "for stable functioning of defense enterprises in the market economy," financing of conversion and wages in the amount of eight minimal monthly payments. The adoption of the state budget for 1994 in the form which is proposed by the government thus means complete stoppage of the majority of 3,000 scientific-research institutes [NII], design bureaus [KB] and plants, and discharge of a minimum of 6 million persons directly employed in [filling] military orders from the sphere of material production. Counting the enterprises which form whole cities and where no other work exists, the number of those suffering from the cuts may exceed 15 million persons. Areas of concentration of the defense industry in Moscow and the Moscow oblast (1.5 million persons), Udmurtiya, the Urals, central Russia, the Northwest, Novosibirsk, and Omsk will suffer especially greatly. But it is not only a matter of social consequences. The country is being stripped of its basic industrial and scientific potential. It is a matter of national security, the future of Russia and its people. This is how the directors of defense enterprises, trade union leaders, and scientists assess the present situation. It is not hard to predict the negative consequences of stoppage of the defense complex. The cost of civilian goods will skyrocket. Export of arms will halt completely, since the "finishing" enterprises will not be able to close the technological circuits of cooperation. Already experiencing a shortage of up-to-date systems and equipment, the Army will be disarmed without international treaties and agreements. The old weapons grow decrepit, and new ones are not being developed or purchased. What are we to do in this situation? In the opinion of the industrialists, prominent scientists, and VUZ teachers preparing cadres for the enterprises of the military industrial complex, we absolutely must raise appropriations. By a factor of two at a minimum. But on the other hand, this is a hard thing to do under present conditions, for the weight of military expenditures in the general budget is already excessive. What, then, is the way out? Aleksey Shulunov, president of the League for Assistance to Defense Enterprises, believes it lies in immediate resolution of a group of problems. In particular, he believes, we must approve the expenditure portion of the state budget for the first quarter of 1994 in the amount of expenditures of the fourth quarter of 1993, no less. And by indexing that, provide industry with the means of existence in the coming months, while there is no annual budget. Then we must improve the tax legislation of Russia. Today it does not stimulate production or enhance the investment activity of enterprises. For one ruble of commodity production, says A. Shulunov, we pay taxes of up to 90 kopecks. It is easy to see that the growth in state extortion, dictated by the desire to compensate for the cut in income due to the sharp drop in volume of production, in turn prompts the producer to conceal income. Just according to official data, last year the government failed to collect 7.5 trillion rubles for this reason. This is more than all military expenditures put together. The chairman of the Customs Committee states officially that budget losses due to failure to pay taxes from foreign economic activity amount to 10 billion dollars. And if monies of the shadow economy, which also circulate outside the sphere of tax control, are included in this sum (according to some data they amount to three times the annual budget), it is easy to see that the income portion of the budget for 1993 has been reduced by a factor of three. If this had not occurred, industry not only would avoid the "card file," but would also have earned money for investment. The industrialists and scientists unanimously demand an immediate change in the existing order of military-technical cooperation of Russia with foreign countries, and for elimination of all obstacles in the path of independent export of arms and military equipment by defense enterprises through state licence. In the words of Shulunov, just the restoration of old commercial ties, resuscitating the export of ZIP [spare parts, tools, and instrument kits], and modernization and servicing of equipment sold in the past will bring in up to 4 billion dollars annually to the complex. Director of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute [TsAGI] Academician German Zagaynov says that today we still have in fact a system of weapons sales by the state. And this is a symptom of a totalitarian regime. He also names another possible way out from this situation -- to move from talking about selective support and structural perestroykaof industry and science to actually doing something. Now instead of selective support, there is dilution of resources at the level of the department apparatus. Says the Academician, it is time for the state to decide whom it intends to support through the budget, and to what extent. For with the present orders of 3 to 5 planes a year for a plant with a capacity of 200, everything will become pointless. The same applies to the scientific research institutes and design bureaus: often they duplicate one another. For this reason, state orders must be concentrated after determining the executors on the basis of expert assessment. As for those who are left without orders, give them their freedom. Freedom to privatize, selecting the optimal type of activity. I need to make a qualification here. The directors of enterprises and officials of trade unions, while unconditionally supporting the idea itself of going public, at the same time sharply protest voucher privatization of their enterprises. And in general this is understandable. Through the sale of stock they could obtain sizeable resources to resume production. But for now the profit from privatization of state property (in 1993) amounts to 169 billion rubles. This sum scarcely sufficed for conduct of check auctions and advertising. Aleksey Shulunov states bluntly that we must halt checkbook privatization while the complex still has things of value. In the opinion of German Zagaynov, today we cannot "cage up" even those enterprises which remain "purely state enterprises." It is reasonable to change a number of them into technical pools and holding companies, where the part which is national property would remain state property and would be maintained out of the budget; and the rest, which grew up for service support and impart to the enterprise the nature of a subsistence economy, would serve as the basis for the holding company. A system of daughter enterprises would allow the transformation of high defense technologies into technologies of civilian branches of industry. The director of TsAGI believes that we can no longer put off the formation of large industrial-finance corporations and the merger of design bureaus and serial plants into a single technological and commercial structure. Otherwise we will lose not world markets, but our own, and will be deprived of the design bureaus and plants. But then, we have already lost practically a third of the numerical strength of the defense complex. Clever and knowledgeable specialists have left science and design bureaus, so that the average age of the associates of scientific research institutes and design bureaus has increased sharply. There is practically no worthy replacement for the designers and engineers owing to the complete absence of so-called cadre accompaniment of the programs being developed in the state. The opinion is growing that the authors are writing them for themselves, eternal and ageless. The Rector of Moscow State Technical University [MGTU] imeni N.E. Bauman, Professor Igor Fedorov, who lately has spoken often at various types of conferences, strives to call attention to the disastrous plight of his university, and also of other major technical VUZ of the country, the Moscow Aviation Institute [MAI], and the Tula and Chelyabinsk Technical Universities, but finds sympathy only from colleagues. In recent months the state has flatly refused to finance the MGTU, with the result that the university's indebtedness for utilities today amounts to 1 billion 600 million rubles. The out-of-town academic and experimental complex at Dmitrov, which for around 20 years has been developed through the efforts of enterprises of the defense and space complex, has been frozen. And today practically the main concern of the rector of this VUZ, which graduated Korolev, Tupolev, Shukhov, Barmin, and Pilyugin, is to clarify relations with Mosenergo [Moscow Electric Company], which intends to disconnect the electrical power from the university. In other countries this is called a shame; in ours it is called difficulties of the transitional period. In his letter to the editors, the director of TsAGI Academician G. Zagaynov analyzes the situation and the ways of emerging from it: "Today it is hard for everyone, but for all the variety of state tasks and interests, we must nonetheless single out one and give it the status of most important -- assuring a worthy standard of living for Russians. Really, it is the only task whose start will require that we begin to speak of morality, of culture, and of national security. The relationship is clear: There is a high living standard in those countries where there is high technology in the basic branches of the economy -- machine-building, transport, power engineering, raw-materials and processing branches, agriculture, communications, construction, and the service sphere. Thus it has developed that in Russia, in these civilian branches of the economy, the technological level is far from the world level. High technologies have been preserved only in the defense complex, and primarily in the aerospace complex. For this reason, technical refitting of the basic branches of the economy, with participation of the defense complex of the Russian Academy of Sciences and the higher school, should be considered the national task of first priority. That is why the government must listen to the defense industry leaders first of all. Especially since not so much is required of it. It must use its influence to promote the union of defense industry leaders and civilian branches, not oppose the purchase of foreign technologies, and guarantee investments. In other words, the industrialists, scientists, and trade unions of the defense branches once again are offering themselves as allies to the government. And this is not a return to the older system of socialist planning. Basically, it is a market economy with directed influence of the state. This is how national tasks have been and continue to be accomplished throughout the world.
