According to Volel, some sectors have the right to demonstrate in the streets whereas others do not. [Begin Volel recording, in Creole] There is a sector that is struggling for democracy, but that does not have the right to speak, even less does it have the right to stage demonstrations or to hold meetings. We in the RDC are always against this stance that favors a person or a group of persons to the detriment of another person or group of persons. We could never offer our support, we never offered our support, and we will never offer our support to anything done against the interests of the people. So, we do not offer our support: We oppose this demonstration. We are against this disorder because those people, who are staging the demonstration, have never done anything for the Haitian people. On the contrary, they have always tried to destroy the people, to destroy the country. [end rcording]
