FR941107-1-00003 FR941107-1-00001 Statement of Consideration The proposed revision would reduce the supply plant shipping requirement from 40 to 30 percent for the period of March through July 1995. The Tennessee Valley order requires that a supply plant ship a minimum of 60 percent of the total quantity of milk physically received at the supply plant during the months of August through November, January, and February, and 40 percent in each of the other months. The order also provides authority for the Director of the Dairy Division to increase or decrease this supply plant shipping requirement by up to 10 percentage points if such a revision is necessary to obtain needed shipments of milk or to prevent uneconomic shipments. Armour states that it would have to make uneconomical shipments of milk to meet the 40 percent supply plant shipping requirement to continue its pool status. Additionally, the proponent states that the 40 percent requirement could jeopardize the continued association of producers who have supplied the Order 11 market in the fall. Armour anticipates that marketing conditions in 1995 will mirror those in 1993 and 1994, when the shipping percentage was also reduced. It expects milk supplies to be adequate to meet the Class I needs of the market. In view of the current supply and demand relationship, it may be necessary to reduce the supply plant shipping percentage as proposed to provide for the efficient and economic marketing of milk during the months of March 1 through July 31, 1995.
