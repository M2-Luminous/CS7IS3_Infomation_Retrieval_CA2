Branko Kitanovic, general secretary of the New Yugoslav Communist Movement, said that delegates of many communist and workers' parties and political parties of many countries aspiring after socialism gathered in Pyongyang and declared to the whole world that they would struggle for the victory of socialism, and this was a historical event which marked a new milestone in the strengthening and development of the socialist and communist movement. The Pyongyang declaration, he said, serves the communists and progressive peoples of the world as a common fighting program in rebuilding the socialist and communist movement and advancing the cause of socialism with a clear fighting goal on a new basis after socialism has suffered a setback and capitalism has revived in East European countries owing to moves of the renegades of revolution. Guillermo Garcia Ponce, general secretary of the "New Alternative" of Venezuela, in a statement issued to the press said the Pyongyang declaration is an inspiring banner which gave firm confidence in victory to the revolutionary parties and people of the world aspiring after socialism, and it declared to the whole world that the victory of the socialist cause is inevitable. Guzman Rivera Castaneda, general secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party of Peru, said the Pyongyang declaration is a fine document which dealt a telling blow at the imperialists who were resorting to vicious anti- communist rackets, making a bluff. Sean Garland, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Workers' Party of Ireland, said the Pyongyang declaration is the source of unity of all the progressive forces. The fact that more than 200 revolutionary parties and progressive political parties of the world signed the declaration fully proves its great vitality, he added. Ludo Martens, chairman of the Central Committee of the Belgian Labour Party, said the Pyongyang declaration is a solemn declaration announcing a new start of the communist movement. The just cause of the revolutionary parties of the world who are advancing under the banner of this declaration is sure to be crowned with victory, he stressed.
