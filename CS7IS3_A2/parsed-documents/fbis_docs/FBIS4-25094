FBIS4-25094 "drchi108_v_94006" FBIS-CHI-94-108 Daily Report 4 Jun 1994 TAIWAN Submarine Spotted Near Penghu During Exercise Submarine Spotted Near Penghu During Exercise `Containment' Procedure Detailed OW0406082094 Taipei CNA in English 0741 GMT 4 Jun 94 OW0406082094 Taipei CNA English BFN [By Sofia Wu] [Text] Taipei, June 4 (CNA) -- An unidentified submarine was discovered off southwestern Taiwan during a late May Republic of China [ROC] military exercise, naval authorities said Saturday [4 June]. Testifying before the Legislative Yuan's Defense Committee, Chou Ching-hung, chief of staff at the Navy General Headquarters, said the ROC naval fleet contained the unidentified submarine for 45 hours and 44 minutes. Chou, however, did not say where the submarine was from. He said the sub was in the open sea off Penghu when it was spotted by an ROC S-2T anti-submarine aircraft participating in the "Han Kuang" wargames. Chou said sonar equipment installed on the Navy's anti-submarine helicopters, destroyers and frigates was used to pinpoint the sub. The ROC Navy also used its underwater communications system to send warning signals to the submarine and ask it to provide its identity and nationality. The sub did not respond, Chou said. According to a CHINA TIMES report, the ROC naval fleet did not attack the unidentified submarine because the vessel remained in international waters and did not intrude into Taiwan's 12-nautical mile territorial waters. The Navy instead sent four destroyers and frigates to contain the submarine, the report said. The Navy also dispatched its S70C anti-submarine helicopters to monitor the submarine. The report said the submarine left the waters off Penghu on the fourth day of the standoff after the four-ship ROC fleet opened an exit. The ROC did not mobilize its submarines to contain the unidentified sub, the report said. National Defense Minister Sun Chen refused comment on the origin of the submarine and whether Mainland China sent the sub to collect military information during the ROC military exercise. Sun said the mainland has many submarines. "It surely would use its submarines to collect military information in the Taiwan Strait," he added. Sun said the ROC Navy is capable of spotting unidentified underwater targets and even attacking them. "Local people need not worry about such incidents," he added. Naval authorities said about 96 mainland submarines regularly sail the waters surrounding Taiwan. A mainland submarine was spotted in waters 12.5 nautical miles off Anping in southern Taiwan two months ago, the authorities said.
