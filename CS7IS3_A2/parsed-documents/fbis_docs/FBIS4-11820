The accord signed in Cairo was "a first step in applying (UN) Security Council Resolution 904," the spokesman said. The resolution, adopted on March 18, condemned the massacre of 30 Palestinians by a Jewish settler at a Hebron mosque on February 25 and called for international protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories. The PLO spokesman, quoted by the official WAFA news agency, welcomed the participation of "friendly countries in the international force" which is to deploy in the West Bank town. But he urged additional measures "to guarantee effective international protection for the Palestinian people, its land and its holy sites." He called on Israel to fulfill all the conditions necessary to ensure the observers could complete their neutral mission and said the PLO was "ready to help them in the task." Other problems still to be resolved included settlers carrying arms and "the presence of extremist settlers and their terrorist activities," he said. The PLO would continue its efforts to protect all Palestinians and "wipe out centres of terrorism," as well as pushing ahead with deployment of a Palestinian security force in the Gaza Strip and Jericho as set out in the Declaration of Principles signed in Washington in September. Talks on launching Palestinian self-rule resumed Thursday after the security deal was signed in Cairo.
