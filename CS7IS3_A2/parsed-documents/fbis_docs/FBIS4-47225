Voting and Determination of the Results of the Elections Article 34. The Polling Place The voting is done in specially assigned spaces in which a sufficient number of booths or rooms for secret balloting must be equipped and ballot boxes have been set up. The ballot boxes are set up so that when the people voting approach them they must pass through the secret voting booths or rooms. No other political actions can be done at the polling place. The precinct election commission bears responsibility for setting up the polling places and keeping them in the necessary order. Article 35. The Time and Place for Voting Voting is held on election day from 0700 to 2000 hours. The precinct election commission notifies the voters of the time and place for voting no later than 10 days before the elections. At voting precincts formed in military units and at sanatoriums, vacation lodges, and hospitals and other inpatient treatment institutions, as well as in places where citizens are in remote and not easily accessible rayons, the precinct election commission may declare the voting over at any time, if all the voters included in the roll have voted. Article 36. The Start of Voting On election day the polling place opens when at least two-thirds of the members of the precinct election commission are present. The chairman in the presence of the members of the election commission seals the ballot box, distributes the ballots among the members of the election commission, and announces the start of voting. The total number of ballots is officially registered in a separate document. Article 37. Establishing the Voter's Identity When a voter comes to the polls to vote, he presents a document certifying his identity to a member of the precinct election commission and signs the voter roll. After that he is issued a ballot. The surnames of the voters who for some reason are not included on the voter roll are included in appendices to the voter roll on the basis of a document certifying his identity, citizenship, and place of residence. Article 38. The Voting Procedure The ballot is filled out by the person voting in the booth or room for secret balloting. The presence of persons other than the person voting is prohibited when he is filling out the ballot. A voter who is unable to fill out the ballot on his own has a right to use his discretion and invite a person other than a member of the election commission into the booth or room. During elections, the voter crosses out the surnames of the candidates on the ballot whom he is voting against. The person voting drops the completed ballot into the ballot box. A damaged ballot may be replaced if the voter requests. Damaged ballots are to be counted and canceled and stored separately. A voter who is unable to be at the place of his residence on election day may request an absentee ballot from the precinct election commission at the place of his residence, make the decisions, and leave the completed absentee ballot in the sealed envelope of the election commission. When the absentee ballot is received, the voter is entered on the voter roll. The corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission determines the form of the absentee ballot. In cases where certain voters cannot go to the polls to vote for health or other reasons, if these voters wish, the precinct election commission instructs members of the election commission to organize balloting at the place where these voters are. Article 39. Counting Votes at the Voting Precinct When the voting is over and before the ballot boxes are opened, the sealed envelopes with the absentee ballots are dropped in the ballot boxes in the presence of the members of the precinct commission. All the unused ballots are counted and canceled by the precinct election commission. The ballot boxes are opened by the precinct election commission after the chairman of the commission has declared the voting over. Opening the ballot boxes before the voting is over is prohibited. The precinct election commission determines the total number of voters at the precinct and the number of voters who received ballots and absentee ballots. The votes at the voting precinct are counted by the precinct election commission separately for each election district and each candidate for deputy in elections to the corresponding council of people's deputies. On the basis of the ballots and absentee ballots which are in the ballot boxes, the commission (for each election district within the boundaries of the given voting precinct) determines the following: the total number of voters who took part in the voting; the number of votes cast for and the number of votes cast against each candidate for deputy; the number of ballots and absentee ballots declared invalid. Votes for the names of citizens added by voters to ballots and absentee ballots are not counted. Ballots and absentee ballots of the wrong type as well as ballots and absentee ballots in which the names of more than one candidate were left when voting are declared invalid. When it is questionable whether a ballot or absentee ballot is valid or not, the question is resolved by the precinct election commission through a vote. The results of the vote count are reviewed at the meeting of the precinct election commission and recorded in the protocol compiled for each election district. The protocol is signed by the chairman, the deputy chairman, the secretary, and the other members of the commission and submitted to the appropriate district election commission. Article 40.

The results of the elections for the district are determined at the meeting of the election commission and recorded in a protocol. The protocol is signed by the chairman, the deputy chairman, the secretary, and the other members of the commission and is submitted to the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission. Article 41.

A candidate for deputy who in the elections received more than half the votes of voters who took part in the voting is considered elected. Elections are declared not to have taken place if less than half the voters recorded on the voter rolls took part in them. Elections overall for the oblast, rayon, or city or for individual districts or for individual voting precincts may be declared invalid because of violations permitted during the elections which influenced the results of the voting. The decision to declare the elections invalid is made by the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission and may be appealed in court within 10 days from the day the results of the elections are published. In the event elections for certain precincts are declared invalid by decision of the corresponding oblast, rayon, or city election commission, the results of the voting for these precincts are excluded from the overall results of the elections, under the condition that without them the elections as a whole may be declared to have taken place. The appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission makes up a protocol on the results of the elections and makes the decision. Article 42.

The runoff is conducted within 2 weeks and the requirements of this Law are observed. The candidate for deputy considered elected is the one who received the largest number of votes of voters who took part in the voting during the runoff in relation to the other candidate, given that more than half the voters recorded in the rolls took part in the voting and that the number of votes cast for this candidate exceeds the number of votes cast against him.

And the appropriate oblast, rayon, or city election commission may make the decision that it is necessary for district and precinct election commissions consisting of new members to hold repeat elections. The voting is done at the same voting precincts and based on the voter rolls compiled for holding the main elections. A person who was nominated and registered as a candidate for deputy while the main elections were being held may not be nominated as a candidate for deputy to that council of people's deputies during repeat elections in this and other districts.
