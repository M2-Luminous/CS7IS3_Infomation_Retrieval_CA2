FR941011-0-00060 FR941011-0-00016 In addition to periods of downtime, periods of low production also appeared to adversely affect performance. The relative usage of an EDP system over any time period can be measured by either comparing the amount of new coating material or new coating solids added to the total capacity of the system. The volume of coating solids added gives a better indication of usage because it is a measure of production. i.e., the number of vehicles coated. This is because, regardless of the coating material used, the same volume of coating solids must be deposited to coat a particular part to a specified film thickness. The other major constituents of the EDP, coating material, VOC and water, do not become part of the final dry coating and can evaporate from the tank during periods of downtime. Therefore, using the volume of new coating material added would not give a consistent measure of usage for systems that use coating materials which contain varying amounts of solids, VOC, and water. The total volume of coating solids added to the EDP tank divided by the total volume of the entire EDP system was found to correlate well with VOC emissions. This ratio has been termed the solids turnover ratio (R T ). The relationship between R T and VOC emissions for 4-week periods is shown in Table 2. As seen in Table 2, VOC emissions, in terms of kilograms per liter of solids deposited, decrease as R T increases. At R T 's above 0.160, emissions are below 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Sources which operate at R T 's of less than 0.160, however, cannot consistently meet an emission limit of 0.17 kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids. Further analysis of the data used to generate Table 2 indicates that for R T between 0.040 and 0.160, VOC emissions are related to R T by the following equation: 0.17 × 350 (0.l60&hyph;R T ) kg of VOC per liter of applied coating solids.
