Armenia "will not give up attempts to expand the so-called "security zone" in Nagorno-Karabakh by occupying new Azerbaijani regions", the press service said. "Within the framework of this annexationist policy, the military and political leadership of Armenia undertook an unsuccessful attempt at intervention into the Beilangan and Tertery districts of Azerbaijan last December," the press service said. According to the statement, this action made Azerbaijan resort to defensive counter measures and resulted in numerous casualties and a new spiral in the armed confrontation between the two states. On the other hand, the press service once again stated that Azerbaijan came out against the war and would insist on a peaceful settlement to the conflict based on "withdrawal of the Armenian forces from all occupied territories and respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and non-violation of Azerbaijan's borders". In this connection, the Azerbaijani president calls on the Armenian leadership to give up the fruitless policy of armed conflict which brings ever increasing sacrifices and tribulations to the Armenian people, the press service said. The president also calls on Armenians living in Nagorno-Karabakh who are citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan to reject participating in military operations on the part of the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia and surrender arms, according to the statement. He guarantees that as Azerbaijani citizens they will exercise their constitutional rights to a safe and peaceful future within the bounds of a single and indivisible Azerbaijan.
