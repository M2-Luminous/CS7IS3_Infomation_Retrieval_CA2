According to the peace agreements, the PN must be dismantled by October. Nevertheless, Santamaria pointed out that a total demobilization may be delayed until December, depending on the PNC deployment process. He gave assurances that the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] had agreed to this, but former guerrilla member Leonel Gonzalez denied the assertion. [Begin recording] [Gonzalez] To extend the PN's existence is to lend institutional support to the crime problem. [Unidentified reporter] Is there a pact between the government and FMLN to postpone the PN's demise, yes or no? [Gonzalez] Such a pact does not exist. There is no pact. [end recording] The FMLN leader said this matter is among the issues most widely debated by both sides, but no specific agreement has been reached thus far. The FMLN does not intend to reschedule the PN's demobilization and is thus requesting that the PNC be deployed more rapidly. [Begin Gonzalez recording] What we have agreed upon so far is that the deployment must conclude by September. By September, approximately 5,700 troops must be trained and deployed. The deployment must conclude at latest in September or October and the PN must disappear. [end recording] Gonzalez said the PN issue will be discussed in depth with UN mediation because the government intends to transfer approximately 1,300 PN members to the PNC in addition to the quota established in the peace agreements.
