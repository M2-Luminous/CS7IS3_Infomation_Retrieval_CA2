The premier declined to elaborate on what was discussed, made just after midnight Thursday Japan time, but a Japanese Government source said both Hosokawa and Clinton agreed to make efforts to avoid retaliatory action being taken. [sentence as received] The measure gives the U.S. Government power to retaliate against trading partners deemed to be engaging in unfair practices. The two leaders failed in talks on February 11 to agree on a new trade framework to reduce Japan's surplus in bilateral trade. Government sources said the Hosokawa government will shortly issue a statement to express its regret over the Super 301 announcement.
