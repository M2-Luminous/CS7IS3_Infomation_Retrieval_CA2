It is known that Yuriy Luzhkov maintains that privatization in Moscow should be implemented taking into account the capital's individual characteristics. Luzhkov sharply criticized the Chubays-style privatization. Anatoliy Chubays has his own arguments and position. You will get more details from interviews with both sides of this dispute about fundamental principles. [Luzhkov] We have made our decision on all the conditions of privatization in Moscow proceeding from the city's interests, and I see no need to change anything in our attitude to what is taking place in the sphere of privatization. [Kiselev] Even despite Anatoliy Borisovich's [Chubays'] appeal to the procuracy demanding that not only this decision but a number of others, too, should be cancelled? [Luzhkov] I can say that Chubays' appeal to the Russian procuracy has no legal grounds, it is nothing but a demonstration and a wish to intimidate the Moscow government and myself. I think that the procuracy will draw an unequivocal conclusion regarding the way we comply with Russian Federation laws. We have not violated Russian laws. We are speaking about our attitude to privatization, the results of its first stage and the failings and failures of the first stage of privatization. The state budget has not received anything, there are no property owners, there is no middle class and territorial individual characteristics are being neglected. Now, when speaking about the shaping of the second stage Mr. Chubays says that the second stage will be based on the achievements of the first step in privatization. What achievements? There is a total failure, a complete mess! What achievements can we talk about? [Chubays] My position is very simple. After all, I am not discussing the advantages and disadvantages of privatization with Luzhkov. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether it is good or bad. I am not discussing with Luzhkov whether he likes it or not. I am speaking about something completely different. I am not debating. I demand that Luzhkov comply with the Russian legislation, Russian laws, the decrees signed by the Russian president, the government decisions signed by Chernomyrdin... [Kiselev interrupts] Anatoliy Borisovich, excuse me for interrupting you but do you not think that your tough attitude toward Moscow Mayor Luzhkov on privatization issues is indirectly affecting the president, his political prestige and authority? After all, at the time the president instructed you to take into account Moscow's individual characteristics while implementing the privatization program. [Chubays] I think that what does affect the president very strongly and is directed right against the president is not my stand on the issue but the blatant violation of presidential decrees currently in force by Mr. Luzhkov who continues to regard himself as a supporter of the president. [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhaylovich [Luzhkov], considering that the president has given Chubays his political support, are you not afraid to incur the president's displeasure because of your criticism of Anatoliy Borisovich? [Luzhkov] I am not afraid and I will tell you why. First, because as early as last December I told Boris Nikolayevich [Yeltsin] that we had arguments against Chubays' methods and asked him to receive us. Boris Nikolayevich met with Chubays and myself and after listening to both of us, made a decision. He instructed Mr. Chubays to prepare a draft decree which would consolidate the individual characteristics of privatization in Moscow, because in his view privatization issues should be solved in a somewhat different manner while preserving the goals and the main principle of reforming the economy. Well, one must say that Chubays failed to comply with the instruction, despite the fact that an absolutely unequivocal and clear instruction was given to prepare a relevant draft decree. Following this, a couple of months later I sent Boris Nikolayevich a letter saying that his instruction was being ignored. So he [Yeltsin] gave instructions again, this time to Viktor Stepanovich Chernomyrdin, to take into account Moscow's individual characteristics and prepare relevant documents which would ensure a legal right to implement these characteristics. So another few months passed but no decision has been made. I therefore believe that in this situation I have a free hand to act in order to protect the city's interests. [Chubays] In fact, I am not at all against a compromise with Moscow. I am truly prepared to design compromise plans applicable to Moscow. But excuse me, as soon as these plans have been approved I will observe them as much as I observe all other presidential instructions. Until such a plan has been designed, as long as the presidential decree on privatization is in force, Luzhkov must comply with it in exactly the same way as all other heads of administration. [Kiselev] But where is the obstacle to designing such a compromise plan? Who is to design it, you or Luzhkov or jointly? [Chubays] I think that Mr. Luzhkov's obvious ambition is the obstacle. As you know, we have put forward a concept of post-voucher privatization. Luzhkov's main demands are as follows: First of all, property must not be sold for vouchers because the vouchers have no value, nobody needs them, so property should be sold for money. But the concept of post-voucher privatization envisions selling for money. Second, Luzhkov used to say that one must not sell so cheaply, much higher prices should be set, property costs much more and it should be revalued. In our concept of post-voucher privatization we proposed that the value of property should be increased at least 12-fold. Third, Luzhkov said heads of administration should be invested with the right to alter the value of property taking into account local conditions. The concept of post-voucher privatization says in black and white that heads [of administration] are allowed to alter the value of property within a range of up to 200 percent. I could comment on the list of demands in greater detail. Look, in this situation Luzhkov should have become, I do not know, chairman of a movement in support of Chubays' post-voucher privatization, leader of the movement if he had been really interested in the matter and the essence of arguments and not the emotional and political layers enveloping them. [Luzhkov] We do not like the second stage for quite understandable reasons -- the same ones which accompanied the failure of the first steps toward privatization. We are saying again that the individual characteristics of the regions need to be taken into account. And with the second stage of privatization Mr. Chubays and the State Property Committee are again saying: No, everything must progress only as the State Property and as Mr.Chubays instructs. And this privatization is not always needed and is not always useful, for the City of Moscow, for example. With regard to the privatization of markets, for example. How can we privatize markets today when criminal bodies may buy them up? And if we find it difficult to fight these criminal bodies today when they don't own the markets, imagine the conditions under which our law enforcement bodies will be working when the markets belong to these criminal bodies. Or with the privatization of hotels, for example, the same reason applies, and in addition to this hotels pay a decent amount into the city's budget. As far as privatization is concerned, we probably need to discuss the fact that privatization should primarily be carried out for economic reasons. If it is advantageous, if the city and the city authorities think that things should be sold, that it cannot manage the property effectively, that the property is not profitable enough, then there is no problem. It should be sold. But if it is of benefit to the city then the city should probably work out for itself what to do with the property. This does not mean we wish to keep property for ourselves, not at all. Our main aim is to emphasize the problem of the economy and the problem of economic expediency. Chubays, the proponent of the market, says you do not have the right to auction and to sell real estate in the City of Moscow at the price fetched at the auction itself. You are limited to the value of two years rent. Well, please, is this really a market? Is Chubays, the democrat and proponent of the market, really offering a democratic approach to the state? It is a monopoly. It is arm-twisting, which does not allow the city to solve its problems in the economic sphere as the city considers expedient. [Chubays] It is not the actual problem which is important but the political game-playing in which Mr. Luzhkov is engaging here. [Kiselev] What exactly are these political games? [Chubays] That is quite simple. You probably remember that I made a statement about six months ago that Yuriy Mikhailovich Luzhkov had begun his presidential campaign. This provoked a very skeptical reaction from many people and very few people took it seriously. They thought that Chubays had just decided to make all kinds of accusations against Luzhkov. No serious expert has any doubt today that Mr. Luzhkov is conducting an active election campaign, an election campaign for the post of Russian president. And that is what has triggered all of this. [Kiselev] Yuriy Mikhailovich categorically denies any intention to start a presidential campaign. [Chubays] Yes, I heard one of his denials. It is traditional for many politicians to deny things until the last minute, to make people beg them to agree and then agree. [Kiselev] Excuse me, Anatoliy Borisovich, but do you not think that in accusing Luzhkov of presidential ambitions, you are putting him at loggerheads with Yeltsin? [Chubays] Well, first the word accusing is inappropriate here. I think that... [Kiselev interrupts] You did make an accusation. [Chubays] What do you mean? It is the right of any politician -- and incidentally Boris Nikolayevich has himself said many times that he thinks it quite allright for people to want to be presidential candidates. [Luzhkov] First, I think that it is quite absurd to talk of a presidential campaign now when we have a living president, a president who is working energetically. It is absolute nonsense. We need to deal with the economy now. That is the main thing for the Russian state today. And I would also like to say secondly -- and this is perhaps a lot more important from the personal point of view -- I have no intention of putting myself forward for high- ranking posts. I have no far-reaching aims. I have already stated many times that my main and only aim is to work in Moscow, for Moscow, and for the people of Moscow. And I do not want to go anywhere, I do not want to go anywhere. I want to do something decent if I can for this city, for my city. [Kiselev] In your view, does Mr. Chubays have some kind of political ambitions in this dispute with you? [Luzhkov] Of course he does. You know, when the person in charge of a system has failed in his work, he has to find explanations for society or he has to find a scapegoat to blame and point the finger at him as the guilty party. [Kiselev] This is the last question that I want to ask you today, Anatoliy Borisovich. You recently appeared on the "Details" program on the second channel and complained that our journalists are often not critical enough of Yuriy Mikhailovich Luzhkov, that they are afraid of the mayor of Moscow. Do you not think that the existing practice of placing paid advertisements in the Russian mass media, in the newspapers and on television -- in which a great deal of money is invested -- actually restricts the freedom of Russian journalists to criticize Chubays and the privatization program? [Chubays] You know, I'm sorry but I cannot agree with you that people are stopping journalists criticizing me personally or the privatization program. I can compete with anyone on the number of critical remarks tossed in my direction, which I have actually received. And as concerns the funds which we spend on propaganda and on information about privatization, I think we do very little on this. I am convinced of this and this is one of the areas we still need to work on. We have not given people enough explanations of the nature, meaning, or aims of the program. That is the absolute truth. And when the funds which we spend on privatization and informing people meet their aims we are sincerely pleased about this. [Kiselev] But there is an important detail here which is not widely known by the public. This money is not, in the main, Russian, it comes from America. The money was allocated by an American agency, a government agency for international development, for privatization advertisements among other things. Do you not think we have a paradoxical picture here -- American taxpayers' money is being spent more or less on investment in the Russian mass media to support certain economic and political programs? [Chubays] You only need to go one step further to accuse Chubays of having been bought out by the CIA. [words indistinct due to Chubays and Kiselev talking over one another] Let us not look at this with stereotypes from the 1930's but in a common sense manner. Some of the funds for information and propaganda about privatization actually do come from Russian money, some of the funds come from international aid to Russia. Moreover, I can tell you that we intend to continue to be active in this sphere. We will gladly accept support from the world community for Russian privatization, especially when it is a matter of free investment from various organizations. I will therefore give an unequivocal answer to your question. Yes, of course we have used them and will use them, and my view is that these funds should be put to even greater use. It would be wasteful to refuse these funds and try to squeeze additional resources for information on privatization from our budget, which is not very generous anyway.
