In a communique issued by the Mexican Consulate in McAllen, Texas, the Mexican Finance and Public Credit Secretariat (SHCP) said this measure had been agreed upon to avoid the jams that have occurred at the Reynosa and Matamoros, Tamaulipas custom stations. The document explained that they are trying to ease and control the international movement of people and merchandise from the United States to Central American countries through Mexican territory. Based on Article 116 paragraph one of the Customs Law, foreigners who want to enter Mexico at border points between Acuna, Coahuila and Matamoros, Tamaulipas will be able to do so at the previously mentioned customs stations. The SHCP also said the Lucio Blanco-Los Indios crossing is part of the Matamoros Customs Office and the facilities at the Colombia, Nuevo Leon Customs Office are adequate and are open 24 hours a day. The communique said that once foreigners are given migrant status, they can take their equipment with them but they will have to request a 10-day temporary permit for the vehicle they are travelling in. It added that people interested in moving merchandise through Mexico should consult a customs agent, who will take care of the necessary procedures at both customs offices.
