Both party leader Thorbjorn Jagland and Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland argued strongly for this at the extraordinary meeting of the party's national executive in Oslo yesterday. Parts of the meeting were open to the press. After introductory remarks by the party leader and the prime minister, members of the national executive were allowed to speak. Storting deputy Hallvard Bakke, who leads Social Democrats Against the EU [SME], was number two in the list of speakers, and he launched a crass attack on the prime minister's arguments on the EU. Bakke also reiterated the demand the no side is making with regard to the party's extraordinary national congress that will probably be held on 18 and 19 June: The opponents of the EU in the Labor Party must be given the same amount of rostrum time in order to be able to put across their overall assessment of the outcome of the negotiations. Bakke himself is unwilling to comment on the result of the negotiations before he has read the documents. "I checked with the foreign minister today, and the results of the negotiations will not be available to the rest of us for many weeks." Bakke added that judging from the newspaper reports the results were more or less as expected. He also asked the prime minister for a detailed review of the budgetary consequences of EU membership and wanted to know how Norway's EU contribution of around 4 billion kroner is to be covered. The SME leader argued strongly against holding the referendum after Sweden. "The result of the referendum could be of practical political significance. But I am not naive. Might is right. The final outcome can probably be taken for granted," Bakke said. The leadership of the Labor Party remains firm that Norway should hold its referendum after Sweden and Finland. Party leader Thorbjorn Jagland yesterday argued that there are democratic and not tactical reasons behind the desire to hold the referendum after those of our neighbors: "We know that many people want to know the outcomes of the referendums in Sweden and Denmark [as published] before they make up their minds, and this is something we should take into account. We cannot allow the danger of being accused of playing a tactical game to prevent us from behaving in a democratic manner. I will take that risk, and I believe I have support for this view in the party, including among people on the no side," Jagland said. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland elaborated: "There is a clear logic in Norway's holding its referendum after the other countries. It was Sweden and Finland that triggered off Norway's process toward the EU; both countries sought membership before we did. And we have to remember that it is not the case that it is Sweden and Finland that are thinking about how we vote in Norway -- it is we who attach importance to what the other two countries do," Brundtland pointed out. The prime minister stressed that Norwegian EU membership will help to unite the Nordic area, while a no could lead to a situation in which the EU's external border follows the border between Norway and Sweden. "That is why knowledge of the Swedish and Finnish votes is of such great importance to the decision we ourselves must take," she said. Jagland said yesterday that the parties in the Storting are hardly likely to meet to decide the date of the Norwegian referendum until after Easter. Thorbjorn Jagland made it clear that the leadership of the Labor Party will not use the party whip on opponents of the EU in the party in the run-up to the referendum. "Both opponents and supporters have just as much right to fight for their views on an issue that will be decided by the people." VERDENS GANG wrote in its editorial column yesterday that "Bakke and Co. are moving ever closer to what has to be called unadulterated splittism -- something that ought to be no joke in the Norwegian Labor Party." Jagland was unwilling to comment on this remark to AFTENPOSTEN. However, a clearly irritated Hallvard Bakke described the article as "a load of rubbish." In his introductory remarks to the national executive meeting Jagland stressed that other rules must apply when something is put before the people in a referendum. "Party discipline must apply in the Storting chamber -- not out of respect for the party, but out of respect for the voters who have supported the Labor Party's program. But once something has been taken out of the Storting, it is the people who decide," he said. He also made it clear that SME is not considered to be a part of the party. "This has been decided by a unanimous central executive. What this organization then gets up to is not the responsibility of the Labor Party," Jagland said. The Labor Party is planning to arrange its extraordinary national congress on Norwegian EU membership for 18 and 19 June. "The date is dependent, however, on whether the EU is able to resolve its internal disagreements on voting rules. It will therefore be the central executive who will fix the final date," party secretary Dag Terje Andersen said yesterday evening after the national executive meeting.
