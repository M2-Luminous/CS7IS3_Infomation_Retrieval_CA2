This proposal was raised in internal deliberations held recently in Jerusalem in anticipation of the next phase of the talks with the PLO. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, Israel has informed the PLO that it will not allow members of the temporary Palestinian Authority, operating in the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, to serve in the same capacity in Jerusalem. This restriction will also apply to Faysal al-Husayni. [passage omitted] Security sources told the cabinet yesterday that the number of terror incidents in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank and the incidence of rioting in the West continues to drop. The sources noted that the number of summer visits to the territories is expected to increase by 70 percent over last year. According to them, over 10,000 visitors might arrive every day, and there will apparently be a great deal of pressure at the Allenby Bridge crossing.
