Last Sunday, two NATO F-18 fighters bombed Serb positions besieging Gorazde in response to a request by UN peacekeepers. The action was repeated the following day. As a matter of fact, the Serbs who claimed that 15 soldiers and several civilians were killed, did not suffer many casualties. The Serbs' reaction to the bombings was immediate and strong although their operation was not a large-scale one. They also immediately suspended contacts with the UNPROFOR [United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia]. Serb leader Radovan Karadzic even canceled a meeting with a U.S. peace emissary scheduled for Monday. In return, NATO threatened to immediately launch a larger-scale air strike if the Serbs retaliated. As Serb forces continued to bomb Gorazde, NATO launched the bombing operation. Long before the first strike was launched, NATO had asked the Serbs to stop the siege of Gorazde declared by the United Nations as a "safe haven." Apparently, the UN had asked NATO to carry out its threat as the Serbs failed to end the siege. As a matter of fact, NATO's bombing operation had by then become controversial. The United States, for example, stated that the bombings were necessary to pressure the Serbs. "If the Serbs remain obstinate, they will face further strikes," said Bill Clinton. A similar threat also came from the UN secretary general. On the other hand, China as a permanent member of the UN Security Council expressed concern over the strikes. "We only support the peaceful settlement of all international conflicts," said a spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Regardless of any controversy, the strikes dealt a serious blow to the Serbs. The Serbs knew very well that NATO had often been hesitant in taking tough action and capitalized on it. They layed siege and bombed Gorazde, where at least 52 Bosnian civilians were killed and hundreds wounded seriously, and this is just one of their blatant violations. On the other hand, NATO's bombing operation did not do much to improve the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Although the UN has been "maintaining security" there for over a year, the Bosnian Muslims as well as Croats are still in danger. The Serbs, who have a better knowledge of the terrain and who are better armed, have easily deceived the UN peacekeepers. As we all know, hundreds of thousands of Bosnians have been killed by Serb miliatiamen in the increasingly absurd [preceding word in English] Balkan crisis. If the UN is serious about overcoming the Bosnian conflict, they should not just take sporadic action. There must be a comprehensive settlement and a preliminary step will be to strictly disarm the Serbs. Without serious action, there will be no way of expecting the Serbs to sit at the negotiating table and draft a common peace plan. Unfortunately, the United Nations or NATO has yet to do this.
