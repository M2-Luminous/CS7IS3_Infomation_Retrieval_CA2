The local administrations for industry and commerce in Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Zhanjiang cities started the investigation immediately after Beecham Group PLC [public limited company], the British holder of the trademark, handed in its complaint about the infringement. The infringers were promptly ferreted out in early April, with 947 boxes of bottled beverages, 600,000 bottle tops, 52,000 packages and 58,000 empty bottles seized, according to a report issued by the SAIC last week. This is the latest case handled in Guangdong, a province which has won praise from foreign businessmen for protecting their registered trademarks in China. In the capital city of Guangzhou alone, more than 900 foreign trademark violation cases have been investigated and dealt with in the past decade, which made up 15 percent of the total trademark infringement cases in the city. Most of the cases handled in Guangzhou concerned trademarks from Hong Kong, Japan, Italy and the United States such as the trademarks for Goldlion, Sharp, Sony, Diadora, Levis and Mobil. China stands firm on the protection of the exclusive rights of the trademarks registered by foreign businesses in China, said a trademark administration official with SAIC, The number of trademark infringement and counterfeiting cases handled by the Chinese administrative authorities for industry and commerce reached 13,042 last year out of which about 500 cases involved foreign trademarks, as disclosed by SAIC statistics. The State's vigilant efforts continue, although the number of trademark violation cases handled so far this year is unavailable, said the official. To ensure rigorous protection, China has so far promulgated the Trademark Law, the Patent Law the Copyright Law, and, the Law Against Unethical Competition, among other laws and regulations, all of which provide a legal guarantee for the protection of intellectual property lights. There has been a rapid increase in trademark applications filed in China by foreign manufacturers and traders. The number of registered trademarks amounted to 59,466 by the end of last year, which was 10 times that of 1979.
