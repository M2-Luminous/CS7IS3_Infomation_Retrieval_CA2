Late on the night of 10 February, the only pipeline still supplying gas to the republic, which crosses the Georgian territory, was blown up once again. The ITAR-TASS correspondent was told at the press service of the Armenian Government that the subversive act was committed at 2330 hours on 10 February near the river Khrami in Marneulskiy Rayon in the southeast of Georgia. A group of Armenian gas workers have been sent to the site to examine and repair the damaged section of the pipeline, the government said. Gas supply to Armenia via Georgia had been cut off on the previous day. According to the Gruzgazprom association, this was caused by a drop in gas supply from Turkmenistan. The Armenian side says that at that point, Georgia was receiving 9-10 million cubic meters of gas a day, while Armenia had been receiving 0.8 to 1.2 million cubic meters a day for the past two months. This tiny amount was just enough to satisfy the bare minimum of the needs of the Armenian economy, and first and foremost, vital facilities, such as hospitals, bakeries, transport, communications, and administrative offices. Since yesterday noon, Yerevan residents have not had any electricity; in the afternoon, the subway was stopped. Domestic heating and hot water are unavailable. Despite the critical situation, 60 industrial enterprises have been working in Armenia today, and trams have been in operation in Yerevan. Buses have been standing idle in the Armenian capital due to lack of fuel.
