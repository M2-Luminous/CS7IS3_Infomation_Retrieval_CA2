Goncz, holding a press conference, said Poland and Hungary are linked by the common goal of quick integration with Western Europe, through European Union membership as well as through cooperation in other fields of international political life. He stressed the importance of regional cooperation, including cooperation within the Visegrad group. "There should be a multicolour Europe of regions, while our integration with European structures would serve Europe as a whole as well as our region," said Goncz. "We have not discussed military cooperation during this visit," the president said adding, however, that there are wide possibilities of cooperation between Polish and Hungarian arms industries. He said he discussed with Polish partners such cooperation and the difficult financial situation of those industries in both countries. Arpad Goncz assured the Polish hosts that there will be no return to the old system after May elections in Hungary "irrespective who wins the elections... Hungary's foreign policy, approach towards the economy and Polish-Hungarian relations will remain unchanged." He added that "for Hungary, Poland, ruled by the left, elected in democratic elections, remains to be the same partner as it had been before."
