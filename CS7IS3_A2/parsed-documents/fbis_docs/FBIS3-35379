According to the report of the central news unit from Kabul, the forces opposed to the president claimed today that they had dispatched hundreds of fresh forces to the battle fronts in the south of Kabul. Meanwhile, on the eighth week after the start of the clashes, the forces loyal to the president still control all the major government centers in the capital and have prevented the penetration of their opponents to the central parts of Kabul. On the other hand, on the eve of the arrival of Pakistan's foreign minister in Kabul, Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Eslami has expressed its readiness to declare another temporary cease-fire. According to the reports from the north of Afghanistan, the central parts of Kondoz province have been the scenes of intense fighting between the forces loyal to the president and the forces of General Dostum. Kondoz Province, which is under the control of the forces loyal to the president, enjoys an important strategic position in the north of Afghanistan, near Tajikistan. On the other hand, the central council of Hezb-e Wahdat-e Eslami [Islamic Unity Party], in a session convened recently in order to investigate the political and military developments in Afghanistan, once again declared its neutrality in the current war in that country.
