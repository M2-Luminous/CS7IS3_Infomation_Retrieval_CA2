However, to demonstrate the basic stand of fulfilling relevant agreements and to hold consultations as soon as possible to resolve various issues arising from exchanges between the two sides of the strait, senior officials of the SEF and the Mainland Affairs Council [MAC] recently decided that following the holding of a mainland affairs work conference in July and after coordinating the resumption of the follow-up working-level consultations, the SEF would be authorized to invite the mainland's Tang Shu-pei [Tang Shubei], executive vice chairman of the ARATS, to visit Taiwan for the second round of the Chiao [Jen-ho]-Tang talks. As for the specific date for the second round of the Chiao-Tang talks, Kao Kung-lien, spokesman for and vice chairman of the MAC, and Chiao Jen-ho, vice chairman and secretary general of the SEF, said recently in separate statements that the second Chiao-Tang talks could take place in August. There is great concern, however, on whether the MAC will still persist in adopting a set of interlocking stratagems in authorizing the SEF to invite Tang Shu-pei to Taiwan for the second round of Chiao-Tang talks according to the relevant stipulations. In particular, the success or failure of the upcoming talks and whether the two sides can establish a common understanding will directly affect the plan for whether the second round of the Ku-Wang [Ku Chen-fu-Wang Daohan] talks can take place this year.
