In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for an original license for the proposed Fitchburg Paper Mill Dam # 4 Hydroelectric project, located on the North Nashua River, in the City of Fitchburg, Worcester County, Massachusetts and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the potential environmental effects of the proposed project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate protection measures, would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Copies of the DEA are available for review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please submit any comments within 30 days from the date of this notice. Comments should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix Project No. 11058 to all comments.
