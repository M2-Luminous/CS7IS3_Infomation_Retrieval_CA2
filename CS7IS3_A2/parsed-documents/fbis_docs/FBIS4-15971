The deputies have begun to study it in their parliamentary factions. We here present to readers the opinion of certain legislators from the State Duma. Valentin Tatarchuk, executive secretary of the "Russia's Choice" bloc deputies' faction: "You certainly cannot harness a horse and a timid doe in the same yoke. The ideological differences based on political forces' differing interpretations of the processes taking place in Russia are not likely to be reconciled quickly. This is a long and complex process. But there is one thing that should be accepted by everyone and should be incorporated in the document -- namely, a written agreement by political and social forces to pursue their activities and resolve their differences within the framework of the Constitution. We have no alternative today: Either we agree to resolve all our problems constitutionally and thereby preserve civil peace, or, if no such document is adopted, we as a people embark on a path of self-destruction, and things will be worse here than in Yugoslavia." Pavel Burdukov, member of the Agrarian Party of Russia deputies' faction: "Only a madman would come out against accord in Russia today. The question is, how can accord be achieved between someone living in semi-starvation and someone gorging on caviar, between a person walking along the street barefoot and the Mercedes owner who spatters him with street dirt? "The proposed draft prompts many urgent questions. If the agreement is to take the form of a social contract, then everyone should bear the burden equally -- government structures, public movements, trade unions. A degree of one-sidedness can be sensed in the present document. For instance, the sides pledge not to use power structures to resolve conflicts. But which sides? Does the Agrarian Party have any power structures? It should be expressed like this: The president and the government pledge not to use the Army, the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], or state security in resolving political disputes. Or take a second point, where it is stated that the trade unions are not to put forward economic or political demands. In that case the other side, having, for instance, stipulated the present standard of living, should pledge at least to maintain that standard. In that case the trade unions' pledge will be appropriate and justified. Certain points which are clearly impossible to fulfill also cause concern. Among them are the promise to lower the level of inflation by the end of the year and eliminate the decline in production. "In my view, the form of the agreement should be sought more in the economic sphere, alleviating the life of particularly vulnerable population strata." Aleksey Mitrofanov, one of the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and its deputies' faction: "The document is very serious, and our group is studying it carefully. We do not regard this draft as final, and we realize that adopting an `Agreement' will not solve the problems. Nonetheless the Russian president's initiative creates a favorable moral and political atmosphere in the country. The draft enshrines a degree of accord between political forces on their standards of behavior, or rather, creates a code of conduct, and that is important. "A number of positions incorporated in the proposed draft correspond in some respects to ours. For instance, it contains a provision on the need to strip any deputy violating the document, once signed, of his powers as a deputy. We advocate the imperative mandate, that is, the right of a faction to exclude renegades from the deputies' list. You will agree that otherwise the question arises: How can violators of the agreement be expelled from the 'body of deputies,' who can actually do this, and how?" Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia and its parliamentary faction: "Accord in society today depends more on the government's actions. You can sign any document you like, but it is not worth anything unless nonpayments are also stopped and wages are no longer delayed. "The proposed draft is an attempt yet again to resolve problems by way of a `roundtable' -- let's sit down and talk about it, issue a decree, and all will be well. The document itself prompts no objections, but it hardly changes anything in practical terms. There is no need to adopt any agreements to do that, it is simply necessary for the government to get down to some real work. But unfortunately the text of the agreement does not guarantee that the executive will start to move more energetically." Natalya Malakhatkina, deputy chairman of the "Women of Russia" political movement's deputies' faction: "Our faction was an initiator of a memorandum like this, so we have studied its content with particular attention. It has a very high status, and there is a danger that it could come above the country's Fundamental Law. It duplicates many of the provisions of the Russian Constitution, and a number of its provisions are actually in conflict with the Constitution. We undoubtedly have here a product that is still raw, proposed by five `roundtables.' But that is why we must do some serious work on it. "For instance, I am concerned about the draft's precise definition of the order in which laws should be adopted. But what is the point of prescribing which law is to be adopted first and which second? You cannot do that -- unforeseen situations may arise, and instead of accord, conflicts that nobody wants will arise."
