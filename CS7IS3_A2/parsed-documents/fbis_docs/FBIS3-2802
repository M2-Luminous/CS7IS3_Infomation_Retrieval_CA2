Bank of East Asia Ltd. Chairman David Li said the 10-year-old peg should be replaced -- after consultations with China, which takes back Hong Kong in 1997 -- with a trade-weighted basket of currencies. "Singapore does it. Taiwan does it. Even China does it," he said. Inflation eased slightly to 8.5 percent for working-class households in 1993, and Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod has forecast a similar level for this year. But the British administration has its hands tied because the dollar peg surrenders monetary policy to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is preoccupied with kick-starting the U.S. economy out of recession. The Hong Kong dollar was pegged at 7.80 per U.S. dollar in October 1983, when Sino-British talks on returning the colony to China in 1997 triggered a crisis of confidence and a flight of capital. With Hong Kong now an economic dynamo, the local dollar has consistently been on the strong side, but the Hong Kong government has repeatedly argued that the peg must stay to guarantee financial stability. Li, who also represents the banking industry in the Legislative Council, disagreed strongly with that view, saying: "Some of our very high power people have their heads in the sand." In a speech to the conference organized by the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW magazine, Li said inflation was fast robbing Hong Kong of its competitive edge against Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. "Inflation is the single greatest threat to our competitiveness," he said. "It is simply too high. Day after day, month by month, we are pricing ourselves out of the market."
