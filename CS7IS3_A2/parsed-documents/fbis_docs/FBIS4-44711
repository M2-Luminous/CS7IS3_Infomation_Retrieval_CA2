It will enable the French aircraft carrier to track 1,000 leads (or potential threats) simultaneously, identify them, and respond as needed," assert electronic engineers of the Directorate of Naval Shipbuilding (DCN). At the tip of the Saint-Mandrier peninsula in Toulon, the system's designers have installed a life-size mockup of the future aircraft carrier's mast, which rises 74 m in height (10 more than on the ship). Over the months, they will use it to fine-tune integration of the different radar, radio, and electronic systems that make up the "eyes and ears" of the Charles de Gaulle, in a real marine environment. Real tests employing aircraft and ships will provide step-by-step verification of work quality, software, computers, consoles--and the whole lot's compatibility. Laboratories will continue ergonomic studies to design the 24 consoles that make up the heart of the Naval Tactical Information System (SENIT-8), which operators will work in four-hour shifts. Everything must be ready in January 1988, when France's first nuclear aircraft carrier will begin its official, 15-month testing period. Until then, there is plenty of work to be done in Toulon, and in the some 200 French and European companies acting as subcontractors. An unusual feature of the system is that its components were purchased on the commercial market, then "hardened" for military needs. This approach will enable engineers to upgrade all or part of the on-board electronics every four years, as technology changes. It also saved money from the outset: of the 17 billion French francs [Fr] the Charles-de-Gaulle will cost, Fr10 to 12 billion are earmarked for the ship itself, and 25 to 30 percent for the combat system. The latter must manage all the information transmitted by its six radars, the radars of the naval group's other ships, early warning planes (AWACS or Hawkeye), and the data supplied by the three satellite systems, Inmarsat, Fleetsatcom, and Syracuse. The combat system must control the launch of defensive weapons (aircraft, missiles, helicopters, decoys, etc.), and keep the carrier in uninterrupted contact with the Navy general staff, its base, any land commandos in operation, its aircraft, the French president, and the ship's internal communication system. Consequently, the Charles-de-Gaulle--whose hull will be launched 7 May in Brest--will be packed with electronics. In addition to its radars, it will boast 80 different antennas, each able to carry four to five transmissions. To avoid interference, engineers are experimenting with different placement patterns on a copper mockup 1/50th the actual size of the ship. Color symbols for each type of threat appear on the consoles of the operations center. The system's eight computers will identify and track them, rating them on a scale of rising danger. Once the threats' fate is sealed, the decision to destroy them, whether they are aircraft, missiles, ships, or torpedoes, is made and implemented. The naval group plays a role in protecting the aircraft carrier. The area surrounding the Charles-de-Gaulle is broken down into four zones. At a distance of over 100 nautical miles, pursuit is guided by an on-board early warning Hawkeye plane (the ship will carry three) or a destroyer. Between 50 and 100 nautical miles, the aircraft carrier's planes (Rafale or Super Etendard, etc.) or the nearby aerial defense support ships will take over. Between 15 and 50 miles, fighters and medium-range missiles will engage the threat. Finally, in the first zone of 15 miles or under, the aircraft carrier's on-board defense weaponry will respond. Naturally, the carrier's weapons must avoid shooting down friendly aircraft. "On 6 June 1944," says destroyer captain Guillot, "90 percent of air losses were caused by the allies themselves, due to lack of coordination." Since the Charles-de-Gaulle will often be traveling in international waters--as the Foch is, off the coast of Yugoslavia--all communication systems have been made compatible with those of our allies. Hence the visits of experts from other navies and their enthusiastic comments, which the DCN plans to use to "sell" the SENIT-8's "forerunner"--the SENIT-6 which equips the anti-aircraft destroyers Jean-Bart and Cassard--on the international market. Yet the SENIT-6 can only monitor 240 potential threats at one time....
