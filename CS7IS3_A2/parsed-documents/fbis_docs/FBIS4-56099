[Kanis] By presenting the document we have begun to institutionalize the process of implemenating the Partnership for Peace program. Relevant organizational structures will be created that will be involved in a specific program of joint actions, as expressed in the individual program. In this way, the basic prerequisites will be created for tackling the questions of Slovak security. A special NATO group will soon come to Bratislava to begin, along with our military and security specialists, to examine the content of the document we have presented to NATO, above all the proposals we have included in it which express our capabilities and resources which we will provide in the implementation of the document presented in Brussels. They will begin to confront the document with reality, with what Slovakia is capable of doing. Up to now, we have received offers for joint exercises from the Netherlands and Norway, and during a dinner the Romanian defense minister also proposed that we carry out such a joint exercise at which a military unit from a NATO member country would participate. We are a small state wrestling with a number of problems and cannot efford to make mistakes in the procedure. We will carefully weigh up the whole situation which arises from the presentation document and create certain model situations. As soon as possible, we would like to prepare all the defense personnel who are going to share in the implementation of the presentation document to a degree which enables us to be perfectly prepared to cope when we take part in joint actions. [passage omitted] [Samel] Unquestionably, the Russian Federation has a specific position in NATO's eyes. Can an individual treaty between NATO and Russia influence the form of the individual treaty concluded between Slovakia and NATO? [Kanis] I believe that the course of NATO has shown that apparently no country has the chance of gaining any other status with regard to the partnership for Peace Program. Naturally, the Russian Federation is a great Euro-Asian power, and because of this it will apparently cooperate in a different manner. I would not exclude the possibility of certain problems being tackled through bilateral U.S.-Russian relations, outside the Partnership for Peace Program. My understanding of the situation is that within the Partnership for Peace program the Russian Federation will be in an equal position. This does not mean that some other, additional provisions will not be included, wither at the bilateral level or at the level of cooperation with NATO. [Samel] Can a situation arise under which Slovakia would be compelled under certain circumstances, such as a treaty between Russia and the United States, to leave the Partnership for Peace program? [Kanis] I totally exclude such a possibility. Central European nations and states today have an opportunity slowly to draw nearer to the West European and trans-Atlantic security, political, and economic structures. Therefore, I do not admit to such a possibility at all. The thing is to ensure that conditions are created within the framework of the Partnership for Peace program for small Central European nations and states to enable them, of their own will, to become a real entity in European politics.
