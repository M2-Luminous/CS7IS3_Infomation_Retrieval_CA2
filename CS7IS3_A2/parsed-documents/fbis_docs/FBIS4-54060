Tahara first mentions a comment by Wataru Kubo, secretary general of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] is approved. Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we have to look at the question of who will lead the next administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters." He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general election. Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system of single-seat and proportional representation because we have promoted political reform this far. "However, the problem is that we will have to hold the election under the multiple-seat constituency system if the Hata administration dissolves the Diet right now." Tahawa presses Kono to explain more fully the LDP's plans if it forces the Hata administration to resign and then forms the next administration before a general election is called. Kono Says: "It depends on the quality of the new government. Mr. Tahara, I think we can say it will still be a minority government if the LDP single-handedly takes power. We will have more Diet seats than the current administration and, unlike the current administration, we will be able to unify opinions more easily because it will be a single-party government. Nevertheless, it will be a minority government. This means we will seek the judgment of the people after making preparations for an election." He is asked if the next cabinet, either an LDP one or an LDP-SDPJ coalition, will be merely a caretaker cabinet which looks after preparations for the next election. Kono says: "Although it is important to seek the judgment of the people, I should not say at this stage that we would hold an election at any cost tomorrow or the day after tomorrow." Asked to explain differences between the policies of Shinseito [Japan Renewal party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa and his own, Kono says: "It seems Ozawa is saying the people exist for the nation, that priority should be given not to the people but to national interests. We maintain, however, that we will build a nation for the people."] On reorganization, which he made at a news conference in China on the possibility of returning to the coalition. Asked what he thinks of Kubo's comment, Kono says Kubo also feels the current political situation, in which the country is led by a minority government, is abnormal and that the Hata cabinet should resign en masse. He also points out that Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, following Kubo's remark, hinted at the possibility of the government dissolving the cabinet if the SDPJ comes back into the coalition. Kono then says: "As the chief cabinet secretary's remarks indicate, the current administration would do anything as long as it can remain in power." He is then asked if the LDP will change its strategy if the SDPJ returns to the coalition. Kono says: "The SDPJ is a big party, so there are many different opinions among its executive department members, including Kubo and Muryama." Tahara then asks Kono to explain the LDP's strategy once it has called for a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet. Kono provides a lengthy critique of the minority government and its inability to manage state affairs, and says the cabinet should resign en masse immediately after the fiscal 1994 budget is approved. Kono says: "After the current cabinet resigns en masse, we have to look at the question of who will lead the next administration. We have to talk about whether we will be able cooperate with each on matters of policy. We are now working through our respective Diet policy committees to find out if we can cooperate with the SDPJ on Diet policy matters." He is then asked for his thoughts on the next general election. Kono says: "The next election should be held under a system of single-seat and proportional representation because we have promoted political reform this far.

We maintain, however, that we will build a nation for the people." On reorganization in the political world, Kono says the system of two major parties proposed by Ozawa will not be able to meet people's demands. "I think there should be many parties," he says. Asked about revising the constitution, Kono says: "I think the time is not ripe enough to revise the constitution."
