Mr Patten said he was prepared to receive Mr Lu--who arrives in Hong Kong tonight--in his capacity as a representative of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC), despite a government ban on official contacts with the Beijing- appointed body. "That would create no difficulties for me," Mr Patten said, in response to a question from the SUNDAY MORNING POST. "It doesn't matter what hat he wears, whether it's head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office or Secretary-General of the PWC, the important thing is there is a long agenda of issues and the people of Hong Kong expect us to get on and find solutions." The comments came as the Chinese Joint Liaison Group team leader Guo Fengmin revealed that contacts were under way to fix a date for a meeting of the Airport Committee, which has not convened since August. Mr Guo was "optimistic" about making progress. "We are prepared to hold the Airport Committee meeting in a few weeks' time, but we have to discuss the exact date with the British," he said. "There is still a gap between the two sides but there has already been some progress." It will be the first opportunity for the committee to discuss the fresh financing package for the Chek Lap Kok project that the Government put forward in January. The Chinese side has raised no major objections to the plan. Mr Patten's offer to meet Mr Lu was last night welcomed by advisers to Beijing, who warned that China could undermine its position by continuing to snub Mr Patten. But XINHUA (the NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY) insisted a meeting between the two remained impossible. Until now, the Government has barred all official contacts with the PWC. Secretary for Economic Services Gordon Siu Kwing-chue was denied permission to brief a PWC economic sub-group. A government source insisted Mr Patten's remarks did not amount to a recognition that the PWC could replace existing diplomatic channels. The Governor's offer comes after mainland officials said that since Mr Lu's nine-day visit was in the capacity of PWC Secretary- General, meeting the Governor would be inappropriate. "Mr Patten has tried his best to create a good environment for a meeting with Mr Lu and if Mr Lu still resists this, then it will undermine his image among Hong Kong people," leftist legislator Tam Yiu-chung said. "Even if he refuses to agree to a formal meeting, at least Mr Lu could meet and shake hands with Mr Patten at a public function." In Guangzhou, newly-appointed Hong Kong Affairs adviser Anthony Cheung Bing-leung said the Governor's offer showed he was adopting a more pragmatic approach towards the PWC. But XINHUA Assistant Director Li Weiting said Mr Patten's remarks would make no difference: "I don't think this will help. Mr Lu is terribly busy this week and has to hurry back to Beijing to attend some meetings." In Hong Kong, XINHUA Deputy Director Zheng Guoxiong said it was more important for Mr Lu to spend his time meeting ordinary members of the community. "Mr Lu is visiting Hong Kong in the capacity of Secretary-General and Vice-Chairman of the PWC, to take part in meetings of the PWC's political and economic sub-groups," Mr Zheng said. "His schedule is really tight and he is unable to meet the Governor. He will use his very limited time to meet all sectors and groups in Hong Kong society.
