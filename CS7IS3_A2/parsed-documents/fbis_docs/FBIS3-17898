I need an enemy, somebody to fight with. The Communists and the Democratic Russians are lying down -- who can I fight with? I cannot kick a man when he is down, understand? There is nobody to fight. [Correspondent] That is how the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] leader assessed the political power of his party today. [passage omitted] The first task of the LDPR now is the struggle for the rights of Russians in the former Soviet Union, and, says Zhirinovskiy, this struggle will be merciless. [Zhirinovskiy] We will use all the most effective means to defend our population, so that they will always [words indistinct] to touch citizens of the Russian state, always. There will only be a scorched desert left. There will be nothing left. [Correspondent] Apart from that, the leader of the LDPR once more made a firm prediction for the geopolitical future of the former republics of the Soviet Baltic. [Zhirinovskiy] You will get a governor general of the Baltic guberniya, a Russian, in the capital, in Riga, you will get a small town of Tallinn choking without light or heat, where Estonians will catch fish and eat them cold because there will be no electricity, and the town of Kaunas, the capital of the little Lithuanian state. You will definitely get that. A weak little national banner will flap in the wind over those two territories, Kaunas and Tallinn. [passage omitted]
