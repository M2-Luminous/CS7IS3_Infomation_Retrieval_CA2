No protest or written or oral complaint regarding such ceremonies has been received by this ministry. Concerning the celebration of the Orthodox Easter in Tirana, the ministry explains that at 1230 on 27 April 1994, Police Commissariat No. 2 in Tirana District received a written request from the Autocephalous Church of Albania which presented two requests. One was for permission for a procession of clerics to go from the church to Kavaje Street and back again. This permission was requested for 29 April 1994 at 1900. The second request had to do with the organization of a ceremony in the form of a gathering, to celebrate the resurrection ritual. For this ceremony, the construction of a tribune on the pavement in front of Mihal Duri Factory was requested. They asked for permission to hold this ceremony on 30 April 1994 from 2300 until 0015. By means of an official document No. 1195/1 dated 27 April 1994, Police Commissariat No. 2 responded that the organization of both ceremonies creates serious traffic problems on the national road, something that can be of consequence for the lives of the people. That is why it did not conduct security for these two activities. At the same time, the commissariat suggested that it was ready to go anywhere but the national road and provide security for the event. Through a second document dated 28 April 1994, the Autocephalous Orthodox Church authorities relinquished their first demand and asked only for approval of the second request, without presenting any protest or complaint against the police. On 29 April 1994, the church authorities received a final positive answer from Police Commissariat No. 2 to hold this event. Besides this, regarding contacts between police representatives and high church authorities, including the archbishop, they have received only thanks from them and no complaints. The Public Order Ministry stresses that the religious masses are free and no one hinders them in the Republic of Albania. However, when a religious authority requests help from public order authorities, they of course will give it according to their ability to secure the event. We express our surprise and deep indignation at the tendency of the Greek Government to exploit even Easter Day for its political aims.
