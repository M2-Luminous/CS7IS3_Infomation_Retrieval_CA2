It has been reported grocery stores are crowded with people stockpiling packed Chinese noodles, tissue paper, and butane fuel. Anticipating and preparing for a disaster is a natural act of a head of a family and this is an act not to be criticized. Our people are instinctively accustomed to preparing for a disaster with the irrational unpredictable group ruling in the North. We need to ponder, however, if our immediate reaction to overcome the present crisis should be stockpiling daily necessities. Will stockpiling material goods really help us get out of the serious crisis we might be facing? Will we be able to boil the Chinese noodles if the water and electricity supply is cut off in a high-rise apartment? Instead, we ought to begin to exercise self-restraint and pull ourselves together. We should rectify the trend of society that is moving toward depravity in which imprudent people do not care about the country or society in their decadent extravagance and in which people in their selfish indulgence do not know the virtue of living together. We must turn these social conditions into a healthy social environment. To this end, we should refrain from making vain assurances, political circles should stop the insincere habit of dividing and feuding, and the leading circles should reflect if they have given up the habit of hurting the other side even in a crisis. The North's motive in continuing war threats against us, while it has no possibility of winning the war, is evident. The North intends to cause confusion and damage in the South, thereby securing an advantageous position in negotiations. What is the way to stop in advance the North's provocation, which the North can perpetrate foolishly. Our natural resources were not responsible for the material wealth we were able to attain from the helpless poverty and scars of war -- it was our spiritual ability that enabled us to achieve what we have today. Therefore, what the North's reckless group fears is our stubborn spiritual ability. If we run about in confusion and panic, the North will focus on this disaster. We should maintain a firm stance and arm ourselves with the will to overcome the national crisis. This could lead the North's rulers to reconsider their foolish illusion. The government is setting up a contingency plan to cope with an emergency. Instead of stockpiling, which is prompted by selfishness and which causes confusion, we should help the government carry out its plan to deal with the crisis and explore ways to survive together. This is a more effective way to cope with the crisis. Civil defense exercises, training programs, and air-raid and disaster drills should realistically educate citizens to overcome the emergency. We are confident we will win. To win, however, everyone should not neglect his or her responsibility to overcome the crisis. Now is the time everyone should be aware of this.
