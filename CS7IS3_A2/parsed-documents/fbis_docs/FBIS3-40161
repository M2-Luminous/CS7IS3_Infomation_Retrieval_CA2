In 1993 we first had freezing cold and then hail damage and tornadoes, and with summer came disastrous floods which caused major losses in agricultural production, personal property and state property. Direct economic losses attributable to these disasters amounted to more than 10 billion yuan for the whole province. When the disasters happened, the people of the whole province, under the leadership of the party committees and government at all levels fought the disasters courageously to rebuild their homes; the insurance departments played a major role in these activities. Up to the present date, the provincial insurance system has paid out over 150 million yuan in insurance claims to over 6,300 afflicted enterprises in the disaster areas, to over 120,000 households which suffered damage and for over 4.3 million mu of damaged cropland. A great many damaged enterprises were able to resume normal production and operations very quickly, and the suffering people were able to stabilize their lives in short order. Various types of post-disaster self-help activities were able to be carried out swiftly after the calamity. The experience in fighting and recovering from these disasters showed the leadership at all levels and each comrade working in the rural villages that in the countryside, if we want to effectively organize the farmers to fight and recover from disasters, one of the major aspects that must be attended to is the forceful expansion of the insurance sector. Hunan is a major agricultural province, and is one in which natural disasters frequently occur. That we must make major efforts to organize the farmers to prevent and recover from disasters is commonly recognized by every level of leadership. However, that insurance is a major link to be forged in this major undertaking is something that some of our comrades do not easily comprehend. From this we can see that in order to effect a great expansion of rural insurance, the first task is for all levels of leadership to have a correct understanding of insurance, and a common understanding which includes grasping at least three points of truth and fable. 1. Expansion of insurance will not hamper production, but can only greatly promote production. A necessary condition for guaranteeing the smooth operation of production and the expansion of reproduction is the establishment of a reserve insurance fund to be used to make up the economic losses incurred from natural disasters and unexpected accidents. This will not only not hinder production, but on the contrary, can only strengthen and promote production. This is especially true in agricultural production where natural calamities abound and to a great extent, one "depends upon nature for food." The situation in our province last year amid the major calamities completely substantiated this point. In July, in Hangongdu Village, Tingcheng District of Changde City, more than 20,000 mu of cotton was inundated, more than 5,000 mu was flattened and died. Because they had insurance, the People's Insurance Company paid over 950,000 yuan in compensation. The affected cotton farmers used the advance compensation to quickly purchase materials for resuming production, and used the opportunity to convert the cotton fields to rice paddies and planted over 4000 mu of rice. However, in some places insurance is not handled well, and after a disaster even resuming normal living is extremely difficult, much less is there a quick recovery in production. 2. Insurance is not an added burden for the farmers, but can only lessen their load. Insurance is an economic compensation system, concretely embodied in the form of a reciprocal economic contract. The farmers take on the responsibility of paying insurance fees, and then have the right to receive insurance compensation from the insurance company in times of disaster. This sort of reciprocal right and responsibility relationship is of course not the same as the unfettered apportioning of expenses or exacting fees. A bit of honest social enquiry will show that at the present, the farmers' heaviest and most feared burdens are disaster without relief, aging without caretakers, and sickness without medical aid. When the farmers join the insurance system and pay the small insurance fee, then when a calamity happens or the insurance comes to full term, they can receive the corresponding economic compensation or insurance payoff, and achieve their goals of having compensation for disaster, care in old age and medical care when ill. Thus, the fear of trouble dogging their steps is eliminated and their ability to withstand risks is enhanced. How can this do anything other than relieve the farmers' burdens? 3. Insurance is not a governmental burden, but lessens its worries and solves its problems. When the populace meets with disasters and production encounters difficulties, all levels of government must as a matter of course fulfill their duties and responsibilities to relieve the troubles of the people. However, the losses caused by disasters are not problems which can be solved by relying solely upon the limited relief funds of the government, and the relief aid of other social departments is also extremely limited. The positively effective method is to rely upon insurance to mitigate the dangers, to organize a thousand households to come to the aid of one. During the recent disasters, the county magistrates in the areas where insurance matters were well handled happily said: "When we saw the insurance agents appear we gained peace of mind." "In the disasters this year, with insurance as our backup, it was a lot easier to be a county (village) magistrate." From this we can see that insurance does not make trouble for the government, but lessens the worries and solves the problems of our leaders at all levels. Insurance benefits the farmers in many ways. Logically speaking, every level of leadership should give full support to insurance. However, this is not the way it works out in real life. Some comrades talk about the importance of insurance, but if you expect them to really give support and aid, they are unwilling and ineffectual; in an informal setting they will talk about the importance of insurance, but in the formal setting with the masses they are not so bold or assured on insurance matters. There are several problems with the line between truth and falsehood which must be clarified if we expect all levels of leadership to put their back into supporting the expansion of the insurance sector. First, we must make a clear distinction between organizational mobilization and administrative interference, and boldly solve the difficulties involved in expanding the insurance sector. At present, we have a great many comrades who are not at all clear about what sort of role the various levels of government and the various levels of leadership should play in economic construction under the market economy. They onesidedly think that in running a market economy, neither the leaders nor the governmental departments can be of much help as far as economic work is concerned. They can think of nothing to say and can find no place to play a useful role. Thus, when the insurance departments mention some concrete problems and questions which require their help in solving, they are always unavailable and evasive, fearing that giving support to insurance work means using administrative measures to interfere with economic work. This sort of mindset is extremely harmful. Insurance is a social action. We want all levels of leadership to support the development of rural insurance so as to draw support from administrative influence and to initiate an effective organization and mobilization throughout society. For instance, focusing on the problem of the weak understanding of rural insurance, the various levels of leadership and governmental departments can and indeed should, through effective channels and forms, initiate a widespread propaganda and mobilization effort directed at the farmers to enhance their understanding of the risks involved and so voluntarily join the insurance program. Done in this way, there is nothing they can be reproached for. There is a fundamental difference between this sort of work and the type of administrative interference which forces the farmers to do this or not do that without regard to objective conditions. For this reason, we want to make the organization and mobilization of the farmer to voluntarily elect to take insurance and the resolution of various problems in the expansion of the rural insurance sector a real part of the work of all levels of leadership and governmental departments, and have them do this work boldly and assuredly. Secondly, we must clearly differentiate between voluntary uniform election of insurance and forced participation in insurance, and boldly expand the happy circumstance of the broad masses of farmers gladly accepting the expansion of rural insurance. Some time ago the insurance company did some useful exploration of the ways to organize the farmers to get insurance. For instance, to focus on the fact that farmers' housing is widely dispersed in many locations over a wide area, the implementation of uniform insurance registration on a voluntary basis, one could say, has a positive effect on the rural insurance industry, and is a useful way to adapt to present conditions in rural villages and expand rural insurance. However, some people latched on to the fault that some of the work done in the process of organizing was rather haphazard, found grievous fault with this method, calling it forced insuring: This is not fair. Looking at the actual situation in our province's rural villages at the present moment, it would seem a reasonable request to ask the insurance company to send a person to knock on every door and collect insurance fees. However, looking at the actual situation in the province, it would be extremely difficult to actually do this and in some places one can say that it is impossible to do. Even if it could be done, it would greatly increase to the operational costs of rural insurance and would adversely affect the accumulation of risk funds. For this reason, on the basis of an all-round propaganda mobilization and the voluntary participation of the farmers, the insurance company, through its agents, conducted uniform insurance election procedures. It is a necessary and feasible method which cannot be simply labeled "total insurance" meaning that it was forced insurance. At present, following changes in governmental functions, the forms of governmental support of insurance have seen corresponding changes, going from direct involvement to indirect propaganda and guidance. For this reason, we must be based on reality, and boldly expand the beneficial situation in which the broad masses of farmers willingly join in, taking the new path of a combination of direct acceptance of insurance and the use of agents, and pushing rural insurance work to ever higher levels. Thirdly, we must make clear the relations between the Peoples' Insurance Company and other insurance organizations, and actively support the Peoples' Insurance Company's role as the main channel of insurance. With the continued flourishing of the socialist market economy, it is necessary that many more insurance entities be fostered. However the unique aspect of rural insurance is that the agricultural products production process is greatly affected by the natural elements and the rural households operate over a widespread area, so that once a calamity hits, not only are the losses tremendous, the survey of the damage done and calculation of compensation also requires a tremendous amount of men and materiel. This makes it necessary for the organization providing rural insurance to have not only great power, but to have a vast staff of personnel and a tremendous insurance network. Considering the several insurance organizations which are expanding the insurance business in our province at present, the China Peoples' Insurance Company is the one which can satisfy the requirements of the broad masses of the farmers. All levels of the party and government should actively support the China People's Insurance Company's in carrying out its work in the rural villages and playing the role of main insurance channel. As far as those insurance organizations which as yet are unable to provide insurance service to the villages, all levels of the government and the financial control departments should follow governmental policies and regulations, actively aid in creating appropriate circumstances, while at the same time strengthening control and discipline, so as to unfalteringly protect the personal interests of the broad masses of farmers.
