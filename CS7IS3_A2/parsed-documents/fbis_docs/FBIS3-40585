It is important to create an atmosphere that is conducive to productive talks at the secretary's level, to start on 1 January. A spokesman of Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said during a routine briefing that the foreign secretary has informed diplomats from eastern Europe and Islamic countries about the situation in Kashmir and the Indian atrocities there. According to the spokesman, the government of Pakistan has warned India to stop the activities of RAW [Research and Analysis Wing (Intelligence Agency)] in Pakistan, because Pakistan and some neighboring nations have proof of its ugly activities. The spokesman further said that if India does not stop the campaign of disinformation against Pakistan, then Pakistan will unmask the activities of RAW. India and Pakistan will have talks on Kashmir in Islamabad on 1 January at the foreign secretary's level. The Pakistani government took back a resolution introduced in the United Nations about human rights violations in order to create a friendly atmosphere for these talks. According to the Pakistani government, some friendly nations have assured that India will be serious in these talks; however, the attitude the Indian government has taken does not give us much hope. India responded to Pakistan taking back the resolution from the United Nations with inhuman acts in Sopur and endless destruction in occupied Kashmir. Afterwards, India continued its shameful atrocities in occupied Kashmir. In Sopur alone, 150 people were killed and 20 were wounded on 26 November. Over 400,000 Indian troops are already present in occupied Kashmir. Recently, East Punjab has sent fresh forces to the valley. The agents trained by the Israeli secret agency, Mosad, are creating havoc in Kashmir. Pakistan has also taken notice of Indian intelligence agency RAW's instigative activities in Pakistan. The fact is that India is using RAW to spread chaos in Pakistan, especially in Sindh, in order to divert the attention of the world from the Kashmir issue and to spread fear and terrorism in Pakistan. Sindh is especially a target of RAW's activities. It is an open secret that some separatist elements in Sindh have a direct connection with RAW. The agents of RAW, dressed as robbers, encourage instigation and terrorism. India wants to create a situation similar to that of East Pakistan in Sindh. The communal and racial riots of Sindh were also encouraged by agents of RAW there. Now the situation is such that the shameful atrocities in Kashmir are increased, the number of troops is augmented, help from Mosad is taken to crush the activities of Kashmiri freedom fighters, and India's intelligence agencies are active against Pakistan's freedom and unity. We cannot call all these activities sincere or the atmosphere friendly. Pakistan has informed the friendly nations about the atrocities being conducted against Kashmiris, especially those countries that have assured Pakistan that India will be serious in the next series of talks, has taken a very appropriate step. The government of Pakistan should also inform them about India's atrocities in Kashmir and RAW's activities in Pakistan, so that if no progress is made in these talks because of India's attitude, then India will not be able to accuse Pakistan. Instead, these countries will learn that it is India's attitude that is the major hindrance to making these negotiations successful.
