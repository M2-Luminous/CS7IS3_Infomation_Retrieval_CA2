FBIS4-5161 "dreas068_c_94010" FBIS-EAS-94-068 Daily Report 8 Apr 1994 North Korea ROK Nuclear Reactors `Disguised' for Military Use ROK Nuclear Reactors `Disguised' for Military Use SK0804060094 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0542 GMT 8 Apr 94 SK0804060094 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Indictment Against Nuclear Warmaniacs"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today describes the white paper recently issued by the Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) on the nuclear arms development of the South Korean authorities as one more stern indictment against the nuclear warmaniacs. The news analyst says: According to the white paper, the South Korean puppets have long since promoted the development of nuclear weapons under the nuclear umbrella of the United States. The heavy water reactor in Wolsong and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, South Korea, are, to all intents and purposes, military facilities for nuclear arms development disguised as "commercial" and "research" reactors. The heavy water reactor in Wolsong is not for "generating electricity." It was introduced for the production of plutonium. The reactor's structure is so designed as to change spent nuclear fuel any moment without stopping its operation. The multipurpose research reactor in Taedok can be easily remodeled into a reactor producing plutonium any moment. Moreover, it is closely attached to a semi-reprocessing facility. It must not go unnoticed that nuclear arms development is being promoted in secrecy at South Korea's atomic reactors and research reactors which are claimed to be undergoing routine inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It is only too natural that Hanminjon raised a question why the IAEA, while taking issue with the pilot reactor of the North, had not published the results of its inspection of South Korea's heavy water reactor and multi-purpose research reactor used for military purposes, whose capacities are scores of times and several times greater than the North's. The South Korean people are now fighting against war and nuclear weapons and resolutely rejecting the Kim Yong-sam bellicose group's development of nuclear weapons. They will mete out a punishment to the Kim Yong-sam group.
