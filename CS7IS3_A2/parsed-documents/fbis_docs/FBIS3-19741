The slogan "Leader Apo [alias for Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK]" was shouted at the Nevruz celebration organized by the Democracy Party [DEP]. Party officials tried to suppress certain slogans and behavior. [Begin correspondent Aydogan Kilinc recording] In response to the request by DEP's Ankara provincial organization to celebrate Nevruz, the Ankara governor allocated a wedding hall in Altindag. Strict security measures were taken around the hall and those entering the premises were searched. The slogan "Resistance Means Existence," written in Turkish and Kurdish, drew the most attention. Many people wearing yellow, red, and green bands, the PKK's colors, made victory signs. A young girl wrapped in these colors danced and excited the 300-strong crowd and people started shouting extremist slogans. When Imam Canpolat, leader of DEP's Ankara provincial organization, said that there is no middle path, which means surrender, the shouts of "Leader Apo" in Kurdish rose in the hall. DEP deputy leader Remzi Kartal got angry when he heard this slogan and warned the gathering that Nevruz cannot be marked under such conditions. He called on the crowd to act in accordance with the DEP's program and principles. He reacted strongly when his advice was not heeded. Remzi Kartal said that efforts are under way to push his party, whose ouster from the parliament is being sought, outside the legitimate system. He said that all the laws in the country are being used to close down the DEP. He added that the sole objective of the DEP is to contribute to the democratic and political solution of the Kurdish issue, which has become the country's main problem. The crowd in the hall booed Prime Minister Tansu Ciller's proposal that Nevruz be an official holiday. The crowd then listened to songs in an attempt to calm itself and dispersed without incident.
