According to the press, Czechoslovakia as a member of the former Warsaw Pact, was charged with the development of bacteriological weapons. They were allegedly developed at an undeground center of the Military Research Institute near Techonin, east Bohemia. The media claimed that the bacteria and viruses developed in Techonin had been hidden at various localities in the Czech Republic. The press reports said that this not only contravened the Czech Republic's international commitments, because the country had signed the Geneva convention under which states undertake not to develop, use and store without international agreement biological weapons, but also threatened the public.
