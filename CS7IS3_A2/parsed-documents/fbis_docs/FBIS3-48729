The demonstration lasted about one and half an hours at Gate No. 1 of the Eighth U.S. Army compound. Protesting drivers said that Chong Yang-han, age 48, was driving his "Arirang Taxi" along a back alley near Hannam Village, Hannam-dong around 11:20 a.m. when an American M.P., identified only as Cpl. Harrison, who was following the taxi in his patrol car, stopped Chong. An argument ensued between the two over whether Chong violated a lane. In the quarrel, Harrison all of a sudden handcuffed Chong and took him into the Eighth Army compound, the drivers said. Learning of the incident, about 100 "Arirang" drivers drove their taxis to the gate to stage the protest until Chong was set free around 3 p.m.
