Background The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is responsible for the safety of flight in the United States and for the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and U.S. operators throughout the world. Section 103(1) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (Act) declares, as a matter of policy, that the regulation of air commerce to promote safety is in the public interest. Section 601(a) of the Act provides the FAA with broad authority to carry out this policy by prescribing regulations governing the practices, methods, and procedures necessary to ensure safety in air commerce. In the exercise of these statutory responsibilities, the FAA has determined that the current civil war in Afghanistan justifies the imposition of certain measures to ensure the safety of U.S.-registered aircraft and operators that are conducting flight operations in the vicinity of Afghanistan's territory and airspace. Fighting between the current government and various factions had been localized to an area around Kabul and the northern portion of the country. However, recent fighting has intensified and spread to a larger area of the country. Areas of northern Afghanistan, including major airbases and military garrisons at Mazare Sharif, have come under the control of heavily armed insurgent forces opposed to the Kabul regime.
