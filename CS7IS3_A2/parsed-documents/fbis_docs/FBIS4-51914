FBIS4-51914 "dreas086_d_94020" FBIS-EAS-94-086 Daily Report 4 May 1994 South Korea Attention Shifts to Chongwadae Attention Shifts to Chongwadae SK0405095594 Seoul YONHAP in English 0753 GMT 4 May 94 SK0405095594 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Report by Cho Se-hyon] [Text] Seoul, May 4 (YONHAP) -- The public's attention has shifted to Chongwadae [presidential office] after Chong Chu-yong, who is being tried on charges of violating the election law, declared Tuesday that he would keep his hands off the Hyundai business group's management. Like it or not, the ball is now in Chongwadae's court and political and business leaders, as well as ordinary citizens, are waiting to see how the office of President Kim Yong-sam treats the beleaguered honorary chairman of one of the nation's largest conglomerates. It is true that the judicial branch of government will have to handle Chong's case in court while the economic ministries must decide whether to ease various restrictions imposed on Hyundai companies. But it is almost common knowledge that their actions depend largely on how Chongwadae receives Chong's retirement declaration, seen by many as a desperate plea for presidential leniency. The initial reaction from Chongwadae was said to be cool. "It is none of Chongwadae's business," one official was quoted as saying. "Chongwadae is not interested in what becomes of the chairman or honorary chairman of one particular business group." Another senior presidential aide went so far as to ask reporters to describe Chongwadae's reaction to Chong's statement as "cold." Chong managed to earn the wrath of President Kim when he ran in the Dec. 18, 1992, presidential election and "muddied" the campaign climate by "abusing" his group's money and manpower. In the eyes of then-presidential candidate Kim Yong-sam, Chong may have personified the evil force in society which holds that "money can buy all." Even after Kim was elected president, he reportedly vowed to "straighten out the bad habit with which (he) tried to buy power with money." The cool response from Chongwadae is understandable since the presidential office has gone on record as saying that in Chong's case, it would simply follow "the principle of law." Behind the stony facade, however, Chongwadae appears to have received Chong's declaration somewhat "positively," although suspicions about his true intentions linger as he did not say he would give up his honorary chairmanship of the Hyundai group. Chong is likely to gain from his move only when he proves through deeds, not words, that he indeed intends to drop business and retire to his farm in Sosan, South Chungchong Province, to concentrate on farming. "We have never discriminated against the Hyundai group," said one Chongwadae official, brushing aside complaints by many Hyundai executives. "The problems of the Hyundai group, if any, are one thing and those of Chong Chu-yong are another," he added. In other words, the government is expected to take phased action in starting to treat the Hyundai group the same as other business conglomerates -- that is, if Chong really does leave behind the world of business. As for the legal case against Chong, there appears to be no change: Chongwadae will let it take its full course. The feeling is that Chong's actions must be handled in accordance with the law, if only to show the public that before the law, everyone is equal. In view of Chong's advanced age, however, many Chongwadae officials appear to believe that he is likely to receive a suspended sentence even if he is convicted.
