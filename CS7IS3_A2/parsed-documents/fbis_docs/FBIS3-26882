This conviction was shared by Major and Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Major arrived in the Russian capital on Monday [14 February] night on his first-ever visit to the country. His talks with Yeltsin on Tuesday resulted in the signing of a package of documents and agreements on international issues. Among the accords, the most important is an "unprecedented" statement on reciprocal non-targeting of strategic nuclear missiles no later than May 30, 1994. The statement envisages everyday control over Russian and British nuclear forces. The two leaders also reached an essential agreement on joint military exercises starting from 1995 to increase their armed forces' capability "for interaction in peacekeeping operations." Details of further military cooperation between the two sides were discussed by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd behind closed doors. Moreover, Hurd and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev signed an accord on cooperation in education, science and culture. They also signed a convention against double taxation to cement the basis of Russian-British economic relations. According to official sources here, Britain was the third largest trade partner with Russia in 1993, when a trade volume of 2.8 billion U.S. dollars was registered. Major also met with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin to discuss further developing trade and economic relations. Summing up the results of their talks in the Kremlin, both Major and Yeltsin told reporters that they held identical views on certain international issues, the Bosnian crisis in particular. Major said he found "no major contradictions" with the Russian leader on the Bosnian problem and both leaders were committed to a peaceful settlement of the conflict. Major said he and Yeltsin also agreed on the necessity to place under U.N. control the heavy weapons of the warring parties around Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Herzegovina. But major pointed to Russia's "certain misunderstanding of the essence of the NATO decision" to unleash air strikes against the Bosnian Serb positions around Sarajevo if the Serbs fail to withdraw their heavy weapons from around the city by midnight GMT on Sunday. Yeltsin told reporters, "Our stands are identical on the main point -- it is necessary to hand over to the U.N. forces the heavy guns deployed around Sarajevo. This measure will allow us to stop the shelling of that city." However, the Russian president stressed, "Some people are trying to solve the problems of Bosnia without Russia. We shall not allow this to happen." Diplomats here said other topics discussed by Major and Yeltsin were Russia's "interaction" with the Group of Seven industrialized countries and the European Union and Moscow's relations with the Baltic nations. Major will leave Moscow for Nizhniy Novgorod, a major Russian city on the Volga, on Wednesday and from there he will depart for London later in the day.
