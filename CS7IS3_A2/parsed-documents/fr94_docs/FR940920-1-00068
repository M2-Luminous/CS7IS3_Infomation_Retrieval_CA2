Introduction This section provides an introduction to the proposed rule by: (1) Summarizing the history of the development of emission guidelines for existing MWC's over the past 7 years; (2) summarizing the general goals of the proposed rule that are specified by sections 111(d) and 129 of the Act of 1990; and (3) providing a brief overview of the major issues discussed in this preamble. A. Summary of Regulatory History Today's proposal is a result of a series of regulatory decisions that were initiated in 1987. During the early and mid-1980's, studies were performed to determine whether MWC emissions should be regulated and, if so, under what section of the Act. As set forth in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking (52 FR 25399, July 7, 1987), the EPA decided to regulate air emissions from MWC's under section 111 of the Act as it existed prior to the 1990 Amendments. Section 111 of the Act required that the regulations be based on best demonstrated technology (BDT). On December 20, 1989, the EPA proposed new source performance standards (NSPS) for new MWC's and emission guidelines for existing MWC's (54 FR 52251 and 54 FR 52209, respectively). On November 15, 1990, the Act Amendments of 1990 were enacted and added section 129 to the Act. Section 129 of the Act specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines must be developed for MWC's in accordance with the requirements of sections 111 and 129. Section 129 further specifies that revised NSPS and emission guidelines be developed for both large and small MWC's and that the NSPS and emission guidelines must reflect certain standards of performance. Section 129 includes a schedule for revising the 1991 emission guidelines. When the EPA did not comply with that schedule, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a complaint with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The resulting consent decree requires the EPA Administrator to sign a notice of proposed rulemaking not later than September 1, 1994 and a notice of promulgation not later than September 1, 1995 (Nos. CV&hyph;92&hyph;2093 and CV&hyph;93&hyph;0284). The NSPS and guidelines promulgated on February 11, 1991 (56 FR 5488 and 56 FR 5514, respectively) apply to MWC's with unit capacities above 225 Mg/day and reflect BDT as determined by the Administrator at the time those guidelines were issued. Today's notice therefore proposes to create new emission guidelines to be fully consistent with sections 111 and 129 of the Act and to extend coverage of the guidelines to existing MWC units located at MWC facilities with aggregate plant capacity above 35 Mg/day. In a separate notice in today's Federal Register , the EPA is proposing to withdraw the subpart Ca emission guidelines that were promulgated on February 11, 1991. Under a separate regulatory action in today's Federal Register , a new subpart Eb NSPS for new MWC plants with aggregate capacities above 35 Mg/day of MSW that are constructed after September 20, 1994 is being proposed pursuant to sections 111(b) and 129 of the Act. Even though a new subpart Eb NSPS is being proposed, the February 11, 1991 subpart Ea NSPS will remain in effect. Municipal waste combustors constructed, modified, or reconstructed after December 20, 1989 but on or before September 20, 1994 would be subject to both subpart Ea (NSPS) requirements and today's proposed subpart Cb (guideline) requirements. In most cases, the control technologies being used to meet the 1991 subpart Ea NSPS emission limits would be able to comply with the proposed subpart Cb guidelines, except that additional controls would be required to reduce Hg emissions, dioxin/furan emissions, and fugitive fly ash/bottom ash emissions.
