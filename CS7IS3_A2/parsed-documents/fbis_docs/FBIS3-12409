The command stressed that this agreement must be foiled and that the political process must be rebuilt based on the resolutions of international legitimacy that deal with the Palestinian cause in order to reach a solution that secures the Palestinian Arab people's national rights to repatriation and self-determination and their right to establishing an independent state. In a statement issued following its extraordinary session today, the command called for a halt to the current negotiations within the framework of the Oslo agreement until the Security Council resolutions that call for an end to settlement building, which they consider illegitimate, are implemented; until the Fourth Geneva Convention is applied in the occupied territories, including Jerusalem; and until protection for the Palestinian Arab people is secured. The command demanded that the Security Council adopt clear resolutions and a suitable mechanism to implement its resolutions on settlement building. In another development, the DFLP called on Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid to directly intervene with the U.S. Administration, Russia, and Europe in order to take tangible steps in response to the bloody massacres against the Palestinian Arab people, especially the crime at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque--steps that similar to those taken in Bosnia. In a message today, the DFLP called on Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid to adopt appropriate resolutions, especially in terms of tightening the economic boycott of Israel to its maximum levels until a comprehensive settlement of the Palestinian cause and the Arab-Israeli conflict is reached. Such a settlement should be based on the principle of full withdrawal for full peace, on providing international protection for Palestinian people under the occupation by deploying international forces under UN supervision, an on rebuilding the bases of the negotiating process on the Palestinian-Israeli track in accordance with the bases of the Arab-Israeli negotiations between Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon on one hand and Israel on the other.
