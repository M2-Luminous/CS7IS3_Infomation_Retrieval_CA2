According to the communique, any territorial claim of the neighboring countries of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia was condemned and border disputes had to be settled without recourse to violence. The communique said that the Serbs should immediately withdraw from areas occupied by force and to allow the return of all refugees dispersed in Croatia and other countries to their homes, as well as in other areas in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Talking to reporters before his departure, Valentic said that his government believed that there was a good chance that Serbs would also attack Macedonia, Kosovo and Sanjak in view of their aggressive policies. He said that international organizations and UN Security Council should implement their resolutions issued concerning Bosnia and not to allow Serbs to continue their aggressions. Iran's First Vice-President Hasan Habibi said that the three countries agreed on almost all issues concerning a trilateral cooperation among the three countries. Habibi said that the negotiations resulted in setting up a joint commission between Iran, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to expand economic cooperation and to provide access to open seas for Bosnia through Croatia. According to Iranian official news agency IRNA, three protocols were signed by Valentic and Iranian officials on transportation, cultural, social, commercial and technical cooperation.
