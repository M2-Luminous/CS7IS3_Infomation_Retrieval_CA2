Zhu Yucheng said: "I mentioned three points to the gentlemen from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong yesterday: First, Xi Yang stole state secrets and violated China's state security laws. It is completely within the scope of China's sovereignty that judicial authorities try him in accordance with laws of criminal procedure. Second, the Xi Yang case involves state secrets, so no public trial was conducted in accordance with laws of criminal procedure. This is a characteristic not only of China's law, but also of the laws of various countries around the world. Therefore, it was legal to conduct a trial in camera. Third, Xi Yang's violation of laws was a personal act. The fact that he stole state secrets is incompatible with his status as a reporter. This is unrelated to freedom of the press or to normal news coverage by Hong Kong reporters on the mainland at all." Zhu Yucheng also said that no unit or individual or government department is allowed to interfere in China's judicial independence. Zhu Yucheng made the above remarks when attending the 1994 Spring soiree held by the Association of Hong Kong Chinese Entrepreneurs at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center in Wanchai last night.
