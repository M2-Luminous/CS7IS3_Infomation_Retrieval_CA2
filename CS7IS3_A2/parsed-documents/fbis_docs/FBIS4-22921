In particular, a method of determining the concentration of methyl ether of chloracetic acid--a colorless volatile flammable liquid with an irritating smell which is easily soluble in ethanol and ether--in the atmospheric air against the background of associated biologically active substances is developed. The detection method is based on using gas-liquid chromatography with a flame ionization detector whereby samples are taken with activated BAU carbon for subsequent thermal destruction and conversion to methyl chloride. The sampling and sample analysis procedures are outlined, and a chromatogram of the harmful substance separation in the air is plotted. The procedure has a detection threshold of 0.001 ï¿½g per 2 ml and and a lower measurement limit of 0.0015 mg/m[.sup]3[/] (in a 20 l sample). The measured concentration range is 0.0015-0.2 mg/m[.sup]3[/] with a measurement error of +/-17.5%. The procedure has been tested at industry enterprises and approved by the USSR Public Health Ministry. Figures 2.
