Azerbaijani Deputy Prime Minister Abbas Abbasov, who is conducting contacts in Ankara, called on Erbakan today. In a statement during the meeting, Erbakan said he does not approve of the Bishkek agreement and the arrival of Russian troops and UN forces in the region. Erbakan claimed that the United Nations is anti-Islam, as demonstrated recently in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Cyprus. If a peace force is established in Azerbaijan against the Armenians, Erbakan noted, this force must be comprised of Muslim countries; otherwise, Azerbaijan will be subjected to double standards. [Begin Erbakan recording] We believe Turkey is the key to the prevention of all these unjust attacks. Turkey is a country with a population of 60 million. It is the most important country for the protection of peace in the Caucasus, in the Balkans, and in the Middle East. Therefore, Turkey must begin to pursue an independent policy that can protect the peace. [end recording] Abbasov, in his statement, said the support accorded to Azerbaijan gives him great hope.
