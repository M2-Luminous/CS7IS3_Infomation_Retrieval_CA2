It described as "groundless" reports that it had approved the consumption of hashish. The Court explained that it had declared the ban on drugs and all drug-related offenses to be in keeping with the constitution. However, lenient sentences may be applied to minor offenses. The Court further explained: "Law-enforcement bodies must in principle discontinue with prosecution if hashish is only consumed in small quantities for private consumption, and without danger to third parties." The Court considers terms such as "free of punishment" or "approval" to be wrong, because in a legal sense, the consumption of hashish and marijuana remains punishable. The Court has merely forbidden the prosecution of petty consumers of hashish in certain circumstances; therefore, in ordinary language, such persons remain free of punishment.
