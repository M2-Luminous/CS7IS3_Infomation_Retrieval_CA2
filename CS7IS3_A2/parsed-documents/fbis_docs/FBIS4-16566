Speaking in the wake of the Union's fourth emergency congress, Kuchma referred to the nationalistic forces of the country's western provinces and the Communists and Socialists. He said Ukraine was following in the footsteps of Russia. Now that forty-odd legislators had joined his Inter-regional Reform Bloc, Kuchma was confident the bloc would emerge as the centrist faction in the new parliament. The centrist-oriented forces in parliament must stop what Kuchma described as a tug-of-war game between the Communists and nationalistically-minded radicals, and insure the formation of a new Cabinet on a professional, and not political, basis. Even parliament must be denied the right to amend key economic legislation, or, said Kuchma, Ukraine's international image will be damaged beyond repair. Pending new presidential elections the lawmakers should help President Kravchuk safeguard civic peace. The Crimea had been and must be part of Ukraine. In the meantime, Kuchma said, Kiev was losing to Simferopol both politics- and economy-wise. But, he said, the Crimea would remain Ukrainian if the reforms and economy started working. The policy of Ukrainization was as erroneous as that of Russification because, Kuchma said, one action always brings a reaction. Unfortunately, Kuchma said, political consideratins always prevailed over economics, which provoked social cataclysms, in Ukraine. According to INTERFAX-Ukraine, the top executives of a number of Ukrainian banks and industrial facilities are holding a working conference in Kiev on 15 April.
