As soon as Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu returns from his consultations with U.S. and Japanese officials Monday evening, the core policy-makers on diplomatic and inter-Korean dialogue will huddle and chart a future course in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue. The question they face is one nobody dared ask before -- should Seoul withdraw its demand for inter-Korean dialogue and let Pyongyang and Washington talk by themselves? Now is the time if Seoul wants to renovate its North Korea policy. Seoul and Washington, impatient on the brink of the mid-May deadline when the U.N. Security Council may decide to impose sanctions on Pyongyang, are more than eager to bring Pyongyang back to the negotiating table. North Korea has hinted at a willingness to negotiate with the United States over IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] inspections but still refuses to engage in inter-Korean dialogue. Ironically, North Korean officials' blatant reference to war last month, threatening to turn the South Korean capital into a "sea of fire," provided Seoul with an excuse to pull back on its inter-Korean dialogue demand. The mood on the Korean peninsula could not be chillier after the war threat, and this may well give Seoul officials a reason to once and for all suspend talks with their Pyongyang counterparts. As things now stand, Seoul insists on exchanging inter-Korean special envoys before Washington holds the next round of high-level dialogue with Pyongyang. "We felt that we better elevate inter-Korean dialogue to a certain level while we had a chance. We believed that was the way, the only way to ensure that inter-Korean relations would progress in parallel with North Korea-U.S. ties," said a Foreign Ministry official, looking back to when Seoul decided to attach this precondition. But North Korea's insistence on negotiating only with the United States and keeping South Korea out of the picture has frustrated Seoul's hopes. Criticism from the liberal wing holds that Seoul's obstinacy on inter-Korean dialogue has only blocked successful negotiations on the nuclear problem. Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong openly suggested Sunday that the government snip any connection between inter-Korean dialogue and nuclear negotiations, a remark widely interpreted as a trial balloon. But to do as Hong suggested requires much more than the courage to take a chance: It means giving up having a say in North Korean-U.S. talks, watching their relations progress more meaningfully and quickly than inter-Korean ties. But more fearful than this for the government is public opinion. No matter what the reason, the government will be accused of caving in to North Korean tactics and letting itself be excluded from the whole negotiating process. This would constitute nothing short of swallowing its own words repeated for years that "the road to the United States goes through Seoul." Foregoing the demand for inter-Korean talks in itself could motivate North Korea to come to the negotiating table, but the price for Seoul is not small.
