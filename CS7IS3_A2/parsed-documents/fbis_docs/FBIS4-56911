He also made reference to military personnel's participation in private enterprises and said it is a very sensitive topic that the Honduran Congress will have to debate. Those issues were brought up at news conference by President Reina with international media representatives attending the inaugural ceremony of the new Costa Rican president. Reina said civilian society had maintained a fearful attitude in the past and that this had allowed the military sector to obtain too much power over society. As an example, he mentioned that, according to the Constitution, the National Congress has to establish the amount of troops the armed institution can have. However, this has never been done. He pointed out that one of the most negative measures implemented by the Armed Forces was troop recruitment, since it forced only poor people to serve in the institution and excluded the rich ones. A positive change, said Reina, is that this system has been abolished and that Congress has already approved a new method in its first debate. The Armed Forces have also accepted the new system. Military Firms The Honduran president pointed out that Congress will have to decide whether military personnel can use their retirement funds to invest in commercial activities. He believes they have a right to do so. However, the problem is that they could use their military influence to attain unfair competition vis-a-vis the rest of the merchants. The National Congress will discuss the issue and reach a final decision on it, Reina asserted. President Reina emphasized that he has never wanted the Honduran Armed Forces to be abolished, because he does not believe it is in the country's best interest to do so. The Honduran Armed Forces, he stated, have asserted that the Costa Rican Army is bigger and has a bigger budget, but this is something that would have to be studied. [sentence as published] Reina said he did not want to argue over this assessment and reiterated that it is what the Honduran Armed Forces officers maintain. The important thing now, he added, is to go from an absurd and inhuman concept, such as the one on national security, to the concept of guaranteeing individual security, which we will establish because we require a force to ensure this. If a law does not have a coercive mechanism, it stops being the law, he said. In Reina's opinion, the phase during which an abusive army took command of the country has been totally transcended. He said all the human rights violations in the country occurred when military officers governed the country. He said he was one of the Central American citizens who had strongly opposed those governments and had even condemned governments formed by his own party because he was determined to defend human rights. Armed Forces Commander Reina was asked about the Armed Forces commander and his relations with General Luis Alonso Discua, the current Honduran Armed Forces commander. The president said he maintained good, cordial relations with Discua. The Honduran president said, however, that in his opinion a mistake had been made in the 1957 Constitution in the section that establishes the Armed Forces commander's appointment, which also gives him too much autonomy in his actions. He added that the then Constituent Assembly president had explained that such provisions had been included in the Constitution because, without them, they could not democratize the country. Reina believes the figure of the Armed Forces commander, as well as his autonomy should, perhaps, be reviewed. He emphasized that his relations with Gen. Discua are very good and that he has no complaints or reasons for distrust. The military commander has reiterated this since he accepted subordination to the president of the Republic. President Reina mentioned that Gen. Discua's term ends next year and his replacement will be selected from a list sent by the Armed Forces to the National Congress. He added that, if several constitutional amendments are made, the military commander would be the defense minister and would be appointed by the president of the Republic. Anyway, he added, Honduras is in a straightforward process to achieve its full democratization and the reassessment of its priorities, which is currently the basic position in America and the world.
