Abiola, Nigeria's main opposition leader, had been threatened with arrest on charges of treason if he went ahead with a plan to set up a "government of national unity" Sunday, anniversary of the June 12, 1993 election that he was widely seen as having won by a large majority. [passage omitted] There were few signs of tension, however, in downtown Lagos, 48 hours before the start of a week of civil disobedience called for by Campaign for Democracy militants in the opposition. Last year's poll was declared free and fair by international observers but annulled by then junta leader General Ibrahim Babangida, who alleged irregularities. Babangida was succeeded by an interim civilian administration, which gave way to General Sani Abacha who seized power last November. Abacha meanwhile is to make a national address on radio early Sunday, his office said in Abuja. [passage omitted] According to Abacha's office, the general was to give a broadcast address to the nation Sunday on the situation. On Friday, head of police Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie said the security forces were ready to confront any eventuality. Nigeria's Anglican archbishop, Abiodun Adetiloye, who fronted moves to persuade Abiola to delay naming a government for a few days, called on the present leadership and the opposition to engage in dialogue to resolve the crisis. In a message to General Abacha, the fourth in recent weeks, the archbishop called on the military leader to choose to adopt an honourable transition of power to the "democratically elected" government of Abiola and avoid a tragedy similar to the one in Rwanda. On Friday, Nigerian television broadcast powerful pictures of the Rwandan civil war and called on Nigerians to "help the government preserve peace." [passage omitted] Archbishop Aditiloye, who heads a church which has 10 million followers in Nigeria, said prayers would be said Sunday for the "peaceful restoration" of democracy. The country's two most influential dailies, the DAILY TIMES and THE GUARDIAN, both appealed to the government in editorials to hold a dialogue with the opposition and also condemned the arrest of leading public figures by the police, including chief and former minister Anthony Enahoro, 71, one of the father's of Nigerian independence.
