He was summoned to a meeting on the day of his arrival in Beijing, and was criticized for not reporting Xu Jiatun's three "unauthorized trips to Hong Kong" which he had known. It was said that the criticism was based on Zhou Nan's report to responsible persons at the center, and that Zhou Nan had learned the three trips to Hong Kong only from Hong Kong's newspaper reports and had been "greatly astonished." She Mengxiao had been notified that he would be transferred back to Beijing immediately and be assigned another job. Actually She Mengxiao had told Zhou Nan about my three trips to Hong Kong before there had been reports in publications. And the Taiwan Affairs Office at the center had also sent a telegram beforehand, which Zhou Nan had seen. She Mengxiao's reaction was: "Incomprehensible, unacceptable." Those who were talking to him were unable to do anything about such a situation, and said that decision would be made after reporting to the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee. The next day they talked to She Mengxiao again, saying: "The responsible persons of the center have decided that the decision on the transfer back to the hinterland be not changed." However they changed their tone, saying: "A normal transfer. Not related to Zhou Nan's report." She Mengxiao continued to argue that such would be even more incomprehensible, and that if a normal transfer was involved, then his term had not expired according to regulations on personnel stationed abroad for he had been on the job for only a little over a year. Those who were talking to him then brandished the big "organization" flag, criticizing She Mengxiao for having a bad attitude. Under the high pressure, She Mengxiao could not but comply. She Mengxiao had previously been deputy secretary general of the Central Political-Legal Steering Group and the Central Political-Legal Commission of which Qiao Shi had been head and secretary respectively. Many of Qiao Shi's speeches had been drafted by She Mengxiao, who had been a talented "scholar." He was wrongly accused in such a manner just a little over a year after he came to Hong Kong. This case caused widespread indignation among some senior cadres in Beijing, who believed that it was just intolerable that some people at the center had gone so far in disregarding the party's spirit of seeking truth from facts and organizational principles and in turning matters of right and wrong upside down. Feeling that She Mengxiao had been treated unfairly, some people went to see Qiao Shi. Qiao Shi said that he sympathized with She Mengxiao but could get no audience when arguing She's case in the Standing Committee, and that there was no way of protecting She. I felt very sad upon hearing the story. Then Song Ping [1345 1627] "talked" to me. After a few words of greeting at the beginning of the meeting, he officially notified me: "The Standing Committee has decided that you come back to live in Beijing." In this way it was finally made clear that I was not permitted to stay in Shenzhen. I already knew that Zhou Nan had asked a responsible person of the center not to allow me to live in Shenzhen, arguing that his work would be affected. Therefore I had already been psychologically prepared. I said calmly: "I understand the Standing Committee's decision. I don't want to come to Beijing. It is better to let me go back to Nanjing." Song Ping first said that he personally agreed to the suggestion, but that it was necessary to seek the Standing Committee's approval. Then he indicated that he would immediately tell Jiangsu to prepare housing for me, and he also said: "The CPC provincial committee will welcome you back." Then Song Ping changed the subject, and said, showing his "concern" for me: "I would like to make some personal, critical observations of you." It was normal for the head of the Organization Department to show concern for cadres and to criticize cadres. I nodded and listened attentively. Song Ping said: "Some people have criticized that article on renewing our understanding of capitalism. Might it not be advisable that you reconsider the article?" He also asked: "Was it Ren Zhongyi [0117 0112 1138] who put forward the idea of renewing our understanding of socialism?" I was surprised to see that they had been so annoyed by Ren Zhongyi also. I made no reply to the question. I expressed my appreciation of his good intention in warning me, and replied: "Thank you for you concern. To this day I still believe that while the language in a few places perhaps should be reconsidered, the article as a whole is not wrong." I also said: "I have already heard that a member of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee has specially assigned people to write criticizing articles. I am already prepared to be publicly criticized." Song Ping hurriedly explained: "Such is not true." In passing I also mentioned the case of Zhou Nan's distorting the facts to make false accusations against She Mengxiao and of the Organization Department's transferring back She Mengxiao anyway in a failure to uphold justice, and expressed my opinion, indicating my resentment. Song Ping listened in a gracious manner, and made no explanation at all. This talk made both of us unhappy. It was only later that I realized that Zhou Nan's transferring back She Mengxiao through creating an excuse had been for the purpose of removing an obstacle to "preparing" material on me. Some of my friends asked about the contents of my "talk" with Song Ping. After learning the contents, they earnestly warned: "Be careful. Their eyes are watching you!" Those several friends were rather informed of the "situation at the top." I figured that if even a man who had already decided to retire would not be tolerated, then I would not live in Beijing after going back to Jiangsu but rather be a hermit in my native place Rugao County, and that as I would not be involved in any "worldly affairs," you must then be willing to leave me alone. I still entertained this naive illusion. I cancelled the plan to visit Jiuzaigou, Sichuan, after the NPC session, and immediately went to Nanjing. After getting approval from the CPC Jiangsu Provincial Committee, I immediately went back to Shenzhen in order to get prepared to move back to my native place. After Zhou Nan took over in early February, one "strange thing" after another happened. The more I thought about them, the more they appeared to me to be related to "the eyes watching you." [28 Sep 93 p 2] [Text] Thee Situation Was Unusual (Part Two of Four) -- Zhou Nan Submitted "Material" On Me, Resulting in My Fear of Becoming a Second "Liang Xiang" [2733 3276]. In February Zhou Nan stopped paying my salaries and my wife's salaries in Hong Kong. My wife was very angry but I just responded with a smile. According to normal practices, salaries would be paid by the receiving unit only after the organizational introduction letter reached the receiving unit. I would not leave office until mid-February, and the CPC Hong Kong and Macao Work Committee had not yet written my organizational relation introduction letter to the receiving unit. And the letter could not be written then because the center had not made clear where I would live after being transferred back to the hinterland. It was laughable that Zhou Nan was in such a hurry to drive me out of Hong Kong. Before Zhou Nan assumed his office, I had already moved out of the Hong Kong Branch of the Xinhua News Agency Building, and my personal belongings had also been shipped to Beilingju (the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY'S base in Shenzhen), Shenzhen. Among the belongings were dozens of cases of books, journals, and documents (mainly copies of the texts of my speeches at some meetings, of which the general office kept the originals or transcripts on file). But, while I was attending meetings in Beijing, Zhou Nan had the general office order my secretary "to sort out" the documents, and had my documents taken away, including the drafts of my statements made at the "heart-to-heart talk" meetings in Beijing and the transcripts of their statements at the meetings. The secretary resignedly told me on the phone: that Zhou Nan had insisted that these had all been "state secrets" documents and must be take away to be "placed on file." As they were now in power and as I was then in Beijing, I could not but tell the secretary to let them take the documents. I intended to reason with them once I was back in Shenzhen. In early March many colleagues in the branch told me that toward the end of February Zhou Nan had set up a task force headed by Xu, director of the general office, "to prepare" material on me. Zheng Hua was in overall charge of the task force, which had already begun "investigations" into my "personal, financial, and material" situation in Hong Kong. At first I did not believe the rumor, but later, after many of those investigated told me about the investigations directly or indirectly, I realized that all this was true. According to the rules made by the CPC Central Committee, "investigations" on the number one men of the provincial and ministerial level could proceed only with the approval given collectively by the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee or by the general secretary. Obviously Zhou Nan had received from the top leadership in Beijing instructions on or approval for taking this unusual action shortly after taking office. Although I had a clear conscience, I still sensed: that I probably would not be allowed to have a "safe landing." On 22 April I returned to Shenzhen. In the early hours of the next morning, the director of the Shenzhen Office of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY came to Beilingju. With a look on his face saying that he was powerless regarding the matter, he told me that the general office had transmitted Zhou Nan's "instruction" to have the car used by the "director" taken back to Hong Kong in the afternoon. I said, giving a forced smile: "It is all right if the car needs to be taken back." I gave a special dinner to say farewell to the driver Master Xu, thanking him for his service over the several years. I realized only afterwards that the car had a license plate allowing it to go to Hong Kong and Macao and come back freely. Zhou Nan was preventing me from passing Man Kam To (the checkpoint for automobiles going between Hong Kong and Shenzhen) so as to prevent me from going to Hong Kong "privately" again. On the 24th I was informed by a reliable source that Zhou Nan had written an official report on my "problems" based on the "material" on me and submitted the report to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Zhou Nan's "decisiveness" and "high efficiency" in accomplishing this task and the various signs detected over the several months suddenly woke me up and shattered the illusion about a "safe landing," waking me up from my dream of living in my native place. Becoming a "second Liang Xiang" or even meeting a worse fate than Liang Xiang was no longer impossible, but would become the reality facing me! How to handle the situation? I went into very complicated and painful thinking. In the name of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, Li Peng used the excuse of studying the development of Yangpu Port of Hainan to have Liang Xiang, governor of Hainan, and Xu Shijie [6079 1102 2638], secretary of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee, fly to Beijing on a special plane. Immediately after getting off the plane, Liang Xiang was put under house arrest, thereby losing his freedom. It was only then that Li Peng sent a task force headed by Supervision Minister Wei Jianxing [1414 0256 5887] to conduct investigations in Hainan Province. Three months later the results of the investigations showed that Liang Xiang had not been the main initiator and leader in the so-called "anticenter" incident in which a telegram in the name of the CPC Hainan Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government of Hainan had been sent to the CPC Central Committee and the State Council to show support for Zhao Ziyang's policy on handling the student movement, and that the accusations about Liang Xiang's "economic problems" brought by some people to the center were also flimsy. As he had been unable to find the "criminal evidence" needed by Li Peng, this minister complained privately to some responsible persons of Hainan Province, before returning to Beijing to report on his work: "The result would not be acceptable to my superior." There was then a rumor in Beijing: that in view of Liang Xiang's achievements in implementing the reform and opening policy and developing the special economic zones, Deng Xiaoping had instructed Jiang Zemin and Li Peng "to do everything possible to spare" Liang Xiang. But in the end Jiang and Li still relieved Liang Xiang from all his duties inside and outside the party on the basis of the unwarranted charge of "using office for personal gains." And they would not let the matter drop, but continued to have a task force conduct investigations in Hainan and Shenzhen. As those knowledgeable people told me, in the "investigations" even the "chickens produce eggs and eggs produce chickens" method for settling accounts with landlords which had been considered wrong even during the land reform was used in an attempt to uncover Liang Xiang's so-called "problems" over the years. It was completely an act of using office for personal gains to use such a method, based on the total disregarding of facts as well as the party's discipline and the state's laws, for treating a senior cadre of the party and state who had joined the revolution for many years and who had worked diligently and made achievements! It was unfortunate that the erroneous practice of ruthless struggle and mutual persecution in the party reemerged after the June 4th Incident, making me feel greatly pained. (147) [29 Sep 93 p 1] [Text] Chapter 16. Events Shortly Before and After I Left My Country IV. The Situation Was Unusual (Part Three of Four) Xu Jiatun reveals how he left his country secretly: I kept the secret from my wife. When passing the checkpoint at Lo Wu Bridge in the course of leaving Shenzhen, I was recognized by a guard. An old friend used his "sedan" to help me, picking me up halfway so as to avoid my getting off at Kowloon. It was only after thinking over the matter again and again for a whole day on the 25th that I made up my mind: in order to ensure my right to defend myself and to make it possible for me to use my remaining energy in my later years to do some work for society, I would "put up with light punishment but leave in the face of severe punishment"; I would let everything I had now be lost for the time being. I decided "to leave my country" and to wait for the opportunity to return. I did not lose hope about my country and nation, neither was I totally disappointed in the Communist Party of China. I was just forced by the situation to make this "bad move." On the afternoon of the 25th I telephoned a friend whom I had known for many years and whom I could trust, asking him to come to Shenzhen for farewell-saying purposes on the ground that, "I would leave Shenzhen for Nanjing right away." On the 26th he crossed Lo Wu Bridge and came to see me early in the morning. He listened sympathetically to my decision, and expressed his willingness to help me "leave my country." On the morning of the same day he returned to Hong Kong and applied for a tourist visa on my behalf to the U.S. Consulate-General in Hong Kong. I requested that efforts be made to enable me to leave on the 28th. After applying to the U.S. Consulate-General, the friend telephoned me, saying: "The thing cannot be bought on the 28th and has to be bought on the 30th." I was worried that the delay could result in my plan being detected by the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, thereby making me unable to leave. That old friend also telephoned Master Hsingyun of the Hsilai Monastery in Los Angeles for my sake (Hsingyun was then in Hawaii), telling him that at his invitation Xu would come to the United States shortly. Hsingyun readily expressed his warm welcome and indicated that he would ask Lu K'eng to meet me at the San Francisco airport. Hsingyun expressed his understanding of my request that "there be no contacts with anybody" and that "the stay be purely for the purpose of having a rest," replying: "Mr. Xu will not be forced to do anything he does not want to do." On the phone that old friend told me only: "The matters involving friends have all been settled. The details will be related on the 30th." After Zhou Nan came to Hong Kong, my wife Gu Yiping immediately left Hong Kong and lived in Shenzhen afterwards. She had been busy packing for several days, and had decided to go to Nanjing by train on the 30th together with the luggage. In order to avoid any unforeseen problems caused by emotional factors and to try to prevent her from being implicated later, I had kept the "secret" from her throughout the process of making this momentous decision. As my bodyguard had some personal matters to deal with at home, I also took the opportunity to ask him to go to Nanjing ahead of me. Having made appropriate arrangements on everything, I decided to leave Shenzhen for Hong Kong on the 30th and "to leave my country" for the United States on 1 May. My old friend had already purchased the plane ticket to Los Angeles. On the evening of the 29th I said "farewell" to my wife and my daughters in Shenzhen. They did not detect in any way my emotional agonizing at the imminent departure. I said to them: "In the future you should live well by yourselves!" They still failed to detect any implied message. I was sleepless for another night. At about 1900 on the afternoon of the 30th, my wife embarked on her train journey to Nanjing as previously planned. I lied to her, saying: that I would take a civil aviation plane to Nanjing in two days. Recalling this episode would make me feel very guilty! Two hours later I left Shenzhen, crossed the border at Lo Wu Bridge, and boarded the train from Lo Wu to Kowloon. In the past I would always be accompanied by people when crossing the border. As I would have to pass the Customs all by myself, I was worried for a time that there would be suspicions. As expected I was recognized by a border guard when passing the checkpoint. He even said: "Director, are you going Home? You look even younger than on television!" I nodded to greet him smilingly, and successfully passed the checkpoint. My old friend used his "sedan" to pick me up at Sheung Shui (the first stop for the train from Lo Wu to Kowloon). For if I should get off at Kowloon, I might be detected by people. Therefore I specially asked my old friend to personally drive a car to pick me up halfway. Some friends in Hong Kong also got into trouble for being suspected by the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to have helped me leave my country. After learning that I would publish my Hong Kong memoirs, that old friend asked me many times about how my departure would be written, requesting that I not mention his name. I replied that I would never requite kindness with ingratitude, asking him to set his mind at ease. Only when a "clean" political situation should emerge in China would I reveal his name. My old friend laughed heartily and said: "Very good. I hope you will then connect my small name to your `leaving the country' so that I, an ordinary person, may have a place in history." I also laughed and replied: I will obey your command and this mystery will have to be solved later. (The last segment will be seen tomorrow.) (148) [30 Sep 93 p 1] [Text] IV. The Situation Was Unusual (Part Four of Four) Xu Jiatun would not have been able to escape if his move had been delayed for two hours! Correct judgment and thrilling departure. That night, at my old friend's home I wrote a letter to Deng Xiaoping, Yang Shangkun, and the CPC Central Committee. In the letter I stated: This time I have been forced "to leave my country" because of a storm in Beijing. But the stay will be temporary and I will return. I will declare publicly that I am "taking a rest by making a tourist trip." Although I "left my country," I still believed in Marxism and in the Communist Party of China, and still respected Deng Xiaoping. I just did not trust some members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee. I related the incidents in which Li Peng, Zhou Nan, and others had tried to conduct "post-autumn-harvest account settling," saying that I had made this painful choice because I would not want to be a "second Liang Xiang." I also made four promises: no attempt to seek political asylum; no disclosing of state secrets; no openly published articles and no public speeches; and no contacts with the democracy movement elements. Finally I asked some members of the Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee not to persecute my family so as not to force me to make further choices that I did not want to make after "leaving my country." As I was unable to have the letter copied, I made three handwritten copies. One was sent to the Hong Kong Branch of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY to be transferred to Beijing; one was sent to the General Office of the CPC Central Committee in Beijing; and one was sent to a friend who was in touch with a top leader in Beijing and who was asked to deliver the letter to Beijing. A few days after arriving in the United States, there was a report from a source in Hong Kong: that after I had left Shenzhen for Hong Kong, at around 2030 on the afternoon of 30 April Qin Wenjun, deputy secretary of the CPC Shenzhen Municipal Committee, had come, under instructions, to the place where I had been staying in Shenzhen to relay the telegram order sent by the CPC Central Committee which had asked me to go to Beijing immediately. Qin had arrived at my place of lodging two hours after my departure. Seeing that I had left, he had waited until very late into the night and than begun making inquiry phone calls to every place hurriedly. This episode had proved that my earlier judgment had been correct. At 9:25 [AM or PM not specified] U.S. western time on 1 May, the plane arrived at the San Francisco airport on time. Lu K'eng and Ts'ui Jung-chih were already waiting at the airport. Lu K'eng then immediately flew with me to Los Angeles. In this way I became Master Hsingyun's guest. Their warm and attentive reception made me feel grateful. After arriving in Los Angeles I immediately contacted Ma Yuzhen, Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, and met with him in the Hsilai Monastery soon afterward. I told him face to face my reason for "leaving my country," and repeated the four promises. Ma Yuzhen had already been instructed to persuade me to return home, and promised that there would be no "trouble" after my return to China. I thanked him for his good intention. Not long afterward Zhu Qizhen, Chinese ambassador to the United States, was also instructed to meet with me in Los Angeles. He made further efforts to persuade me to return home, promising that there would be no "trouble" after my return to China. Could I believe the promise that there would be no trouble after my return to China? In reply I told Zhu Qizhen that I would not be going back for the time being but would keep the four promises, asking him to tell Beijing to set its mind at ease. I also indicated my attitude toward Beijing's "promise": "With Li Peng in power, who can ensure that promises are kept? Even if Li Peng would not make any trouble, who will be able to ensure the keeping of the promises when some people should proceed to make troubles?" During this period, on three occasions I took the initiative in having meetings with the consul general and the vice consul general in Los Angeles. Zhu Qizhen had been instructed to meet with me, and I did not take the initiative in this instance. During Yang Shangkun's visit to four Central and South American countries, Zhu Qizhen transmitted the messages contained in the phone call made by Yang Shangkun from Mexico, which expressed the hope that I would go back to China together with Yang Shangkun on the same plane at the end of his trip. There was also the promise that "I would be treated well." I thanked him for his kindness, and indicated that I had no confidence in the promise about the way I would be treated after going back to China. In late February 1991 I asked Consul General Ma Yuzhen for a meeting (I already knew by then that Jiang Zemin and Li Peng would take further "actions" on my leaving the country), and at the meeting I asked Ma to transmit my message: "Whatever they say and do, I have the right to publicly defend myself, and history will reach a correct conclusion." Ma Yuzhen might not have known then the situation, and asked me if I had heard something. He said: "This may not necessarily be true." As expected, making use of the power in their hands, Jiang Zemin and Li Peng destroyed my way home. On 19 February the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Guangdong Province dismissed me from my post as a deputy to the NPC; the Xinhua News Agency's news on 2-3 March also contained the announcements that I had been dismissed from my post as a member of the NPC Standing Committee, that I had been expelled from the Communist Party of China, and that I had been dismissed from my post as a member of the CPC Central Advisory Commission. I had already expected that this would happen, and was psychologically prepared. Friends would say that I had been unfairly treated, and suggested that they would raise the issue. After thinking over the matter again and again, I decided to write, firstly, "A Preliminary Analysis of Peaceful Evolution," and, then, my memoirs. History, I believe, will use facts to show that it is true that some people have betrayed the people and Marxism, but that I have not done so. Even if I will not be able to see the beauty of China, the mother who has experienced all kinds of tribulations--the motherland--will let the soul of a son who has shared her worries and happiness return.
