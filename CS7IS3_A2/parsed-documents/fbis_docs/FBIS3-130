Five MK commanders have capitalised on their training in Angola and the former Soviet Union to go into business. The MK officers -- together with legal, commercial and human resource specialists -- founded Alexandra Business Holdings several months ago with the aim of employing MK returnees. They went into partnership with the established Security Operations Group and obtained the backing of ANC [African National Congress] deputy secretary general Jacob Zuma. This week, the group launched its first security firm and negotiations for the formation of another four companies are under way. The guards, armed with revolvers and shotguns, will soon start protecting trucks in Alexandra and industries on the outskirts of the township. The firm has already signed to protect trucks belonging to soft drink giant Amalgamated Beverages Industries. Alexandra Business Holdings chairman Sam Buthelezi said the company planned to use an "empowerment strategy" to contribute towards more stable and harmonious communities. Director Mandla Maseko is still MK chief of staff in Alexandra and was trained in Angola and the Ukraine before doing time on Robben Island. "Guerrilla training is an advantage in this type of work, but extra security training is necessary," he said.
