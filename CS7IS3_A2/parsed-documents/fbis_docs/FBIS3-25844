"Actually, China is the most democratic country in the world," jokes Sichuan's Governor Xiao Yang, an ebullient, grand-fatherly figure of 62 who took office last February and has made a name for himself as one of China's most reform-minded leaders. When the expressway between Chongqing and Chengdu opened, for example, Mr Xiao had fences put up to prevent pigs and dogs from trying to skip through the traffic. Two days after the fences went up, peasants dismantled them. "They thought it was inconvenient." When stock prices drop or people have a gripe about a corrupt local official, they write to the Governor, who personally responds to the most important of the 300 written petitions he receives from ordinary folk each month. Such are the everyday problems Mr Xiao faces. Far more pressing, for his own political as well as his people's future, is the threat of peasant riots; controlling the birth rate of a province which, at 110 million people, is the most populous in China; preventing inflation from going out of control; and above all, transforming Sichuan from relative poverty to something approaching the prosperity of the coastal areas. After more than a decade of the central government pampering the coastal areas with economic reform prerogatives, it finally looks as if hinterland provinces such as Sichuan will be getting a bigger share of the pie. Last year, the central government invested 30 billion yuan (about HK$27 billion [Hong Kong dollars]) in Sichuan. This year, the figure will probably reach 40 billion. A big portion of the money will go into infrastructure. Foreign investment in Sichuan last year soared to U.S.$2.6 billion (HK$20.2 billion), double the amount of the previous year. The bulk of this investment has been small-scale, low-technology ventures, but the province is now trying to attract big infrastructure projects. Mr Xiao said Sichuan hoped to sign an agreement with AT&T this year to set up a telephone switching joint venture which would produce about one million telephone lines per year. And the province has started up an electricity generating equipment plant with General Electric of Canada. In urban areas, a big problem this year will be controlling inflation, which was eight or nine percent last year, well below the national average, but gaining momentum. The provincial government wants to contain inflation to about 10 percent this year, "but I can't be certain we can accomplish this," Mr Xiao said. When prices soared last year, the government stepped in and sold grain from its reserves to calm the market. Guangdong recently set price controls, but Mr Xiao said there were dangers in tampering with the free market. "If you want to build a socialist market economy, then it isn't appropriate that prices not move," he said. By the Governor's account, inflation hits hard at a lot of people, in particular the province's 400,000 retired Communist Party cadres, three to four million retired workers, and tottering state- run enterprises employing four or five million people. Including dependents, that runs to 20 or 30 million people, roughly a quarter of the provincial population. To buffer them against these price spirals--and thus ensure against worker demonstrations--Mr Xiao hopes to introduce a policy which will adjust workers' wages to increases in the cost of living. He is now waiting for the central government to approve the proposal. Mr Xiao says one of his biggest problems is population control. A campaign is currently in progress to improve contraception and get people to obey China's one-child-per-family law. The Governor estimates his province probably has several million more people than reported in the national census. "Some areas report that they haven't produced (children), but in fact they produced a lot," Mr Xiao said.
