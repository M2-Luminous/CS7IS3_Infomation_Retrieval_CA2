This was stated by EU Foreign Affairs Commissioner Hans Van Den Broek during the EU-Cyprus joint parliamentary committee meeting in Brussels. [Begin recording] [unidentified correspondent] Speaking during the committee's meeting, EU Commissioner Van Den Broek said that the European Union supports the confidence-building measures and in the fourth financial protocol it is preparing for Cyprus, it is providing a special chapter on their implementation. Van Den Broek said that he will visit Cyprus on 24 March. The Dutch commissioner said that it is uncertain if a solution could be found quickly. The EU Council of Ministers, he added, should evaluate the stance of the interested parties at the beginning of January 1995 and based on this evaluation should evaluate Cyprus' application for accession. The EU Council of Ministers' decision, he said, will be based on the EU observer's report irrespective of whether or not the UN secretary general assigns blame to the interested parties. Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis stressed that it is very clear that the Turkish side is looking for ways to abandon the process or, at least through time-consuming discussions, make the process ineffective. [Mikhailidhis] Despite all this, our side will continue full cooperation with the UN secretary general and his representatives. We are ready to discuss in a constructive way, with goodwill, and within the assigned timeframe in hope that such an agreement will be possible with the European Union's precious support.
