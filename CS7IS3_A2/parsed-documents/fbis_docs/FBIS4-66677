Rajju Bhaiya is a politician and his appointment will definitely influence national politics. In addition to making plans to build Rama's temple in Ayodhya, the Sangh family is rigorously preparing for obtaining Gyanvapi Mosque in Varanasi and Krishna's birthplace in Mathura. There will be vidhan sabha elections in 10 states next year. Rajju Bhaiya will have to plan a strategy in order to improve BJP's [Bharatiya Janata Party] situation during these elections. It was decided in the BJP's national working committee meeting held recently in Hyderabad to emphasize the issue of Hindutva. Seeing the present situation of various Sangh family organizations, accepting the position of the RSS director is analogous to wearing a crown made of thorns. Rajju Bhaiya will have to take strong action to stop the waywardness which is increasing in the once-disciplined Sangh family. It is said that Rajju Bhaiya is very upset at the increasing undiscipline in the BJP. It was also learned that he had directed BJP leaders to give up their royal living style and lead simpler lives. There are also talks about the RSS attitude becoming very severe towards the present central government. Only a few people know the fact that former Sangh President M.D. Deoras and Prime Minister Narasimha Rao were classmates in Nagpur a long time ago and both talked to each other directly. Perhaps that is why the BJP had helped Mr. Rao many times when Mr. Rao was in trouble. Recently, there was a similar occurrence. The government was having problems in getting the bill asking for the privatization of banks, insurance companies, and airlines passed. Raja Maheshwar Singh, a BJP member, had the plan to disobey the president's directive. However, he did not push it. The BJP member abstained when the vote was taken. Similarly, the BJP helped the government in getting a bill passed in the Lok Sabha. Rajju Bhaiya admitted that Atal Behari Bajpayee had accepted the leadership of the Indian delegation to Geneva with his permission. Now the attitude of the Sangh family definitely will change towards the Rao government. The RSS wants to get other parties' support against the Dunkel proposals. It is said that RSS had assured George Fernandes of its cooperation in opposing the Dunkel proposals, however, Fernandes did not accept the offer. It was also learned that Rajju Bhaiya met Chandra Shekhar recently and offered to start a campaign against the Dunkel proposals, however, Chandra Shekhar suggested that it would be better for the two parties to run their campaigns separately. The word is that Rajju Bhaiya had formed this strategy to separate left-wing parties from other parties. It also appears that Rajju Bhaiya is very eager to establish contacts with Janata Dal's V.P. Singh. He was V.P. Singh's professor at Allahabad University. It is also being said that Rajju Bhaiya supports the idea of establishing coalitions with the non-Congress parties in the states where the BJP is weak, however, the BJP high command does not support this idea. It wants the BJP to win the next election on its own strength as forming coalitions with other parties will only hurt the BJP. Therefore, the possibility of the BJP forming a coalition with a non-Congress front is very small. Rajju Bhaiya has announced that the claim on the Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi and on the Idgah building in Krishna's birthplace in Mathura will not be relinquished. The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) has selected these three [including Ayodhya] places from among more than 3,000 sites for return to their original use. These sites are extremely holy for the Hindus and are of no importance to the Muslims. Therefore, the Muslims should hand these over to the Hindus to win their goodwill. This will help foster friendship between the two groups. He said that this is the goal, however, the VHP has to decide how it achieves this goal. The Sangh family will cooperate with the VHP in this effort. The VHP has been claiming for the last several years that other religious groups have taken over 3,000 to 5,000 Hindu worship places and have changed the structures totally. The victors had done this to crush the self-respect of the vanquished community and to destroy the Hindu culture. It is said that Mogul emperor Aurangzeb had destroyed the Vishwanath temple in Varanasi and built a mosque on that site. This is known as Gyanvapi mosque now. Similarly, the temple in Mathura at Krishna's bithplace was destroyed by Aurangzeb, Mehmood Gaznavi, and others several times. At present, the Idgah that Aurangzeb built at Krishna's bithplace stands there. After destruction of the Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, security arrangements around these places in Varanasi and Mathura have been strengthened. Steel fencing costing over 250 million rupees has been built around these places, and para-military forces are protecting them round the clock. It is important to mention here that the present Vishwanath temple was built by Indore's queen Ahilya Bai and Sher-i Punjab Ranjit Singh had mounted about five mounds [about 200 kilograms] of gold on its roof. At present, this temple is under government control. Similarly, Varanasi's king Patni Mal had bought Mathura's site for 5,000 rupees in an auction from the East India Company. In 1935, Pandit Madan Mohan Maulviya decided to rebuild it and contacted Seth Ghanshyam Das Birla. Rai Krishna Das was Raja Patni's successor and did not want to sell this historical place and Birla did not want to accept it for free. It was decided in the end to pay 5,000 rupees to Ram Krishna Das as fee for this land, which he would later donate to the temple foundation. When the temple foundation dug the land for lying the foundation, they found many ancient artifacts there. These prove that Krishna was born at that site. Mr. Maulviya did start the work of building this temple, however, he could not finish it. He died during that time. The temple was finished due to the efforts of the Birla brothers and the editor of KALYAN, Jay Dayal Goenka, however, the Idgah building still stands on the original bithplace. The Hindus are not allowed to enter the Idgah. the same is true about the Gyanvapi masque. The RSS was founded by a Congress Party member, Dr. Keshav Baliram Hedgewar in 1925 in Nagpur. The goal was to unite the Hindus and protect their religion and culture. The RSS slowly spread in various parts of the country. After Dr. Hedgewar's demise in 1940, the working committee opened a sealed envelope left by him and learned that he had appointed M.S. Golwalkar as his successor. Before working for the RSS, Golwalkar was a mathematics professor at Benares Hindu University. At the time he was appointed to the executive director's position, he was working as its secretary. He was only 34 years old at that time. The government banned the RSS for four years when Mr. Gandhi was assassinated. Over 200,000 volunteers took part in a satyagraha [peaceful demonstration] to help remove this ban. Guru Golwalkar established several front organizations in order to expand RSS activities. Golowalkar just before his death in 1973 appointed then general secretary Balasaheb Deoras as his successor by leaving his name in a sealed envelope. Three months ago, I informed the nation before anyone else that Balasaheb Deoras was ready to retire and appoint a capable person as his successor. Professor Rajendar Singh was one of the possible successors. When this news was published in the PUNJAB KESARI many people refused to believe it. Some people were very critical of it, however, now it has been proven that my information published in The PUNJAB KESARI was correct. It is true that Balasaheb Deoras' health was not good for the last two years. He had a stroke and his body was paralyzed, however, this news was kept secret from the members. Last year, when his younger brother, Bhaurao Deoras, died in Delhi, some of the members saw his serious condition at the Nigambodh cremation place. At that time, he had expressed his desire to one of his senior associates that he wanted to appoint an able successor since he could not do his job because of his illness. As for Professor Rajendar Singh also known as Rajju Bhaiya, he is 72 years old. He was born in Bulandshaher in Uttar Pradesh. His father, Thakur Balbir Singh, was the first Indian chief engineer of Uttar Pradesh. He was educated at the Modern School in Delhi and a very good public [private] school in Nainital. He scored highest points in the high school examination in the whole nation. He earned M.S.C. in physical sciences from Allahabad University. Until 1942, he was a card-carrying Congress Party member. At that time, he met Bhaurao Deoras, who brought him into the RSS. Between 1952 and 1966, he worked as a professor and also worked for the RSS to expand its program. He resigned from the university in 1967 and was appointed the administrator for the northeastern region. He was also administrator for Uttar Pradesh. In troubled times, he took responsibility for administration. He was appointed associate director of the RSS. He was appointed executive secretary in 1978. The high command removed him from this position in 1987. At that time, it was claimed that he had resigned from the position because of his poor health. His successor was H.V. Sheshadri who was also the chairman of Dr. Hedgewar's birth centennial celebration. The first three executive directors of the RSS were Maharashtrian Brahmans while Rajju Bhaiya is a Rajput from Uttar Pradesh. Fot the first time in the history of RSS, the executive director has appointed his successor while he was still alive. The first three executive directors of the RSS were bachelors while Rajju Bhaiya is married and has a family. There are several administrators in the RSS high command who are senior to Rajju Bhaiya. These include Dattopant Thengari, the founder of the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh [BMS] (Indian Labour Union), who is considered the greatest thinker in the RSS family. He also founded another associate organization, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh [BKS] (Indian Farmers Union). He is a Maharasthrian Brahman and has been a Rajya Sabha member for 12 years. In addition to him, Mr. H. V. Sheshadri, the present executive secretary of the RSS, is the most powerful person in the RSS. He is from Karnataka and a writer by profession. He has written dozens of books. Moropant Pingle is also a senior administrator and has been executive secretary once. He is the head of the VHP now. He is a skilled organizer and a Maharashtrian Chitpawan Brahman. Why did Balasaheb Deoras ignore these senior officials and appoint Prof. Rajender Singh his successor? There are various conjectures about it. It is not possible to say anything definite about any of these people. The new executive director has appointed Mr. Sheshadri the secretary general. It was the first time in the RSS history that three joint secretaries were appointed. These include C.K. Sudarshan who was still in this position when Suresh Katekar was appointed joint secretary. The third joint secretary is Madan Das who was the president of the All India Students Federation until recently. He was appointed secretary general of the anti-Dunkel awareness campaign. He has appointed Abha Thite, Guru Golwalkar's personal secretary, administrator of eastern region, Jitendra Vir as northern region's administrator, and Subraynam Swami as southern region's administrator. He also appointed B. Hari central administrator for India, Bal Apte as head of the All India Students Federation, and Ashok Singhal as the head of the VHP [Vishwa Hindu Parishad]. His team is relatively young and most of them are about 50 years old. It is important to mention here that the executive administrators of the RSS are also responsible for taking care of the other organizations within the Sangh family. There are about 7,000 administrators. They are not allowed to marry. The Sangh has about 35,000 branches and has a membership between 7 and 9 million. There are 47 organizations in the Sangh family. The major organizations among these are the BJP, VHP, Indian Labour Union, Sanskar Bharati, Vidya Bharati, and the BKS.
