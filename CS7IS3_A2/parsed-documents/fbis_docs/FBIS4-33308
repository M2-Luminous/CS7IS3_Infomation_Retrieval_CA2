That the Government of the Republic, through its peace delegation -- within the framework of a strong and deceptive publicity campaign -- maintained, during the round of conversations and afterward, a deceitful, incoherent, and harmful position. It is deceitful because it has attempted to label as humanitarian its position, which ignores substantial aspects of the uprooting of communities and the magnitude and social trauma, reducing it to a ridiculous space in this worst and ambiguous government policy that is being implemented. It is incoherent because it rejects society's clamor and demands of justice on such an important issue. This has been expressed by the Assembly of Civil Society, as well as by the URNG at the negotiating table. It is harmful because it lays down as a first condition a cease-fire in the areas of resettlement; this is totally unwarranted. Besides, they know before hand that this is rejected because: a) It does not deal with the agreement's issue nor its validity; b) the areas of specific resettlement are not areas of combat, and when and where these are determined is based on the presence and actions of the military detachments; and c) the faithful fulfillment of the Overall Agreement on Human Rights and its immediate verification take into consideration and guarantee the situation of the noncombatant civilian population. 2. To try, as the government has proposed, to avoid having the Commission on the Violation of Human Rights begin its work until the issue of the displaced persons has been concluded is outlandish, and it violates the official agreements signed and established in the negotiating process. This vital and important issue was the object of a specific agreement, expressed in a special declaration on 29 March when the Overall Agreement on Human Rights was signed. This special declaration established, with no room for doubt and in an expressed manner, that during the month of May a specific meeting should be held to deal with this issue. Since there is no excuse or pretext to evade this commitment, it was agreed that the meeting would be held in Oslo on 11 June without any preconditions and that it would not deal with any others issues. 3. Yesterday marked two months since a historic event: the official signing of the Overall Agreement on Human Rights. Sixty days have gone by, and the government continues to ignore and not fulfill the majority of the points agreed upon. At this time, we strongly demand that at least the national campaign -- in which the government and other institutions had made a commitment to report and explain the agreements -- be carried out immediately and in all its magnitude. The explanations or justification given by the national government of the Republic and internationally, alleging lack of funds, fall short in both validity and credibility while they only denote a serious want of political willingness to comply. In this framework and before the national and international community, we demand that Commander Everardo be handed over alive. We reject the defense minister's explanations and insinuations. 4. On 14 May, as part of a vast military plan, the Guatemalan Army initiated a general offensive of a surprising nature. The goal was to put the URNG at a disadvantageous position for discussing the displaced persons' issue on 21 May. The second phase of that national offensive was initiated today in the Ixcan area. Here is where the six elite battalions, including two paratrooper battalions, were concentrated. They have been deployed to operate against the communities of resistant people and against the camps of displaced persons who have returned. We reiterate our charges concerning the consequences and implications this will have in the coming weeks at a national and international level. The URNG reaffirms its willingness to participate in the negotiating process with the best constructive attitude, but we are not willing to accept any distortion or coercing aimed at weakening or misrepresenting the contents of the substantive issues and their development. UNRG General Command [signed] Commander Rolando Moran, Commander Pablo Monsanto, Commander Gaspar Ilom, Carlos Gonzalez, secretary general of the PTG's [Guatemalan Labor Party], CC [?Central Committee].
