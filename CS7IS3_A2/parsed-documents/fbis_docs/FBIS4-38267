FBIS4-38267 "drnes125dd_94012" FBIS-NES-94-125 Daily Report 28 Jun 1994 INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS Palestinian Affairs 'Usfur Says Israel Putting Obstacles Before PNA 'Usfur Says Israel Putting Obstacles Before PNA NC2806154394 Cairo MENA in Arabic 1430 GMT 28 Jun 94 NC2806154394 Cairo MENA Arabic BFN [Text] Gaza, 28 Jun (MENA) -- Hasan 'Usfur, official in charge of directing negotiations in the Palestinian National Authority [PNA], has accused Israel of trying to implement the Cairo agreement signed by the two sides on 4 May in a way that is not compatible with its spirit and of trying to put obstacles before the PNA. In an exclusive statement to MENA, 'Usfur, who is a member of the Palestinian delegation now negotiating in the Palestinian-Israeli security committee, said that Israel is trying to exploit the security aspect in order to stop or impede the Palestinians' movement on the pretext of "security issues." He added: We regard these practices by the Israeli side as an attempt to depict the PNA as impotent and incapable of being a strong authority and therefore inciting the Palestinians against the PNA. He noted that the Israeli side's objective is to put the Palestinian side in a weak position when future negotiations start between the two sides. 'Usfur also accused the Israeli side of blatantly violating the Cairo agreement on a number of security matters. He said the Israeli side sometimes stops the Palestinians from moving around in the areas under its control or in the areas where they have security privileges. He added that the Israeli side is doing this in a way that completely violates the agreement. He added that the Israeli side also carries out actions that annoy the Palestinian citizens in the Jericho area, such as complicating traffic along the Jericho-al'Awjah road, which belongs to the self-rule authority, the Palestinians' travel from the West Bank to Jericho and vice versa, and not yet completing the security passageway between the Gaza Strip and Jericho. He noted that Israel has come up with a concept that contradicts the agreement. He said that the Palestinian side was surprised by this behavior because it realizes that it is waging a new battle to build the Palestinian Authority under the shadow of political complications and the complications of the agreement itself. Hasan 'Usfur said: We believe that building the National Authority is an historic challenge for the Palestinian people and we fully realize that Israel will not be a peaceful state that will give the Palestinians the opportunity to build its own developed and civilized entity. He expressed his belief that there are mentalities inside Israel that believe that Israel is the only advanced country in the region and the only country that has the proper human conditions and therefore it tries to put obstacles before the future evolvement of the Palestinian entity. Regarding the issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners and detainees, 'Usfur said that the Israeli side was not sincere when it came to implementing the recorded or unrecorded agreements between the two sides. He added: Discussion of this issue began with the Oslo negotiations and there were more than one Israeli promise to solve it. It was also discussed during the Taba and Cairo negotiations. The Israelis tried to restrict the release of some detainees. We understood some of these restrictions but they, regrettably, used this understanding to complicate the release of the detainees. Hasan 'Usfur said that the Israeli side has interpreted some aspects of the Cairo agreement as it pleases. It is exploiting the fact that the PNA [Palestinian National Authority] needs to have the Palestinian prisoners released and the difficult conditions the prisoners live under in prison. He clarified that as a result of this, Israel began to set new conditions on the prisoner-release process. Some of these conditions are the pledges the prisoners sign before their release, and the place they are taken to after they are released. None of these conditions were stipulated in the agreement. 'Usfur noted that currently there are attempts to restore dialogue and negotiate over this issue. He said that the arrival of Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to the PNA area is encountering some difficulties as a result of the complications Israel is creating, particularly since they are complications of a political nature. In his interview with MENA, Hasan 'Usfur said that the Palestinian side believes the Cairo agreement is the first stage to finding a final solution. We were hoping that this stage would mark the beginning of the end of a long era between the Palestinian and Israeli sides. He said that upon assuming authority in the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, the Palestinian side worked on providing the necessary conditions to keep the commitments that were stipulated in the recent Cairo agreement. He expressed his belief that important progress was made in a record time period, especially in the security field. The Palestinian side succeeded in asserting the prestige of the Palestinian security authority. This closed the door before all wagers that the PNA will not be able to succeed easily, since there will be strong opposition to the agreement. He said that there were some people who believed that a civil war will erupt. But what has happened is the exact opposite. The PNA was given a very warm welcome and the people responded positively to it. Everyone realized that there is only one law: the law of the Palestinian Authority.
