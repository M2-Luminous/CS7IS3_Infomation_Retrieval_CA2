The primary task for the cruise by the two police 400-DWT Boats was to survey the waters around Taiping Island and chart routes from Taiwan to Taiping in order to provide important information for the establishment of a peacekeeping force on the island and facilitate future sails for ships and fleets. According to the reports, on patrol were two associate geology chief engineers of the "China Petroleum Corporation" in Taiwan. They were to survey sites with exploitable oil and gas. Meanwhile, a fisheries research boat named "Yuxun No.2" carrying 31 oceanology experts joined the cruise. According to reports, the Taiwan regime has reiterated that the Nansha Islands are an inseparable part of China and sovereignty belongs to China. In December 1992, the Taiwan regime set up "the South China Sea Group" and mapped out an "outline on South China Sea policies." Such policies aim to firmly safeguard the sovereign rights in the South China Sea. In September 1993, a large-scale, high-level symposium was held on the South China Sea, called by Taiwan's "Ministry of the Interior". Addressing the opening ceremony, Lien Chan noted that no country can deny the fact that the islands in the South China Sea belong to China whether in legal principle or from the historical perspective. Officials from Taiwan's "Ministry of the Interior" said that Taiwan will continue irregular patrols to the South China Sea in the future.
