Thus, as compared with December 1993, production of tungsten concentrate declined by 79.3 percent; of hard alloys--by 67.0 percent; of refined copper--by 41.5 percent; of sponge titanium--by 32.2 percent; of zinc--by 13.6 percent; and of primary aluminum--by 3.9 percent. There was increased production of only molybdenum concentrate--by 0.6 percent--and lead--by 12.4 percent. A similar picture is observed when compared with production in January 1993. In January 1994, some plants remained "on vacation" because of insolvency caused by rising prices for coal, raw materials, and transport and the decline in consumption of metal output. On Russia's domestic market, consumption of aluminum declined by half and consumption of copper, zinc, lead, and tin declined by 25-30 percent in 1993 as compared to 1992. Export of nonferrous metals did not compensate for the reduced domestic consumption largely because of higher prices for energy resources and fuel; their proportion in the prime cost of nonferrous metals is higher than for ferrous metals. The effectiveness of exporting nonferrous metals at present is the result of revising and lowering export duties. The financial status of enterprises continues to be difficult. If we compare the balance assets and liabilities of enterprises for industrial activity, a general trend is identified: the proportion of real estate in assets is declining, while the proportion of sources of inhouse capital in liabilities is decreasing. And in contrast, in both assets and liabilities debtor and creditor indebtedness is rising, which prevents enterprises from operating normally. For example, the proportion of sources of inhouse capital declined by a factor of 1.4 of its former level, and creditor indebtedness increased by a factor of 1.8 in polymetal industry enterprises during the first nine months of 1993. In December 1993, in terms of the level of labor payment, the nonferrous metallurgy of Roskommetallurgiya [Russian Committee on Metallurgy] was sixth among the sectors of industry (182,000 rubles [R] as opposed to an average level in industry of R145,700). The highest average monthly wage remained in the aluminum industry and the lowest in the solid alloy industry, while the number of people working in those sectors increased by 6.5 percent and decreased by 7.1 percent, respectively. Of the total amount of work time losses because of production stoppages at nonferrous metallurgy enterprises which presented reports in 1993, special metallurgy enterprises accounted for two-thirds (more than 2 million worker days), and of that the Belokalitvinskiy MPO [Metallurgical Production Association] accounts for almost 1.2 million worker days. Significant losses of work time occurred at enterprises of the solid alloy industry too, for the most part because of the lack of sale of output: the Pobedit plant had downtime almost every month which totaled about 140,000 worker days during the year, while the figure was 61,700 worker days at the Kirovograd Plant. Wages at both enterprises were low. The number of people working at Roskommetallurgiya nonferrous metallurgy enterprises in 1993 declined by 0.5 percent, and PPP [industrial production personnel]--by 1.0 percent. At enterprises which are working well and expanding by producing output different from their specialization the figure actually increased: it more than doubled at the Nadvoitsy Aluminum Plant; it increased by 22.5 percent at the Kyshtym Copper Electrolyte Plant; and it increased by 18.5 percent at the Bratsk Aluminum Plant. At enterprises with low labor payment, the number of employees as a rule declined: by 25.3 percent at the Dzhida Tungsten-Molybdenum Combine; by 20.3 percent at the Samara Steel Mill; by 20.1 percent at the Vishnevogorsk Mine Administration; and by 15.6 percent at the Novosibirsk Rare Metals Plant. According to the 1993 results, most nonferrous metals were sold at the MBTsM [Moscow Nonferrous Metals Exchange] (86.8 percent of all sales). The dynamics of growth in exchange prices for virtually all nonferrous metals were positive. Their level is still lower than the level of prices on the London Metals Exchange.
