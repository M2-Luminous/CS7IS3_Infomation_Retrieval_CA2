FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Laurence Wilson, (410) 966&hyph;4603 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Sections 1861(v)(1)(A) and 1888 of the Social Security Act (the Act) authorize the Secretary to set limits on allowable costs incurred by a provider of services for which payment may be made under Medicare. These limits are based on estimates of the costs necessary for the efficient delivery of needed health services. Implementing regulations appear at 42 CFR 413.30. Section 1888 of the Act directs the Secretary to set limits on per diem inpatient routine service costs for hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) by urban or rural area location. Section 4008(e)(2) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;508) amended section 1888(a) of the Act to require the Secretary to update the per diem SNF cost limits for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992, and every 2 years thereafter. Under the authority of section 1888 of the Act, we published a final notice on October 7, 1992 (57 FR 46177) announcing a schedule of limits for freestanding and hospital-based SNFs effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992. The limits were computed using data from cost reporting periods ending on or after June 30, 1989, through May 31, 1990, for freestanding SNFs and from cost reporting periods ending on or after October 31, 1988, through September 30, 1989, for hospital-based SNFs.
