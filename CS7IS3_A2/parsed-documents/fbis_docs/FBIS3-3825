On his way home, he stopped over in Vladivostok, a Russian city on the east coast, and met with Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev. Although both sides stressed their bilateral relations had become mature and had withstood recent tests, they also admitted that differences were unavoidable and they had yet to improve their cooperation. According to reports here, Christopher warned Russia against taking actions alone on issues in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Middle East, but Kozthez insisted that Russia must not be excluded from the process of deliberating on international affairs and complained that Russia's cooperation with the United States in foreign affairs did not bring any substantial benefit to Russia. The less-than-friendly exchange [jiao feng 0074 6912] between the two foreign ministers was an inevitable result of the changes in U.S.-Russian relations. For a certain period, leading Russian politicians continued to stress the need to safeguard Russia's national and state interests and to play a leading role in international affairs. Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev recently made it plain that Russia was "facing the task of resolutely, and even toughly in some aspects, safeguarding and developing our interests," and should "reinforce its status on the international stage." At the same time, Russia changed certain practices it pursued in previous years and took a series of diplomatic initiatives. In order to contend for the dominating power in the political settlement of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis, Russia took the initiative in getting involved in the issue early this year. When the United States and its West European allies issued an ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia, Russia not only opposed the Western plan for launching air strikes against the Serbs, but also persuaded the Serbs to withdraw from the vicinity of Sarajevo and hand over their heavy weapons. Russia then dispatched its own peacekeeping troops to Bosnia. Recently, when the Croatians and the Muslims in Bosnia reached an agreement on establishing a federation in Washington, Russia summoned the Serb leaders to Moscow almost at the same time to discuss corresponding steps. In addition, Russia not only strongly opposed NATO's eastward expansion, but also put forth the "pan-European security conception" in order to check and balance the "peace partnership" initiated by the United States. In Middle East affairs, Russia also showed a positive attitude toward participation in the process of peace. After Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev met with PLO Chairman 'Arafat in Tunisia, Moscow announced that `Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Rabin had been invited to visit Russia in order to seek a breakthrough in the impasse in Palestinian-Israeli relations. Russia also became tougher when dealing with its relations with the United States, and this caused concern and apprehension in the United States. After the Ames spy case was exposed, the Russian Government rejected the United States' demand to recall the Russian diplomat in charge of intelligence affairs, and then took corresponding action after the United States expelled the Russian diplomat. During former U.S. President Nixon's visit to Russia, President Yeltsin refused to meet him on the grounds that Nixon had met with the opposition leaders. This move was viewed here as "making it hot" for the Americans. In view of the United States' activities of drawing some former USSR republics over to its side and forcing Russia to withdraw troops from the Baltic countries, Russia reiterated that it had the right and duty to interfere in affairs in the "close neighbors outside its territory." The appearance of the above-mentioned situation made people in the United States think that relations between the two countries had become frigid, and were "undergoing the most serious crisis since the dissolution of the Soviet Union." THE WASHINGTON POST said that "the Russian bear has awoke." Russian Foreign Minister Kozthev used a figure of speech: "The honeymoon is over, but the marriage remains in a good condition." According to analysis by the mass media here, the changes in the political situation after the Russian parliamentary election constituted the major reason for certain changes in its foreign policy. The radical economic reform scheme, which was called "shock therapy," was set back, and Russia did not actually benefit from the assistance promises made by the United States and the West. This forced the Russian authorities to adjust its foreign policy by making themselves farther distant from the United States and trying harder to safeguard Russia's status and influence as a big power. The mass media here held that, although the United States recently kept a wary eye on the changes in Russia's foreign policy, it still continued to stabilize U.S.-Russian relations and took this as a major component of its efforts to play a "global leading role." For its own interests, Russia also needs to cooperate with the United States in some fields and to maintain the lukewarm "partnership." In order to patch up relations with Russia, U.S. Secretary of Defense Perry [as published] recently visited Moscow. Before he set off, he indicated that the United States would pursued a dual policy. On the one hand, it would promote Russia's positive developments through various types of cooperation; on the other hand, it would prepare for Russia's adoption of a policy hostile to the West.
