He was speaking at the end of talks with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel. Kozyrev said he and Kinkel held two hours of talks to discuss how to clear the ground for Yeltsin's visit as well as "over a score of other problems and some international issues." He spoke of German support to Moscow's approaches for cooperation with the G7 nations, the European Union and the Council of Europe. Kinkel in turn pledged his country's commitment to getting a Russian-EU deal signed as soon as possible. He said Germany would take over the EU presidency from July 1 which would give it more leverage to influence the situation. "We are aware that Russia is in a hard position and it needs support," Kinkel said. He also spoke of receiving Kozyrev's assurances that Moscow would sign the NATO-sponsored Partnership for Peace deal. Kinkel does not hold with widespread speculations of signs of rift between Russia and the West. "Both bilaterally and multilaterally, Russia remains Germany's reliable partner," he said. "We can say the same about Germany," Kozyrev remarked. Kozyrev described Tuesday's talks between Croatia and Serb Kraina at the Russian embassy in Zagreb as a good sign and a step in the right direction. In his view, the Washington accords between Bosnian Muslims and Croats must be made part of a comprehensive settlement. Kozyrev called for compromise between the three warring Bosnian communities on the issue of the country's integrity. For his part, Kinkel praised Moscow's efforts to help open Tuzla airport and create "a better environment in and around Sarajevo." Kinkel also spoke of wanting to take part in the first session by a joint commission on the return of cultural treasures, an issue which would feature on the summit agenda though not centrally.
