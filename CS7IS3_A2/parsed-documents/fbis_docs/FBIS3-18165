Andoniadhou] [Text] The red dollars that were illegally exported from the former Soviet Union have found shelter in European Union [EU] and Swiss banks. These funds, estimated at around billions of dollars, leave Russia on a daily basis with Cyprus as the intermediate destination. Much of the funds remain in banks set up in Cyprus with Russian capital or in offshore companies' accounts. But most of the funds find shelter in European banks. There is an organized system in the movement of funds that are now in the hands of the former nomenclature of the Soviet Union. There is a ring of former communists and bank and enterprise directors in which government officials are also involved. Following the downfall of communism, this ring took possession of huge funds belonging to the state and is now using various methods to take them to the West. It is estimated, but without Central Bank of Cyprus confirmation, that funds worth millions of dollars remain in Cyprus. Cyprus has been chosen by this ring due to the incentives offered in the form of reduced taxation. According to official estimates, there are 2,000 offshore companies in Cyprus today belonging to Russians. Among them are eight Russian banks. The registration of Russian companies is increasing rapidly every day following efforts by the Cypriot and Russian Governments to expand their economic and trade relations and develop commerce and tourism. Cyprus and Russia signed an agreement for the mutual promotion and protection of investments in Moscow last Thursday. Based on this agreement, the two countries will be obliged to protect each other's investments.
