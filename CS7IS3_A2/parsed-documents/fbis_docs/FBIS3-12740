Many of the telephone lines have been disconnected by the striking Bezeq Company employees. Many of the problems and disconnections have been deliberately made by the company employees, the company's director general said this morning. The company will establish an inspection committee, and if employees are found to be guilty of malicious action against the telephone network, disciplinary and even judicial measures will be taken against them. Meanwhile, our correspondent Meron Tzur reports that there are difficulties in dialing from inside and outside the country. This includes, among others, facsimile and some computer communications. Employees have returned to normal work only in the Haifa District and the north. The company is considering distributing back-to-work orders to the employees to ensure vital services. It is also awaiting an answer from the employees committee on a compromise proposal made last night.
