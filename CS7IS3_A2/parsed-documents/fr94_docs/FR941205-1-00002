FR941205-1-00002 FR941205-1-00001 OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT 5 CFR Parts 300, 550, 752, 771, 831, and 842 RIN 3206&hyph;AG37 Agency Administrative Grievance System AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is proposing to abolish regulations at 5 CFR Part 771 on the agency administrative grievance system (AGS). This change would implement a human resources management recommendation under Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review (NPR). This change also would be consistent with OPM's initiative under the NPR to sunset the Federal Personnel Manual (FPM), which included abolishing FPM Chapter 771 on the AGS as of December 31, 1993. DATES: Comments must be received on or before January 4, 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments may be sent or delivered to Marjorie A. Marks, Chief, Family Programs and Employee Relations Division, Office of Labor Relations and Workforce Performance, U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Room 7412, 1900 E Street NW, Washington D.C. 20415. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gary D. Wahlert (202) 606&hyph;2920. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The National Performance Review was issued on September 7, 1993. Appendix C to the NPR is entitled Major Recommendations Affecting Governmental Systems and includes a number of recommendations concerning reinvention of human resources management. One recommendation, HRM08, stated that agencies should ``improve processes and procedures established to provide workplace due process for employees'' and elaborated that ``[a]ll agencies should establish alternative dispute resolution methods and options for informal disposition of employment disputes.'' Among other things, the recommendation specifies that ``[t]he Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) should eliminate by December 1994, all regulations governing internal agency grievance and appeal procedures, thus freeing agencies to tailor ADR [or alternative dispute resolution] techniques to various situations.''. The proposed abolishment of the AGS regulations does not preclude agencies from continuing their AGS procedures established under Part 771 to resolve workplace disputes. It merely means that the mandatory requirement for such procedures would cease to exist. Thus, agencies would be free to continue their AGS procedures, modify them, or eliminate them depending on the needs of their organizations. As suggested by the NPR, agencies could take the opportunity to use ADR techniques in helping resolve disputes in the workplace. Tried and proven techniques such as mediation and facilitation, to name only two of many possibilities, may be used in this regard. In addition, elimination of the restrictions contained in the current regulations affords agencies even more flexibility to design and operate appropriate workplace dispute resolution procedures. OPM's Office of Labor Relations and Workforce Performance will be available upon request to assist agencies in exercising their new flexibility in this important area of human resources management. In this role, OPM endorses and is guided by the NPR which states that ``[w]orkplace problems which are not resolved in a timely and sensitive way impair productivity and morale and impede mission accomplishment.'' Conforming Amendments OPM also proposes to delete references to Part 771 as they appear elsewhere in title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. In those cases, the languages would be modified to refer generically to ``administrative'' grievances or grievance systems to reflect the fact that agencies may have administrative grievance systems even though they would no longer technically be established under Part 771, i.e., 5 CFR 300.104(c)(2), 550.803, 752.203(f), 831.204(e)(2), and 842.106(e)(2). Likewise, other current references to ``administrative'' grievances in title 5 (and not also referring to Part 771) would remain unchanged, i.e., 5 CFR 511.607(a)(1) and 550.804(b)(1).
