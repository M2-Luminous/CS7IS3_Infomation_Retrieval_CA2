Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai addressed the conference. This year the customs sector was assigned by the state to collect 8,500 billion dong in import-export taxes. At the conference, the officials discussed various measures to implement state regulations and orders on renovating economic thinking in line with the party's open door policy; initiating and submitting to the government new regulations and policies that respond to the needs of the new situation; reforming supervision mechanisms to ensure convenience for local residents and foreign guests in traveling in and out of the country; maintaining a smooth flow of trade; and suppressing smuggling and tax evasion. The sector will strive to fight corruption, and expel and bring to trial those degenerate cadres and officials. The customs offices will also pay more attention in improving statistical work, upgrading facilities so that they can help the government with effective macroeconomic management.
