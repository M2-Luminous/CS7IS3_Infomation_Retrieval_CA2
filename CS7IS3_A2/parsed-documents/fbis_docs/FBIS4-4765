Pol Gen [Police General] Prathin said police had tightened security along southern rail roads after the recent bomb which derailed a train. Police patrolled around the clock in certain areas. Last week, a passenger train that left Hat Yai for the southern border town of Sungai Kolok detonated a bomb under the tracks, derailing 14 carriages and injuring 10 people. Asked if the incident was aimed at ousting the government, Prathin said the government could not be removed because it was elected by the people. The government had done nothing wrong and was not involved in corruption. "Those who want to oust the government by bombing are fools," he said. He said the bombing was intended to create a disturbance. It was the work of the people with mental problems. Prathin admitted that the country's intelligence service was ineffective. He had been told about the matter on several occasions, and found that it was true after he was appointed police director general. Officers had not seriously performed their duty. They would try hard only when there was an incident. However, the intelligence had been improved, he said. Prathin said police had done their best to provide security for people's lives and property. However, some acts of terrorism were impossible to prevent.
