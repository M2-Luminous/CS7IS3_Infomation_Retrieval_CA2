K. Karklit, All-Union Institute of Refractories; UDC 666.762.852.001.4] [Abstract] Degradation processes were studied in silicon carbide refractories exposed to high-temperature gas streams. Fired and unfired specimens were made from powders with grain sizes ranging from Nos. 3-125. The fired specimens were made with either a silica or a nitride binder, or they were siliconized (10-15% carbon in the refractory mass and firing in silicon vapors), and silica glass, bentonite, ferrosilicon, and boron carbide were added to impart strength to the silica binder and inhibit SiC oxidation. The unfired specimens were made with Bakelite binder polymerized at 180-200ï¿½C. Specimens of each type of refractory with select physical and mechanical properties were tested in a high- temperature (2650-2730 K) and velocity (2300 m/s with a 1.2 air- fuel ratio) gas stream created by igniting alcohol in oxygen (nearly 13% O[.sub]2[/]). Test duration was 15 s, which is much shorter than usual for this type of test. The specimens were cylindrical, 50 mm long and 20-25 mm in diameter. Change in specimen height during the 15-second test period was recorded photographically. Oxidation of the SiC with the formation of SiO, SiO[.sub]2[/], and CO was the main process resulting in a dramatic alteration of the composition and properties of the specimens in the layer below the one exposed to the gas stream. The degradation processes occurred at the fastest rate within the first 5 s, after which the rate stabilized. The silica binder specimens had the greatest specimen height and mass loss rates (0.88 and 1.92 average specimen height loss, in mm/s, and degradation rate, in kg/sq m x s, respectively), followed by the siliconized specimens (0.85 and 2.46) and those made with the nitride (0.77, 1.81) or Bakelite binder (0.68, 1.63). The latter also had less SiC oxidation and a correspondingly lower proportion of SiO[.sub]2[/] in the layer concerned. Figures 9, tables 5; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.
