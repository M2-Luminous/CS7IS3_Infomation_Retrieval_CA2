ACTION: Solicitation for applications for Fiscal Year 1995 National Research Initiative Competitive Grants Program (Competitive Research Grants Program). Applications are invited for competitive grant awards in agricultural, forest, and related environmental sciences under the National Competitive Research Initiative Grants Program (NRICGP) administered by the Office of Grants and Program Systems, Cooperative State Research Service (CSRS), for fiscal year 1995. Authority The authority for this program is contained in Section 2(b) of the Act of August 4, 1965, as amended (7 U.S.C. 450i(b)). Under this program, subject to the availability of funds, the Secretary may award competitive research grants, for periods not to exceed five years, for the support of research projects to further the programs of the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Proposals may be submitted by any State agricultural experiment station, college, university, other research institution or organization, Federal agency, private organization, corporation, or individual. Proposals from scientists at non-United States organizations will not be considered for support. It is expected that Congress, in the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1995, will prohibit CSRS from using the funds available for the NRICGP for fiscal year 1995 to pay indirect costs exceeding 14 per centum of the total Federal funds provided under each award on competitively-awarded research grants.
