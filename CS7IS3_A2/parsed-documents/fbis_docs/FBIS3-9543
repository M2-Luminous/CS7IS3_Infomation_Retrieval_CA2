He said his party would appoint new heads to Hungarian Radio and Television, and would remedy legal offences like the recent dismissal of 129 Hungarian Radio staff. Gellert said television news programmes hardly ever carry reports about the MSZP. According to their survey, from March 16 to 22, Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] politicians appeared on 30 occasions, not counting parliamentary coverage. In this same period, one single report was carried about the MSZP, and that was about the jogging accident of MP Laszlo Bekesi, the Socialist's economic expert.
