FBIS3-33676 "drnes020_c_94003" FBIS-NES-94-020 Document Type:Daily Report 31 Jan 1994 Egypt Daily Calls for Action in Response to Clinton Remarks NC3001080894 Cairo AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I in Arabic 22 Jan 94 p 2 NC3001080894 Cairo AL-AHRAM AL-MASA'I Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Editorial: "Statement That Raises Hope"] [Text] Certainly we must not ignore the statement that U.S. President Bill Clinton made to the American television network CNN yesterday, which was reported by all international news agencies. The importance of this statement is due to two factors: First, it comes a few days after the Geneva summit with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad and, second, it comes a few days before the resumption of the bilateral negotiations in Washing?on after a suspension of about four months. What did President Clinton say? He declared that he will do all he can to establish an honorable, permanent, and acceptable peace in the Middle East. He said that peace is the outstanding priority of U.S. policy in the region. Evaluating the Geneva summit, President Clinton said that Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad was sincere when he emphasized to him Syria's concern to reach peace, which he described as very important to Syria and to all Arab peoples. Clinton said that he wants to see a peace agreement between the Arab countries and Israel. He noted that his meeting with President al-Asad in Geneva was serious and great. Regarding Lebanon, President Clinton said that the talks with President al-Asad in Geneva dealt with implementing the al-Ta'if agreement and that they agreed that Lebanon should return to being an independent and sovereign state and that all foreign forces should withdraw. These positive statements prompt us to rise to our feet in respect for U.S. President Bill Clinton and to call on him at the same time to translate them into action on all the Palestinian, Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian negotiating tracks. Fortunately, the Washington bilateral negotiations will be resumed on Monday on all tracks. We have a right to be optimistic and to expect great results from these negotiations. The United States provides Israel with everything from bread to missiles. As we know, there are strategic cooperation agreements between them that allow Israel, as happened recently, to transfer advanced U.S. technology. Since the Arab party's intentions have been proven serious to the United States as President Clinton himself noted, it remains for him to signal to Israel that withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories and recognition of the Palestinian people's rights have become a requisite that must be fulfilled sooner rather than later. Israel is maneuvering on all negotiating tracks and instead of proceeding seriously and directly toward peace, we find that it is trying to incite Arabs against each other. First Israel focuses on the Syrian track so that one thinks that a solution is imminent. Israel then abruptly leaves Syria and focuses on the Palestinians so that everyone thinks that a solution is at hand. It then leaves the Palestinians and returns to the Syrians. It continues this approach in an attempt to generate concern and division among the Arabs, pretending that this is the nature of negotiations. We Arabs have all become convinced of America's role as a full partner in the peace process. We are all convinced that the role of a full partner cannot only be played through statements. This role must be exercised practically by advising Israel that its security cannot be achieved by capturing the land of others but by striking a balance in the interests of all parties and living together within a framework of good neighborliness and cooperation in all areas. President Clinton's statement raises our hopes and affirms that peace is making progress despite Israel's maneuvers. It remains to translate these statements into action.
