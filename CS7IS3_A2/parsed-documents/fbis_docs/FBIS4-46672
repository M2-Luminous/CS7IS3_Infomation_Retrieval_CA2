Broad groups of maps also are formed along such subject lines as the limitations and conditions of economic and other activity; ecologically engineering geology, engineering geography and technical evaluations; complex natural-production characteristics; characteristics of problem situations, ecological measures and infrastructure, etc. The spatial series of ecological maps covers all hierarchical levels -- global, continental and macroregional, national, regional, local and detailed.They are being developed in the entire rangeof cognitive aspects: inventory, evaluation and prediction maps, maps of recommendations, as well as functional directions (scientific reference, reference, instructional, etc.). The multifaceted and multiaspect character of the research and development work carried out in the field of ecological mapping, their volumes, the frequently spontaneous-initiative state of affairs advances to the forefront the tasks of providing the necessary scientific base for this work, as well as the well-known organizing principle. This is necessary for ensuring the comparability and up-to-datedness of maps and in the last analysis the possibility of their use in scientific and jpractical (including administrative) work, the possibility of generalization into revNikolay Volneyko, an officer of the test site safety division, in the regions of falling of rocket parts 1858 tons of such pieces have been collected from the tundra. Specialists from the Trans-RES Scientific-Production Center assisted the rocket specialists. They have special equipment and resources for this. The military has neither. Even the rental of a helicopter today costs almost a million rubles an hour. The army budget does not allow for such expenditures. It is true that Trans-RES also has no resources for the delivery of the scrap metal to metallurgical plants. It is necessary to lease barges, to float them along the Koyda River to Arkhangelsk, where the metal is reloaded onto the railroad and shipped to Cherepovets or Magnitogorsk. Where to get such money for prepayment? And then it is still unknown whether the costs will be recovered. Today the prices are rock-bottom. Initially, especially during the period of contention for parliamentary and local deputy seats, the theme of pollution of the tundra by rocket wastes was at the center of attention of all ecological movements and a democratically oriented public. There was a demand for the immediate clearing of reindeer pastures and rivers from the "lethal metal" and enormous fines were imposed on the rocket launchers, hailed into court. The soldiers cleared 318 000 hectares of tundra; how is another question. But there is no longer any possibility for clearing the rocket cemeteries. To be more exact, there is no money. For two or three months the test site has not been receiving its money allowances and the city has not been paid for electric power and heat; there is now no fear of the court. And the deputies and ecologists also have forgotten about them. Possibly for the same reason: however much you ask for sweets, no one hands them over. But possibly other concerns have appeared, a little more important. Two thousand tons of aluminum lie in the Koyda cemetery; they do not rot, they do not spoil -- such is the nature of metal. It awaits until the country has the money for its evacuation. But the tundra? It cannot bear it.
