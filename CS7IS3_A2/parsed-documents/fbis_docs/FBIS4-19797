Its opinion, gauged through a SOFRES poll in cooperation with regional daily newspapers (footnote) (1,000 persons interviewed between 1 and 6 April 1994), has remained virtually the same since the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty. Slightly over one-third of the respondents (36 percent as compared to 37 percent in September 1992) often think of themselves "as a European citizens." Although Europe remains an abstract concept, most respondents still consider that a hypothetical collapse of the European Union would be "serious" (59 percent as compared to 57 percent in December 1991). The single market is judged harshly: 48 percent think that it has "increased" France's economic difficulties over the past two years, while only 15 percent consider that it has "reduced" them. For the future, although pessimism is less pronounced, it remains the dominant feeling: 34 percent think France's economic problems will increase in the coming two years, while 32 percent believe that they will abate. However, there is less worry on this count than in 1992. With regard to institutional matters, public opinion prefers a confederation. A vast majority (52 percent) favors "close cooperation between the national governments within the European Council." One-third of the French (36 percent) are in favor of "a federal European state whose decisions, when adopted by a majority of member states, should be implemented in each country."
