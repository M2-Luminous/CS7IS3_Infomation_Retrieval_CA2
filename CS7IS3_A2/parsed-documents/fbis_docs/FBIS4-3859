"The asymmetrical economic cycles and adjustment pace as well as the resulting weakening coordination mechanism have weakened the role the industrial countries in the world economy," said Chen Yuan, deputy governor of People's Bank of China. Speaking here today at the 42nd meeting of the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Chen stressed that the developing countries have played an important role in helping the global economy out of its difficulties. Chen said most of the developed countries, with better conditions of fiscal deficit and public debt, should enhance the underlying fiscal position to create favorable conditions for world economic growth. Noting that many developed countries have achieved price stability, Chen said that these countries should take the domestic economic cycles into consideration while formulating monetary policy. These countries, Chen said, "should also coordinate policies to avoid a recurrence of the turbulence in the international monetary system." He said that the long-lasting structural unemployment in developed countries can only be addressed through reforms of the labor market and an acceleration of industrial restructuring in these countries. The deputy governor of China's central bank also pointed out that the developed countries' reliance on protectionism to ease domestic economic difficulties will only prolong the structural adjustment process.
