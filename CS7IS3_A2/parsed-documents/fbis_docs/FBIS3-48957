[Kwasniewski] After four years, we have found ourselves in a completely new political situation, so posing some fundamental questions is very appropriate now. The main elements of change in Poland are permanent, and we cannot make just a step back from them, but even a step sideways. I mean democracy, free market, ownership transformations which increase economic efficiency and the economy's openness to the world, I also mean the country's sovereignty and its inclusion in a European security system. Still, the question remains of how we intend to go about strengthening those main elements while at the same time implementing our program. I regard a third element as a personal task of mine -- the Polish political scene must stabilize itself, and once it has acquired a definite shape, there must be room in it for a strong social-democratic party. Such a party will be in power at times, and in the opposition at other times, but it will never be condemned to have any to-be-or-not-to-be doubts. [Kaszuba] But if the left-wing government survives for four years, then it will finish what "Solidarity" has started. [Kwasniewski] No, it will not finish but rather continue what "Solidarity" started. We are against constant revolutions taking place -- it would be a very bad thing if Poland was to adopt the kind of development model which is similar to the movement of a pendulum: From one wall to the other, and back again. Development is about strengthening achievements that have already been made and about introducing changes which would be in accordance with people's expectations. One can then live in a country which is better organized, with a higher standard of living and equal opportunities. In that sense, it is a continuation, and I am not afraid of using that word. The essence of the transformations -- which by the way were initiated earlier, since even though these were slogans proclaimed by "Solidarity" many of them were also declared during the "Roundtable" talks -- is to transform Poland into a democratic, well-organized, economically efficient, significant in global terms, and normal kind of country. [Kaszuba] And also a capitalist one, with a constitution of a bourgeois democratic state. [Kwasniewski] That ideology's significance around the world has been getting smaller and smaller. [Kaszuba] Fine, but is it not your perception that we have an historical paradox here? Or maybe on the contrary -- maybe it is a natural course of events? [Kwasniewski] I would lean toward the latter. Social democrats the world over have managed to make their contribution to free-market and democratic systems. But there is a debate going on about whether it is capitalism, socialism, or social democracy, and about what all these are supposed to be about. If we want to get something useful done in Poland, then we must immediately abandon such obsolete labels. If capitalism is a system of free markets with different ownership forms and based on democracy, then we are after capitalism. But should capitalism be described as exploitation of man and supremacy of the class of owners, then we should not be building capitalism. But for me it is a completely useless debate. The point is about having a vision of the country -- we may call it what we want, even though I tend to prefer calling it a social-democratic system -- in which there would be a free market, different ownership forms, an effective economy, a democracy, and with people having equal opportunities and power to influence official decisions. [Kaszuba] For some time now, the fate of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] as an election alliance has been trembling in the balance. For many different reasons, the groups forming the alliance have been embarking on their own roads, while SdRP wants to take upon itself the task of leading SLD. Is SdRP already strong enough for that? [Kwasniewski] SdRP is in a situation of absolute necessity -- it is the main pillar of SLD, and it is the only force to have nationwide political structures which are capable of implementing political tasks which are about getting ready for elections, explaining the government's measures, and looking for social support for these measures. In my view, the solution to the issue is in the hands of trade unionists, not SdRP. It is the trade unionists who found themselves in the most difficult situation. It is natural for them to be in the opposition -- they are critical of the government and they make demands while at the same time avoiding any responsibility. Right now they are part of the governing coalition and so they must change their line of reasoning -- from contesting and making claims, to a more pragmatic and efficient solving of problems facing employees. But the weak side of that concept is that the trade unions' role is not very spectacular, and that it will be hard to try to argue with the shouters and it will be even harder to win battles with them. The All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] is not the first trade union to have found itself in this kind of situation. We are familiar with what "Solidarity" went through -- the union has never decided to back the government completely, it led to the government's collapse and today it is absent from the parliament. That is an important factor in debates. OPZZ is not the first trade union to participate in political structures, either -- it was the same case in Sweden, Spain, and Greece for years. [Kaszuba] What other source of SdRP's radicalization in personnel issues could there be aside from its feeling of strength? [Kwasniewski] It is not a radicalization at all. Does election victory in a democratic country mean that a government is formed and the winning party makes no appointments apart from ministerial posts, with the president's policies being implemented in presidential ministries, and the predecessors' policies being implemented in the other ministries so as to gain support from the mass media? Does that also mean that there are no changes at the level of voivodships [administrative districts], even though some voivodes [local government officials] do not have any great willingness to cooperate with representatives of the new government? That would not mean being in power but enjoying being in power at the supreme levels. We think that every government should have necessary instruments and procedures at its disposal. This is also the essence of the dispute about participation in presidential ministries' leaderships. They are included in the government's structure so the prime minister and the whole coalition bear responsibility for measures undertaken also by those ministries. So we would like to have some influence over them. The whole issue would never have even come to surface if it was not for some deficiencies in the process of agreeing on certain issues. We came to the conclusion that direct influence is insufficient. So for the sake of those ministries, and for the sake of integrating measures undertaken by the government with those undertaken by the president, a system must be created in which the flow of information and consultations would be complete. [Kaszuba] But the sudden interest expressed in the ministries tends to create the impression of the coalition having come to a conclusion that it can afford to get involved in a conflict with the president at this stage. [Kwasniewski] The president is someone who undertakes different measures and makes different value judgments at different points in time. Our proposals -- these were jointly agreed upon by SLD and the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] -- are neither a result of a willingness to be begging for conflicts, nor of a contention that the president is now weak, so one can launch an attack on him. Rather, the proposals are the result of a conviction that the ministries' activities cannot be out of the government's control since that would mean that first, we would create an unconstitutional situation. Secondly, a joint creation of concepts by the ministers, the president, and the governing coalition, will better serve the cause of ruling the country. [Kaszuba] And the coalition hopes that the president will continue to swallow the bitter pills without uttering a word? [Kwasniewski] What bitter pills? I am sure the president will understand that it is in his best interests. After all, you just cannot think this way: This is my backyard and everybody else can keep their noses out of it. There are no constitutional provisions to justify such a view. If foreign, internal, and defense policy is to be implemented exclusively by the president, then government members should not implement it but rather high-ranking officials in the President's Office. The Constitution provides -- and we adhere to this -- that the president is the commander in chief of the Armed Forces, that he participates in shaping both foreign and domestic policy, and that he has influence over filling those posts. The ministers were appointed in accordance with his wishes, and now the coalition would like to have the possibility of participating in decisionmaking within the ministries. Foreign policy, internal policy, and defense issues -- these are the main parts of any government's business and that is the case around the world. [Kaszuba] Two months ago, SLD used to say it does not plan on replacing voivodes. Right now the party -- along with PSL -- announces widespread purges. [Kwasniewski] The fact that up to now there have been very few changes proves that there is no purge going on whatsoever. I think we will always be between two extremes: On the one hand there will be views expressed that the coalition fails to influence an important part of the government's policy, but on the other hand, following any kind of personnel measure there will be talk of purges and retaliation. Both views are false. [Kaszuba] But one does not change one's views on an issue as important as this within a period of two months. Is it not the case that by leaving voivodes alone the coalition was courting the Democratic Union [UD], but once it found out there is no chance for agreement -- at least for now -- then it decided to come back to the issue? [Kwasniewski] Our relationship with UD was predetermined by recent statements made by its leaders. UD wants to remain a definite opposition party and an alternative to the arrangement now in power. Aleksander Smolar even wrote that it was a mistake to vote for Oleksy, that it was a mistake to abstain during votes in the Sejm Constitutional Commission, and that one should have shown society with determination that UD was in opposition. In that sense, the roles have been divided and I can see no political possibilities -- even though one could find some substantive ones -- to come into alliance. I cannot imagine, either that following PSL's statements during the debate on a vote of confidence for Suchocka's government, we could see UD courting PSL again. [Kaszuba] SLD abstained, so it can keep courting. [Kwasniewski] We did not abstain from courting UD. There was too much politics in the debate and not enough of sticking to the letter of the law. Political decisions concerning the previous governments had been made -- both of them were brought down. To me, that was when political issues were done with. The question put before the Sejm was: Was the budget adopted by the previous Sejm ever implemented? If someone thinks it was not implemented, then he should continue the trail and look for the guilty party. [Kaszuba] There was talk in SLD circles under the previous Sejm that Ireneusz Sekula was a wasted seat in parliament. How did this sudden reversal come about, I mean his appointment as chief of the Main Customs Office? [Kwasniewski] Sekula is a good organizer and manager, he is experienced in working in large, state-owned institutions, and he is also psychologically predisposed to carry through difficult operations. He is just strong psychologically. Apart from that, he also enjoys social support, he has been politically active since 1990, he was elected Sejm deputy twice, and had he not been elected, he would not have made the comeback now. [Kaszuba] But he has always aroused controversy, even among his colleagues from his deputy club. [Kwasniewski] Yes, and that is why he occupied position number 16 on the electoral list but he still managed to win in his electoral district, and that must be respected. Those colleagues who had raised their objections and then lost to Sekula, should bow before him. [Kaszuba] Is the essence of the governing parties' far-sightedness about that they will take up the most important posts and the government's immediate base, followed by having provisions on public civil service enacted which would be apolitical and not subject to changes along with changes of political teams? And this way, the supposedly apolitical posts will be permanently occupied by people representing the left wing? [Kwasniewski] We need a law on civil employees of public services but if it is enacted, then it will be possible to withdraw political nominations. The point must be defined at which public and irremovable service begins which would be based on contracts, and then people must be found to fill those posts, people whose political views will be irrelevant. [Kaszuba] Can you say with absolute certainty that this will be the order in which events will happen? [Kwasniewski] That order simply must happen, if all this is to make any sense at all. In any case, nobody will believe that a politically appointed voivode can become a "civil servant" overnight. We will deal with that when the right time comes. Of course, once the law becomes effective, it will influence the way personnel are appointed. It would be the same case if UD was in power today. After all, the apolitical nature of voivodes presented a diversified picture under the previous cabinet. Not only were they not apolitical, but they were also active in specific political parties, including PSL. SLD was the only party which was totally absent from state administration agencies. [Kaszuba] And you insist that is not retaliation? [Kwasniewski] One could comment on any kind of change by saying it is retaliation. The word is being used much too often; one could speak of retaliation if changes were introduced everywhere after two months and if people from the old Polish United Workers Party took up voivode posts. That would be a case of retaliation, it would be a purely political act, and also complete stupidity. An opinion on people performing public posts cannot be political in its nature and nothing else. If we have a case of a good voivode -- and I know a few of those although I want to cite no names since I am not sure whether that could harm them or be good for them -- who happens to be from the right wing, he should remain at his post. But if there is someone who is incompetent, then he must leave. The coalition is not only responsible for who is in power, but also for the entirety of issues in Poland. What about personnel replacements? Of course they happen -- that is the case all over the world when it comes to such posts. [Kaszuba] It has been a month and a half since your apology in the Sejm [for abuses under previous communist regimes]. Do you feel you have been forgiven? [Kwasniewski] I did not expect anybody to forgive me. [Kaszuba] So why did you make the apology? [Kwasniewski] To me, the "I'm sorry" was an important political act. In the context of the whole speech it meant that the past is a closed chapter and there is no going back. I am aware that 20 percent of the people voted for us, but on the other hand, many people fear going back to the old ways. And I think that those people who can afford to speak frankly and do not have to decorate their statements with different political ornaments -- I think those people approved of my statement. They became convinced that there is no going back to an era which we are all fed up with.
