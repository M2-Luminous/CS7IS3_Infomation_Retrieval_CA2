According to the Finance Ministry, profitability rose to a level clearly higher than the long-term average. This year the profitability of industrial enterprises will continue to improve. Last year's improvement in profitability was fostered by the rise in prices for export goods, and also by the drop in labor unit costs and interest rates. According to preliminary estimates by the ministry, the net profits for industrial enterprises rose by 10 billion markkas over 1992. Compared to sales, the proportion made up by net profits rose by 2.5 percent units to a level of over 8 percent. This year net profits will increase by 11 billion markkas, and the share of sales consisting of net profits will increase to 10.5 percent. The ministry estimates that the available financial resources of industry will rise to 14 percent of sales. Net profits are defined as that portion of money earned by a business that can be applied in investments or for distribution of income. The financial condition of industry has been improved by the fact that companies have been able to decrease their indebtedness. The Finance Ministry predicts that the net indebtedness of industry, in relation to sales, will decrease to about 30 percent by the end of the year, which is on a par with predepression levels. The ministry expects that the improvement in financial conditions and the lowering of interest rates will drive industrial investments into an upswing this year. Conditions for investments are now "better than they have been for a long time," according to the ministry. The price competitiveness of manufacturers improved about 60 percent in 1991-93. Two-thirds of this improvement was due to the weakening of the markka. The remaining one-third was the result of the rapid improvement in productivity, and the "patient development" of a better labor cost situation. Competitiveness will drop somewhat this year due to the recent strengthening of the markka. Nevertheless, the competitiveness of Finnish business will continue to be about 40 percent better than the long-term average level. Unemployment Will Continue To Worsen The rapid improvement in conditions for industrial enterprise will not help decrease unemployment. Sixten Korkman, the head director of the Finance Ministry's National Economy Department, says that improvement in unemployment is dependent on the recovery of the domestic market. "Unemployment will continue to be at shockingly high levels for several years because the starting level is so high," said Korkman. According to the ministry, the demand for labor will continue to decrease by more than 30,000 persons yet this year. Jobs will be lost especially in service occupations in both the public and private sectors. According to the report, the proportion of those unemployed who have been out of work for over a year will rise to one-third. According to head director Korkman, employment might still improve faster in this situation than in previous recessions, because businesses have no employees in "unnecessary positions." "Businesses have eliminated all of the positions that they can eliminate. At the same time, productivity has risen exceptionally fast during the recession," said Korkman. Labor productivity, that is the ratio of production to the work input, rose as much as 12 percent in industry last year, which is also the same as during the previous year. The ministry expects that industrial productivity will improve by 5.5 percent this year.
