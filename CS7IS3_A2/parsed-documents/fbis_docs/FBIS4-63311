There are substantial changes in the composition of the Moldovan delegation, primarily connected with the resignation of its head, Anatoliy Taranu, extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador of the Republic of Moldova to Russia. He is supposed to be replaced by Nicolae Osmochescu, deputy foreign minister of the Republic of Moldova and international law specialist, who has been asked to lead a group of experts from Chisinau at the talks with Tiraspol. The Moldovan delegation decided to make some concessions in the latest round of talks. Backing down on its previous demand that the Army be withdrawn by 1 July 1994, it suggested that the withdrawal be carried through during one or two years. In the opinion of Anatoliy Tiranu, it is not ruled out that Moldova could decide on even greater concessions: from approving a longer duration of the Army's stay on its territory to assigning it the status of a military base.
