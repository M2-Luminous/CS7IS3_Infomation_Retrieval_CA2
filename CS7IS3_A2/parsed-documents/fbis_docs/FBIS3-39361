After all, the first reaction to the failure of the trade talks was a significant revaluation of the yen toward the dollar. At the same time, the yen also became much more expensive toward the mark and currently rates close to its highest historic level of August 1993. Last Friday [11 February], a few hours before the talks were suspended, 100 yen only cost 1.62 German marks [DM], while on Tuesday it was DM1.68; this corresponds to a revaluation of the Japanese currency -- or a devaluation of the mark -- by almost 4 percent. On the basis of the rate at the beginning of the year, the changes even amount to 9 percent. The expensive yen first of all means that German companies will get more money for their exports to Japan -- calculated on the basis of German marks. BMW or Wella can be happy about a little extra money; yet, in terms of the national economy, it does not make a big difference, since German exports to Japan are still a mere trifle. What is important for the economy is the effect on imports: Many Japanese products, ranging from stereo systems to computer printers and automobiles, are very popular here because they simply offer good value for one's money. The stronger yen will not force the producers in the Far East to increase prices in Germany to get the same money back in yen as before. This will make German producers at home more competitive. Unlike a strong dollar, an expensive yen hardly creates any dangers of inflation, but leads to shifts in market shares -- this benefited domestic industry even last year. In addition, it improves the competitive position of German companies on third markets over contenders from Japan. The high rates of the yen toward the greenback, incidentally, also has a side effect: It has made the dollar slightly weaker toward the mark. This development should actually make it easier for the Bundesbank to resume its policy of small steps and to cut interests, which are still much too high for the current economic developments. One thing that is open, of course, is how long the yen will stay so high: Based on the strong economic growth in the United States and the rather upward moving interest rates there, experts expect the dollar to regain in strength. The price of the yen is currently rather a political one than based on economic output. Yet, what is also open is how the agreement between the United States and Japan, which is bound to come one day, will look like: Will the two superpowers reach purely bilateral agreements -- in violation of GATT rules -- then Germany and Europe will be the losers. Yet, if Japan were to decide to tear down some of the many invisible import hurdles, then Clinton would have given the Europeans a present.
