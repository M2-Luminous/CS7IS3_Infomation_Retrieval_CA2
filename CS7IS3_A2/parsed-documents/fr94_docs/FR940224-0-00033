FR940224-0-00033 FR940224-0-00003 SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background In August 1989, Congress enacted section 501 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, (FIRREA), (codified as section 21A(b) of the FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)), which established the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC). Pursuant to FIRREA the RTC has the duty to manage and resolve failed depository institutions that come under its jurisdiction and to conduct the operations of the RTC in a manner which ``maximizes the *␣*␣* return from the sale of institutions or assets,'' ``makes efficient use of funds'' and ``minimizes *␣*␣* losses *␣*␣* in the resolution of [failed institutions]''. Section 21A(b)(3) of the FHLBA, as added by section 501(a) of FIRREA. In addition, the RTC is required to resolve all failed institutions in the ``least costly *␣*␣* of all possible methods'' (collectively Cost Constraints). Section 13(c)(4)(A)(ii) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), 12 U.S.C. 1823(c)(4)(A)(ii), as made applicable by section 21A(b)(4) of the FHLBA, 12 U.S.C. 1441a(b)(4). The RTC is committed, wherever practicable and whenever consistent with those statutory Cost Constraints, to preserving the ownership characteristics of historically minority-owned depository institutions, and to increasing the total number of minority-owned depository institutions. See, Strategic Plan for the Resolution Trust Corporation, 54 FR 46574, November 3, 1989. Section 21A(s) of the FHLBA permits the RTC to make available to an acquiror which is either a minority depository institution or a women's depository institution, on a rent-free lease basis for not less than 5 years, any branch of a failed institution which is located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' Section 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA, which was added by section 3(a) of the Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act, Pub. L. 103&hyph;204 (the Act), provides that in considering offers to acquire any insured depository institution, or any branch thereof, located in a ``predominantly minority neighborhood'', (as defined in regulations prescribed under subsection (s)), the RTC shall give preference to an offer from a minority individual, minority-owned business, or a minority depository institution (Minority Acquiror), over any other offer that results in the same cost to the RTC as determined under section 13(c)(4)(A) of the FDIA. 1 1 This Act also provides, in connection with such an acquisition, the following additional preferences: (i) the Minority Acquiror shall be eligible for minority interim capital assistance under section 21A(u)(1) of the FHLBA, provided that such assistance is consistent with section 13(c)(4)(A) of the FDIA; (ii) the RTC may provide to the Minority Acquiror performing assets under the RTC's control, in addition to those of the depository institution or branch to be acquired, in an amount not greater than the amount of the net liabilities carried on the books of the depository institution or branch and acquired by the Minority Acquiror; and (iii) such disposition of the performing assets of the failed depository institution or branch to the Minority Acquiror shall have a first priority over a disposition by the RTC of such assets for any other purpose. This interim rule defines ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' as used in sections 21A(s) and 21A(w)(17) of the FHLBA as a geographic area constituting a United States Postal Service 5-digit Zip Code (Zip Code) in which 50% or more of the persons residing therein are minorities, based upon the most recent census data, unless the RTC determines, in its sole discretion, that other reasonably reliable, readily accessible data indicates different neighborhood boundaries. The population data and the minority composition of these Zip Codes are determined using the most recent (currently 1990 data) Census of Population data (Census Data) collected and published by the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economics and Statistics Administration, Bureau of the Census (Census Bureau). If the institution or a branch thereof is located in a Zip Code area for which no significant Census Data is available (e.g., a business district or office building) the Zip Code of a nearby geographic area served by the institution or branch, for which such Census Data is available, will be used as its Zip Code for purposes of this rule. If the RTC determines, in its sole discretion, based upon other reasonably reliable and readily accessible data, and subject to RTC's Cost Constraints, that a different delineation would more accurately reflect the area served by the financial institution or branch to be marketed, the RTC will use such delineation as the boundaries for the relevant neighborhood. There is no legislative history which might provide clear guidance in developing a definition of ``predominantly minority neighborhood.'' Consequently, except for the word ``minority'' which is statutorily defined, the definition of ``predominantly minority neighborhood'' was, therefore, developed based upon the common or ordinary meanings of the individual words comprising the phrase, the statutory context in which they have been used, and based upon readily available data.
