FR940802-0-00008 FR940802-0-00002 Section 1427.1 (b) is amended to clarify what information is available in State and county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices. Section 1427.3 is amended to: (a) correct a typographical error; and (b) add the definition of ``warehouse receipt''. This interim rule amends §1427.4(b) to add references to receivers, guardians, or trustees which were inadvertently omitted. This interim rule amends §1427.5(b)(1)(v)(B)(4) to clarify that certain extra long staple cotton is ineligible for CCC price support loans. This interim rule amends §1427.5(c)(2)(ii) by removing the reference to incentive payments and thereby allow purchases of cotton to make such payments to a producer without affecting the ability of the producer to obtain a price support loan with respect to such cotton. This interim rule amends §1427.6(b) to clarify who may disburse loan proceeds to approved cooperative marketing associations. Section 1427.11 refers to warehouse receipts that may be used as collateral for CCC price support loans. This section has been revised to recognize the existence of electronic receipts by removing specific statements such as ``stamped'' and ``initialed''. Provisions for taking administrative offsets are provided in part 3 of this title and part 1403 of this chapter. Accordingly, this interim rule removes and reserves §§1427.14 and 1427.168. CCC has determined that the liquidated damages can be reduced without affecting the administration of the cotton price support programs. Accordingly, this interim rule amends §1427.18 and §1427.175 to: (a) decrease the liquidated damages amounts; and (b) add provisions that provide that any or all of the liquidated damages may be waived under certain conditions. Section 1427.23 is amended by removing paragraph (f) and redesignating paragraph (g) as paragraph (f). The removed provision was originally included to allow upland cotton producers who lost beneficial interest at the time of ginning an opportunity to file for a LDP on the day such upland cotton was ginned. This required producers to report ginning to the county office on a weekly basis. Since this provision was implemented, CCC developed a more workable procedure that allows producers to request LDP's in advance of ginning with the LDP rate based on the loan repayment rate announced and in effect on the day the upland cotton is ginned in accordance with redesignated §1427.23(f). Section 1427.171 is amended to clarify provisions relating to locations that are approved for the storage of CCC loan collateral by removing the reference to commercial warehouse houses. Section 1427.174 is amended to correct a spelling error.
