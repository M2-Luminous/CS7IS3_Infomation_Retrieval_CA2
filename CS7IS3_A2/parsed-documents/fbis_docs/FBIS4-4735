The two men submitted a request to the Hiroshima District Legal Affairs Bureau for access to a list of people and money they say has been deposited on their behalf. Hiroshima is the only place in Japan where the existence of such a list has been confirmed and if it is made public, it would be the first time in Japan. The South Koreans, Pang Hun-chae, 71, and Pak Chang-hwan, 71, are members of an association of former conscripted Korean employees of Mitsubishi. A Japanese citizens' group which assists Korean "hibakusha," or people who have suffered from the Hiroshima atomic blast, invited them to Japan. Pang and Pak were brought to Japan in 1944. Pang was working at the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries shipbuilding yard and Pak at the Mitisubishi machine assembly plant when the United States dropped an atomic bomb on the city August 6, 1945. The bomb destroyed most of the city. Both made their own way back to South Korea in September that year. The citizens' group said the list kept at the district legal affairs bureau contains 1,951 names but only people on the list are allowed to read it. Pang and Pak say their wages for July and August, 1945 are unpaid. During negotiations with staff at the bureau, they were able to show the staff extracts from their family registers, but the bureau staff said they will have to confirm what documentation is required to determine their identity. Pak said he produced a pension identity card issued to him by a local insurance office in Hiroshima during the war, and was upset that the officials had not trusted his documentation despite having the copy of the family register which shows the "Japanese" name he was using at the time.
