[Aleksandrov] The Partnership for Peace lays the foundation for the European armed forces' integration. [Shishmanova] Yes, but it does not provide any guarantees for our defense. [Aleksandrov] Look here, guarantees can be provided (?only by the state institutions). There are no other guarantees. Who is going to attack us? Greece, Turkey, or Romania? You must realize yourself that this is preposterous. This cannot happen. [Shishmanova] Nevertheless, there is a war, in Yugoslavia. [Aleksandrov] The Army can cope with this. You should understand that guarantees of the kind that the Soviet Union used to provide can no longer be obtained. There is no one to provide them. [Shishmanova] Perhaps NATO. [Aleksandrova] Whom should it provide guarantees for? [Shishmanova] Evidently, not for us. [Aleksandrova] Yes, evidently not for us, (?hence we should adopt other models). [Shishmanova] In that case, what is the Partnership for Peace doing for us? [Aleksandrov] It is a serious [words indistinct] for our defense. [several words indistinct] The so-called Visegard Four member-states are not pleased, because they will not join NATO before us. [Shishmanova] Yes, but Clinton is expected to meet their leaders, rather than ours. [Aleksandrov] This is Clinton's business, it is none of my concern. I am neither president, nor prime minister, I am minister of defense. However, I must tell you frankly my point of view, which I have repeatedly stated, namely that none of those countries is ahead of us, and I should point out that we see considerable opportunities in the NATO program that we intend to take full advantage of.
