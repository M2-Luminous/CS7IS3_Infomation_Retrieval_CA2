FR940722-0-00015 FR940722-0-00003 The FCA Board disagrees that disclosure of information undermines board accountability and responsibility. In fact, disclosure of senior officer compensation is intended to promote board accountability to shareholders rather than shift board responsibility to shareholders. The objective of this type of disclosure is to provide shareholders with information to assess whether senior officer compensation is appropriate in view of the institution's financial condition and performance and to hold the board accountable for maintaining a reasonable rationale for the level of compensation paid to its senior officers. D. Invasion of Privacy Although numerous reasons were cited in opposition to individualized compensation disclosure, no other issue generated the intense reaction created by concerns of ``invasion of privacy.'' Respondents were highly concerned that the disclosure of potentially sensitive information in a public format, such as the annual report, would cause considerable staff dissension and would render management unable to effectively administer the institutions' salary programs. One commenter stated that disclosure of the individual salaries of the five highest paid senior officers will, more than likely, cause salaries to gravitate to the highest paid levels in order to maintain morale rather than ``limit'' compensation paid to senior officers. Several commenters expressed concern that the disclosures may cause employee flight. Additionally, some FCS associations were concerned that the individual compensation disclosures may inadvertently reach the branch officer level. The FCA recognizes that internal conflict may be generated when the information presented is used by parties for purposes for which they were not intended, such as a means for co-workers to compare salaries or to use as a bargaining tool for salary negotiations. The FCA also believes, however, that management is ultimately responsible for maintaining employee morale and retaining competent staff through fair and reasonable compensation, and for communicating to staff how this is accomplished through the salary administration program. A primary aspect of the disclosures is to provide shareholders insight regarding the methodology and basis the boards use to determine what they consider to be ``fair and reasonable'' compensation, rather than to ``limit'' senior officer compensation as suggested by a commenter. Further, the FCA believes stockholders have valid reasons to have this type of information readily available to them and they should not be penalized because of the potential for internal conflicts. Many commenters were opposed to the proposed disclosures because FCS institution annual reports are used as marketing tools, among other things, and made available to a wide spectrum of interested parties. Some commenters believed that the broad distribution of the reports could promote animosity among shareholders and employees throughout the FCS and possibly other members of rural communities. Several commenters also stated that in order to evaluate the reasonableness of individual senior officer compensation, shareholders would need to understand several key aspects of the employer/employee relationship, such as the experience and knowledge an employee brings to his/her job, geographical cost-of-living data, market compensation for similar positions, job responsibilities, and the competitive and regulatory environment in which the employee operates. Commenters also asserted that providing just a dollar amount of compensation, without any other relevant data, would be interpreted by the readers of the annual report in terms of their own frame of reference. This could easily lead to confusion and ill feelings among employees and shareholders because they are not provided with all the facts involved in determining an individual's compensation.
