Sansaricq has asserted that the Senate will take all necessary measures to manage the situation. [Begin recording, in Creole] [Sansaricq] Personally, I guarantee the international community that the Senate of the Republic will do its best to protect the safety and lives [pauses] so no attacks are perpetrated against foreigners in Haiti because what they want to show is that we are a band of wild people who cannot lead our country. [Unidentified journalist] So you think that the international community has put economic diplomatic pressure on us, but that the threat of military intervention is not certain, contrary to what is being said? [Sansaricq] There is no reason to invade Haiti because we are a peaceful country. If President Clinton takes upon himself the responsibility for putting a half-crazy man back in power -- a pro-Libyan, pro-Castroist, a man who could have established democracy in Haiti but did not -- I think President Clinton will regret it because he will have many problems, not in Haiti, but in the United States, with his own people, 65 percent of whom tell him no, do not enter Haiti. We will do our best to manage the situation. If the intervention comes, we can do nothing about that. We will manage it the way it comes. We can do nothing about it, but we always [pauses] we would not like our country to be invaded. [end recording]
