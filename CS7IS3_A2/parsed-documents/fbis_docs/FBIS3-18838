This was announced by the Federal Economics Ministry in Bonn today. At 7.4 percent in the second half of the year, it grew clearly more than in the first half of the year. Gross domestic product per worker in the states of former East Germany reached around 46 percent of the Western level last year. In the view of Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt, the Federal Statistical Office's data confirm that there has been a high rate of growth in eastern Germany over the past two years. Following a temporary deceleration, the economic catching up process evidently has started to accelerate again somewhat. However, this could not yet be described as a self-sustaining recovery in the states of former East Germany. [passage omitted]
