A crowd up to one thousand demonstrators marched on Thursday along the city's central street, Rustaveli Prospekt, passed the parliament building without meeting any resistance from law-enforcement bodies. Local observers link the march to today's incident in Georgian parliament, when city police chief David Zeikidze and his officers tried to force their way into the conference hall in order to prevent lawmakers from approving Shota Kviraya as Georgian interior minister. Major-General Zeikidze is known to be an implacable foe of late Gamsakhurdia and his supporters. He has repeatedly used force to disperse unauthorized rallies amd demonstrations in support of the ousted president. But this time, feeling insulted by the actions of the parliament's and Eduard Shevardnadze's guards who kept him off the conference hall, he pointedly refrained from breaking up the demonstration. Today's protest action by Gamsakhurdia supporters coincided with the 3rd anniversary of the national referendum which declared Georgia's sovereignty and thus triggered the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
