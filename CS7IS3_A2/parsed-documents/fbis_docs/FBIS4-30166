This despicable disinformation campaign is part of their persistent anti-DPRK intrigues. Their decoy materials such as letters, publications and video cassettes are, without exception, run through with sheer lies groundlessly vilifying the DPRK. They send such propaganda materials in the name of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) or Koreans in Japan or even the International Institute of the Chuche Idea [IIJI]. This is an intolerable insult to and mockery of Chongnyon and Koreans in Japan and the IIJI. It goes without saying that the disinformation campaign is a brainchild of the notorious South Korean "Security Planning Board" [SPB], an anti-DPRK plot-breeding machine accustomed to telling lies and fabricating things. The "SPB" recently launched into such dastardly campaign with the sinister political aim of creating ideological confusion among officials of the DPRK and progressive figures of different countries by taking advantage of the situation complicated by the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. The South Korean authorities stoop to any infamy in their efforts to create ideological confusion within the DPRK and take the edge off the international movement for solidarity with the Korean people's cause of justice growing stronger with every passing day, while running amok in their preparations to unleash another war and stifle the DPRK with the help of outside forces. But, by doing so they are stripping themselves fully naked as sycophant traitors. It is a gross mistake, if they think they can give rise to any slightest ideological vacillation among officials of the DPRK and world's progressive people with such dirty tricks. It is as foolish an act as trying to destroy a rock with an egg. The South Korean authorities must immediately stop the despicable act of distributing decoy materials that can convince no one.
