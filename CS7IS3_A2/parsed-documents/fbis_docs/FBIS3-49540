The fact that the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP] is trying to restrict the president's prerogatives, or even to replace him, has long since been discussed, not only behind the closed doors of the BSP headquarters at 20, Positano Street. The present initiative of the Socialists can hardly be defined as the result of their foreboding about forthcoming elections, alone. One of the latest causes of concern for Videnov's people seems to be a possible, new reorganization of the parliamentary structures under the aegis of the head of state. The separation of living political organisms such as the Civic Alliance for the Republic [GOR] and of the Alliance for Social Democracy [OSD] from the aging body of the BSP, which is evidently underway, would deprive the giant party from its control over parliamentary events and from the possibility of overthrowing the government at a convenient time. The fact that the president himself is no longer a decisive force in political life is beyond any doubt. However, the danger that he might stand behind a vigorous parliamentary center force, or even support the SDS, a possibility that has been repeatedly hinted at from the president's headquarters on 2, Dondukov Street, evidently suffices to cause panic among the Socialists, whose political isolation would be devastating in such case. By further stimulating the antipresidential campaign of the SDS, the BSP will presumably rely on threatening our head of state with the SDS guillotine, while trying to make the Democrats more open for reconciliation with their chief opponent, at the same time, and acting as a balancing force between the centers of power so as to preserve control over the situation. The political game of the Socialists who are trying to pull the strings of the government, while distancing themselves from it at the same time, has long since been unsuccessful. Their current attempt at sharing the responsibility with others, which they tried yesterday, will hardly be more effective. It would be naive to believe that the colossus on clay feet, as the BSP can already be described, could rely on a supportive crutch from the SDS. We can presume that SDS leader Filip Dimitrov will be subject to a new series of attacks by his fellow party members. The attacks are most likely to come from those who, until recently, accused him of preventing the dialogue with other political forces. Nevertheless, the SDS leader confirmed that those capable of exploiting their opponent's failures are the real winners in the political game.
