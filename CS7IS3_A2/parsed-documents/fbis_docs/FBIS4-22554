Regardless of whether the timing of this press conference was dictated by some complex strategy or the result of pure chance, this dividing line between two political time zones (one would like to believe that there will be a change of direction in Ukraine) was truly an interesting moment in which to hear the opinion of someone who has crossed this boundary ahead of others. Especially as the advertised subject of the press conference was "Ukrainian Banks: The Basis of Economic Reform." Here is Petro Miroshnykov: First, about Inko Bank itself. Even though Western experts concluded that last year was the most difficult year for commercial banks since they have been in existence in Ukraine, Inko had a successful year. It has a balance of 2,249.5 billion karbovantsi and a profit amounting to 212 billion karbovantsi, or 17.8% of the profits earned by other commercial banks (this does not take into account the performance of the "big five" -- the former special state banks, three of which, Prominvestbank, Ahroprombank, and Ukrsotsbank, have also been designated as commercial banks). Inko has 66 branches (two outside Ukraine -- in Belarus and Armenia) and correspondent accounts in more than 100 countries. And if, as the experts predict, only the strongest and most secure banks will survive this year, Inko is unquestionably among those in this group. On the general economic situation. The principal cause of the deep systemic crisis is the power crisis. Until political guideposts are put in place and questions of ownership are defined, the present difficulties in the economy will continue. It is pointless to make predictions until we see who will be forming the government. One thing is clear: the reform process is now irreversible, and it is only a question of how effective these reforms will be. On foreign investment. We have a sufficiently modern law on protecting foreign investments, but no foreign investments. Contrary to the government's belief that foreigners are practically lining up to invest their money. This is not the case. Nor will it be the case until political stability is achieved and there are political guarantees. Once things get going, investments will be virtually impossible without banks. These investments will be channeled through the banks, and they will be guaranteed and serviced by the banks. The fact that few banks can perform these functions is another matter. This is especially true of the entire pleiade of the so-called small banks and of the overwhelming majority of medium-sized banks, which are not up to the job. Inko, other commercial banks, and the National Bank of Ukraine [NBU]. The Kiev Bank Union has had two consultations with V. Yushchenko, the head of the NBU, at which joint measures were outlined. To be sure, the NBU has other problems at the moment: monetary circulation, emission, switching to a national currency -- these things take up all of the NBU's time and effort, but we remain in contact with the NBU. If you recall, there was that ridiculous telegram from the NBU and the Ministry of Finance instructing enterprises to switch their accounts to their place of registry. This telegram was later "edited," and the Bank Union played a role in this. Of course, there are some conflicts in our relationship. But the Kiev Bank Council tries to solve them in a constructive manner. Lobbying on behalf of banks. Some 212 commercial banks have been created in Ukraine. And three of them -- the former state banks Prominvestbank, Ahroprobank, and Ukrsotsbank -- control 87 percent of the bank market. Ukraine is alone in leaving this deformity of the banking system in place. In Russia, these banks were broken up into regional banks. Prominvestbank currently controls 60 percent of the bank market. We are all hostage to this bank, including the government, but it seems that the government does not understand this very well. Consequently, it is unrealistic to talk about lobbying on behalf of banks at this time. We need to create a system of laws, and they should all be "written" by the same people so that they reflect a single ideology and not be in conflict with one another, as is the case today. We need to review existing laws and pass approximately another... 400 laws. Emission. Last year, commercial banks were forced to issue credits for the sugar plan at the ridiculously low annual rate of 50 percent. We thought that such methods were being used as a last resort. But we were wrong. The same thing is happening this year. The principal issuer of preferential credits will be the Ahroprombank. I believe that in the end this bank will get the money from the government, which will take it from the National Bank. And the National Bank, in turn, will print the money. Because there is no such money in circulation. It does not even exist in kind. I see no other way out at this time. Yet, last year we recommended that the government buy only as much of the harvest as it needs for its programs. For the remainder of the yield there are exchanges. Those who know prerevolutionary history, know that the price of sugar was always set by the Kiev Sugar Exchange. On the payments crisis, balances in the red, and forged money. A payments crisis has been raging in Ukraine for three months. According to some estimates, the sum in arrears is higher than the amount of money in circulation in the country. The banks, too, were affected by this crisis. In addition, the NBU has devised a grim penalty for those who have wound up in the red and is piling up fines upon fines. As a result of such "healing" measures, 11 banks have gone bankrupt. In three weeks, Inko lost 43 billion karbovantsi. The specialized banks --the same "big five" -- made no outside payments through most of December, confining themselves to circulating paper internally. Now the banks have gotten out of the red because emission is under way. We see this by our clients. We were able to cope with forged bank remittances in short order because the National Bank was efficient in switching the commercial banks to electronic payments. Inko received its portion of forged remittances, but not directly -- we got them from Prominvestbank, which accepted them. Are the banks pushing up inflation? Yes, but not the purely commercial banks. The specialized banks are doing this by disbursing cheap money and financing unprofitable enterprises. Obviously, they are not doing so of their own accord. The new commercial banks act as a counterbalance to them. But the forces are not equal. The Crimea and Inko. Inko's development policy in the Crimea is going to be cautious, although we plan to open two branches there. I regard the proposal to include the Crimea into the ruble zone as unrealistic: accounts can be settled in any currency, but there must be a single monetary unit in clearing operations. If there are two monetary units in circulation, one of them will simply leave this territory, as has happened before in the world. Implementing this proposal in spite of this fact will bring Crimea one step closer to secession from Ukraine. Whom does he want to see in parliament? People with similar views, among whom he counts Hrynyov, Lanovyy, Filenko, and others. In full compliance with the election law, Inko did not finance anyone, Miroshnykov was not put forward as a candidate, and he has no intention of creating a bankers' party. He is satisfied to head the Bank Union. But a candidate does not live by money alone; he also need analyses, studies, expert opinions. Yet (we remind you that this press conference was held before the election -- ed.) Miroshnykov does not share the optimism of some politicians and believes that there will be no second round, because... the election will be invalid. When this report is published, each of our readers will be able to judge this banker's prognosis for himself.
