Former vice president Aleksandr Rutskoy, the famous champion of the fight against corruption, has not remained on the sidelines. Presently in Krasnoyarsk, Rutskoy, chairman of the Russian Social Democratic People's Party, has criticized this edict. One of his arguments is: Name me a single document which could be implemented, Rutskoy said in an interview to a RIA correspondent. Rutskoy believes that the edict has not been thoroughly worked out, and not only violates human rights, but is contradictory to legislation. With the aid of the edict, the authorities intend to drive society into a condition of total pathological fear, Rutskoy said.
