FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Federal Reserve Board Clearance Officer_Mary M. McLaughlin_ Division of Research and Statistics, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551 (202&hyph;452&hyph;3829). OMB Desk Officer_Milo Sunderhauf_Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Room 3208, Washington, DC 20503 (202&hyph;395&hyph;7340). Final approval under OMB delegated authority of the extension with revisions, of the following reports: 1. Report title: Report of Transaction Accounts, Other Deposits and Vault Cash; Reports of Certain Eurocurrency Transactions; and Advance Reports of Deposits. Agency form number: FR 2900; FR 2950/51; and FR 2000/2001. OMB Docket number: 7100&hyph;0087. Frequency: Weekly, Quarterly, Daily_dependent upon request. Reporters: Depository institutions. Annual reporting hours: 1,767,743. ␣ 1Report 1Estimated number of respondents 1Estimated hours per response FR 2900 8,764 (weekly) 1 to 12 (3.50 avg.) ␣ 4,934 (quarterly) 1 to 12 (3.50 avg.)

General Description of Report This information collection is mandatory [12 U.S.C. 248(a), 461, 603, 615, and 1305(b)(2)] and is given confidential treatment [5 U.S.C. 552b(4)]. This package of reports collects information on: deposits and related items from depository institutions that have transaction accounts or nonpersonal time deposits and that are not fully exempt from reserve requirements (``nonexempt institutions'') (FR 2900); Eurocurrency transactions from depository institutions that obtain funds from foreign (non-U.S.) sources or that maintain foreign branches (FR 2950, FR 2951); and selected items on the FR 2900 in advance from samples of commercial banks on a daily basis (FR 2000) and on a weekly basis (FR 2001). The Federal Reserve proposes that the single deposit cutoff ($44.8 million) (and one of two determinants of deposits reporting category) be replaced by two separate deposit cutoffs ($44.8 million and $55.0 million). The higher cutoff would be applied to nonexempt reporters, resulting in a shift of over 1,000 reporters from weekly to quarterly FR 2900 reporting and a significant reduction in annual reporting burden. The lower cutoff would continue to apply to fully-exempt institutions (see Item 1 below). In the future, both cutoffs would be indexed annually. Also, the Federal Reserve proposes to broaden the entity coverage of the daily FR 2000 to include large thrift institutions, and recommends that eighteen thrifts be added to the reporting panel. No revisions to the content of any of the reports are proposed. Information provided by these reports is used for administering Regulation D_Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions; or for constructing, analyzing, and controlling the monetary and reserves aggregates; or both.
