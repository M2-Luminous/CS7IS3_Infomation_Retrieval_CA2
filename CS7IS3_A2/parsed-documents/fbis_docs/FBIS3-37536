This has been done in view of the boycott of the elections announced by the Dniester authorities. To prevent the opening of polling stations, a special situation was introduced there by a decree of Igor Smirnov, the Dnestr Region leader. Armed posts were placed in some populated areas and on bridges across the Dniester. People engaging in the election campaign are being detained. The Moldovan leadership fears that on the election day - 27 February - the population of the left bank regions will be afraid to cross the Dniester and come to the polling stations opened on the right bank. Therefore, under Mircea Snegur's decree, the citizens of the Dniester Region will be allowed to vote during the week beginning 21 February.
