FR940622-0-00020 FR940622-0-00011 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES Health Care Financing Administration 42 CFR Parts 405 and 489 Office of Inspector General 42 CFR Part 1003 [BPD&hyph;393&hyph;IFC] RIN 0938&hyph;AC58 Medicare Program; Participation in CHAMPUS and CHAMPVA, Hospital Admissions for Veterans, Discharge Rights Notice, and Hospital Responsibility for Emergency Care AGENCIES: Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and Office of Inspector General (OIG). ACTION: Interim final rule with comment period. SUMMARY: We are revising requirements for Medicare participating hospitals by adding the following: A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to individuals who have health coverage provided by either the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS) or the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Veterans Administration (CHAMPVA), subject to limitations provided by regulations that require the hospital to collect the beneficiary's cost-share and accept payment from the CHAMPUS/CHAMPVA programs as payment in full. A hospital must provide inpatient hospital services to military veterans (subject to the limitations provided in 38 CFR 17.50 ff.) and accept payment from the Department of Veterans Affairs as payment in full. A hospital must give each Medicare beneficiary (or his or her representative) at or about the time of admission, a written statement of his or her rights concerning discharge from the hospital. A hospital (including a rural primary care hospital) with an emergency department must provide, upon request and within the capabilities of the hospital or rural primary care hospital, an appropriate medical screening examination, stabilizing treatment and/or an appropriate transfer to another medical facility to any individual with an emergency medical condition, regardless of the individual's eligibility for Medicare. The statute provides for the termination of a provider's agreement for violation of any of these provisions. These revisions implement sections 9121 and 9122 of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (as amended by section 4009 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987), section 233 of the Veteran's Benefit Improvement and Health Care Authorization Act of 1986, sections 9305(b)(1) and 9307 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1986, sections 6003(g)(3)(D)(xiv), 6018 and 6211 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, and sections 4008(b), 4027(a), and 4027(k)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. DATES: Effective date: This interim final rule with comment period is effective July 22, 1994, with the exception of the new information collection and recordkeeping requirements contained in ยง488.18, ยง489.20(m), ยง489.20(r)(2) and (3), and ยง489.24(d) and (g), which are not yet approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Following OMB approval, a document will be published in the Federal Register announcing the effective date for those sections. Comment date: Comments on changes to the June 16, 1988 proposed rule resulting from provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989 (OBRA 89) or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) will be considered if we receive them at the appropriate address as provided below, no later than 5:00 p.m. on August 22, 1994. These changes generally concern the responsibility of Medicare participating hospitals in emergency cases. The specific new provisions in this area from OBRA 89 and OBRA 90 are discussed in section II.D.2 of this preamble. We will also accept comments on Appendix II to this interim final rule. Appendix II instructs hospitals with emergency departments on their responsibilities concerning the posting of signs specifying rights of individuals under section 1867 of the Act with respect to examination and treatment for emergency medical conditions. We will not consider comments on provisions that remain unchanged from the June 16, 1988 proposed rule or on provisions that were changed based on public comments.
