The Macedonia foreign minister Crvenkovski considered as successful and a good example the meetings he had with the Albanian high officials. "We are for a close cooperation with Albania and all the other neighbours realising the democratic principle of the non-intervention into the domestic affairs," Mr. Crvenkovski said adding that his government is also for respecting of the human rights and for the relations building based on the European and international standards. The Macedonian foreign minister said we discussed with the Albanian side some economic projects of the common interest about the international situation and for the eventual consequences our two countries may have by the grave situation in region. "We had a fruitful meeting and we desire these meetings be as often as possible," Mr. Crvenkovski said. Asked about the U.S. State Department report on the human rights in Macedonia, Mr. Crvenkovski said he didn't know anything about that report. We observe, said Mr. Crvenkovski, the principle which says that all citizens in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are equal having all the rights and it is of the state interest that all of them be pleased to their state and accept it as their own. I think, Mr. Crvenkovski said, all the problems can not be solved within a year but the great steps the Macedonian state has done can not be rejected. Answering to a question in regard with the closing of the Salonica port, Mr. Crvenkovski said "from the Albanian side we have a full support and we appreciate this very much." But, however this blockade makes the transport difficult. This is a means of pressure that will not be accepted from the international community. Minister Serreqi, answering a question about the possibility of the aggravation of the relations with Greece because of giving FYROM port facilities, said that "the fact that the Albanian Government offer not only port facilities, but facilities for all the goods circulation in the interest of Macedonia as an answer to the one- sided approach attended and declared from the Greek Government, one day after the visit of the Greek Foreign Minister Papoulias to Belgrade, is an evidence of the will for relations of good neighbourhood with Macedonia and an evidence of the independence of the foreign policy of Albania. "I was surprised from the decision of the Greek Government because during the visit and the meeting in Athens, in the talking with Mr. Papoulias, he told me that the time has come to reconsider the approach of Greece toward Macedonia in a quite different sense from the decision taken by them. I believe that even my colleague and the Macedonian Government should appreciate this support given from Albania. Answering the question of a journalist concerned on an article published in the newspaper FLAKA E VELLAZERIMIT about the ill- treatment of the Albanians who ask passports of identity, necessary for the future census of the population, the Macedonian minister said that this problem has no relations with the census of the population and that the Macedonian state is for its performance according to the world standards. Answering the question "cause any trouble to the Macedonian Government some cases of the killing of Albanians in FYROM" Mr. Crvenkovski said that he doesn't know cases of the abuse of the human rights till the killings, at least during the period he has been minister. Considering the representation of the Albanians in the Macedonian institutions, Mr. Crvenkovski said that during a year and a half, the representation of the Albanians in the political life of Macedonia is going over the possibilities of the organs of power there. Considering the Albanian approach toward the acceptation of Macedonia in CSCE, Mr. Serreqi said that it will depend from the treatment of the Albanians living there. Calling the Albanian factor as very important for the relations between the two countries, Minister Serreqi said that something has been done for the rights of the Albanians in FYROM, but there are possibilities to do more. The question "Which is the Macedonian approach to the Kosova question," Mr. Crvenkovski said that "our approach toward Kosova question is that it should be resolved through dialogue, it is impossible to find a solution for it through other ways."
