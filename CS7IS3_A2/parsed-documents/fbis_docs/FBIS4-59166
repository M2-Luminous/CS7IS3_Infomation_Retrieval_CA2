PUK officials contacted by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT yesterday said that joint forces of the Revolutionary Guard and the Islamic Movement of Iraqi Kurdistan [IMIK] (a fundamentalist movement suspected of receiving aid from Iran) last Tuesday attacked the towns of Halabjah and Khurmal near the Iraqi-Iranian border and tried to control them "but PUK forces confronted and killed, wounded, and captured some members of these forces," according to the sources, which added that the day before yesterday the village of Biyarah [as transliterated] near Halabjah was the target of "another attack by the forces of the Revolutionary Guard and the IMIK" and that the attack was repulsed by PUK forces. The sources added that the attacking forces "suffered 150 dead, some of whom carried Revolutionary Guard identification cards," and the the prisoners taken by PUK forces included "three Iranian Revolutionary Guard members." They further said that the PUK forces also seized arms and equipment from the attackers. Fierce battles had taken place in December last year between the PUK and the IMIK, as a result of which the latter lost its influence in the areas close to the Iranian borders. Meanwhile, sources in the parties of Barzani and Talabani have confirmed that calm continued for the second day yesterday in the Iraqi Kurdish areas where armed clashes occurred last week between fighters of the two parties, but independent sources say that the situation is still tense in some areas. Joint committees from both parties are visiting these areas and trying to normalize the situation there. It should be noted that the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party had sent a message to Barzani, Talabani, and the political bureaus of their two parties urging "an end to the fighting and a restoration of the situation which existed before 2 May." In a bulletin, a copy of which was received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, it said that the Central Committee held an emergency meeting last Saturday during which it discussed the recent clashes and issued a statement urging that "the blood of the Kurdish people be spared" and that "the region of Kurdistan should not fall into the trap which Saddam Husayn's clique is trying hard to push it into."
