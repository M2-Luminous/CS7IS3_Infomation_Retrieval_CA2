"Without GATT membership, our open policy and reform would continue," said Li Zhongzhou, Deputy Director General for International Relations at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec). Li made his remarks last week at an international seminar, "China Business Summit," that came about two weeks before China was to send a high-level delegation to Morocco to sign the final agreements of the Uruguay round of GATT talks. During the 16th session of the GATT Working Party on China held in Geneva last month, most member nations showed support for China's early re-entry. Among the exceptions was the United States. Li admitted that denial of membership in GATT would likely have a negative effect on trade expansion and slow down the pace of reform in China. "However," he said, "a passive return to import substitution (a measure to restrict imports) in parallel with continued investment incentives may actually encourage greater foreign investment (in China) because local production would then be favoured over imports. "The world trade community has a choice between accepting China as an equal trading partner by granting it GATT membership, or competing for access to the Chinese market on a reciprocal basis," he said. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) prefers multilateralism to bilateralism. Li said China has made a high profile effort to regain GATT member status, but does not want membership at any cost. "The bottom line is equal treatment," Li said. "China hopes to obtain unconditional most-favoured-nation (MFN) treatment equivalent to that accorded to all other contracting parties by participating in GATT. It is important to point out that this is the fundamental international principle applied universally, not a privilege as claimed by certain political arguments." The United States has insisted that it will renew MFN for China on the condition that the Chinese Government "makes progress on human rights" and other issues, an approach that China maintains runs counter to the spirit of GATT. "The entry into GATT is a crucial step to integrate the Chinese economy with the international community. It injects a dynamic factor into the world economic growth. However, this purely economic issue has been complicated by non-economic factors and the negotiation has been delayed for an unwarranted long period," Li said. He added that the market-based pricing system has been in place in China, which is one of the fundamental demands of GATT. He noted that certain major trading partners are taking advantage of China's negotiations for GATT membership to extract unreasonable concessions that are beyond China's ability. For example, some partners demand that China eliminate all non- tariff measures while they themselves maintain quantitative restrictions on thousands of items such as textiles and clothing, agricultural products, consumer goods, steel and footwear. In some of these sectors China has comparative advantages. "In the case of increased protection against Chinese products," Li asserted, "China will be forced to reduce imports in order to balance its foreign trade. This return to import controls, Li said, would be the second best choice for China if it is kept out of the world's multilateral trading system.
