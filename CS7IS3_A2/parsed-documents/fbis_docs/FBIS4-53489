FBIS4-53489 "dreas097_d_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-097 Daily Report 19 May 1994 South Korea * Kim Yong-sam's Military Relations Discussed * Kim Yong-sam's Military Relations Discussed 942C0107A Seoul SINDONG-A in Korean Apr 94 pp 194-204 942C0107A Seoul SINDONG-A Korean CSO [By Yi Sang-ki, HANGYORE political reporter: "Kim Yong-sam, Yi Pyong-tae and the Hanahoe Generals"] [Text] The periodic spring personnel changes, announced every April, has become a focus of attention inside and outside the military as the time draws near. They are the first regularly scheduled changes under Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, an ex-member of Hanahoe--the No. 1 target of reform last year--and, therefore, how he will treat Hanahoe officers is a matter of great concern. The upcoming announcements are especially noteworthy in that they will provide a clue to the future direction of the Kim Yong-sam government's control of the military. Therefore, it is not a bad guess that both the military leadership and Chongwadae are in agony over this process confronting them. In that agony, merits and demerits of reforms last year are evidently working as a guide. Aside from how Hanahoe officers will be treated, the coming changes are drawing attention to such questions as: Whether or not the command leadership will be replaced, and if they are, how extensively, and how substantially the newly created Deliberation Committee on Proposed Appointments will exercise its screening power. Also noteworthy will be changes involving Navy and Air Force officers. Also, a great majority of officers, remembering that the fall personnel changes last year were affected by considerations of private connections with the command leadership, are interested in knowing whether the problem will be corrected this time. Informed military sources forecast that the upcoming changes will be kept within a narrow range. In substance, however, they are of important significance in that they are to show the will of the supreme commander and the future direction of his personnel management. Speculation that the April changes--which may be moved up to late March because of the president's scheduled visits to Japan and China and the need for an early stabilization of the military--will be on a small-scale are based on the following factors: First, President Kim, through five or six shakeups he carried out last year, has established his control over the military and is confident of his leadership as supreme commander. In other words, the president must have decided, they say, that there no longer exists the possibility of the military challenging him or rebelling against him. It can be said that the experience gained from the side-effects of the frequent shakeups last year--which even caused vacillations among commanding officers in some units--also contributed to this observation. Therefore, the president clearly intends, they claim, to use maximum restraints on unnecessary changes for the sake of stability within the military. In addition, there was the death of Cho Kun-hae, chief of the general staff [CGS] of the Air Force, in the line of duty in a helicopter crash on 3 March. It is feared that another sweeping shakeup at this time could plunge the military into a vortex again. In his speeches to the commencement exercises of the Army, Navy, and Air Force academies, held successively on 2, 4, and 8 March, President Kim said that "there were times when the honor of the great majority of our military personnel treading their honorable path was undermined." He gave the impression that it was not the same president who dismissed Kim Chin-yong as the CGS of the Army and So Wan-su as the commander of the Defense Security Command [DSC], in a blitz about this time last year. "The military life is a difficult and severe one. But it is an honorable one for the fatherland and the nation," the president declared for the sake of the honor of the military. He pledged to pay greater attention to lifting the morale of personnel as well as to programs for science-based national defense and the training of specialist manpower. In other words, the president, who consistently had relied on the "stick" in military management, has now promised the "carrot." The general observation is that as a result of such changes in the president's policy and perception toward the military, he will likely give priority to stability and consequently will avoid replacing the Army's top leadership after all. In fact, at a year-end Chongwadae dinner party for major commanders of each service last year, President Kim, in his conversation with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, referred to reports of shells that had fallen on school playgrounds, chiding him that "there is some laxity in the Army these days." But the president called in the CGS to Chongwadae in February this year to encourage him, it was confirmed. Since it is viewed as a certainty that there will be no reshuffle of the leadership of each service, it will be noteworthy whether the Ministry of National Defense [MND] and the leadership of each service will be able to achieve stability and harmony through the upcoming changes and, at the same time, resolve the private organization issue in an amicable fashion. It can be said that the authority over the changes was, in effect, transferred to the MND minister and the chiefs of staff of the respective services. This is because it has become virtually certain that there will be no changes this time involving four-star generals, which are normally made by the president in person. Although some in the Army think that Gen Kim Chae-chang (18th class of the Military Academy [MA]), deputy commander of the Combined Forces Command [CFC], will be replaced because he is a Hanahoe officer, a majority believe that he will be retained because he was appointed by President Kim and, moreover, is outstanding as a military diplomat with the U.S. authorities and as a leader of operations. Even if there are no direct personnel actions by Chongwadae for the foregoing reason, it is still doubtful that the present military leadership, including MND Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, Chief of Naval Operations Kim Hong-yol, and Air Force CGS Kim Hong-nae, will independently exercise their rights of personnel management; rather, Chongwadae is likely to influence them one way or another. "It proves that the military has been accustomed to the exercise of its rights by Chongwadae throughout last year," officers say. Meanwhile, under the military personnel law revised late last year, a committee to consider proposed changes involving general officers was created to bolster the MND minister's authority. How the MND minister will exercise his strengthened authority remains to be seen. In the past, the MND minister's authority over CGS-recommended promotions for general officers was a mere formality; however, the new law empowered him to examine and screen the proposed promotions. It is worthy of note that, unlike the days of former MND Minister Kwon Yong-hae when the minister and the Army CGS formed a single, vertical command system, currently they are from the same MA class and this is another factor drawing attention to the coming personnel changes. In particular, MND Minister Yi Pyong-tae's background relating to Hanahoe--the private organization whose members CGS Kim Tong-chin decided last year to exclude from considerations for promotions in principle--is complicating the situation, making it difficult to work out adjustments until the last minute, according to reports. Since the MND is exercising its screening power for the first time, it is of course expected to go all the way trying to coordinate with each service on their lists of officers to be considered for promotions. Therefore, military sources foresee that there will be no cases of proposed promotions being turned down by the MND. Consequently, actions on Hanahoe officers will inevitably be a focus of the spring personnel changes after all. On this point, the general observation is that MND Minister Yi, who is one of them, has no plan yet. He himself has on no occasion given any hint at all on his attitude toward Hanahoe. After Col Paek Sung-to (MA 31st class) distributed a Hanahoe namelist in early April last year, officers whose names were on the list, even including field-level officers, were put at a disadvantage in their military life last year. The eyes of these officers and of outsiders are now fixed on the Army leadership to see if they will be again refused to be considered for promotions/reassignments this year again. Former MND Minister Kwon Yong-hae and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin made it clear last year that "Hanahoe officers will be put at a disadvantage in terms of promotion in the first year, they will be treated on the same basis with their colleagues of the same MA class from the second year on." If so, there will probably be a relief for them this year. However, since Yi Pyong-tae was installed as MND minister last year, there has been an atmosphere surging in the military stifling a settlement on the Hanahoe since. Meanwhile, in a year-end interview with Chongwadae reporters, President Kim explained his action in appointing Yi to the MND post, saying that "although he belonged to Hanahoe, he had never been a leader of it. Moreover, he has a strong will for reform." As seen in that remark, Chongwadae seems to be shifting to appeasement in resolving the Hanahoe issue. On the other hand, an anti-Hanahoe climate, combined with an anti-Yi Pyong-tae mood, has brought a high wind to the Army, according to informed sources. In his first days as MND minister, Yi, like Don Quixote, inundated leaders of each service with directives, which led to the creation of an Army "7-Day Camping Team" -- and after debates, the team issued a report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within," binding Yi hand and foot. It occurred in early January. As contents of the report were partly leaked to media, they resulted in narrowing Yi's options, whose obtrusive acts already had caused strong distrust among military leaders in resolving the Hanahoe issue, according to sources familiar with affairs inside the military. Until immediately before that, or late December, Yi reportedly had been planning to complete actions on Hanahoe generals with no more than the releases of Kim Sang-chun (MA 19th class, director of the operational planning headquarters of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]) and Yi Tae-hyong (MA 19th class, director of the war potential planning headquarters of the JCS) from their respective posts. However, as the 7-Day Camping Team report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within" was leaked, it inevitably narrowed Yi's options on the Hanahoe issue. The anti-Hanahoe offensive escalated, forcing the Army leadership to attempt to persuade Hanahoe generals on the Army Headquarters Policy Committee and those awaiting their retirement to voluntarily retire from active service. In January, Kwak Tong-to (MA 21st class, major general) visited Lt Gen Yi Taek-hyong and Lt Gen Ham Tok-son (both MA 20th class, former 11th Corps commanders) and Kim Chong-pae (MA 20th class, former 3d Army commander) separately, who were moping away their time in the Policy Committee research room next to the Army Headquarters Seoul office in the MND building, to advise them to retire on their own. The generals, except one, refused to follow the advice. Some of them expressed their displeasure, saying that "it could be different if the CGS in person comes to see me on that but...," according to reports. They are said to have stated that "for us, it is not a big thing to retire, but we find it absolutely unacceptable unless there is a measure taken to rehabilitate those junior officers who were discriminated against merely because their names were on the reported list." Some were known to have even mentioned the legal retirement-age clause. Others rejected the idea of voluntary retirement, saying such retirement can be compared to dishonorable discharge. Thus, the Army leadership's effort to coax Hanahoe generals into retirement ended in failure. To be exact, however, nobody in the military, even among Hanahoe officers themselves, believes that they can make a comeback from where they are awaiting their retirement. Meanwhile, away from those lieutenant-general or major-general level officers who are either on the Army Headquarters Policy Committee or officially awaiting their retirement, there are the cases of Hanahoe generals still active in field army, MND or JCS posts. As for the latter cases, it is rumored that they will be possibly rescued on a selective basis. Such rescue of course will more likely take the form of reassignment rather than promotion, according to informed military sources. Based on these speculations, it is also said that in the reassignments of field-level officers being announced after the spring changes for generals, the scope of reassignments for Hanahoe officers in particular will be considerably expanded. Of the lieutenant-colonel and colonel-level field officers who graduated from the MA in the 27th-36th classes, approximately 10 Hanahoe officers in each class were demoted last summer from their key positions in the so-called big three commands--the Capital Garrison Command, the Special Force Command and the DSC--or from major posts in the Personnel Management office of the Army Headquarters, the Personnel Staff Headquarters, the MND and the JCS to leisurely assignments in educational centers or other front-line or rear units. What sort of reassignments they will get will inevitably draw attention because they are linked to the rescue for them in the periodic fall promotions later this year. Commenting on the issue of field-level Hanahoe officers, a high MND official said that "since it is a very delicate problem, the MND has not yet adopted an official position. But I expect that when it does, it will be in favor of their rescue." "Whether they are rescued or again passed over for promotions, there will be repercussions. In that case, it will be wise to minimize sacrifices," he noted. The same official added that the shift to stability, solidarity, and enhancement of the morale in the president's new policy for the military is another factor backing up that possibility. Concerning the question of treatment for field-level Hanahoe officers, a considerably large number of personnel pointed out that several factors other than such high policy-level considerations will work as variables. Needless to say, it is true that some in the military are persistently demanding--as the 7-Day Camping Team report did--that Hanahoe officers be removed. Their point is that they had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past in promotions and assignments, and that as such, they are negative elements damaging solidarity of the military and, therefore, should be rooted out. Otherwise, it is impossible to hope for the development and reform of the military, they contend. Their contention, however, became less persuasive as time passed over the past year, according to analysts. In the process of military reform, the removal of Hanahoe did not produce an idealistic picture as anticipated. To make it worse, the sparks began flying in an undesirable direction. Rumors widely circulating have it that posts vacated by Hanahoe officers were filled by people having personal school, regional, or service ties with the leadership formed after the start of the new government, causing discontent and distrust in the military. In other words, factionalism and flattery are widespread in the military in the wake of such display of favoritism, even to the extent of creating a climate filled with nostalgia for the past. The following is a comment by Lieutenant Colonel "K", a non-Hanahoe officer working in an educational center which had been a place for about-to-retire officers before becoming a "place of exile" for Hanahoe officers: "It is understandable that under the new government, those who had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past were demoted from their posts for the sake of balance with other officers. However, I cannot understand why they had to be reassigned to an educational center. They are the people who were telling us that education is the most important thing; it is clearly contradictory that they send them to an educational center now. How could an education center could be a place of exile? When they saw the announced promotions in the periodic fall changes last year, some of which could have been totally unthinkable in the past, I heard many say that `the old days were still better.' Speaking of colleagues in my unit, they had first disapproved of Hanahoe officers but, after months now, those who are sympathetic with them for their capabilities and their attitudes are rapidly increasing in number." Officers maintain that this sort of sentiment in the minds of non-Hanahoe officers is fueling dissatisfaction with the present Army leadership. Some of them, along with Hanahoe officers, unhesitatingly complain that "the personnel changes last year were, in a nutshell, reassignments and promotions to fill Hanahoe-vacated posts with cronies of the military leadership." According to them, "the military leadership is taking advantage of the vacuum and, under the pretext of reform, is preoccupied with expanding its own influence." They contend that friction, factionalism and the feelings of helplessness are spreading in the military and that there is an urgent need to correct the situation. What they say is increasing its persuasion. Chongwadae announced in a self-appraisal in February that the army-level commanding officers (four-star generals) were all replaced in the first year of the Kim Yong-sam government. Also replaced in this period, it said, were 73% of the corps-level commanders (lieutenant generals) and 63% of the division-level commanders (major generals). The who replaced them in this process were generals of the "new power group" of the single-line influence represented by Kwon Yong-hae, former MND minister, and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, officers say. Some people are apprehensively concerned that since Yi Pyong-tae took over as MND minister, however, there have been signs of the single command channel breaking into a dual one. According to them, the military in the Sixth Republic days could maintain its balance under the watchful eyes of Hanahoe from the Fifth Republic and the 9.9 [9th Div., 9th Airborne Brig.] clique; nowadays, however, the 9.9 clique, along with those close to former MND minister Kwon and CGS Kim, formed the power group and this group is thoroughly blocking Hanahoe and other rival groups. Among the generals of the new power group, some are capable and well qualified, like Lieutenant General "K" and Major General "H" in the MND and Major General "L" in the Army Headquarters, while others are apparently ill-qualified for their posts. Those riding on their private relationships with the military leadership have become objects of distrust among junior officers. In extreme cases, some generals are bent on finding a pull with Chongwadae, National Assembly and other political personages, not to mention the military leadership. Rumors circulating in the military have it that some even went all the way to Koje Island at the beginning of the year to perform a formal New Year's bow to President Kim's father, Kim Hong-cho. In the military today, the following people represent about all promoted by Kwon Yong-hae in his minister days: 3d Army Commander Yun Yong-nam (MA 19th class) and MND Policy Office Director Cho Song-tae (MA 20th class) who had been both Kwon's policy planning officers in the MND when Kwon was vice minister; 9th Corps Deputy Commander Yim Chong-sop (MA 22d class; former chief of the personnel staff) and Infantry School Commandant Pyon Kil-nam (MA 22d class), who were respectively the commander of the 6th Division infantry regiment and the artillery regiment when Kwon was the commander of that division; and Field Division Commander O Nam-yong (MA 24th class), who was Kwon's aide. It is different with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin. A graduate of Kyongbok High School, which turned out many personages currently active in power circles, he served in all types of field and policy posts, including 1st Div. commander, 5th Army commander, MND Policy Office director, and ROK-U.S. CFC deputy commander. Thus, he is said to have developed much broader personal ties than Kwon. First, among those who graduated from the same high school after him are: Maj.Gen. Sin Yang-ho (MA 22d class) of the JCS, Hanahoe officer; Chon Kwan (MA 23d class) and Kim Hui-sang (MA 24th class), both commanders of major divisions in the metropolitan area; and Maj.Gen. Hong Sun-ho (ROTC 4th class), rear division commander. Lieutenant Colonel "H", currently assigned to a major post in the DSC as successor of a Hanahoe officer, is another person drawing attention inside and outside the military because he is another Kyongbok High graduate. A fairly large number of general officers who had been his colleagues in the service were promoted by CGS Kim and, for that reason, people often bear them a spite regardless of their abilities. To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the Capital Garrison Command, served as deputy chief of staff when CGS Kim was CFC deputy commander; Brigade Commander "K", promoted to the present post last year, was Kim's colleague when they were both section chiefs. Lt.Gen. Chang Chang-kyu (MA 21st class), commander of the Special Force Command, and Lt.Gen. Yi Yu-su (MA 20th class), corps commander, served as a division commander and a armored brigade commander when Kim was the corps commander. Maj.Gen. An Song-yong (MA 23d class) and Maj.Gen. Yi Chong-ok (MA 24th class), who both were reassigned as field division commanders on their promotion to major general last year, were also Kim's colleagues who served respectively as chief of staff and operations chief in those days. And Maj.Gen. Kim Sok-won (former Grade-A selectee), chief of the Army Headquarters operational staff division, and Maj.Gen. Yang In-mok (MA 22d class), chief of the munitions staff division, were a battalion commander and a regimental commander respectively when Kim was the division commander. Maj.Gen. Kang Chong-pil (MA 23d class), of a field army, was also a battalion commander in the same period. Maj.Gen. Chong Yong-chin (MA 23d class), a field division commander, and Brig.Gen. Yim Su-won, Army Headquarters personnel management superintendent, served as battalion commanders when CGS Kim was the commander of 62d Regiment of 20th Division. In addition, it is known that Brig.Gen. "H" of the communications force and Brig.Gen. "Y" of the engineer force served as communications corps commander and engineer brigade commanders respectively when Kim was the commander of 5th Corps. Over the fact that so many people who had personal relationships with CGS Kim through work were promoted to major posts, opinions are divided in the military. Some say that "for reform of the military in a transitional period, it is necessary for a leader to promote, and use effectively people whom he can trust absolutely." "At a time when every move of the leadership in the Army Headquarters at Kyeryongdae becomes known to the foremost front in a matter of a few hours, you cannot but pick a person you can trust if you are to choose from among people with little difference in abilities." Others argue, as strongly: "The true consummation of reform lies in the vitalization of the organization. But his conduct of personnel management focused on private relationships and deepening distrust among members of the organization. It is imperative that the military display its organizational power in perfect order at a time of emergency, and in this organization, complaints about personnel management directly lead to the weakening of combat power." These people also point out that "the reason the 12.12 [1979] coup by Hanahoe was possible was that at the time they did not operate by the dynamics and logic of the organization but were banded by private ties." Therefore, officers who see problems in the leanings of the military leadership and its domains say that they are concerned about what sort of expressions they will find in the coming changes. For now, they expect that thanks to the appointment of Yi Pyong-tae as MND minister, the leanings will be eased to considerable degrees. On the other hand, the 9.9 group--which, along with people close to CGS Kim, forms the new power group--includes these people: Kim Hyong-son (MA 19th class), deputy chief of staff; Lt.Gen. Yi Kyu-hwan (MA 21st class), field corps commander; So Kyong-sok (ROTC 3d class), chief of staff of the Education Command; Yi Yong-tae (ROTC 4th class), field division commander; and Maj.Gen. Chon Kwan (MA 23d class). They are people who served in the 9th Division, 9th Airborne Brigade in the past when former President No Tae-u was the commander of these units. Along with the Hanahoe clique of former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was once the commander of the 1st Division, 1st Airborne Brigade, they were known to be the mainstream of the military in the Sixth Republic. Unlike Hanahoe, the 9.9 group is generally in good shape under the new government. Explaining the reason, a general officer said: "Soon after the start of the new government, the military leadership, which had not yet formed its own influence, found it beyond its capacity to remove Hanahoe, the biggest influence in the country in the past decade. Based on that judgment, it apparently tried to remove Hanahoe's resistance by forming an alliance with the 9.9 group." Another general said that "the balance of power in the military is not determined by factors inside the military alone." "The new government," he continued, "needed the help of the 9.9 group, the second largest clique in the military, to establish its control over the military. It must have had the understanding of, and the coordinating with, former President No Tae-u about it." "It should also be noted," he added, "that in the latter half of the Sixth Republic, when Kim Yong-sam changed his coat to join the ruling party, a substantially large number of military leaders pledged loyalty to him, and that those leaders were mostly members of the 9.9 group." Of late, with the personnel changes approaching, rumors about private organizations named Mannahoe and Nanumhoe, and their relationships with the new power group, are circulating rather widely in the Army, straining the Army which had its measles in the Hanahoe namelist incident in April last year. This is not the first time that people hear rumors of third private organizations in the military. This time, however, they are drawing extraordinary attention because of the time factor. At the parliamentary hearings about the DSC at the time of the National Assembly inspection of government offices in October last year last year, Kim To-yun, then commander of the DSC, stated that "40-odd private organizations have been unveiled and disbanded since the start of the new government," making no mention of Mannahoe or Nanumhoe though. Rep. Kang Chang-song of the Democratic Party has been saying since early last year that "in addition to Hanahoe and Alcchahoe, there is Mannahoe in the military." According to informed military sources, Mannahoe is led by "L", a former CGS, and "K", a retired four-star general, who were estranged by Hanahoe immediately before the start of the Sixth Republic. It is composed, they say, by officers of the MA 15th through 29th classes, seven or eight of them from each class. According to rumors, this group was involved in the Hanahoe namelist incident last year; however, it is known that the official investigation into the incident failed to shed light on it. Some in the military insist that the current rumors of the existence of Mannahoe and its identity are considerably at variance with facts. According to them, all that "L" and "K"--who, while in the military, had a strong antipathy against Hanahoe--did was to hold gatherings, based on personal friendship, to press Hanahoe into dissolution, and nothing else. Others say that this private organization, which initially had little influence in the military, has grown into a powerful one as it occupied major posts taking advantage of the power vacuum immediately after the start of the new government. According to informed sources, those classified as Mannahoe members include such influential figures as "K", "J", "L", and "P" (all major generals) and "K" and "L" (both brigadier generals) and "P" and "K" (colonels). With respect to Nanumhoe, another private organization, there are also a great deal of "rumors" circulating lately. Nanumhoe is known to be composed of field-level officers of the MA 30th through 37th classes, specialist officers in personnel management in particular. The identity of this group reportedly was first unveiled in the military in about 1986. Nanumhoe was first formed as a social gathering of officers of the MA 30th and 31st classes in the Office of Personnel Management Superintendent, expanding its influence after Colonel "P" introduced them to General "L" and General "K", according to reports. This group maintains a close relationship with Mannahoe, say informed sources. Colonels "K" and "P" of the MA 30th class, another Colonel "K" of the same class, and Colonels "J", "P", and "L" of the MA 31st class are reported to be the leaders of Nanumhoe. Military sources say that inasmuch as the various rumors currently circulating about Mannahoe and Nanumhoe have the possibility of causing vacillations and tumult again in the military, authorities should look into them and make facts clear. They are concerned, they say, that there is the danger of the military being thrown into another Hanahoe-type vortex. Officers are unanimous in saying that the upcoming changes should be carried out in a fair and reasonable fashion, that at the same time, there should be objective light shed on the rumors that are currently circulating. Then, what sort of specific changes are anticipated? In the Army, changes are expected of two or three corps commanders and five or six division commanders whose replacements are approximately 18 months overdue. In particular, the coming change of To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the Capital Garrison Command, is drawing much attention. Some observers say that he will get his second assignment favorable for promotion to the four-star general rank, while others maintain that he has served only 1 year in his current post and therefore will be retained. Among corps commanders, Lt Gens O Yong-u and Kim Kil-pu (both MA 20th class) are viewed as certain to be replaced because they have served out their terms in the current posts. As for Kim Kil-pu, a Hanahoe officer, whether he will get a second assignment is a matter of great concern. At the same time, there is a prediction that Kim Hyong-son (MA 19th class), Army chief of staff, will also be replaced. They [O Yong-u and Kim Hyong-son] are likely to replace Chang Pyong-yong (MA 18th class), (?inspector general), and Chang Sok-nin (MA 18th class), commandant of the National Defense College, respectively, whose terms of office are to expire in April. The posts to be vacated by them are expected to be filled by an MA 21st class officer and a non-MA officer or an MA graduate respectively. It is seen as certain that there will be no MA 22d class officers promoted to corps commanders this time. Along with changes in the Army, it is also expected that there will be changes carried out in the Air Force and the Marine Corps. As for the Navy, it is known that there is no need for changes. In the Air Force, there will be a change to fill the post of director of the Intelligence Headquarters of the MND, which was vacated by Kim Hong-yol who succeeded Cho Kun-hae as Air Force CGS on the latter's death in the line of duty, plus changes involving offices thus affected. While the possibility of an Army general officer being appointed to that intelligence post cannot be ruled out, military sources expect that it will continue to be occupied by an Air Force officer, considering the factor of the Air Force morale after the CGS' death. In the Marine Corps, while Rear Adm. Yi Sang-mu (Naval Academy 17th class), 2d Division commander, is most likely to succeed Yim Chong-nin as commandant on the expiration of Yim's term of office, some see Rear Adm. Kwak Chae-song (Naval Academy 16th class) of the JCS office as a possible successor. Also, these changes in the Marine Corps will be followed by the transfers of Sin Won-pae, deputy commandant, and Chon To-pong, special aide for the chief of Naval Operations. The two rear admirals, Yi and Kwak, are both from the Pusan-Kyongnam [PK] region. So, when all the changes are completed, including those in the Marine Corps, the PK force and Kyongbok High graduates will form the mainstream of the top leadership of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under the Kim Yong-sam government, pushing aside the TK [Taegu-Kyongbuk] force, the remnant of the Sixth Republic, completely.
