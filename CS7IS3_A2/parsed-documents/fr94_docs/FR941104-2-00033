Memorandum Opinion, Order, Authorization & Certification Adopted: October 4, 1994 Released: October 5, 1994 By the Chief, International Facilities Division: 1. The Commission has under consideration the above-captioned applications filed by WilTel International, Inc. (``WilTel''), MCI Telecommunications Corporation (``MCI''), LDDS Communications, Inc. (``LDDS'') , Sprint Communications Company L.P. (``Sprint''), and IDB WorldCom Services, Inc. (``IDB'') requesting authority pursuant to Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to establish channels of communication between the United States and Cuba for the provision of direct services. The applications were placed on the Commission's public notice. AT&T filed petitions to deny against all of the applications. For the reasons stated below, we grant the applications. Background 2. WilTel requests authority to acquire by lease from Comsat and operate 120 64-kbps digital satellite voice-grade circuits, and up to two satellite video transmission circuits on an occasional use basis, provided via the INTELSAT Atlantic Ocean Region (AOR) satellite at 335 â—‹ E.L., for the provision of international message telephone service (``IMTS'') and other switched services 1 and for international private line service between the United States and Cuba. In an amendment to its application, WilTel also requests the flexibility to use either the INTELSAT and/or an Intersputnik satellite. WilTel states the proposed satellite facilities will be located between an appropriately authorized U.S. international fixed-satellite earth station and the appropriate satellite. 2 1 These services include facsimile, data and video transmission services. 2 WilTel also requests authority to provide service to Cuba via the fiber optic undersea cable, CUBUS&hyph;1, that has been proposed in the application for a cable landing license of WilTel Undersea Cable, Inc., FCC File No. SCL&hyph;94&hyph;002. Because this cable landing license has yet to be granted, we will defer acting on WilTel's request to use these facilities until such time that we are assured the cable facilities will be available for WilTel's use.
