Vice Defense Minister Chong Chun-ho will visit Manila from May 23-27 and sign the memorandum on May 24 with Filipino Undersecretary for Defense Feliciano Gacis, the officials said. The agreement is the first of its kind that Seoul has signed with a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, here on the first leg of his Southeast Asian tour, proposed that South Korea and the Philippines establish a "special partnership" to bolster civilian links in the economic and social sectors as well. South Korea already sold 12 naval patrol boats to the Philippines in May last year at a cut-rate 100 U.S. dollars apiece, paving the way for talks on overall defense industry cooperation, the officials said. According to the memorandum, the two countries will form a defense industry cooperation committee which will meet once a year alternately in each other's capital. Details of the date and place for the upcoming meeting will be decided at next week's vice-ministerial talks. The majority of the military equipment that South Korea can hand over to the Philippines is of U.S. origin, and Seoul must therefore obtain Washington's approval before this materiel can be transferred to manila, officials explained. The equipment would include F5-A jet fighters and tanks as well as munitions, they said.
