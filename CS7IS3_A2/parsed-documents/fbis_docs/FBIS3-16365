He said that a criticial situation has arisen as regards financing the Armed Forces. Thus, in January of this year, the Defense Ministry received only 63 percent of the planned appropriations. Pavel Grachev stated that if in the very near future the situation does not improve there cannot be any question of any reforming of the Army or of maintaining its high combat effectiveness. He said that this year the Army would in real terms be cut by 200,000 men instead of the scheduled 400,000. The reason for this is that it is more expensive to discharge an officer than to keep him -- each officer being discharged needs to be simultaneously paid 20 monthly wages. This year purchases of armaments will be considerably reduced. This could have a deplorable effect on the defense industry enterprises and the development of new military technologies. Pavel Grachev strongly criticized the way trade in Russian arms is being conducted: He believes that opportunities to earn billions of rubles are being missed. The journalists also inquired how the Army would react to a possible increase in social tension in the country. Grachev said that the armed forces are outside politics, but would not permit a civil war.
