FR941116-0-00050 FR941116-0-00011 I. Introduction This proceeding is a companion to Order No. 561. In Order No. 561, the Commission established an indexing methodology, which would establish ceilings on oil pipeline rates, to be used by oil pipelines as the generally applicable and simplified ratemaking methodology for oil pipelines on or after January 1, 1995. The Commission provided the opportunity for oil pipelines to seek an exception to indexing through a cost-of-service filing if the pipeline could show that, under indexing, it would substantially underrecover prudent costs. Further, the Commission provided that rates for new services could be established either through settlement or by use of a cost-of-service methodology. 2 2 18 CFR 342.2. In Docket No. RM94&hyph;1&hyph;000, Market-Based Ratemaking for Oil Pipelines, the Commission elicited comments on its proposal to permit oil pipelines to seek market-based rates and the appropriate standards for making a determination that a pipeline lacks significant market power. This matter is the subject of a Final Rule in Docket No. RM94&hyph;1&hyph;000, issued contemporaneously. In Order No. 561, the Commission recognized that cost-of-service rate filing information would be necessary for oil pipelines to justify seeking rate increases under the cost-of-service alternative, should they choose to use this methodology, and for interested parties to decide whether to challenge proposed cost-of-service rates. The Commission also recognized that Form No. 6 might need to be revised to enable review of the effectiveness of the index in tracking industry-wide cost changes and for interested parties to decide whether to challenge indexed rates. The present rule adopts regulations specifying the information that must accompany oil pipelines' cost-of-service rate filings and requested changes in depreciation rates, and modifies and streamlines Form No. 6. II. Public Reporting Requirement The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for the collections of information under the final rule will be reduced for Form No. 6 by approximately seven percent and will, in effect, remain unchanged for rate filings, since the Commission is here codifying the information to be provided which the Commission's staff in the past has requested from oil pipelines that have made cost-of-service rate filings. The information will be collected on Form No. 6, ``Annual Report of Oil Pipeline Companies'' and FERC&hyph;550, ``Oil Pipeline Rates: Tariff Filings.'' 3 These estimates include the time for reviewing instructions, researching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The current annual reporting burden associated with these information collection requirements is as follows: 3 FERC&hyph;550 is the designation covering oil pipeline tariff filings made to the Commission. Form No. 6: 22,200 hours, 148 responses, and 148 respondents; and FERC&hyph;550: 5,350 hours, 535 responses, and 140 respondents. The final rule will reduce the existing reporting burden associated with Form No. 6 by an estimated 1,628 hours annually, or an average of 11 hours per response based on an estimated 148 responses. This estimate includes the addition of two new schedules, the elimination of several schedules, and increasing the reporting thresholds for which oil pipelines must analyze and report certain data. Comments regarding these burden estimates or any other aspect of these collections of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden, can be sent to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208&hyph;1415]; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB (Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), FAX: (202) 395&hyph;5167. III. Background On October 22, 1993, the Commission issued a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) concerning the information to be included by an oil pipeline in a cost-of-service rate filing, and on potential changes to Form No. 6. 4 In the NOI, the Commission invited comment on what action would be appropriate to develop a final rule with respect to cost-of-service rate filings, whether and to what extent its Form No. 6 should be revised in light of Order No. 561, and whether and to what extent it should establish additional requirements with respect to an oil pipeline's depreciation studies. 4 Cost-of-Service Filing and Reporting Requirements for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Inquiry, 58 FR 58817 (November 4, 1993), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. Notices ¶ 35,528 (October 22, 1993). On July 28, 1994, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR). 5 In the NOPR, the Commission proposed that oil pipelines seeking cost-of-service rates would be required to file specific data conforming to the Order No. 154&hyph;B methodology. 6 The Commission also proposed to revise and streamline Form No. 6, and proposed that Form No. 6 data would be filed on an electronic medium. Finally, the Commission proposed certain rules for oil pipelines performing depreciation studies. The changes were proposed to be made effective January 1, 1995. 7 5 Cost-of-Service Filing and Reporting Requirements for Oil Pipelines, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 59 FR 40493 (August 9, 1994), IV FERC Stats. & Regs. Proposed Regulations ¶ 32,509 (July 28, 1994). 6 Opinion No. 154&hyph;B methodology is derived from the Commission's opinions in Williams Pipe Line Company, Opinion No. 154&hyph;B, 31 FERC ¶␣61,377 (1985), on rehearing, Opinion No. 154&hyph;C, Williams Pipeline Company, 33 FERC ¶ 61,327 (1985); and ARCO Pipe Line Company, Opinion No. 351, 52 FERC ¶ 61,055 (1990), on rehearing, Opinion No. 351&hyph;A, ARCO Pipe Line Company, 53 FERC ¶ 61,398 (1990). 7 Electronic reporting of Form No. 6 was proposed to commence with the reporting year 1995 reports, due on or before March 31, 1996. The Commission received fourteen sets of comments. 8 After analyzing those comments as discussed below, the Commission is adopting the rules proposed in the NOPR, except for the electronic reporting requirement for Form No. 6, with minor modifications and with clarifying statements. Although the Commission has procured the software development tool, the electronic version of the Form No. 6 application has not yet been developed. Therefore, the Commission is deferring the electronic reporting requirement at this time, pending development and testing of the necessary electronic version of the Form No. 6 application. Once that process is complete, the Commission intends to issue a final rule providing for the electronic filing of Form No. 6. 8 A list of commenters is contained in Appendix A to this order. IV. Cost-of-Service Filing Requirements The Commission is adding a new Part 346 to its regulations that sets forth the threshold filing requirements for oil pipelines seeking to establish initial rates on a cost-of-service basis, or to pursue a cost-of-service alternative to indexing as a means of establishing just and reasonable rates. The Commission is also amending sections 342.2 and 342.4 to reflect the addition of Part 346.
