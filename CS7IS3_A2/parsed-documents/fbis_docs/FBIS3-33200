The 18 EZLN representatives arrived in three groups from the Lacandona Jungle, where the guerrillas have settled since the war began on 1 January, in vehicles supplied by the International Red Cross. "Subcommander Marcos," whose identity is unknown, arrived in the first group, made up of eight delegates, accompanied by Peace Commissioner Camacho Solis and Samuel Ruiz, bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas and mediator in the conflict. The group, which was greeted with applause and shouts from people who gathered at the main plaza in San Cristobal, arrived from the nearby town of San Andres Laraizal, 40 km west of San Cristobal. A second group made up of seven rebels arrived from Ocosingo, some 90 km east of San Cristobal, and a third group, made up of three guerrillas, arrived shortly after noontime (local time) from Las Margaritas, 100 km south of San Cristobal. The EZLN delegates gathered at the San Cristobal Cathedral, site of the peace talks scheduled to begin at 1100 (1700 GMT) on Monday [21 February]. "We will not turn in our weapons, definitely not. We have learned from other countries where rebels disarmed and then were repressed and exploited again," one of the rebels who arrived from Las Margaritas said. All the delegates, including "Marcos," wore EZLN uniforms and had their faces covered with ski masks or scarves. None carried weapons. The cathedral in San Cristobal de las Casas is protected by three "security cordons," made up of members of the International Red Cross, nongovernment human rights organizations, and unarmed policemen.
