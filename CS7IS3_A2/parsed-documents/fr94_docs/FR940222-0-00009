FR940222-0-00009 FR940222-0-00003 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 92&hyph;CE&hyph;57&hyph;AD; Amdt 39&hyph;8835; AD 94&hyph;04&hyph;15] Airworthiness Directives: Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD) that applies to certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation (Twin Commander) Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 airplanes. This action requires inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) for interference, fretting, or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange at Wing Station (WS) 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing any cracked spar cap. Reports of two of the affected airplanes have cracked spar caps at WS 96 prompted this action. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent failure of the wing structure caused by a cracked spar cap at WS 96. DATES: Effective April 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain documents listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 12, 1994. ADDRESSES: Service information that applies to this AD may be obtained from the Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation, 19003 59th Drive, NE., Arlington, Washington 98223. This information may also be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Mike Pasion, Aerospace Engineer, FAA Northwest Mountain Region, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 277&hyph;2594; facsimile (206) 227&hyph;1181. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Twin Commander Models 500, 560A, 560E, 680, 680E, and 720 airplanes was published in the Federal Register on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34950). The action proposed to require inspecting the spar cap for interference, fretting, or corrosion between the firewall flange and spar cap flange at WS 96, and clearing any interference, repairing any fretting or corrosion damage, and replacing any cracked spar cap. The proposed inspection and repair, if applicable, would be accomplished in accordance with Twin Commander SB No. 212, dated November 3, 1992. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the nine comments received. Seven commenters concur with the proposal as written. One commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), states that the proposal should require an eddy current inspection of the spar cap. The CAA questions whether fretting and corrosion are the sole contributors to fatigue damage to WS 96, or if these merely aggravate what is already a fatigue-sensitive location. The CAA goes on to state that, if a crack can start from a corrosion pit as small as 0.006 inches (as happened on a Swedish airplane), then there is a good chance that even a clean airplane will crack over time. Also, the CAA states that, if a fatigue crack has started at the base of a corrosion pit, the blending of the corrosion will smear over the crack and conceal it from the dye penetrant inspection (which is called for in the SB), and that an eddy current inspection is the only method for detection of this crack. The FAA does not concur. The proposal relates to fretting that may occur because interference between a firewall stiffener and the forward flange of the lower spar cap. It would require action for fatigue cracks found as a result of this interference and fretting. Fretting does have a synergistic relationship with corrosion and fatigue, and its existence greatly accelerates fatigue crack growth. The FAA has received no reports of fatigue cracks in the affected area that were not a direct result of fretting. Also, the spar cap at WS 96 is extremely difficult to inspect using eddy current methods because of other structures in the area interfering with placement of the eddy current probe. Dye penetrant inspections are used extensively in the aviation industry and have proved very reliable in detecting cracks. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.
