Saratov told Interfax in an interview Friday that the disagreement between Chubays and Moscow Mayor Yuriy Luzhkov had only a few more weeks to run. He said that after this a new stage would begin and the argument would no longer be relevant. The essence of the conflict between Chubays and Luzhkov is the latter's demand to carry out a privatization campaign in the city in line with a special program which is at odds with nationwide legislation. This would help the Moscow authorities to increase the price of real estate. Chubays believes Moscow facilities should be privatized in line with the nationwide scheme without any special conditions. Speaking at a news conference in Moscow Friday, Boris Yeltsin said that as the two sides could not agree, he had decided that privatization in Moscow should proceed according to a special program which would not be applied to other areas of the country.
