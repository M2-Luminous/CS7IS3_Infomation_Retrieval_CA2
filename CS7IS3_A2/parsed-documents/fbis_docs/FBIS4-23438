Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer said at a news conference in Pretoria that no powers had yet been assigned to provinces. This had been underlined by President Nelson Mandela's issuing a Government Gazette that temporarily assigned all government functions to central government ministries. Another obstacle was that elections for local governments would take place only in a year's time. Mr. Meyer said that the process of assigning powers to the provinces would take place within a matter of days and that he would meet provincial executive committee members on Monday. He would meet provincial premiers on Thursday. However, he said the question of financial transfers to provincial government still had to be ironed out.
