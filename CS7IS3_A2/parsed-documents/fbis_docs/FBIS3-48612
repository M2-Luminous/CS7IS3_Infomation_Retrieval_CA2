He said there were discussions about turning ASEAN into a center for cooperation with organizations in other regions. A meeting on this will be held in Bangkok from 3 to 4 February. According to Surin, Malaysia concurred that ASEAN should take the lead in developing capital for the gas and oil sector and spread this capital to other regions, particularly to Indian ocean countries. Surin said there has been considerable progress in Thai-Malaysian relations, including in the economic triangle project. Regarding the private sector's proposal to open the Thai-Malaysian border around the clock, Surin said Malaysia is interested in the proposal and is considering it. The question is whether the Thai side, particularly the Thai Government sector, is ready and whether there are enough goods to pass the border to justify a 24-hour opening. Surin said APEC was also discussed with Malaysian officials. An APEC meeting will be held in Jakarta in May.
