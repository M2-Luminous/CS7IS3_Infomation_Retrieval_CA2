The "Circular" requires that units at and above regimental level in the whole army must incorporate all receipts and payments of outlays in the annual budget according to regulations, and must not practice "external circulation." When compiling an annual budget, they should draw up an annual budget plan for outlays on the basis of actual needs and financial capacity, and through earnest study and adequate proof. The compilation of a budget for different outlay items for the same unit or within a department shall be under the direct administration of financial departments. After the budget is examined by the party committee, it shall be reported to the higher authorities for approval. The compilation of a budget must not include a multitude of outlay items. Once a budget is approved, it shall have legal effect and no unit or department is permitted to alter it without authorization. After an annual budget is issued to the lower levels, there will be no more examination or approval of fragmentary outlay items. It is necessary to strictly implement a budget control responsibility system; all outlays earmarked for the budget control contractual responsibility system must be channeled to their recipients. It is necessary to bring expenditures on capital construction outlays under control; all capital construction projects must be incorporated into the plan and placed under centralized control. No unit or department is permitted to alter a construction project without authorization or carry out construction of a project in excess of approved standards or area. If the source of funds for a construction project to be financed by a unit or department from funds raised by itself is improper, it must not be reported to the higher authorities and must not be treated as a project; in such a case, even though a capital construction plan has been issued to the lower levels, construction of the project is not permitted to start. The "Circular" stipulates that extra outlays kept by units and departments at all levels in reserve for emergency use shall be placed under centralized control by party committees and under the direct administration of logistic financial departments. The use of such extra outlays shall be under a complete rationing system; their use shall be proposed by relevant departments and, after examination and approval by financial departments, shall be reported to chiefs in charge for approval, provided the amount of such extra outlays do not exceed their prescribed standards (norms). The "Circular" stresses: It is necessary for organs and, in particular, leading cadres at all levels to take the lead in handling jobs according to budget. They are not permitted to approve, earmark, or answer questions on outlays as they please. Auditing departments must audit and supervise budgets for all departments at all levels and their implementation, and must sternly deal with those who violate the regulations on budget control.
