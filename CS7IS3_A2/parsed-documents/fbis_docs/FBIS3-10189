During his visit to Germany, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has been trying to design a more dynamic position for Brazilian diplomacy and counter the self-restraint our country has been imposing on its foreign presence. High-level meetings have been scheduled for April when British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd visits Brasilia, and the Brazilian foreign minister will visit France at the invitation of his counterpart, Alain Juppe. Amorim will address the Senate Foreign Relations Committee then. These bilateral meetings have not been held for some years. As just an example of the poor period being experienced by Brazilian diplomacy, the French foreign minister's visit to Brazil has been postponed four consecutive times during the past few years. The positive results of the foreign minister's visit to Germany foreshadow a new period. In Bonn on 25 February, the Brazilian foreign minister himself announced these two important meetings with the British and French foreign ministers to O ESTADO DO SAO PAULO. Amorim said: "If Brazil hopes to play a leading role in the international arena, it cannot give up these talks." The Brazilian foreign minister accused former President Fernando Collor of destroying our country's foreign policy and not replacing it. The Brazilian foreign minister admitted that recently our country has been placing less emphasis than it should on its bilateral relations. This explains the new effort toward France, the United Kingdom, and Germany, Brazil's three principal European partners, which represents a priority in Itamaraty's strategy. The effort to further approach these EC countries is obviously aimed at attracting technology and investments. Amorim emphasized: "To this end, however, it is necessary to hold political talks." In the case of Germany, the Brazilian foreign minister explained: "The tripartite agreement's ratification was essential because diplomacy and development must work together." Concerning specific projects, the minister confirmed the German interest in Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System]. The Germans are interested in installing the air traffic control system in the Amazon region. The French and Americans also have expressed interest in this project. The Brazilian Government's decision on the submitted proposals must be made by late April.
