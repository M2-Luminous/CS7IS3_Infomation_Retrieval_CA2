The third item on the agenda of the weekly ministerial meeting was on the assessment of the operation of restoring peace and security and was presented by the minister of territorial administration. Regarding the Bujumbura mayorship, he noted that the recently conducted disarmament operation in the suburbs north of the Ntahangwa River restored a certain calm. It created conditions for the return of peace which can be seen in the return of the people to their homes, busy marketplaces, notably those of Kinama and Gasenyi, as well as the reopening of schools. The minister of territorial administration, however, indicated that some areas were still faced with overcrowding due to the problem of displaced people, and that with the outbreak of cholera the situation might worsen. The meeting called on the government to take swift measures in time to deal with the problem and also to convince the displaced people to reintegrate into their respective areas. [passage omitted]
