This is Shandong's first transregional agricultural economic organization with the nature of association voluntarily organized by Laiyang, Laixi, Changle, Shouguang, Yushu, suburban Taian, and Jinxiang counties and cities. It is learned that all of these seven counties and cities -- the executive members of this organization -- are the province's backbone bases to produce, process, and export agricultural products. The vegetable exported and processed by these counties and cities alone accounts for more than one third of the country's total. In addition, more than 50 enterprises and bases in Zhejinag, Henan, Liaoning, and two other provinces have joined this organization as ordinary members. This joint organization will certainly exert a tremendous influence on agricultural produce markets at home and abroad. Xiao Wanjun, deputy director of the Central Policy Research Center, and Wang Jiangong, vice governor of Shandong Province, made a special trip to the county to attend the inaugural meeting and make speeches. Wang Jiangong was invited to serve as honorary director of the organization. And the general office of the provincial government, the provincial agricultural commission, the provincial planning commission, the provincial foreign economic relations and trade commission, and 10 other units were invited to be advisers of the organization. The people have generally regarded the establishment of this organization as a new move of Shandong and even China in developing the production, processing, and marketing of agricultural products on an even wider scale and at an even higher level. The people have also regarded it as an essential trend of development of the rural market economy. (Mu Yutai), secretary of the Laiyang City Party Committee, initiator of this joint organization, and executive chairman of the first committee of this organization, said: In line with the principle of voluntary cooperation, by jointly handling affairs, conducting economic consultation, and issuing journals of the organization, this organization will commonly analyze the agricultural produce markets at home and abroad and circulate the notice on the amount, variety, and quotas of the production, processing, and marketing of respective agricultural products and on the distribution of agricultural products on markets. This organization will also conduct the exchanges of sciences, technologies, funds, professionals, and management experiences and will subject itself to the guidance and supervision by the government in order to avoid overlapping construction and overlapping import of agricultural products and the unlawful competitions between different areas. This organization will also go beyond the limits of administrative divisions to help optimize the distribution of natural resources, readjust the structure of agricultural products, and push the province's agricultural and sideline products to the domestic and international markets in an all-round manner.
