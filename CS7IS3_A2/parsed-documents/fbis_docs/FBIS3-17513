This was the comment given by Gevork Poghosyan, Director of the Sociological Research Center, National Academy of Sciences, to results of the recent poll, carried out by his service. He told SNARK there was a time when President was inferior by his rating to the Vice President Gagik Arutunyan, and to the former Foreign Minister Raffi Govhanesyan. But now, no politician in Armenia can match with his popularity. "The second, and far behind, was the former Communist Leader of Armenia Karen Demirchyan, said the sociologist. According to the poll results, 9 percent of the Yerevan citizens trust the President completely, 31 percent partially, and 52 percent do not at all. Such a rating may be considered as normal, with account of drastic situation in Armenia", told Poghosyan. In his opinion, if Levon Ter-Petrosyan nominated himself as a candidate for the new presidential elections, he would have won.
