Suspicious as I am, I recalled the wisdom of the popular proverb: "explanation not sought, accusation obvious." In case there were any doubts, I decided to investigate the matter. [passage omitted] We are talking about an austere number: 2,000 members carrying firearms of various types and calibers, ranging from pistols to military grenades. In its report, the Government Secretariat stresses that the weaponry "is new for the most part." The warring group has been training for at least a year. Such an army, and its respective "training," requires something more than ideology and animosity. In brief, could the drug traffic, present in the seasoning of all stews in which major interests are at stake, be involved in the Chiapas affair? It would be valid to agree that this state is considered a third-rate producing zone, because the soil on the border is less suitable for such activity than that in the north. Nevertheless, in view of this fact, it should also be noted that, on the one hand, a blatant increase in poppy crops has been observed in the border zone between Chiapas and Guatemala; and, on the other, the controls established to reduce the drug trafficking to the United States has prompted a search for new routes. In other words, the fact that Chiapas is not important as a producer does not detract from the drug traffickers' interest in it as a preferred corridor for drug movement. We should not forget that "El Chapo" Guzman was captured in Guatemala. The reporter, Jesus Sanchez, writing in EL FINANCIERO on the subject, remarks: "The official reports show concern over the formation of the so-called Chiapas triangle, which, by May 1993, was being viewed from the following standpoint: It could be concluded that, owing to conditions of extreme poverty and serious sociopolitical conflicts, a corridor may have been established that would create an empty zone, to be converted into a smokescreen concealing `narco'-terrorist activities." We can find a similar situation in Peru, with the SL [Shining Path] group, which is offering protection for the growing and movement of drugs. The data proving the zone's importance as a transit point are interesting. During 1992, 152 aircraft presumably carrying drugs were detected: a figure 250 percent higher than the number of planes discovered in 1991. All of this discounts the increase in drug drops made using short flights. Similarly, of the total number of flights leaving South America with illicit cargo, 43 percent have the Central American isthmus as their destination. From there, a considerable number reach Guatemala, and their cargo is transferred by land to Chiapas. This is quite obvious in the trafficking of opiates, the seizures of which last year accounted for 97 percent of the total confiscated throughout the entire country. Nor should we underestimate the requirements of money laundering and the possibilities of diverting the attention of the Army and the other authorities responsible for combating the drug traffic, which might well be discharging this function in other locations. This is nothing new. Perhaps the most enlightening experience in this respect is reflected in the link between the Colombian guerrillas and drug traffickers. After all, behind harsh Mexico lies the Mexico of injustice and infamy. Nevertheless, let us hope that this obvious truth does not cause us to forget other factors which, albeit secondary, cannot fail to disturb and aggravate the situation. The drug traffic is, unquestionably, one of them.
