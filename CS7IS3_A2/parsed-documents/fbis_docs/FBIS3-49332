The DS main board said Sunday evening [9 January] it would take concrete decisions only if a national unity government was being formed. The results achieved at the early parliamentary elections in Serbia were also discussed and the list of deputies to the parliament adopted. The election campaign was conducted by Zoran Djindjic, the president of the DS Executive Committee and head of all DS lists. The DS main board discussed the confidence to the party's president, Dragoljub Micunovic, but the vote was put off until January 15, due to a lack of quorum. The vote on confidence to the president of the DS was demanded by 52 municipal committees, out of a total of 90. At early parliamentary elections, the DS increased the number of seats compared to last year's parliamentary elections, when it won only 7 seats. This year it won 29 seats, to become the fourth strongest party in the 250-seat parliament. The SPS won most seats -- 123, but it was below the absolute majority line.
