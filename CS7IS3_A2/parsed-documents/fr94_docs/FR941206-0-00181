FR941206-0-00181 FR941206-0-00019 (2) The VO concentration at the point of waste origination for a hazardous waste shall be determined in accordance with the procedures specified in 40 CFR 265.1084(a)(2) through (a)(6) of this chapter. (b) Waste determination procedures for treated hazardous waste. (1) An owner or operator shall perform the applicable waste determinations for each treated hazardous waste placed in waste management units exempted under the provisions of §264.1082(c)(2) of this subpart from using air emission controls in accordance with standards specified in §264.1084 through §264.1087 of this subpart, as applicable to the waste management unit. (2) The waste determination for a treated hazardous waste shall be performed in accordance with the procedures specified in 40 CFR 265.1084(b)(2) through (b)(10), as applicable to the treated hazardous waste. (c) Procedure to determine the maximum organic vapor pressure of a hazardous waste in a tank. (1) An owner or operator shall determine the maximum organic vapor pressure for each hazardous waste placed in tanks using air emission controls in accordance with standards specified in §264.1084(c) of this subpart. (2) The maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste shall be determined in accordance with the procedures specified in 40 CFR 265.1084(c)(2) through (c)(4). §264.1084 Standards: Tanks. (a) This section applies to owners and operators of tanks subject to this subpart into which any hazardous waste is placed except for the following tanks: (1) A tank in which all hazardous waste entering the tank meets the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart; or (2) A tank used for biological treatment of hazardous waste in accordance with the requirements of §264.1082(c)(2)(iv) of this subpart. (b) The owner or operator shall place the hazardous waste into one of the following tanks: (1) A tank equipped with a cover (e.g., a fixed roof) that is vented through a closed-vent system to a control device in accordance with the requirements specified in paragraph (d) of this section; (2) A tank equipped with a fixed roof and internal floating roof in accordance with the requirements of §264.1091 of this subpart; (3) A tank equipped with an external floating roof in accordance with the requirements of §264.1091 of this subpart; or (4) A pressure tank that is designed to operate as a closed system such that the tank operates with no detectable organic emissions at all times that hazardous waste is in the tank except as provided for in paragraph (g) of this section. (c) As an alternative to complying with paragraph (b) of this section, an owner or operator may place hazardous waste in a tank equipped with a cover (e.g., a fixed roof) meeting the requirements specified in paragraph (d)(1) of this section when the hazardous waste is determined to meet all of the following conditions: (1) The hazardous waste is neither mixed, stirred, agitated, nor circulated within the tank by the owner or operator using a process that results in splashing, frothing, or visible turbulent flow on the waste surface during normal process operations; (2) The hazardous waste in the tank is not heated by the owner or operator except during conditions requiring that the waste be heated to prevent the waste from freezing or to maintain adequate waste flow conditions for continuing normal process operations; (3) The hazardous waste in the tank is not treated by the owner or operator using a waste stabilization process or a process that produces an exothermic reaction; and (4) The maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste in the tank as determined using the procedure specified in §264.1083(c) of this subpart is less than the following applicable value: (i) If the tank design capacity is equal to or greater than 151 m 3 , then the maximum organic vapor pressure shall be less than 5.2 kPa; (ii) If the tank design capacity is equal to or greater than 75 m 3 but less than 151 m 3 , then the maximum organic vapor pressure shall be less than 27.6 kPa; or (iii) If the tank design capacity is less than 75 m 3 , then the maximum organic vapor pressure shall be less than 76.6 kPa. (d) To comply with paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the owner or operator shall design, install, operate, and maintain a cover that vents the organic vapors emitted from hazardous waste in the tank through a closed-vent system connected to a control device. (1) The cover shall be designed and operated to meet the following requirements: (i) The cover and all cover openings (e.g., access hatches, sampling ports, and gauge wells) shall be designed to operate with no detectable organic emissions when all cover openings are secured in a closed, sealed position. (ii) Each cover opening shall be secured in a closed, sealed position (e.g., covered by a gasketed lid or cap) at all times that hazardous waste is in the tank except as provided for in paragraph (f) of this section. (2) The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of §264.1087 of this subpart. (e) The owner and operator shall install, operate, and maintain enclosed pipes or other closed-systems, EPA considers a drain system that meets the requirements of 40 CFR 61.346(a)(1) or 40 CFR 61.346(b)(1) through (b)(3) to be a ``closed systems'', to: (1) Transfer all hazardous waste to the tank from another tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to this subpart except for those hazardous wastes that meet the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart; and (2) Transfer all hazardous waste from the tank to another tank, surface impoundment, or container subject to this subpart except for those hazardous wastes that meet the conditions specified in §264.1082(c) of this subpart.
