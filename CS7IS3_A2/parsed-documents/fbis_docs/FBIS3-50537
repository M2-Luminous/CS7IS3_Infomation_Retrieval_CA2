Visibly satisfied, Martinez evaluated the parliamentary meeting. [Martinez] I believe I can tell you with conviction that the expectations of the session were met. I believe we produced what we wanted and what is fundamental: a collective reflection of all deputies regarding important and difficult issues. Given the level of the deputies' participation, obviously the speeches by the commander in chief, the amount of information and ideas expressed during the meeting--and even the agreement to hold a special period of sessions to continue the discussion--I believe that the Cuban parliament has demonstrated a formidable lesson of democracy. This stems from the fact that generally these kinds of measures are taken suddenly, clandestinely in some countries, and are not discussed in parliament or later returned to parliament for further discussion, as it will take place. [Betancourt] I asked prominent economist Osvaldo Martinez what he thinks of the statements by many deputies who are not economists. [Martinez] I think that this reveals our progression regarding what we could call our people's economic culture. It is a difficult and complicated matter that obviously has many technical components. I believe, however, that our deputies, as part of our people, have such a keen political sense and a sense of defense of the revolution and its most vital interest that this helps them extraordinarily; in addition, I believe the deputies have seriously prepared for this period of sessions and studied the state of the country's internal finances. I also believe that I was pleasantly surprised by the level of understanding and manipulation of the issues broached during the debates. [Betancourt] When certain deputies mentioned the implementation of such measures as price increases, policies of gradual taxation, the elimination or reduction of subsidies to companies that do not yield profits as ways to resolve this internal financial imbalance, may someone think these measures respond, for instance, to IMF recipes? [Martinez] These measures in no way respond to IMF principles. I believe that during the discussion a principle that was stressed throughout was that no one will be left unsupported. No honest Cuban must be afraid of any measure that may be implemented. I think these would be logical measures that would be implemented due to the pressing need to achieve a balance in internal finances as an important step to improve our economy. Such measures would be aimed at the supreme objective of saving the revolution and overcoming the special period; that is why I believe that these measures can in no way be considered--neither from their discussion methods or contents --IMF-type measures. [Betancourt] I pretty much know the answer to my next question. What perspectives.... [pauses] What do you expect for the 36th year of the revolution, which is about to start? [Martinez] I expect a year of work, a year that will also be difficult in economic terms. It will require a great working and capacity of sacrifice from our people. I strongly believe, however, that the worst part is now over. I believe we can reasonably argue that the future will be better. We are beginning 1994 not only with a greater ?apacity to resist but also with more consolidated accomplishments and better economic perspectives than those we had at the outset of 1993.
