That's a big if. Last week the country's top bankers announced four anti-inflation measures, including nipping runaway investment in fixed assets. However, speculative moves have again pushed up the prices of raw materials beyond their real value. Steel prices, for instance, have risen to around 4,000 yuan ($459.80) per ton from below 3,000 yuan ($344.83) per ton at the end of last year. The prices of crude oil and some other major products are also expected to rise soon. The State has budgeted 1.3 trillion yuan ($149.4 billion) for investment in fixed assets this year, and the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has vowed to prevent any violation of the ceiling. But others speculate that at least 1.5 trillion yuan ($172.4 billion) will actually be forked out. Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji warns that such speculation could well threaten the stability of prices. In January, in fact, inflation in 35 large cities exceeded expectations by rising to 23.3 per cent. The government has said it wants to contain inflation this year to 10 per cent compared with 13 percent last year. A senior Chinese economist who asked not to be named says two basic factors determine inflation. One is the scale of investment in fixed assets. Failure to restrain capital spending will lead to excessive growth in the money supply. The other factor is the prices of such basic goods as grain, cotton edible oil, meat and sugar. "The real threat of inflation does not come from the price hikes of the latter, because people's purchasing power will grow at the same pace," the economist said. Besides, the State has pledged to stabilize agricultural production this year to avert drastic price increases . "What unsettles me most is a possible ballooning of the money supply," he said. He said inflation may well surpass 10 per cent, but not to the point where the economy will collapse. "It will be an uphill battle to fight inflation this year, and we need deft direction of the financial ropes and of public psychology," he said. In some regions inflation has been pushed up by freewheeling price rises in defiance of State orders. Local governments have also winked at big wage increases to dilute public fears about devaluation. Reliable sources say that despite an impending rise in the price of crude oil, the price of oil products must be kept stable or even lowered to protect consumers, especially farmers. Higher prices for oil products would deal a hard blow to farmers, jeopardizing grain output. The State's major tools for curbing inflation include controlling wages, restraining borrowing from banks to offset budgetary deficits, and bolstering agricultural production.
