ITAR-TASS has learned this from a spokesman for the NATO headquarters in Brussels. In his words, if UN observers ask for military support before any new political decisions are made, then NATO aircraft will launch a necessary air strike without delays. NATO will do this in compliance with last year's Security Council resolution, for which Russia voted too, the NATO spokesman stressed.
