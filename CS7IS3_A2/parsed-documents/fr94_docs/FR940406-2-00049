FR940406-2-00049 FR940406-2-00027 [FRL&hyph;4858&hyph;3] Agency Information Collection Activities Under OMB Review AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: In compliance with the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ), this notice announces that the Information Collection Request (ICR) abstracted below has been forwarded to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and comment. The ICR describes the nature of the information collection and its expected cost and burden; where appropriate, it includes the actual data collection instrument. DATES: Comments must be submitted on or before May 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For further information, or to obtain a copy of this ICR, contact Sandy Farmer at 202&hyph;260&hyph;2740. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Office of Air and Radiation Title: New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for the Phosphate Fertilizer Industry (Subparts T, U, V, W, and X). (EPA ICR No. 1061.06; OMB No. 2060&hyph;0037). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved information collection. Abstract: Owners or operators of phosphate fertilizer plants must notify EPA or the delegated regulatory authority of construction, modification, startups, shutdowns, malfunctions, and dates and results of initial performance tests. Owners and operators must install, calibrate, and maintain monitoring devices to determine the mass flow of phosphate-bearing feed, and devices to measure and record continuously pressure drop across the scrubbers, and must keep records of the mass of phosphate bearing feed. This industry is not required to submit excess emission reports. EPA or the delegated authority reviews the records during routine inspections to ensure compliance with the standards. Burden Statement: The reporting requirements apply only to the initial performance tests, and since no new or reconstructed sources are expected to become subject to the standards in the next three years, there is no burden projected for reporting. The public recordkeeping burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 87.5 hours per recordkeeper annually. The estimated burden includes the time needed to review instructions, search existing data sources, gather the data needed and review the collection of information. Respondents: Owners or operators of phosphate fertilizer plants. Estimated No. of Respondents: 11. Estimated No. of Responses per Respondent: None. Estimated Total Annual Burden on Respondents: 963 hours for recordkeeping only. Frequency of Collection: Not applicable. Send comments regarding the burden estimate, or any other aspect of the information collection, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to: Ms. Sandy Farmer, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Information Policy Branch (2136), 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. and Mr. Chris Wolz, Office of Management and Budget, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, 725 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20503. Dated: March 31, 1994. Paul Lapsley, Director, Regulatory Management Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;8232 Filed 4&hyph;5&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
