FR940613-0-00072 FR940613-0-00015 The American Movers Conference believes that the load-through feature of the maxi-cube should be made optional. We do not agree. That language is included both in the statutory definition in 49 U.S.C. app. 2311(f)(2) and in the Appropriations Committee report. This feature is one of the primary reasons Congress declared maxi-cubes specialized equipment. Removing the load-through element from the definition would make these vehicles indistinguishable from truck-trailer combinations. The State of Connecticut asked if the maxi-cube vehicle will be designated as specialized equipment since it will be limited to the NN and reasonable access routes. Maxi-cube vehicles are by statute specialized equipment, and Federal regulations for such equipment apply only on the NN and reasonable access routes. This action concludes the FHWA rulemaking proceeding that was designated with the regulation identification number 2125&hyph;AC65. Beverage Semitrailers A rulemaking to designate as specialized equipment the 28-foot van-type, drop-frame beverage semitrailer when it is equipped with an upper coupler plate that extends in front of the semitrailer, has been underway since 1990. The last action on the subject was publication of an NPRM on June 25, 1990, at 55 FR 25850. The final rule was being prepared when the ISTEA was enacted. Since the rulemaking necessary to implement the ``LCV-freeze'' would, like the beverage semitrailer rule, amend 23 CFR part 658, the decision was made to include both in a single document. Since they amend the same existing regulation, combining them minimizes the number of separate changes made to an already complex regulatory document. The STAA, codified at 49 U.S.C. app. 2311 et seq. , established length and width standards for vehicles using the highways designated as the NN (appendix A to 23 CFR part 658 (1993)). The STAA prohibited any State from enforcing a length limit of less than 28 feet on a semitrailer or trailer operating in a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination on the NN (49 U.S.C. app. 2311 (a)). The STAA, under an equipment grandfather provision, also allows the use of 28.5-foot semitrailers and trailers in truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combinations if they were actually and lawfully operating on December 1, 1982, within a 65-foot overall length limit in any State. The statute prohibited any State from denying reasonable access to points of loading and unloading for a truck tractor pulling a single 28-foot (28.5-foot if grandfathered) semitrailer that generally operates as part of a truck tractor-semitrailer-trailer combination. In addition, the STAA gave the Secretary authority to exclude from measurement of trailer length and width, devices necessary for the safe and efficient operation of CMV's, provided length exclusive devices did not have, by design or use, the capability to carry cargo (49 U.S.C. app. 2311(h), 2316(b)). Questions involving permissible vehicle length and length exclusive devices are critical to a new design for 28-foot beverage semitrailers. As used in this proceeding, ``beverage'' means a liquid for drinking, including water. One new design places the kingpin under the nose of the trailer with a portion of the upper coupler plate extending beyond the front of the vehicle. Since these beverage semitrailers use an enclosed van-type, drop-frame design, mounting the kingpin in this manner allows the drop-frame portion of the semitrailer to be extended forward. The FHWA has issued several NOI of length and width exclusive devices. The most recent was published on March 13, 1987, at 52 FR 7834. That NOI recognized a number of length-exclusive design features, including (1) the pickup plate lip of the upper coupler, and (2) any non-load-carrying device which falls within the swing radius of the semitrailer (measured from the center line of the kingpin to the front corner of the semitrailer). As applied to the new design described above, these two provisions have proved difficult to administer and have caused confusion and misunderstanding between the FHWA and the industry. The June 25, 1990, NPRM proposed to designate as specialized equipment van-type, drop-frame beverage semitrailers. A 30-day comment period (through July 25, 1990) was provided. In addition to seeking general comments, the NPRM requested all interested parties to respond to four questions concerning these vehicles. The FHWA solicited comments on the following questions as well as other comments: 1. Should ``beverage trailer'' and ``beverage semitrailer'' be defined in the proposed regulation? 2. Is the proposed length limit for the upper coupler extension of the semitrailer clear? 3. Will the semitrailer, as configured, be as safe as one with the upper coupler plate positioned fully under the semitrailer? 4. Will the position of the center of the kingpin, not more than 28 feet from the rear of the semitrailer, produce offtracking characteristics that are significantly greater than those of conventional 28-foot semitrailers? Discussion Eight responses to the June 25, 1990, NPRM were submitted to the docket. The respondents included four State Departments of Transportation; California (Caltrans), Florida (FDOT), Minnesota (MnDOT), and Virginia (VDOT) and the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Hackney and Sons, Inc. (trailer manufacturer), and one individual. Of these respondents, six favored designating the beverage semitrailer as specified equipment, one (Caltrans) opposed, and one (VDOT) was not sure the vehicle could operate on its current system of highways for STAA dimensioned vehicles.
