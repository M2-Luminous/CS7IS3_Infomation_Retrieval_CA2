The protest note was handed to the Indian high commissioner in Islamabad today. Briefing reporters, a Foreign Office spokesman referred to statements by the Indian president and by Salman Khurshid, minister of state for external affairs. He said that India cannot use such vilification to divert the world's attention from the atrocities being committed in occupied Kashmir. He said that such statements reflect India's helplessness in Kashmir, and give the impression that India has no alternative but to resort to a vilification campaign in defense of its policy of genocide. When asked about the Kashmir visit by representatives of the European countries, the spokesman said the diplomatic representatives were not permitted to meet people freely. He said they should visit Sopor, Kupwara, and Bijbiara, where gross human rights violations are being committed.
