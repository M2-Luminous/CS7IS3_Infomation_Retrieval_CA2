I went there because a comrade who was in Angola with me told me that the boulevard in Havana was worse than the Angolan alleyways (candongas). I felt insulted. I had an exchange of words with him, harsh words, but I do have to admit that he was right. At the boulevard in Havana, I found a mixture of the legal and the irritably illegal. On the boulevard there are dozens of persons who have been authorized and have permits, as established in Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment, to sell the products they make with their own two hands. But the people who visit the boulevard are attacked, to use a word, by a dirty band of peddlers, unscrupulous people who have nothing to do with the measure adopted by the Revolution. What is worse, they seem to be acting without a worry of punishment in their minds and filling their pockets with illegally earned money. No one seems to want to stop these people. Decree No. 141 that allows self-employment was discussed at length during the last session of the National Assembly of the People's Government. The discussions made it clear that this measure adopted by the Revolution needs to be controlled and supervised. The absence of control and supervision lets unscrupulous people, enemies of honest work, to mix with those authorized by Decree No. 141 to peddle their goods. The San Rafael Boulevard in Havana is possibly the worst example for the country. I will repeat that there are dozens of people on the boulevard who have permits to sell the products they make. But for every one of these people, there are five who, without permits, sell bread and cheese or ham, hot pizza, and candy, which is not homemade and which they sell for 20 pesos. This kind of candy is sold at stores and their brand, shape, and size of the candy makes us believe that they were all taken out of the same container or box. They, of course, are selling this at an astronomical price. If you want to buy a pair of pants you are charged 1,500 pesos. A chocolate bar costs you 20 pesos, and so forth. There is something else, something that make a real revolutionary stop and think. These people are old enough to work or young enough to be in school. I can truly tell you that my visit to the San Rafael Boulevard was an eye opener. There are some there who are authorized to sell on the boulevard, but who are also violating the law. Why? Well, their permit says that they are authorized to sell ceramics, but they are also selling plastic, aluminum and other products. It is not possible for one person to make all those articles. They have their stands there and nothing happens. Now, regarding food, except for the peanut candy and the paper cones filled with 10 peanuts being sold at two pesos, the rest of the so-called fast foods established in Decree 141 are not being respected. Furthermore, if you are to look over Havana, you will see that many people are violating Decree 141. If you visit the diplomatic store in Miramar, you will see that right outside the fence the people are selling the products they bought earlier inside. The taxis are charging whatever they want and are also accepting dollars. We have been told in the past that we should not compare between what is happening in Havana and other areas of the country; however, I believe that it would be worthwhile to see if the decree is being respected in other provinces. Holguin comes to mind. I believe this would be the best comparison. During the last ANPP session, it was agreed to appoint a group of inspectors to ensure that Decree 141 was being respected. I believe this will have to be done as soon as possible. It is very important that this be done. The people agree with self-employment but they are upset when we do not do something to perfect the law. For example, the people cannot understand how come a policeman enforces the law sometimes, and overlooks problems at other times. While on the boulevard I talked to a policeman. He told me that he felt that what was happening at the boulevard was wrong but that he worked for Havana Vieja Municipality and that in his municipality the people could not do what was being done on San Rafael Boulevard. When I asked him who was responsible, he told me that Zapata and Dragones Unit was responsible. But I found no policeman from the Zapata and Dragones Unit there. I also believe the people's councils could do something about this. I repeat, the people approve of the self-employment measure because it contributes to solving some of our current problems; however, they want it to be a good measure. Our own Commander in Chief Fidel Castro said it at the ANPP session. It is a good and useful measure. Self-employment solves a problem today and will continue to solve problems in the future. I do believe it is worthwhile that every municipality or administrative council, in this case, the Havana Municipality, act immediately to solve this problem.
