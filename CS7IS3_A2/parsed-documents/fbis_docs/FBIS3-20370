This means closer cooperation between Social Democrats Against the EU (SME) and No to the EU. Both SME leader Hallvard Bakke and No to the EU leader Kristen Nygaard have told AFTENPOSTEN that cooperation on the no side is now to be strengthened. "All the groups on the no side now feel that much closer cooperation is necessary. No to the EU will be the coordinating body, but this will not lead to any central control," Nygaard told AFTENPOSTEN. He said that the time is not yet ripe for weekly meetings, but that those active on the no side will meet as and when necessary. "This means closer cooperation and ongoing consultations." Labor Party faction Social Democrats Against the EU, the Center Party, the Christian People's Party, the Liberal Party, Red Electoral Alliance, and the Workers' Communist Party are all involved in this cooperation, as are the Norwegian Farmers Association, the Association of Farmers and Smallholders, and several youth and environmental organizations. There are also good contacts with the Norwegian Fishermen's Association that has its secretariat in Trondheim. In what ways will you be active in the run-up to the Labor Party national congress? "I expect that it will be SME that will tackle this area first and foremost. The national congress will probably do what the head of government wants -- which is, to increase the chances of Norway joining the EU," Kristen Nygaard said. SME will hold its first national conference in the Folketeater building in Oslo on 9 and 10 April. This will be the formal founding of the no organization within the Labor Party. Hallvard Bakke expects that all the country's provinces will send representatives, and he is standing formally as the organization's leader. Bakke too stresses that it is important to have broad cooperation on the no side. "We are working to become as united as possible," he said. Bakke rejected the suggestion that the SME is working to recruit the no people for the Labor Party's national congress. "We are not a faction within the Labor Party. We are working in relation to the referendum. I expect that there will be a clear yes majority at the national congress, but the national congress will not decide anything at all. That is what the referendum will do," Bakke said. Asked how many members SME now has, Bakke replied that he does not know. Nor does he know how many of the Labor Party's Storting deputies are members of SME. The battle for Norwegian minds on the subject of the EU is largely an internal battle within the Labor Party. Storting deputy Olav Akselsen was one of the 15 Labor Party deputies who voted against submitting an EU membership application in the last Storting. Now he is increasingly doubtful, and membership of SME has never been a consideration for him: "It is a militant organization for those who are unshakable in their faith," Akselsen said. He views the EU issue as a "question of faith." "It is a question of what you believe is best for Norway," he said. Labor Party Youth Association [AUF] leader Trond Giske is a member of the interim executive of the SME. He will play an active role on the no side in the run-up to the referendum. Of the internal conflict in the AUF he said: "There was a clear majority at the national conference that opposed the EU." Giske also made it clear that the AUF will cooperate with other no organizations and fight its campaign in part through the SME. Storting deputy Anneliese Dorum from Akershus is also a member of the interim board of the SME. She is concerned that "in the name of democracy" there must be a reasonable split between yes and no delegates to the Labor Party national congress. "It will be up to us as individuals and party members to see to it that both supporters and opponents are represented at the national congress," Dorum said. Akershus will elect its national congress delegates at its annual general meeting on 23 April.
