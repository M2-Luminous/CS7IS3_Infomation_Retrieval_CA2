FR940711-0-00068 FR940711-0-00019 The reference to the ``Federal Act'' in proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200 lacks specificity and could be interpreted in a manner that is inconsistent with the second part of 30 CFR 772.15(b), which requires that information can be kept confidential only if it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration. The Director, for the reasons stated above, approves proposed Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;203&hyph;200, but requires Utah to submit an additional amendment providing that coal exploration permit application information may not be kept confidential unless it concerns trade secrets or is privileged commercial or financial information relating to the competitive rights of the persons intending to conduct coal exploration. IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments 1. Public Comments The Director solicited public comments and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the proposed amendment. No public comments were received, and because no one requested an opportunity to testify at a public hearing, no hearing was held. 2. Agency Comments Pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), the Director solicited comments on Utah's proposed amendment from the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and various other Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Utah program. Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). _By letter dated October 7, 1993, MSHA raised a concern that in one area Utah's proposed rules may conflict with MSHA's 30 CFR part 77 regulations (administrative record No. UT&hyph;873). MSHA stated that the proposed rules refer to tables and charts regarding allowable airblast, ground vibration, and particle velocity due to surface blasting but that MSHA's regulations do not specify and/or limit these values for surface blasting. MSHA also stated that, in addition, its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground miners when surface blasting occurs. With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulations at 30 CFR part 77 do not limit surface mines for airblast, ground vibration, and particle velocity, the Director, as discussed in finding No. 2, finds that Utah's surface mining blasting limitations at Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524.661 are substantively identical to, and no less effective than, OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 816.67(d). With respect to MSHA's statement that its regulation at 30 CFR 77.1303(j) provides for the protection of underground miners when surface blasting occurs, the Director notes that existing rules in the Utah program, and the corresponding Federal regulations, provide for such protection. With respect to MSHA's implication that Utah's surface mine blasting rules should also provide protection for underground miners, Utah Admin. R. 645&hyph;301&hyph;524 and 524.641, and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 816.61(d)(1)(ii) and 816.67(d)(1), require that (1) blasting operations conducted within 500 feet of active underground mines must have MSHA approval and (2) underground mines must be protected from damage by establishment of a maximum allowable limit for ground vibration before initiation of blasting. For the reasons discussed above, the Director is not requiring Utah to modify its rules in response to MSHA's comments. By letter dated February 28, 1994 (administrative record No. UT&hyph;896), MSHA responded to the revisions proposed by Utah in its January 7, 1994, submittal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;881), by stating that ``it appears there is no conflict with the requirements of 30 CFR.'' Other Agencies. _By letters dated August 25, 1993, and January 27, 1994, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers stated that it found the changes to Utah's regulatory program to be satisfactory (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;863 and UT&hyph;890). By letter dated August 26, 1993, the Bureau of Mines stated that it had no comment because the amendment would not affect minerals other than coal (administrative record No. UT&hyph;864). By letters dated August 27, 1993, and February 1, 1994 (administrative record Nos. UT&hyph;867 and UT&hyph;892), EPA stated that it had no comments on the proposed amendment. By letter dated February 14, 1994, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stated it found nothing of significant concern to the Fish and Wildlife Service (administrative record No. UT&hyph;895). 3.
