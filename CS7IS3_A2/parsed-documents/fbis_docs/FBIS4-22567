Between Dispute Over Principles and Pragmatism"] [Text] Tallinn, Mar--While in Moscow one can occasionally hear threats in regard to the alleged suppression of the Russian minority in Estonia--there is even talk of a bloodbath, apartheid, and deportation--and in Tallinn Russia is accused time and again because of the delays in troop withdrawal and alleged imperial intentions, the situation in the country itself is absolutely quiet. Neither are the human rights of the Russians disregarded--only the right to vote in parliamentary elections is witheld from noncitizens--nor are there "deportations." Estonians and Russians get along well in their daily contacts, even if most Estonians in the depth of their heart would really like the "occupation Russians" out of their country and the Russians fear precisely this. But there is a gaping difference between heart and mind, and the Estonians, too, know that they cannot drive the Russians across the border. They see the humanitarian problems. And for the Russians it is much more important to take part in the Estonian economic miracle and to earn kroons than to flirt with the "ruble zone," even if they are annoyed about the demand to apply for residence permits. In the daily contacts, even when there are occasional provocations, the tone of voice is recitative in the Nordic manner. The Russians, too, have become more "Nordic" in the meantime. The striving to live together in harmony is unmistakable. In Estonia, just like in Latvia, there have never been serious incidents between the nationalities. Even the grumbling in the lines has stopped, because one no longer has to stand in line: The atmosphere in the shops has become relaxed and friendly, as in the West. The Estonian Government, too, especially Prime Minister Laar, refers to the fact that the situation in the country is quiet and that unfortunately a completely false impression is created by the saber-rattling in Moscow. There are continuous assurances to the effect that there really are no difficulties with the Russian minority. Once the Russian troop withdrawal is complete, so goes the argument, then even the last old Stalinists in Estonia, who up to now regarded Estonian independence as a temporary episode, will realize that they must obey Estonian laws. Up to now, they say, the old Russian leaders have done a disservice to their own cause, for example by thundering against the language requirement for Estonian citizenship, instead of learning the language. Once the occupation army is out of the country and the sovereignty of Estonia is restored, they say, it will be possible to be more generous toward the Russian minority. Behind the dispute over principles--Estonia wants Moscow to admit that it occupied Estonia in 1940--and the Russian threats to protect the Russians with "sanctions" if necessary, there is concealed a network of pragmatic cooperation, including between the nations and the economic actors. In the negotiations about technical details of the troop withdrawal, say about the removal of the stocks of mines and ammunitions, as well as the nuclear reactors of the Paldiski submarine base, the experts are finding agreeable solutions. Estonia suspects that the Russian military pensioners could form a fifth column. But the pension transfers to the barely 11,000 former officers from the Russian Ministry of Defense are cleared smoothly through Estonian banks. During the past year, Russia has reduced the number of its troops to approximately 2,000 officers and noncommissioned officers, because wages and food provisioning suddenly had to be paid for in kroons. In the Estonian Ministry of Defense and in the high command, Estonian former colonels of the Soviet Army are performing their service in civilian clothes because, in Estonian uniform, they would lose their Moscow pension. In spite of the far-reaching reorientation to Western markets, the foreign trade between Estonia and Russia is again increasing, especially through agricultural exports into the region of St. Petersburg. Tallinn, so Estonian Foreign Minister Luik emphasizes, is the second most important port of transshipment for Western humanitarian transports to Russia. And without the in part highly-skilled Russian workers in the industrial plants, many of whom at one time belonged to the Soviet armament industry, the economic upswing of the country could not be attained, as people in the Estonian Ministry of Economics, in the Estonian Government in general, and among most of the parties, know. In terms of investments of foreign firms in Estonia, Russia--after Sweden, Finland, and America--is still before Germany in fourth place. What is the point of the Russian threat of sanctions, in the meantime taken back by Prime Minister Chernomyrdin in Helsinki, if Estonia receives its oil no longer from Russia, but through private and international enterprises such as Neste and Statoil? Whether Neste or Statoil fill their tankers with Russian or Norwegian oil depends, above all, on the prices. Only with respect to natural gas supplies is Estonia dependent to the extent of 100 percent on Russian shipments. The Russian Gazprom gas concern, however, long ago for a great deal of money bought 30 percent of the shares of Eesti Gaas [Estonian Gas]. For Gazprom--where Chernomyrdin once was a director--the sales against Estonian currency at world market prices is important. Estonia, so says Foreign Minister Luik, could be a bridge between East and West--not politically, as once Finland under Kekkonen wanted to be, but economically. Many Estonian firms, he pointed out, have close contacts with Russian firms. Through the "Russian" firms with Russian workers and managers, he suggested, splendid contact with the economy of Russia could be established from Estonia. The traffic system and information infrastructure, he added, are rather well-developed. If the Russian leaders today complain about the fact that the Baltic states do not thank Russia and Yeltsin for granting them independence, he suggested, this is rather their problem with their own past. To the contrary, the Russians actually should be grateful to the Balts. For through their aspiration for independence and democracy, he said, they contributed to the breaking up of the Soviet system and the democratization of Russia. The Russians, too, could learn from the Estonian economic miracle through shock therapy, said Prime Minister Laar. According to him, Russia's problem is not that it was subjected to too much shock therapy, but that it received too little of it. Foreign Minister Luik said that Russia, in which politics no longer determines the economy, also has an interest in a strong, independent Estonia. As a satellite, he suggested, Estonia is economically worthless for Russia. It is valuable, by contrast, he said, as a partner, if it has a stable currency, and a stable democracy and is economically prosperous.
