He warned, however, that this "should be done some time in the future." The [Honduran] military leader, his Salvadoran colleague Gen. Humberto Corado, and Gen. Julio Fidencio Otzoy, the Guatemalan deputy defense minister, were present today for a special ceremony honoring 210 disabled veterans from the three Central American nations. During the event, the veterans received artificial limbs donated by a U.S. humanitarian organization. When asked about the project that would separate the police force and the Armed Forces, Discua said that "the right thing would be to do this some time in the future," because "it is no easy task. The whole transformation process will require resources, which are scarce in our countries." In commenting about the recent report on the state of human rights in Honduras, issued by Leo Valladares Lanza, the national human rights commissioner, the Honduran minister said that the document is "a preliminary report that should be examined objectively." The report, entitled "The Facts Speak for Themselves," lists 184 cases of missing persons during the 1980's. Discua said that "there were some such cases in the past, which occurred under the specific circumstances of the time. There has always been a struggle between the officially constituted power and the subversive movements. The bad thing, however, would be to be partial about the situation, because the two fought against each other and there are victims on both sides." Gen. Corado said the new atmosphere of peace in the Central American countries, which have overcome their armed conflicts, calls for reorganization within the Armed Forces's. The civil war in El Salvador ended in 1992, which brought about a reduction in the 66,000-strong Armed Forces to less that half. In Nicaragua, where the fighting ceased in 1990, the Sandinist People's Army cut its 80,000 force to less than 17,000. "We should not see armies as having only war as their mission. We were not born from war. We were born with the republic; we have participated in every stage of the nation's development; and our work is still valuable," he added. Corado said the efforts of the Salvadoran Government and UNESCO to carry out the First Forum on Peace Culture are "worthy of praise." Representatives of 14 countries that have endured armed conflicts will meet this week in San Salvador, along with representatives from 40 other nations participating as observers. Guatemala is the only country where civil war still persists. There is hope the war, which began in 1960, will end this year following negotiations that are scheduled to begin in March in Mexico.
