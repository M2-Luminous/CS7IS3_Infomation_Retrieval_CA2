The Hanahoe, a political military club at the center of criticism from every strata of South Korea, was a powerful group of fascist military hooligans basically composed of former members of the Chilsonghoe. The Chilsonghoe had consisted of seven generals--namely Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Son Yong-kil, Chong Ho-yong, Kwon Ik-hyon, Choe Sung-tae, and Paek Un-taek--who hailed from Kyongsang Province and graduated in the 11th class of the South Korean Military Academy. While under the patronage of traitor Pak Chong-hui following the 16 May Coup, they changed the name of Chilsonghoe to the Hanahoe when they were pinned with the insignia of major on their shoulders. Being on the lookout to seize power, they increased membership to approximately 200. Following this, the rascals expanded their area of influence to include all graduates between the 11th to 36th graduating class of the South Korean Military Academy. Chon Tu-hwan, No Tae-u, Chong Ho-yong, and Pak Chun-pyong, the chief culprits behind the 12 December coup and the Kwangju massacre, were Hanahoe members. Chang Se-tong, Ho Sam-su, and Ho Hwa-pyong, the henchmen to traitor Chon Tu-hwan in the Fifth Republic, were nests of the Hanahoe. The fact that Yi Pyong-tae, who has assumed the position of puppet defense minister, was a member of the notorious secret military group shocks the South Korean people. The appointment of Yi Pyong-tae a member of the secret group of vicious military gangsters as puppet defense minister by puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam all but shows his intention to revive the Fifth and Sixth Republics's influence and repeat the fascist suppressive rule of the Fifth and Sixth Republics in South Korea. As everyone knows, the Kim Yong-sam group has prattled as though the Hanahoe had been broken up and took measures as though to remove Hanahoe members not only from the puppet regime, but also from the military when Traitor Kim Yong-sam raved that he would wipe out the Hanahoe members from the civilian regime, and the puppet Army announced that 10 colonels who were Hanahoe members would be excluded from promotions. However, this was a trick to deceive the South Korean people. The chieftain of the civilian regime has not separated itself from the Fifth and Sixth Republics but are colluding with them. With the people's spirit of resistance growing higher due to the rice market opening, traitor Kim Yong-sam attempted to appease the people's protests by means of shifting the blame onto his stooges and firing them, while naming vicious military gangsters to important posts. These facts show that the Kim Yong-sam group has not eliminated the Fifth and Sixth Republics's forces and prove, even worse, that it drew the rascals into its civilian regime in order to resurrect the Fifth and Sixth Republics' military fascist terrorist rule. In reality, the Kim Yong-sam group is carrying out fascist suppressive rule over the South Korean people more than ever before. On 28 December, traitor Kim Yong-sam, during his visit to the Seoul District Prosecution Office to check end-of-the-year readiness, made outbursts that he would not tolerate violent demonstrations. Even before taking office, the puppet interior minister, raved that it is okay for the investigators to torture political criminals. By following the puppet traitor's suppressive order, South Korea is dripping with a warlike atmosphere and the people's righteous struggle for independence, democracy, and reunification are now being brutally oppressed. Needless to say, the worsening fascist suppressive maneuvers of the Kim Yong-sam group are aimed at suppressing and obliterating the people's struggle to oppose the rice market opening. Attempting to defuse his regime's crisis, puppet traitor Kim Yong-sam named the Hanahoe group's military gangsters and fascist oppressors whom the South Korean people criticize in order to oppress and obliterate the people's antigovernment struggle. Nonetheless, this is nothing but a last-ditch resistance by one who faces a tragic end. The fascist suppression will only heighten the resistance of the people and hasten the self destruction.
