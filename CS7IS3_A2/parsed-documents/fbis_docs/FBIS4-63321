Dzhokhar Dudayev, republican president and commander-in-chief of armed forces, presented banners and standards with Chechen symbols to 12 regular units before the parade. A conference devoted to the anniversary since the end of the 50-year-long war of tsarist Russia against highlanders, was also held in the Chechen capital on the same day. Its participants, including guests from Saudi Arabia, the United States and Jordan, noted that the Russian empire conquered Caucasian peoples with fire and sword but could not suppress their will for freedom. Addressing the conference, Dudayev called for "establishing an international tribunal to condemn the continued colonial policy of Russia in the Caucasus".
