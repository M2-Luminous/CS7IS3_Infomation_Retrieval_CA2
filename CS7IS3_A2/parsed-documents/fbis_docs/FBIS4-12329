Major General Amnon Shahaq also said as much to his colleague, Dr. Nabil Sha'th, during the last round of talks in Cairo. This was reported in a consultation held in Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's Tel Aviv office yesterday. A member of the Israeli delegation explained that the deployment of the Palestinian police force will take about one month and that until it is completed, the IDF will not complete its withdrawal. Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin firmly opposes unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and Jericho. Sources in the defense establishment say Israel will not create a power vacuum which could be filled by Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], even if this means our remaining in the Gaza Strip for another week or two against our wishes. The question is: Why are the Palestinians holding up the entrance of the first Palestinian police officers, who are slated to arrive in the autonomy areas in two days. A senior political source said: This does not stem from 'Arafat's negative attitude; even worse, it is the result of internal differences of opinion and disarray within the Palestinian delegation. Jerusalem hopes that despite the differences of opinion between the generals and the politicians within the PLO, the first eight Palestinian police officers will arrive in Gaza and Jericho next Sunday or Monday.
