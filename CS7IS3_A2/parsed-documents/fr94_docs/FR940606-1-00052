FR940606-1-00052 FR940606-1-00008 While spot stripping and decal removal have been exempted from the proposed standards, the EPA, in selecting the format of the exemption, intends to limit the use of organic HAP-containing stripper to the lowest amount necessary. The EPA selected a limitation on the annual average amount (in gallons) of organic HAP-containing stripper used per aircraft. The format for the proposed standards for inorganic HAP emissions from depainting operations was developed from the section 114 questionnaire responses. The seven facilities that reported blast depainting operations were ranked according to control efficiency of the filtration methods (particulate filters or baghouses) used to control particulate emissions. The best performing 12 percent of these sources are represented by the one facility with the highest control efficiency. This facility achieved a reported control efficiency of 99 percent and was chosen to represent the MACT floor. The control efficiency data reported in the section 114 questionnaire responses consisted of engineering judgement estimates and information obtained from the filter manufacturers. No test data were reported. Due to this lack of quantifiable test data, the EPA is requesting comments on whether the 99 percent level of control represents the demonstrated level of technology for the control of particulate emissions from blast depainting. These comments should contain a technical justification, including test data where possible, for any recommended level of control. 4. Chemical Milling Maskant Application Operation An emission limitation based on the mass of organic HAP and VOC per unit volume applied was selected for chemical milling maskants. There are essentially two means of complying with the proposed standards: (1) Solvent-based chemical milling maskant with a carbon adsorber to reduce emissions or (2) a waterborne chemical milling maskant with an organic HAP content equal to or less than the proposed standard. This format allows facilities to choose either method (or develop an equivalent method) without giving preference to either solvent-based or waterborne chemical milling maskants. 5. Handling and Storage of Waste The rationale for the format of the proposed standards for handling and storage of waste is essentially the same as that for housekeeping measures for cleaning solvents. Since no data were available to establish an emission limitation and control equipment was not technically feasible, a work practice format requiring housekeeping measures was selected as the most appropriate means of reducing emissions. G. Selection of Emission Test Methods and Monitoring Requirements 1. Emission Test Methods In addition to the specific test methods described below for each affected source, the proposed rule adopts the provisions specified in ยง63.7 of the General Provisions, 40 CFR part 63, subpart A. 9 9 Ibid. a. Cleaning operation. For hand-wipe cleaning, the proposed standards would allow owners or operators to use either a cleaning solvent that conforms to an approved composition list or a cleaning solvent with a vapor pressure less than or equal to 45 mm Hg. Procedures are, therefore, necessary for determining whether a cleaning solvent conforms to the approved composition list or meets the vapor pressure limitation. The other portion of the proposed standards for cleaning operations (including spray gun cleaning) includes housekeeping measures, equipment standards, or work practice standards, for which no test methods or procedures are required to demonstrate compliance. Those facilities that use cleaning solvents that conform to the approved composition list would have to demonstrate how the solvents comply. The EPA is proposing that data supplied by the manufacturer of the cleaning solvent be used to show compliance. The data must show all components of the cleaning solvent and demonstrate that one of the approved composition definitions is met. To determine the composite vapor pressure of a cleaning solvent, the EPA is proposing that for single-component cleaning solvents data supplied by the manufacturer or from standard engineering reference texts be used. This information is readily available and, for single component cleaning solvents, should be readily acceptable. For multi-component cleaning solvents, it is necessary to determine the composite vapor pressure of the cleaning solvent. This requires determining the amount of each organic compound in the cleaning solvent and each one's vapor pressure. Once these are known, then a procedure to combine the information must be followed to calculate the composite vapor pressure. The EPA is proposing that gas chromatographic analysis, following the procedures outlined in E 260&hyph;85, be used to quantify the amount of each organic compound. The vapor pressure of each organic compound would then be determined, again, either by the manufacturer's data or from standard engineering reference texts, as discussed above. For combining these data to calculate the composite vapor pressure, the EPA is proposing that the blend be assumed to be an ideal solution where Raoult's law applies. While more accurate methods are available, the cost and time to conduct those methods and the small gain in accuracy are not justifiable when compared to the ease of calculating composite vapor pressure assuming an ideal solution where Raoult's law applies. Further, the composite vapor pressure of any blend changes with the conditions under which it is applied. This normal variability would cause some cleaning solvents to meet the composite vapor limit under certain conditions, but not others, if the vapor pressure test methods were used instead of the calculation. b. Primer and topcoat application operations. One part of the proposed standards for primer and topcoat application operations requires the use of specified high transfer efficiency application equipment, or equivalent.
