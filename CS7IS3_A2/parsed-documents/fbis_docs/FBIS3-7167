Prime minister Yi Hoe-chang asked those present at the meeting to be more vigilant against the dogmatic adventurism of North Korea. "You should be prepared against any eventuality as the North Korean nuclear question is about to come away from the stage of dialogue into the phase of sanction by the UN Security Council," Yi said. The prime minister also suggested that relevant offices let the people fully know about the government's policies toward North Korea since he said the people's understanding is important in building up the nation's overall security preparedness. The officials present at the meeting included, besides the premier, Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Information Minister O In-hwan, NSP Director Kim Tok and Chief Presidential Secretary Pak Kwan-yong.
