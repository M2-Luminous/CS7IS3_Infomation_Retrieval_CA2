FR940128-2-00244 FR940128-2-00159 Subpart I limits radionuclide emissions to the ambient air from NRC-licensed facilities to that amount which would cause any member of the public to receive in any year an effective dose equivalent (ede) of 10 millirem, of which no more than 3 millirem ede may be from radioiodines. These limits involved application to radionuclide emissions of the Agency's policy for regulating section 112 pollutants which was first announced in the benzene NESHAP (54 FR 38044 September 14, 1989), and utilized the two-step process outlined in NRDC v. EPA , 824 F.2d at 1146 (1987) (the Vinyl Chloride decision). At the time of promulgation of the radionuclide NESHAPS rule, EPA granted reconsideration of subpart I based on information received late in the rulemaking from the NRC and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NRC was concerned about duplicative regulation of its licensees by NRC and EPA, while the NIH was concerned with the potential negative effects of the standard on the use of nuclear medicine in patient treatment. EPA subsequently extended the stay of the effective date of subpart I on several occasions, pursuant to the authority provided by section 10(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. 705, and section 301(a) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7601(a). (55 FR 10455, March 21, 1990; 55 FR 29205, July 18, 1990; and 55 FR 38057, September 17, 1990). In 1990, Congress enacted legislation comprehensively amending the Clean Air Act, which included a section addressing the issue of regulatory duplication between EPA and NRC. Section 112(d)(9) of the CAA provides, that no standard for radionuclide emissions from any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (or an Agreement State) is required to be promulgated under Section 112 if the Administrator determines, by rule, and after consultation with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, that the regulatory program established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant to the Atomic Energy Act for such category or subcategory provides an ample margin of safety to protect the public health. This provision enables EPA to eliminate duplication of effort between EPA and NRC so long as public health is protected with an ample margin of safety. On April 24, 1991, EPA issued a final rule staying until November 15, 1992 the effectiveness of subpart I for all categories of facilities licensed by the NRC or NRC Agreement States except nuclear power reactors (56 FR 18735). The purpose of this stay was to avoid the costs and disruption associated with formal implementation of subpart I while EPA was collecting additional information necessary to make the substantive determination for these facilities contemplated by CAA Section 112(d)(9). NESHAPS Rulemaking on Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Agreement State Licensees Other Than Nuclear Power Reactors, EPA 430&hyph;R&hyph;92&hyph;011 (November 1992). (On August 5, 1991, EPA proposed to rescind subpart I for commercial nuclear power reactors (56 FR 37196) and issued a final rule staying the effectiveness of subpart I for nuclear power reactors during the pendency of the substantive rulemaking on rescission (56 FR 37158)). The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) petitioned for judicial review of the rule staying subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors. On September 25, 1992, the DC Circuit Court of Appeals issued a decision holding that EPA had exceeded its authority by staying subpart I while it was collecting the information required to make a finding under CAA section 112(d)(9). NRDC v. Reilly, 976 F.2d 36 (DC Cir. 1992). EPA completed its investigation of radionuclide emissions by NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors while the litigation in the DC Circuit Court concerning the rule staying subpart I for these facilities was still pending. On September 18, 1992, EPA announced that it intended to propose rescission of subpart I for these facilities and proposed a rule which would further stay subpart I during the pendency of the substantive rulemaking on rescission (57 FR 43173). Although EPA did propose to rescind subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors on December 1, 1992 (57 FR 56877), EPA did not adopt the proposed stay. EPA concluded that the Court's ruling in NRDC v. Reilly had left substantial doubt concerning the legality of any further stay of subpart I for these facilities and decided not to issue any further stay. As a result, the rule staying subpart I for NRC and Agreement State licensees other than nuclear power reactors expired by its own terms on November 15, 1992, and subpart I took effect for these facilities on November 16, 1992 (the official mandate implementing the DC Circuit Court's decision in NRDC v. Reilly was not transmitted until after the stay had already expired).
