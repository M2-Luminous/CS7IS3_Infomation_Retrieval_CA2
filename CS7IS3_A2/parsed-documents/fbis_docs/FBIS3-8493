The protest states that this Serbian apartheid and segregation against the ethnic Albanians in former Yugoslavia is every day exterminating every kind of institution and legal structure of the spiritual and material world in Kosova. This is a manifestation of another form of ethnic cleansing, which the Belgrade authorities are practicing in Kosova. The Albanian Helsinki Committee addresses all international institutions to stop, as soon as possible, these inhuman acts that incite and provoke the spread of war toward the south of Balkans at any cost. The committee feels that the European consciousness cannot stand indifferent when academies are closed in front of its eyes, cultural and academic institutions are locked, and art and culture representatives are beaten, maltreated, and imprisoned, thus challenging the European science and culture itself. The Albanian Helsinki Committee expresses its conviction that the international public, as well as the recent approved resolutions accepting the CSCE Commission as observers against the violations of human rights of Albanians in former Yugoslavia, will exert their pressure to stop Serbian repression, apartheid, and segregation in Kosova.
