The following are the main points of the joint action agreed on Tuesday [19 April]. In order to work for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace in the Middle East, the EU will: (a) participate in international arrangements agreed by the parties to guarantee peace and contribute to defining the future shape of relations between the regional parties in the context of the Arms Control and Regional Security Working Group; (b) develop its role in the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee responsible for the coordination of international aid to the Occupied Territories, maintain its leading role in the Regional Economic Development Working Group and develop its participation in other multilateral groups, consider additional ways in which it might contribute to the development of the region; (c) pursue confidence building measures which it has submitted to the parties, pursue demarches to the Arab states with the aim of securing an end to the boycott of Israel and closely follow the future of Israeli settlements throughout the Occupied Territories and pursue demarches to Israel about this issue. Further, the Council will examine proposals the Commission will make: (i) for the rapid implementation of programmes of assistance for the development of the Occupied Territories and a Palestinian operating budget; (ii) to provide aid in the framework of existing guidelines to the other parties to the bilateral negotiations as they progress substantially towards peace. In order to contribute actively and urgently to the creation of a Palestinian Police Force, the EU will provide assistance: Funds for ECU10 million will be made available from the Community budget as a matter of urgency. At the request of the parties, the European Union will participate in the protection of the Palestinian people through a temporary international presence in the Occupied Territories (Security Council Resolution 904). Operational arrangements and financing arising from this decision will be the subject of a separate and specific Council decision. Also at the request of the parties, the EU will implement a coordinated programme of assistance in preparing for and observing the elections in the Occupied Territories. Arrangements will be the subject of a separate Council decision once Israel and the PLO have reached agreement on arrangements for the elections. The EP [European Parliament] will be invited to participate in those arrangements. Lastly, the European Union confirms its willingness to take further operational decisions in the field of this joint action, in accordance with developments in the peace process.
