The spokesman, Wu Jianmin, made the remark at a weekly press conference held here this afternoon when asked to comment on the "Radio Free Asia" bill passed by the U.S. Senate. "The real motive behind the setting up of this radio is to interfere in the internal affairs of China and other Asian countries and create confusion through news media," Wu said. Wu stressed that the affairs of Asian countries should be handled by their own people. When the setting up of this radio station was under consideration, he noted, China and many other Asian countries voiced their strong opposition to it. By taking the action, Wu said, the United States has trampled upon the universally acknowledged norms governing international relations and violated the basic principles laid down in the three joint communiques between China and the United States.
