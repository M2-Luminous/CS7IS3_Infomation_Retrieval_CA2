Maymistov, Moscow Institute of Engineering Physics; UDC 535.2] [Abstract] Propagation of ultrashort light pulses through a dispersive nonlinear medium is analyzed, for simplicity considering only scalar electromagnetic waves. The analysis is based on the theory of coherent interaction in several approximations: 1. resonance, 2. unidirectional wave propagation, 3. slowly varying complex pulse envelope. Resonance may be assumed when the bandwidth of the pulses is much smaller than the resonance frequency. In this approximation the wave equation is supplemented with Bloch equations, the resulting Maxwell-Bloch system having steady-state solutions but no soliton solution. Unidirectionality may be assumed when the concentration of resonant atoms is sufficiently low for interaction of counterpropagating waves to be negligible. In this approximation that system of equations transforms into one whose soliton solutions describe gp-pulses and breezers with 2�-pulse envelopes. When the unidirectionality condition is not satisfied, then the nonlinear wave equation E[.sub],zz[/] - c[.sup]2[/]E[.sub],tt[/] = ... must be resorted to. This equation, obtainable from the same solutions to the Bloch equation and very similar to the Boussinesq equation, is completely integrable and has known multisoliton solutions. Approximation of a slowly varying complex envelope leads to the system of MacCall-Hahn equations, whose soliton solutions describe 2�-pulses. In the approximation of a slowly varying envelopes of optical pulses and of medium polarization formal solution of the Bloch equation yields the nonlinear Schroedinger equation of nonlinear fiber optics.
