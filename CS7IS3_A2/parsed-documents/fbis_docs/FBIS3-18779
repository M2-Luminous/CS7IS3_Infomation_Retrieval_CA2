The ministers of foreign affairs of the European Union and the members of the Commission responsible for external relations, of the one part, and the minister of foreign affairs and the state secretary of the Ministry of International Economic Relations of the Republic of Hungary, of the other part, attended the first meeting of the Association Council between the European Union and Hungary in Brussels on 7 march 1994. 2. The Association Council adopted its rules of procedure and the rules of procedure for the Association Committee, which will in future prepare its meetings and in general ensure continuity of the association relationship and the proper functioning of the Europe Agreement. The Association Committee may, under the authority delegated by the Association Council, adopt decisions concerning the implementation of the agreement. 3. The parties welcomed this inaugural meeting of the Association Council, following the entry into force on 1 February 1994 of the Europe agreement between the European Union and Hungary. They regard the meeting not only as a symbol of the important new stage reached in their relations, but also as a practical step towards achieving the goals set out in the agreement including, ultimately, the common goal of Hungary's future membership of the Union which guides the co-operation between the parties. The Association Council welcomed the entry into force of the treaty on European Union as a further impetus to the process of co-operation and integration in Europe. 4. The parties discussed a number of political issues and confirmed the importance of maintaining a bilateral political dialogue in accordance with the provisions of the Europe Agreement. The parties noted with satisfaction that a multilateral framework for a strenghtened political dialogue and consultation on matters of common interest has been set up by the Copenhagen European Council; they looked forward to its full implementation. On this basis, the Association Council also welcomed the fact that at the initiative of Foreign Ministers Hurd and Andreatta the Council is currently considering modalities to further intensify multilateral political dialogue with the associated countries. The Association Council is deeply concerned by the continuing crisis in the former Yugoslavia. Both parties welcomed recent promising developments on Sarajevo and the agreement between the Bosnian and Croat sides as important steps towards ending the war throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. They expressed their full support for an early negotiated settlement between all the parties involved in the conflict on the basis of the European Union action plan. During the discussion, the Hungarian side described its special situation and sacrifices in connection with the crisis in the former Yugoslavia. The European Union side expressed its understanding in this context. The parties agreed on the utility of sustained and concerted efforts in order to preserve the peace and stability and to enhance mutual understanding and peaceful relationships on the European continent. In this context, they looked forward to continuing consultations on the preparation of a conference launching the stability pact, which is the subject of a joint action of the European Union. 5. The Association Council welcomed the success of Hungary in establishing stability of democratic institutions, the rule of law and the respect of human rights. It welcomed also the progress made towards completing the process in transition to a functioning market economy. It recalled the Community's commitment, expressed most recently by the European Council in Copenhagen last June, to assist in that process. The Association Council agreed that the implementation of the Europe Agreement should play an important role in promoting sustainable non-inflationary growth and in further liberalizing and integrating European markets.
