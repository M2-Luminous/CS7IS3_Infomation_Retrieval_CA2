Miss, the connection please. [Operator] Sir? [Mejia] Yes. [Operator] Yes, we now have the line with the capital of Namibia. [Mejia] Good. [Operator] Cuban Minister Roberto Robaina is on the line. [To Robaina:] This is a call from Cuba. Go ahead, both of you. [Mejia] Yes, thank you very much, Miss. Mr. Foreign Minister, good evening. We are on the air, live, for the "Exclusive" program and all of Cuba, over our radio station Radio Rebelde. How are you? [Robaina] Well, very well. No problems whatsoever. [Mejia] Comrade Foreign Minister, we want to know about the continuation of the dialogue begun today by yourself and Namibian Foreign Affairs Minister Theo-Ben Guribab, a dialogue you two began at the 48th UN General Assembly, and especially what subjects were broached in these official talks. [Robaina] Well, indeed, Mejia, we arrived in Windhoek just a few hours ago. I think we are carrying out a program that, happily, is already the, let us say, final part of the tour through these countries of Africa. But I think it has special significance, precisely because it has to do with this territory, Namibia, in particular -- which is so closely linked to the history of our country and to the presence of our Cuban troops in Angola, troops who made a modest contribution to the independence of this territory. I think it constitutes a privilege for everyone accompanying me, and from the point of view....[rephrases] For me personally, the land that (?can still be seen) from the border, to have the privilege and possibility of seeing it and treading it with one's own compatriots. [sentence as heard] And I think that has been, without a doubt, a meeting of special significance -- just as this people's respect and admiration has been special from the beginning, the respect and admiration of the ministers with whom I have already met. I have seen....[rephrases] I have begun the official talks with the Foreign Ministry, but I have also already contacted the ministers of Interior, Sports, Education, and Industry. That is, we have already made contact with several of them; and in all of them we can see, in the first place, a deep tie, a tie that is sincere and based on the historic relations that Cubans and Namibians have always had. I think...[rephrases] a very broad agenda was discussed today, which has to do with the medical collaboration that already exists, with the cooperation...[rephrases] the collaboration in the sphere of education proper. We just signed an bilateral foreign ministry agreement today, and we prepared the signing of a trade agreement, which will be signed in the next few hours. The meetings with the ministers of Health, Commerce, Tourism, and Sports continue tomorrow; and the meeting with the president is scheduled for 21 January, before departure. I have just now visited, at the places where they work, the physicians who are providing services here, too, within a system of compensated cooperation [colaboracion compensada]. There are 14 of them established in Windhoek, the capital; and the other 40-some-odd are in the regions more distant from the center, (?from) the capital. And tomorrow night I am meeting with the entire Cuban group here, after I finish up the entire program with the Namibians that I have scheduled for the day. [Mejia] Well, Comrade Minister, I would so much like to know if there is a possibility of your summing up for us your trip through the Dark Continent, through these five African countries; and whether or not the objectives of this trip have been fulfilled thus far. [Robaina] I feel that, even though there are a few hours left before finishing, we can perfectly well sum up: It is an exceptional opportunity to encounter a part of our history. I have, from the first days, found a profound gratitude on the part of the Africans in all the countries for what Cuba has done for them. I insist that Cuba is today a nation, and it is the nation that lives, resists, and works thanks to, among other things, what the Africans contributed to us in the formation of that Cuban patriotism and that nationality that exist in our land. Therefore, not only are we collecting expressions of gratitude; we, too, are expressing to this Dark Continent what we Cubans owe to it, especially as regards the formation of the Cuban nation. This has been an exceptional opportunity to speak of our historic relations; but we have said that in order to remain faithful to those historic relations, we must, above all, make history at the present time. And to make history in our relations at the present time is to find the adequate, proper, current level that corresponds to our relations with Africa under these new circumstances. The situation is new for the world. The situation is new for Africa. The situation is new for the countries I have visited and for our country as well. But I think we will be far more faithful to our history if, under such difficult circumstances, we are capable of being faithful to the principles that have always characterized these relations. Above all else, we have found a space for communication, a space for understanding, and a space for exchanges. I do not believe in strictly political diplomacy. I believe that in these times, our country's diplomacy must seek space for the greatest problem we have: economic reintegration into a truly difficult, complex, and changing world. [Mejia] Comrade Minister, I want to thank you for this time you have given Radio Rebelde. I would also like to invite you to join us here at our studio when you get back to the country. [Robaina] Thank you. I truly appreciate the opportunity you have given us to keep the people informed of what we are doing. I have said before and I repeat: Even though our work here is difficult and involves pressures, nothing can be more difficult and pressuring than what our people, whom we miss so much, do morning, noon, and night. [Mejia] This was a live telephone interview with Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina on the last leg of his tour in Windhoek, Namibia. Foreign Minister Robaina is now concluding a five-country tour of Africa.
