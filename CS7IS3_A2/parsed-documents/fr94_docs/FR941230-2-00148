FR941230-2-00148 FR941230-2-00072 Waiver Studies_$275,000 States are increasingly enacting new legislation mandating transfer of juveniles to criminal courts. This trend includes the development of innovative procedures such as (1) blending traditional features of juvenile and criminal justice procedures and (2) sanctions and statutes that categorize juvenile offenders into different classes according to the seriousness of the offense, designating juvenile or criminal court for each class. Research in this area has been limited; few studies have evaluated juvenile and criminal court handling of serious or violent juvenile offenders. OJJDP proposes to support two studies in fiscal year 1995. The first would compare juvenile and criminal court handling of juveniles. This comparison would be made between a State(s) that allows for judicial waiver of serious or violent juvenile offenders and a State(s) that mandates criminal court handling for specified categories of offenders. The second study would evaluate an innovative system of blending criminal and juvenile justice systems to handle serious or violent juvenile offenders. Funding for the initial phase of each of these studies will be competitively awarded and will not exceed $125,000 for each grant. OJJDP Support for PAVNET_$25,000 PAVNET, the Partnership Against Violence Network, is an information initiative that reflects the level of Federal, State, and local cooperation needed to build safer, less violent communities. PAVNET will integrate information on a wide range of programs and remove barriers to sharing information on programs and resources to fight violence and support families and children. PAVNET is an electronic data base that is accessible through the Internet and also available in hard copy. OJJDP's proposed support for PAVNET would be accomplished through a fund transfer to the National Institute of Justice. Through this support, many juvenile justice prevention and intervention programs that have been identified as promising and effective models would be available through the PAVNET system. Innovative Firearms Program_$250,000 The purpose of the Innovative Firearms Program is to assist State or local jurisdictions to develop and implement new or enhanced projects to prevent the possession and use of firearms by juveniles and control illicit firearm trafficking. Law enforcement, prosecutorial agencies, schools, community groups, and juvenile justice system representatives may participate in the program. The grantee(s), in cooperation with the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), OJJDP, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, will also work with U.S. Attorneys to develop and implement State and local projects related to the new Youth Handgun Safety Act. The Act prohibits the possession of a handgun or ammunition by, or the private transfer of a handgun or ammunition to, a juvenile. BJA and OJJDP will also work with local jurisdictions to develop a program to reduce firearms crimes by juvenile gangs through improved enforcement of firearms laws and other laws and regulations, such as tax and business laws, that are used to control firearms sales. OJJDP would transfer funds to BJA for this program. OJJDP Management Evaluation Contract_$360,000 The purpose of this contract is to provide OJJDP with an expert resource capable of performing independent, management-oriented evaluations of selected OJJDP programs. Evaluations would determine the effectiveness and efficiency of either individual projects or groups of projects. Evaluations could include demonstrations, tests, training, and technical assistance programs. Evaluations would be requested through work orders issued by OJJDP and carried out in accordance with work plans prepared by the contractor and approved by OJJDP. Each evaluation would be defined by OJJDP and costs, method, and timetable determined through negotiation between OJJDP and the contractor. The contract would be funded through a competitive award in fiscal year 1995.
