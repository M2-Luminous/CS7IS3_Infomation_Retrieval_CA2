In order to strengthen and improve army management in the new period, it is necessary to devote much effort to regular operation. Regular management is the long-term, fundamental task for army building. Massive, concrete, and extensive regular management can be seen everywhere and every day. It is carried out according to existing rules, regulations, ordinances, and systems, to meet the needs of the army regarding daily war preparations, military training, army operation, the soldiers' daily life, and all other duties. So long as a good job is done in this regard, we will be able to implement all rules, ordinances, and regulations down to every unit, every member of the army, and every specific task, thus ensuring the successful completion of all tasks with military training as the core. Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly handling the relationship between shock operations and regular jobs. It is necessary to carry out intensive rectification of discipline and work style to cope with some specific prominent problems in respect of troop management during a certain period. However, such intensive operations cannot replace regular management. For instance, the cultivation of discipline and work style of the army, the fostering of servicemen's fine qualities, and establishment of regular order in work and everyday life cannot be achieved overnight or through a couple of shock operations. Even if some longstanding, knotty problems can be resolved through shock operations, regular efforts are still necessary to ensure that such problems will not arise again. By the way, many problems regarding army management may not be very serious at the outset, and they can be readily resolved at this initial stage by moderate or precautionary measures. However, if such problems are left unattended at first, and shock operations are only launched just before accumulative effects are about to cause a catastrophe, then the development of the army will have been more seriously impaired. Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly handling the relationship between management and education, and persistently carrying out regular management and ideological education. The nature and goal of our army determine that strict management must be based on persuasion, education, enlightenment, and initiative. This is one of our army's fine traditions and one of our basic principles for army management. To uphold this principle, we must, as far as management is concerned, start from ideological education, making our officers and fighters not only understand what they should do but also why they should do it that way, thus enhancing their sense of obedience to management. To uphold this principle, officers who are in command must be aware of what fighters are thinking about, and strengthen management to cope with specific problems to fulfill the objective of strict management. Practice has proved that extensively launching the drive of "four knowing's and one catching up with" [si ge zhi dao yi ge gen shang 0934 0020 4249 6670 0001 0020 6418 0006] and that of "four reports and one reliance" [si ge bao gao yi ge yi kao 0934 0020 1032 0707 0001 0020 0181 7237] could be an effective approach to ensuring the perfect integration and sure implementation of regular management and ideological work. Our leading people and organs at all levels must give better guidance to ensure that these drives will be carried out in a deep-going and down-to-earth manner within all the army. Concentrating efforts on regular activities means correctly handling the relationship between specific duties and management. Our army's regular management can by no means be separated from its various missions with military training as the core. Without effective management, the army can hardly complete any tasks; but without the tasks the army is undertaking, management will become meaningless. Regular management must apply to every specific task, and all kinds of military officers at all levels must do a good job in management with a view to accomplishing all the tasks. Only in this way will we be able to give full play to the role of management work in safeguarding the smooth operation of the army and the completion of all tasks. Only by applying management to all specific tasks will we be able to do away with, once for all, inconsistency in management performance, and thus ensure that fighters will perform equally well on and off the drill ground, both in the presence and absence of leading officers, and both during and after inspection periods. So we will be able to constantly improve the overall management efficiency. Massive, concrete, and extensive management operations are the most prominent characteristics of regular management. This determines that our officers in command must keep an industrious, meticulous, and down-to-earth work style. Being industrious means to be industrious in thinking, in going around to keep in touch with and talk with the fighters, to inspect work frequently, and to be ready to discover and solve problems at any time. Being meticulous means to always keep general interests in mind when organizing and carrying out management work and doing a meticulous job when dealing with specific tasks. Working in a down-to-earth manner means taking an honest attitude and doing practical work with regard to management, doing a solid job in ensuring implementation of orders, preventing formalism, and opposing trickery and deception. In this way, we will be able to keep up our good, efficient job in regular management of the army.
