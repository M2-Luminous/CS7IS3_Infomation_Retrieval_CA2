FR940527-1-00097 FR940527-1-00014 In the March 27, 1987 final rule, we determined that it was necessary to develop separate ``scaling factor formula'' values under the 1986 malpractice rule (see §413.56(b)(3) through (5)), for malpractice insurance costs attributable to hospital outpatient services and for costs attributable to inpatient services furnished by facilities excluded from the prospective payment system (see 52 FR 9836). However, we were unable to derive separate formula values for inpatient and outpatient services for ``the R factor'' in the formula (that is, the national Medicare malpractice loss ratio, as adjusted for associated claims adjustment expense), due to the difficulty of securing hospital data attributing malpractice claims (and associated claims adjustment expense) separately to outpatient services and inpatient services. Moreover, separate scaling factor formula values for hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system were not developed. In Children's National Medical Center, et al. v. Sullivan, Civil Action No. 90&hyph;1362&hyph;WBB (D.D.C. July 16, 1991) (`` Children's National ''), the Secretary entered into a Consent Order providing that the 1986 malpractice rule is invalid and shall not be enforced, due to the agency's inability to develop separate scaling factor formula values for outpatient services and for inpatient services furnished by hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system. The Children's National Consent Order was approved by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on July 16, 1991. The Administrator of HCFA then issued HCFA Ruling 91&hyph;1 (Sept. 30, 1991), which, first, provided that the Children's National Consent Order governs all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly pending appeals of the malpractice issue, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after May 1, 1986 and, second, required reimbursement of such claims under the pre-1979 utilization method. The Supreme Court's Georgetown decision, the Children's National Consent Order, and the two corresponding HCFA Rulings establish that the 1986 malpractice rule is null and void as to all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly pending hospital appeals of the malpractice insurance cost reimbursement issue. See 42 CFR 401.108(c). See also HCFA Transmittal No. 395 (December 1993), which deleted as ``obsolete,'' due to HCFA Ruling 91&hyph;1, the implementation provisions for the 1986 rule that were formerly included in §2214 of the Medicare Intermediary Manual, Part 2. We are proposing to conform Medicare regulations to the actual state of the law governing provider malpractice insurance cost reimbursement by removing §413.56 from the regulations, and by eliminating all cross-references to §413.56 from the regulations. As a result of this proposal, the amended Medicare rules would reflect the previously established legal requirement that reasonable cost reimbursement for provider malpractice insurance cost claims that are either open or the subject of properly pending appeals, must be determined under the pre-1979 utilization method. C. Related Technical Changes (§§412.20, 412.22, 412.25, 412.27, 412.29, 412.30, 412.96, 412.105, 412.108, 412.116, 412.130, 412.71, 413.40, 413.53, 413.174 and 482.66) We are proposing to remove the words ``distinct part'', wherever they appear, in the following places: (a) Section 412.20(b)(1); (b) Section 412.22(b); (c) The section title and paragraph (a) of §412.25; (d) The undesignated introductory texts of §§412.27 and 412.29; (e) The section title of §412.30; (f) Section 412.96(c)(1) and (c)(2); (g) Section 412.105(b), (f)(5) and (g)(1)(iii); (h) Section 412.108(a)(2); (i) Section 412.116(a) and (b); (j) The section title of 412.130; (k) Section 412.130(a)(2) and (a)(3); (l) Section 413.40(a)(2)(ii), (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) and (f)(2); and (m) In §482.66(a)(7)(i), the second appearance of the words ``distinct part'' are removed. We also propose to revise the section titles of §§412.27 and 412.29 to remove the words ``distinct part'' and replace them with the word ``excluded''. In addition, we propose to make technical changes to §§412.71(b), 413.53 and 413.174(b)(4)(iv) to remove and replace obsolete language and to correct references.
