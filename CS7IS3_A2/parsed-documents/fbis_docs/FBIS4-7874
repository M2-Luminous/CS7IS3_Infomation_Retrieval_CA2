Poland may join the Western structures of economic cooperation and security earlier than was predicted by most analysts. No specific dates have been set yet. However, we can see phenomena that are not any less convincing than precise schedules. Integration is clearly faster now. The government has confirmed its desire to further increase this rate. It unanimously empowered Prime Minister Pawlak to submit a motion requesting full membership in the European Union [EU], one of the most important political establishments of today's world. A Historical Moment Also, according to parliament members, if the external conditions are favorable, this initiative may enable Poland to achieve a true European character, democracy, and well-being. They emphasize that such a firm intention to develop the old and establish new links to the West results from the social assent as well as from the agreement among politicians on this issue. Sometimes it seems that it is all happening in conditions that are similar to the general agreement and support demonstrated by Poles in such historical moments as the regaining of independence after World War I, the bloodless overthrow of communism in 1989, and the voluntary acceptance of the burden of the economic reform in 1990. The fact that our goals were clearly defined and then presented was important. We have not always been able to act like this. We should, then, once again recall the sharp words of criticism spoken in November and December by Lech Walesa about Western politicians. At that time, the NATO leaders were still hesitant in their evaluations; they were not sure whether the issue of admitting Poland to the organization could even be discussed. After a few months, it became clear that the criticism of the delay of the West, pointing to its consistency, is beginning to yield the expected results. Unanimity The most important and probably the most valued factor is the unanimity of the Polish political forces. At a recent meeting in parliament with Robin Beard, the NATO deputy general secretary for defense, Deputy Jerzy Wiatr, one of the leaders of the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], said that "even those politicians who look only in the direction of Russia finally admit that the Polish pro-Western option is right." He explained that the breakthrough moment was the Moscow coup. Poland learned a very important lesson from the developments in Russia: The source that radiates democracy and the philosophy of dynamic economic progress is still in the West. Tomasz Nalecz, of the Labor Union, added to these words that, in the issue of our membership in NATO, we are witnessing some kind of unique phenomenon in the Polish parliamentary system. If we take a look at the plenary sessions of the Sejm discussing our membership in NATO, we would not see any differences between the various parties, even though they are quick to underscore their different opinions and ardently present controversial issues. A Hand in a Friendly Gesture The strategic goal of Poland is the attainment of full membership in NATO, the EU, and the West EU, says General Stanislaw Wozniak, director of the Department of Military Foreign Affairs of the Ministry of National Defense. He also stresses that our realism in the selection of Western organizations in which we would like to have our security structures does not mean that we want to turn our back on our eastern neighbors. This is proved by a number of military agreements, signed first with our neighbors and then with others--in all, 14 states, mostly eastern and southern states. Only recently have we reached such agreements with the United States and Canada, and we are planning to conclude them with Sweden and Norway. Foreign analysts know perfectly well that, in Polish defense concepts, there is no room for an invasive expansion or attempts to subordinate other states. The location of the Polish Army units is no secret, and it proves that we have no aggressive intentions or that we are grouping our forces in order to attack any external object. Slavic and Modern Similar views about our good relations with Russia and other neighbors, especially Slavic neighbors on the other side of the Niemen, Bug, and San Rivers, are expressed by Andrzej Olechowski, author of the recently announced main points of the eastern policy. He formulates several programs, based on partnership and outlining joint action for peace, economic cooperation, or exchange of experiences useful in the efficient implementation of democratic reforms. Minister Olechowski would even be ready to propose "curbing the pro-NATO trends if the price were," let us say, "deterioration of the position of the prodemocracy forces in Russia." Solid Roots The opinion that the road to NATO should lead via the EU is becoming increasingly popular in the concepts of Polish diplomacy. This opinion is backed by the Sejm Extraordinary Committee for the European Agreement with Jan Borkowski of the Polish Peasant Party, Piotr Nowina-Konopka of the Democratic Union, and Professor Marek Mazurkiewicz of the SLD. The committee was the first to definitely support the intention of the head of the Polish diplomatic service; he wanted to obtain consent from the government to submit a motion requesting full membership in the EU for Poland. This committee also issued a positive opinion on the solid ground that had been prepared for Poland for the so-called second and third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty. Even though the first pillar--economic integration--may still seem rather weak, we can certainly cooperate in the areas of foreign policy, security, the justice system, and internal order. All of our initiatives set off these solid foundations of integration and stress the time factor. The Treaty on the EU came into effect on 1 November 1993. On 1 February of this year, Poland obtained the status of a state associated with the EU. The time span is not very big. Now the government is showing that we are doing our best not to allow the distance to increase, or even that we want to believe that it will be reduced earlier than expected.
