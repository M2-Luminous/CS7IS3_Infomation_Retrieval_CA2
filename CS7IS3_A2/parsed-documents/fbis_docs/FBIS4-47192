Kivelidi Opinion Since this draft was sent out by Oleg Soskovets, first vice-premier of the government, for an evaluation by various authoritative specialists in this field, we are able to publish one of the comments. To O.N. Soskovets, first deputy chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation The country is choking in bureaucratic licentiousness. The attempt at a transition from the totalitarian economic system to the market system by means of the administration and command system embellished by democratic slogans has collapsed. Millions of producers, as before, are not owners of their labor and its results. This labor and its results are appropriated by the bureaucratic system. The preservation of hired labor with the removal of surplus value makes any administrative foci of the type of organization of new federal state systems for the development of entrepreneurship senseless. This is an attempt to maintain, at the expense of the poor taxpayer, a huge army of idlers, who will definitively regulate the pitiful and ugly development of the free market. The introduction of the capitalist system from above on the basis of the collectivization and industrialization model is doomed to failure. The fact that, allegedly, Russia's businessmen are interested in the creation of another bureaucratic monster evokes surprise. As an entrepreneur, who over a period of 8 years has engaged in free economy, I can say one thing: I do not need a state body, which will drive me to capitalism. I think that all entrepreneurs need normal economic laws and taxes and not new bureaucratic administrators. I consider the draft documents on the organization of the "Ministry of Capitalism" a mistake. Such a body under the Government of the Russian Federation can be useful only as a public body not forming part of the authorized staff of the Government of the Russian Federation.
