FR941017-2-00005 FR941017-2-00001 The 1938 Act is silent on the specific weights that should be assigned to each factor but directs that the allotments and allocations should result in fairness, efficiency, and equity. CCC regulations governing the marketing allotments provide for the three factors to be weighted equally or as determined appropriate by CCC for the fiscal year. Equal weights were assigned to each of the factors when allotments were instituted in FY 1993. However, experience gained during the administration of the FY 1993 allotment program made it clear that the use of equal factor weights could result in a disproportionate share of the negative impacts of allotments being placed on a relatively few processors, while other processors who were also expanding production would incur little or no negative impact. Due to this disparate impact, the allotments in FY 1993 also resulted in an increase in refined sugar prices to levels in excess of those needed to achieve the price support and no-cost objectives of the sugar program. This experience indicated that CCC should adjust the weighting of the three factors in light of the data available in order to achieve the statutory goals of fairness, efficiency, and equity in allocating market shares and to avoid driving prices for consumers and industrial users to excessive levels. The Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have also suggested that the factors be weighted differently (e.g., weights of 10 percent for past marketings, 30 percent for processing capacity, and 60 percent for ability to market), based on the premise that sugar delivered to the market by the most efficient processors will result in the lowest prices for users and consumers. The use of equal factor weights for FY 1995 would again restrain marketings by rather few processors and would be inappropriate to ensure a fair, efficient, and equitable sharing of both the burden and benefits of marketing allotments. Equal factor weighting would also be likely to have a much greater price impact than necessary to achieve price-support objectives. CCC has determined that it would be most appropriate, given the relevant statutory purposes and the expected market impact, to provide greater weight on ability to market (50 percent versus 33.3 percent) and less weight on past marketings (25 percent) and processing or refining capacity (25 percent). The estimated restraint on beet sugar marketings would decrease from approximately 195,000 tons, under an equal weighting scheme, to 144,000 tons. Constraining marketings by this amount is expected to have the necessary price impact to deter forfeitures and sufficiently support sugar beet prices while not contributing unnecessarily to inflation and not unduly restraining a small segment of the industry.
