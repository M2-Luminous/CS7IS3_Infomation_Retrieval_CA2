Drop in Production May Mean End to Production of Unnecessary Output"] [Text] The statistics regarding the state of our economy in March can hardly be cause for optimism. Vice Premier A. Shokhin admitted that we have not seen such a slump in production throughout the years of reform. One should not doubt the accuracy of the State Committee for Statistics' [Goskomstat] figures -- the country's main accounts department has been working better and, importantly, more honestly. There is certainly a slump, but what has caused it? Statistics do not provide the answer to this question and that is why it is just as hard to paint a real picture of the situation in our economy as it is to say without knowing the rate of exchange who is richer -- an Italian with 1 million lire or a Turk with 1 million Turkish lire. First it is necessary to compare the figures for the production of various categories of output with the demand for this output. Undoubtedly, a considerable proportion of the decline is due to the fact that production of unnecessary or poor-quality output has stopped and been replaced by imports. This means that a normal market has begun to operate with a manager only buying what he needs. The second reason for the fall in demand is the fact that enterprises are resorting to their own internal stocks: Previously idle machine tools are being started up, dust-covered tires are being supplied from depots, and electric motors that are still fit for work are not being scrapped. This second inhibitor of demand will quite obviously exhaust itself fairly rapidly -- stocks will run out -- and this represents the main potential base for the revival of demand and future economic growth. A third inhibitor will however also manifest itself here -- one that is coming into play even today -- prices. Will enterprises have the money to buy equipment that they really need and that is of really good quality (the same applies to consumer goods for the population)? This question is perhaps the most tricky. Today many enterprises are cutting production and are inundated with goods that are necessary in theory but are failing to find a market owing to their price which potential customers consider to be too high. A kind of "trench war" is under way -- who will sit the other out? In a normal market economy the vendor is usually the first to "give in," lowering prices and guaranteeing himself a profit by increasing turnover. When this mechanism comes into play in our country too, then it will be possible to say that another important element of a civilized market has appeared. But at the moment we evidently cannot do without vigorous intervention on the part of the state. This primarily applies to the rescue and recovery of unviable production units. A second highly important lever for state regulation is credit policy. We have finally managed to get inflation under control -- it has proved possible by targeted efforts to lower the rate from 18 percent in January to 8.7 percent in March. It is quite likely that the rate will be reduced further in the coming months to 5-7 percent. But is that necessary? The leadership of the Ministry of the Economy believes that it is more advisable to slightly raise the rate of inflation once an influx of credit into the most viable sectors and production units has been guaranteed. It is not only "bald" statistics that are needed to adopt such decisions, but also in-depth analysis of what is behind a particular figure. Otherwise decisions are adopted on the basis of the following principle under pressure from sectoral lobbyists: "Everything is collapsing, let us help." Analysis of the economic situation along with the adoption of the corresponding decisions must be prompt and efficient. Production of the Most Important Categories of Industrial Output in the First 20 Days of March 1994 In the first 20 days of March 1994 the average daily volume of production of 13 out of 163 reported categories of output -- 8 percent of the total -- rose compared with the same period in March 1993 (including urban telephone system cables, polypropylene, potash fertilizers, asbestos-cement pipes and sleeves, cotton fabrics, school books, pencils, full-fat cheeses and sheep's milk cheese, and toilet soap), while production of 145 categories of output, or 89 percent, dropped. During this period in March 1994 no tower cranes with a load capacity of eight tonnes or more, no feed-, grain-, and flax-harvesting combines, and no mainline electric locomotives were manufactured.
