FR940613-2-00051 FR940613-2-00032 The noted investment manager, Peter Lynch, describes this problem, and the existing form of conversion generally, in graphic terms. Buying stock in a converting mutual, he writes, is like going to an automobile dealer to buy a car, giving him a check for the purchase price, and discovering on the way home that the dealer has put your check in the glove compartment of the car. Unless the car is an extraordinary lemon, this is bound to be a good deal. And increasing the size of the check_which is what ``disciplining the appraisal process'' amounts to_won't make it stop being a good deal. It is possible that the recent OTS amendments (and the requirements in the FDIC proposed rule mentioned above) which aim to give long-term, local depositors more rights_but within the framework of the existing form of transaction_may produce similarly frustrating results. As noted earlier, ``real'' depositors are not going to benefit, no matter what priorities they receive, because ``real'' depositors still may not subscribe in significant numbers. We believe that ``insider abuse,'' which is the focus of much recent discussion and of several of the OTS amendments and the requirements of the FDIC proposed rule, is only a piece of the problem. In one recent conversion, for example, state authorities forced the institution to rescind stock grants which would have benefited insiders by approximately $40 million. This was laudable. But the ``pop'' in the price of the converted institution's shares benefited those who subscribed by more than $200 million on the first day of trading and by $275 million after one month's trading. All who had their subscriptions filled were depositors_but only 5% of all depositors subscribed. We question whether it can be an adequate response to the trustees' fiduciary duty to deliver that much value to the tiny fraction of a mutual institution's depositors with the capacity to line up and collect it. We continue to believe_as stated in testimony before the Congressional Banking Committees_that the conversion process is fundamentally flawed. Thus, in addition to the proposed rule published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register (which is intended to address concerns within the existing mutual-to-stock conversion framework) we also are issuing this request for comments seeking views on an approach which might address the basic flaws in the existing scheme. The (Misguided) Question of ``Ownership'' The most vexing question facing everyone who has ever dealt with mutual-to-stock conversions is: ``Who owns mutuals?'' That may be the wrong way to ask the question. As indicated earlier, mutuals were originally closer to charities or community organizations than to commercial enterprises. As a by-product of doing what they were founded to do, they have accumulated net worth. The trustees hold that value in trust. The right question more likely should be: ``If the trustees decide to convert, to whom should that value be delivered?'' We believe there are two ways to answer the question: leaving it to the trustees in the reasonable exercise of their fiduciary duty, or legislation. Leaving the decision to the trustees is logical, but may be impractical. The best argument in favor of this approach is that the history and circumstances of institutions vary, that boards are designed to balance competing interests and considerations, that existing law should be adequate to prevent abuse, and that the government should not interfere unless it has to. As different boards of trustees wrestle with the issues, a consensus should tend to emerge. The argument against leaving the decision to the trustees is twofold. Taking the positive view of such boards, it places an unfair burden on them and their institutions. They will be lobbied by potential claimants. Someone will object to whatever decision they make. Taking the skeptical view_and there is no question that some boards have interpreted their fiduciary responsibilities rather loosely_leaving the decision to the trustees is unwise. The FDIC will in the end have to expend significant resources providing informal guidance to the conscientious and making sure that trustees' determinations are reasonable. Some could well believe that the preferable way to answer the question of ``to whom the value should be delivered'' would be legislation. In fact, the main purpose of this notice and request for comments is to solicit views from the public on a legislative proposal that the FDIC could prepare and present to the appropriate legislative body(ies). Legislation could take the form of state law, through which each state would decide the question for the mutual banks it charters (or has chartered), or federal legislation, through which the Congress decides the issue on a nationwide basis. Uniformity argues for federal legislation, but questions of federal preemption of state law would have to be considered. If federal legislation is decided upon, the Congress could either establish in the statute explicit value-distribution rights or authorize the appropriate federal agency (presumably, the FDIC for state savings banks and the OTS for federal and state savings associations) to determine to whom the value of the mutual institution should be delivered.
