Mr. Ka, who made this statement at a meeting with his Malian counterpart Sada Samake, considered these incidents as an alert signal that should prompt the two countries to take effective measures to dissuade those who attempt to breed insecurity along their common border, hence disturbing the peace and tranquility of the border populations. After recalling the instructions given in this regard by President Abdou Diouf during yesterday's cabinet meeting, Djibo Ka reasserted the Senegalese Government's determination to spare no effort in combating banditry and insecurity along the common border. For his part, Sada Samake, Malian territorial administration and security minister stressed the urgent need to implement security measures and to provide the necessary framework for fighting the criminals. "Rigorous measures must be taken to counter acts of vandalism by bandits who are beginning to cause heavy losses in human lives and property," he said in particular. Talks between the two ministers should lead to the adoption of a new strategy to counter vandalism along the common border of the two countries. A final communique will be issued at the end of the talks scheduled for today. The Kidira meeting is the second to be held by the two ministers after the one in Bakel (east Senegal) on 13 January.
