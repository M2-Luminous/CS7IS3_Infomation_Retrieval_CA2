FR940526-0-00004 FR940526-0-00003 5 CFR Part 831 RIN 3206&hyph;AF79 Civil Service Retirement System; Reemployment of Annuitants AGENCY: Office of Personnel Management. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing final regulations concerning the reemployment of disability annuitants. These regulations merely eliminate duplicative regulatory language and are intended to clarify existing regulations. EFFECTIVE DATE: October 22, 1993. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mary Ellen Wilson, (202) 606&hyph;0299. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On September 15, 1993, OPM published a final rule in the Federal Register , (58 FR 48265), that, among other things, added subpart D of part 837 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, concerning reemployment of disability annuitants. This change was effective October 15, 1993. On September 22, 1993, OPM published a final rule in the Federal Register , (58 FR 49177), effective October 22, 1993, that contained §831.1211 entitled ``Reemployment of disability annuitants.'' The September 22 publication contained many, but not all, of the instructions contained in the new subpart D of part 837. The publication of two sets of substantially identical rules on the reemployment of disability annuitants was inadvertent. Retaining these rules in two different parts of the Code of Federal Regulations could cause confusion, especially if a reader were to review §831.1211 alone, and erroneously conclude that he or she had reviewed the entirety of the rules governing reemployment of disability annuitants. Also, the existence of §831.1211 is inconsistent with the Office of Personnel Management's stated intent to incorporate all retirement program rules affecting reemployed annuitants in part 837. Consequently, OPM has decided to delete §831.1211. Under sections 553(b)(3)(B) and 553(d)(3) of title 5, United States Code, I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking and for making these amendments effective October 22, the same effective date as the regulations published on September 22, 1993. Notice of proposed rulemaking is unnecessary because this final rule only corrects nonsubstantive errors in the recently published regulations. This date is appropriate for the same reason. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because the regulation only makes nonsubstantive, technical corrections in regulations which only affect the employment of disability annuitants.
