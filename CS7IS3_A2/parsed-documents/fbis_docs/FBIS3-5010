Australia believes that, being closer to the region, it has developed a greater awareness of these sensitivities and that it has "some perspectives on this that might be usefully conveyed" to Washington. They will be conveyed to a U.S. delegation led by Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Under Secretary of Defence Frank Wisner, who are due in Canberra Monday for bilateral discussions. Warren [Christopher] will leave Wednesday for meetings in Beijing and Tokyo after a day and a half of talks with the Australian delegation led by Foreign Minister Gareth Evans and Defence Minister Robert Ray. It is Australia's first ministerial meeting with senior officials of the Clinton administration following postponement of a talks originally scheduled for Cairns last July. "It's an imporant opportunity for us to reaffirm the alliance ties and for us to have an influence on US policy development," an Australian official told a media briefing here. "One of our objectives is to bolster US perceptions of Australia as an active participant in the region, a responsible player and an ideas generator for the region." Australia will take the opportunity to impress upon its closest ally and largest trading partner after Japan the view that it should work to sustain what is seen as a well respected role as a regional force for stability. "For that to be sustained I think the US has got to show an awareness of regional concerns and regional sensitivities, something we feel that we in Australia have developed a little more of in recent years," said the official. Australia would not lecture the United States, but wanted to indicate its view that Washington is still needed and wanted as a major player in the region. Canberra is also keen on the eve of Christopher's visit to Tokyo to see an early settlement of the US-Japan trade dispute over the trade imbalance favouring Japan. Australia did not take sides and supported Washington in its efforts to open Japanese markets further and bring Japan more into the sort of trading patterns that exist elsewhere. But the official added that Australia also shared Japanese concerns about the imposition of quantitative indicators in particular market sectors. Canberra's view is that if Japan opens its markets in particular areas they should be open to all countries, not just the United States, and if their dispute cannot be resolved it might be referred to the GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade). Canberra will also raise the issue of renewal by Washington of its Most Favoured Nations (MFN) trading status in China, which is dependent on a judgment about human rights. "There are also questions of sanctions that the US has in place against high technology exports because China has refused to commit itself to the missile technology control regime guidelines, something which affects us," the official said. Australia had human rights concerns with China, but did not tie them to trade, the official said, commenting: "In essence we are singing from the same songbook, but we don't have a linkage with trade."
