By developing the spirit of showing utter devotion to each other and sharing honor and disgrace, all participants at the meeting exchanged frank and candid views on the proposed personnel arrangements in accordance with the spirit of the CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee. They held unanimously that the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee convening such a consultation meeting is undoubtedly of great significance in uniting all forces that can be united, mobilizing all positive factors that can be mobilized, and successfully furthering all types of work in Hubei. Secretary Guan Guangfu also delivered a speech in which he explained to the non-CPC personages a series of work arrangements made by the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee for this year; spelt out specific requirements on the forthcoming provincial people's congress session and CPPCC committee session; and also gave an account of some relevant personnel arrangements. Guan Guangfu said: Since the end of last year, the provincial party committee and people's government have made a series of work arrangements and worked out a number of grand plans for both 1994 and the next few years. The whole province should now strive to arrive at the following unnanimous understanding: It is necessary to persist in reform and carry on development in light of Hubei's actual conditions, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and in accordance with the spirit of the CPC Central Committee and the spirit of the Hubei Provincial CPC Committee. Guan Guangfu pointed out: Since Comrade Deng Xiaoping made a series of important speeches during his south China tour last year, Hubei has enjoyed faster economic growth and an excellent momentum in economic growth. Thus, we should make every possible endeavor to safeguard, with one heart and one mind, such an excellent situation; carry on development; maintain the current excellent momentum of economic growth; and open up new vistas for, and successfully further and accelerate, Hubei's economic growth with an eye on further raising Hubei's economic efficiency. Guan Guangfu noted: In order to maintain an excellent momentum in economic growth, it is imperative to implement to the letter all relevant reform measures and properly handle relations between reform, development, and stability. In order to maintain stability, it is imperative to tackle all new situations and new problems in a timely manner and press ahead with development. Reform and opening up constitute the motive force for development. We should strive to persist in reform and expand opening up this year. I hope that all democratic party members will join hands with us in pushing forward Hubei's reform and opening up. Speaking of the upcoming provincial people's congress session and CPPCC committee session, Guan Guangfu asserted: This year, we're going to hold these two important sessions earlier than usual because we need to make work arrangements for this year ahead of schedule. The two upcoming sessions will abide by all the relevant legislative procedures when arranging Hubei's work in 1994. I hope that all the provincial people's congress deputies and CPPCC committee members will be able to conscientiously deliberate and discuss the forthcoming provincial government work report and work hard to turn the upcoming two sessions into two successful sessions marked by solidarity. The provincial CPPCC committee leadership will, as expected, be further perfected, thereby becoming more capable of catering to the growing needs of Hubei's CPPCC work. I hope that all comrades concerned will make concerted and unreserved efforts to attain this goal. Wang Qigang and Meng Meilu, provincial CPPCC committee vice chairmen and some others also attended this morning's political consultation meeting.
