The ganja was contained in 23 separate bags that were marked `Jamaica' on the outside said a police source. The ganja appeared to be professionally packaged and intended for transhipment to another destination, most likely the U.S., he said. Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts could not be reached for comment on the discovery. In the past, Mr. Cutts has said the large amounts of ganja found on Cayman beaches indicate the islands are being used to ship drugs from Jamaica and Honduras to the U.S. through Miami. Travellers from Grand Cayman are seldom detained and searched when clearing Customs at Miami International Airport.
