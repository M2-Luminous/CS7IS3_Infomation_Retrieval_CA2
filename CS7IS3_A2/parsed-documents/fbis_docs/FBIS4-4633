FBIS4-4633 "dreas064_d_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-064 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 South Korea Official on Talks Precondition Official on Talks Precondition SK0404023394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO in Korean 4 Apr 94 p 1 SK0404023394 Seoul CHOSON ILBO Korean BFN [By Ho Yong-pom] [Text] Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong strongly indicated on 3 April that the ROK and the United States may change their existing policy of demanding the special envoy exchange as a precondition of North Korea-U.S. talks by saying: "Although the special envoy exchange between the North and the South still remains a precondition to the third round of North Korea-U.S. talks, a broad discussion including the de-linking of the two is possible and should be done." Attending a discussion meeting on the North Korean nuclear issue among opposition and ruling party lawmakers held at Academy House in Suyuri, Seoul on the afternoon of 3 April, Vice Minister Hong said: "It will be more advantageous to omit the precondition of the special envoy exchange and adopt a package deal of `guaranteeing the diplomatic relations with the United States under the condition of the assurance of nuclear transparency' because the latter provides a more justifiable basis for imposing stronger sanctions in case North Korea refuses nuclear reinspection." Vice Minister Hong's remarks are noteworthy because it has been learned that the government has been recently reviewing a plan to simultaneously hold the special envoy exchange between the North and the South and the third-round North Korea-U.S. talks if North Korea accepts additional inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Vice Minister Hong backed up the speculation that the de-linking is being studied by saying, "Behind-the-scenes dialogue for the third-round North Korea-U.S. talks is still underway between working-level officials of the two sides. For now, we do not intend to propose dialogue to the North first." Vice Minister Hong also said, "Had the nuclear issue not come up, our government would have followed its policy to actively help the establishment of diplomatic relations between the North and the United States from the very beginning of the regime."
