The meeting was to concentrate on possible ways of settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. Armenia accounted for its refusal by the fact that Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian community was barred from negotiations, while Armenia thinks it necessary to grant this community the status of a party in the conflict, Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry reported tonight.
