A regular officer with 25 years of experience and an Afghan War veteran, he consolidated his position and influence both in Moldova and Moscow during the armed conflict between Kishinev and Tiraspol in 1992. This is why he can take the liberty of making judgments that do not become military officials, and particularly commanders of foreign troops... People have different opinions about General Lebed, ranging from a boorish soldier to a man capable of replacing Pavel Grachev. General Lebed gave an interview on the eve of legislative elections in Moldova at the 14th Russian Army Headquarters in Tiraspol, sitting under the Russian flag and a large poster depicting the Kremlin. We preserved the general's style of speech throughout the interview. [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Comrade commander, Moldovan President Mircea Snegur said he would press for the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Moldova in 1994... [Lebed] I got you. As they say, desires do not always match abilities. When I am asked whether it is good when the Army of one state is on the territory of another state, I answer "no." Should it be pulled out? Yes, it should. When it should be pulled out is a separate question. This should be done when all political and economic conditions for the pullout are in place; when, for example, one can get a sufficient number of trains here and then dispatch them to new stationing sites so that local women do not assault our units, as was the case before... Those conditions are not yet met! Why not? Just because a year and a half of peace brought no results; negotiations are in a deadlock with no progress in sight. As for economic conditions, Shevardnadze from Georgia babbled much about them -- hundreds of thousands of officers are left without jobs, apartments, and any prospects for the future. This kind of withdrawal is even more unacceptable. There is also a diplomatic side to the whole problem. What would Ukraine say, if I started to transport weapons and ammunition through its territory? After all, its railroads will be jammed with dangerous cargo. There is a technical side to this problem. Considering the railroads and loading sites available and the huge amount of weapons, this transportation would require two solid years of around-the-clock work -- day and night, and no holidays... So, who can ever talk here about the summer of 1994? Besides, you cannot utilize the ammunition here. They would not listen to any arguments, and only go like, Get out of here and period. I think it is an election campaign ploy. [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Some politicians -- in particular, Brigitte Schultz who is the leader of a NATO group observing elections in Moldova -- believe that the presence of the 14th Russian Army in the Dniester region will complicate Russia's participation in the "Partnership for Peace." [Lebed] Brigitte Schultz is no authority to me. Besides, women should move their butts out of this place, and not stick their noses into the dog's turd. She is threatening us? Let her come down here and try to pull this Army out. The former Soviet Army withdrew from Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Germany, Mongolia, and Cuba. This was the first wave, and then the second one followed. The withdrawal of the Western Group of Troops is to be completed by 1 September, and the Northwestern Group of Troops is now being withdrawn from the Baltics. All this crush of officers, warrant officers, military equipment, and wild homeless officers... With a severe economic crisis crippling Russia and Ukraine, this problem will not be solved quickly. And it must be solved in a civilized manner. When the British Rhein Army had to be pulled out from Germany two years ago, the British estimated that this would require nine years. Germans checked it out and agreed. This is what I call a civilized approach. [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] Who could replace the 14th Army in the future? UN peacekeeping forces, maybe? [Lebed] Let us take it for granted that not long ago, we were citizens of one state, therefore we can come to terms more quickly and easily than any Americans, Germans, or Englishmen. Take, for example, the trilateral peacekeeping posts of Russians, Dniester Russians, and Moldovans. If they want to get smashed, they do it together, so there are no ethnic problems among them. Their commanders know each other, too, because they used to serve in the same army. A steady balance of forces has been established in this region. If you drastically disturb it... For example, suppose there is no 14th Army as of tomorrow. This will immediately instigate a temptation to solve long-standing problems in one fell swoop. Someone will have to fill the vacuum. No action, however tough and swift, can be victorious. That is a tough place around here -- everyone would always owe something to everyone. European borders were drawn and redrawn after numerous wars. Here, you can prove that white is either white or black, depending on how old your map is. This is why this place can become another Yugoslavia. Personally, I don't see any possibility as to how to pull my Army out of this region. Even if someone new comes tomorrow to lead it, he would not see, either. The humiliatingly short record time for withdrawal from foreign countries often brought about a problem of, say, how to dissolve a division in two months. Servicemen were asked then where they came from. Are you guys from Tiraspol? Come to the 14th Army commander, he will find you a place. As a result, 51 percent of officers and 79 percent of warrant officers in my Army come from this region. This is one whole jumble -- the Army is Russian, its commander's last name is Lebed, his combat deputy is Melnychuk, and his logistic deputy is Perepadya. All of them have numerous relatives in nearby Ukraine. Generally speaking, this is paranoia that needs to be blown away as soon as possible. Ukrainians, Russians, Belarusians are all Slavs with one fate, blood, and faith. We should think of what unites us, and not the other way around. What we are doing right now is separating them as Siamese twins that have two heads and one body. If separated, both of them will be nothing but hideous freaks. So, we are working now on the freaks. [KIEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI] What are the relations between the 14th Army command and the Dniester leadership? [Lebed] Relations with the Dniester Republic of Moldova [PRM] have never been cloudless. They introduced some dumb money and meddled in someone else's business by sending some hundred soldiers to the White House in October. They bring in some citizenship and pass weird laws, privatizing the 30-km-stretch of the Russian gas pipe line in the region. They took under their jurisdiction the air space over their republic without even having an airport and planes. I refused to be a PRM deputy because I am against the boorish interference with affairs of the state that I serve. It is up to Russia what president and parliament to elect. No Swedes, Czechs, or Dniester residents have the right to decide this.
