The ANC currently has about 1,200 employees in its service. BEELD has been informed that the party intends trimming down full time staff to less than 100. ANC Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa yesterday said at a news conference that the reorganization of the ANC will come into effect form 1 October. ?? Among others things the ANC's 14 regions will be reduced to the nine provinces, and the ANC's departments will be reduced to six departments. The department responsible for MK [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing], for instance, will be disbanded. Mr. Ramaphosa said those workers who will be dismissed will get settlement packages retroactive from July this year. "They are good packages." He said the ANC has not yet determined how many posts there will be after the reorganization. He mentioned as an example that the ANC currently has 13 drivers, but after reorganization there will be only four. All posts will be advertised and preference will be given to the retrenched workers who apply for the posts. BEELD has been told that the ANC intends to bring salaries for the posts on par with those earned by MP's. There have been many complaints among ANC members whose contention was that "they had made the same sacrifices in the liberation struggle, and yet they were earning far less than ANC members elected to Parliament." -- The ANC has a big problem in many of its regions with debt accrued during the run-up to the election. The ANC is looking at "creative methods for handling the debt." -- The ANC's head office remains at Shell House in Johannesburg. The organization will, however, now occupy considerably less office space. The ANC is to start a "sub-office" in Cape Town. -- The ANC wants to extend its ties with the South African Communist Party, COSATU [Congress of South African Trade Unions], the broader democratic movement and community organizations, and will ensure that it remains their undisputed leader. -- The ANC's national conference, at which a new national executive committee is to be elected, will be held from 17 to 22 December. -- The ANC's national working committee of 26 people is to be expanded to also include cabinet members, deputy ministers, and provincial premiers who had not been members of the working committee up to now.
