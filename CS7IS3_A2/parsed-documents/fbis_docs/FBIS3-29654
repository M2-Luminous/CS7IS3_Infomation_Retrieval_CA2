North Korea said it would issue visas to IAEA inspectors in the near future, and the speculation was that the team would be able to enter Pyongyang via Beijing this weekend. But as of Saturday morning, no news on the visas had arrived. A Foreign Ministry official said nothing will happen this week. The timing of the IAEA's entry into North Korea is a crucial point because the agency's Board of Governors meets from Monday. The international community expected Pyongyang to quickly issue the visas so the inspection process could begin before the board meeting, whose main topic is the North Korean nuclear issue. Only limited flights are available to Pyongyang from Beijing. Even if the inspectors received visas early next week, the flight schedule would allow them to enter North Korea only toward the weekend, which would come after the IAEA board meeting closes. Then why the delay? Analysts here offer various reasons. First, some say North Korean supreme leader Kim Il-song took over the nuclear negotiations from his son and heir-apparent, Kim Chong-il. Confusion arose from this change, as attested by North Korean officials in New York and at the truce village of Panmunjom who were apparently left in the dark about Pyongyang's decision to accept IAEA inspections. Even Ho Chong, North Korean deputy chief of mission to the United Nations and representative at working-level contacts with U.S. officials, was unaware of the decision. North Korean military officials recently contacted at Panmunjom didn't even know their government had invited U.S. representative Ronald Dellums to visit, according to sources in the Military Armistice Commission (MAC). Dellums, who was to arrive in North Korea last week, was known to have cancelled his plans when Pyongyang failed to issue a visa at the last minute, without giving any reason. North Korean negotiators recently asked the U.S. side to present its demands on paper, an uncommon practice. The analysts say a new situation has developed in North Korea, requiring that all reports to superiors be made on paper instead of verbally as had been the case, backing up their theory of confusion in the hierarchy. Others say all the delay is due to a much simpler reason -- North Korea was "on vacation" to celebrate Kim Chong-il's birthday Feb. 16. The entire nation kow-towed for three days for the junior Kim's birthday last year, and all administrative affairs were frozen during the period. This year is no exception, they say, and visas for the IAEA inspectors will be issued as soon as the regular workweek begins next Monday.
