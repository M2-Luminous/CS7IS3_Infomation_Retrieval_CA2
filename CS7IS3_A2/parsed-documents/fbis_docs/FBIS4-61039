"We have signed a memorandum on the creation of the holding company," Nikolay Bekh said in conversation with this IZVESTIYA correspondent. "We share many problems with `VAZ.' For instance, a whole number of associated plants supply their output to `VAZ' and `KamAZ' simultaneously. And both motor vehicle plants have an interest in supporting these suppliers. Or take a common problem such as capacity utilization at our own enterprises, instrument-making, and machine-tool-building plants. We will compile a common cyclical timetable for the preparation of new vehicles -- both trucks and cars -- and will make sure that these plants are operating to full capacity. "One other problem is our representation abroad. Both auto giants maintain their own subunits in many countries to deal with spares, repairs, and advertising -- and this expenditure will be reduced if these efforts are combined." The idea of pooling the motor plants' efforts has been around for a long time, but, as Bekh said, when state enterprises collaborate, ambitions often prevail -- who is more important, more significant, older.... But when enterprises are floated, people start primarily counting the money and looking to see what is more profitable. A vivid example of this is that, barely having agreed to set up a holding company, "KamAZ" and "VAZ" adopted an agreement which people had tried unsuccessfully to achieve for seven years -- it was decided to set up a joint company to produce "Oka" cars. "We had each made these cars at our own plans, now assembly will take place solely at `KamAZ'," Nikolay Bekh explained. "We have built a new block, the `VAZ' will transfer their welding equipment to us and increase engine production. We are setting ourselves the target of producing 75,000 vehicles a year." In uniting to solve specific problems, "KamAZ" and "VAZ" are in no way losing their independence. It is merely a question of coordinating their common financial interests. Having won the stockholders' support, Nikolay Bekh supposes that the final signing of the documents setting up the Volga-Kama financial and industrial group will take place no later than May.
