He appealed to people's deputies and journalists not to support abortion, while voting on the draft constitution that is to be adopted by our parliament. I will recall that in their ballots, deputies are being asked to define their position on the legislative, executive, and juridical authorities of the Republic of Belarus, and respond to whether our state should become a presidential republic. The results of the voting will be announced next week. Having heard the speeches delivered in the miscellaneous section, deputies continued the debate on amendments to the electoral law. After that, they began to discuss the Supreme Soviet draft resolution on the volume of foreign debt and trends in the use and repayments of foreign credits. The draft resolution specifies that the volume of foreign debt of the Republic of Belarus will amount to $2 billion until the end of 1994. [passage omitted] Because today is Friday, deputies voted to shorten the working day. The session concluded at 1700 [1200 GMT]. Deputies will reconvene at the Oval Hall of the House of Government next Tuesday.
