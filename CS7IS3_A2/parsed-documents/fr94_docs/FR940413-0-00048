FR940413-0-00048 FR940413-0-00014 DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 75 Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act Regional Centers Program AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Waiver of a rule. SUMMARY: The Department waives the rule at 34 CFR 75.261 in order to extend the project period under the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (DFSCA) Regional Centers Program from 48 months to 60 months. This action will allow services under this program to continue uninterrupted, and will result in the awarding of 12-month continuation awards to each of the five existing grantees, using fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 13, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Kimberly C. Light, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202&hyph;6439. Telephone: (202) 260&hyph;2647. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regional Centers Program is authorized by sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA, which is part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). Appropriations for the Regional Centers Program were authorized through September 30, 1993 by the DFSCA. Section 414 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA) authorizes an automatic extension of the DFSCA through FY 1994 (September 30, 1994). The Congress is considering reauthorization of the DFSCA, but final action on the reauthorization is not expected until late in FY 1994. In FY 1990, the Department awarded cooperative agreements for five Regional Centers to provide training and technical assistance services in drug education and prevention to State educational agencies, local educational agencies, and institutions of higher education. The centers were each given a project period of 48 months, based on the project period announced in the Friday, September 15, 1989 Federal Register . Since FY 1990, these centers have been maintained through continuation awards in three subsequent fiscal years (FY 1991, FY 1992, and FY 1993). Each center has received approximately $3 million per year. Based on the automatic extension authorized under section 414 of GEPA, projects authorized under sections 5111(a)(1) and 5135 of the DFSCA can be funded in FY 1994 as well. Any funding after FY 1994 would be dependent on future Congressional action with no guarantee that projects funded under the current authorization could be supported. If a new competition under the existing legislation were held in FY 1994, the projects could only be funded for a limited project period of 12 months. In the past, it has taken new centers up to a year to ``start up,'' given the scope and complexity of the services they provide and the time it takes to hire qualified staff and develop plans and relationships that are responsive to clients in their regions. The Assistant Secretary believes that starting new centers in FY 1994 for only 12 months would severely disrupt the quality and level of center services. Holding a competition in FY 1994 would impose considerable costs at the Federal level without a guarantee that the new centers would be able to provide the technical assistance necessary to school districts, as the Department moves to implement Goals 2000 and the new ESEA. Therefore, the Assistant Secretary, in the best interests of the Federal Government, extends the current projects for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This action is consistent with the President's mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions, the Assistant Secretary waives the rule at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no cost to the Federal Government. In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary waives 34 CFR 75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers Program during FY 1994. On January 18, 1994 the Assistant Secretary published a notice proposing this waiver in the Federal Register (59 FR 2549). Public Comment In the notice, the Assistant Secretary invited comments on the proposed waiver. Seven parties submitted comments and all supported the proposal to waive the rule and extend the current project period for one additional year. The Assistant Secretary has made no changes in the waiver since publication of the proposed notice. Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 This waiver has been examined under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 and has been found to contain no information collection requirements. Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with this order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program. Assessment of Educational Impact In the notice proposing this waiver, the Assistant Secretary requested comments on whether the proposed waiver would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based upon the response to the proposed waiver and on its own review, the Department has determined that this waiver does not require information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States.
