It goes without saying that it is. The only question is -- how. These days I am in constant telephone contact with the alliance's press service, which, in its turn, sends out daily reports on Bosnia by fax or by express mail. Here, for example, is one of the latest reports containing information on Wednesday's North Atlantic Council session on this subject. It took place after several demarches by Moscow and the statement by President Yeltsin, who was unhappy that the West had made the decision to bomb the Serb positions without consulting with Russia. There was also a statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry, which warned against any new NATO ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, and the session of the State Duma which condemned NATO's raids. What decisions were reached in Brussels against that backdrop? As for new ultimatums -- nothing was decided. None of the 16 member countries even raised that question either with regard to Gorazde or to other regions declared "safe areas" by the United Nations. Obviously there is no need for that because, unlike the situation around Sarajevo, the mechanism for the use of force in the Gorazde region could be worked out without prior threats. Now about the raids themselves. On the eve of Wednesday's North Atlantic Council session I talked about this with several NATO diplomats. Some shrug their shoulders in incomprehension, others spread their hands in equal bewilderment, while others answer the question with a question: "What do you want? After all, the legal basis for this exists and Moscow itself took part in its creation." In view of Russia's interests in the Balkans one can and undoubtedly should be incensed at NATO's bombing raids and condemn them, but that should be done now, before it is too late. In the recent past those who are responsible for Russian foreign policy had somewhat different priorities in the Bosnian crisis and in relations with the West in general than they do now. Is it not clear that it is largely due to those priorities that NATO, without abandoning strong-arm decisions in principle, has managed not only to create for itself the image of a "Balkan peacemaker" but also to ensure for itself an international legal basis for practical "assistance in establishing peace" in the former Yugoslavia? That is how NATO regards UN Security Council Resolution 836 adopted on 4 June 1993 in connection with the raids in the Gorazde region. Russia voted for it. A mistake? Moscow prefers not to talk openly about that right now, but you can judge for yourselves. The NATO people, however, with such a "legal backing" behind them, are saying clearly: "We are acting on the basis of the Security Council decision in giving `close air support' to the UN forces in Bosnia when danger threatens them. These actions are being carried out with the sanction of the UN Secretary General's representative and the UN command in Bosnia. We are merely carrying out orders." In such a situation what need is there for consultations with Russia?
