[passage omitted] [Munoz] [passage omitted] The PPD is a new party that has no connections to any previous or current governments. We are going to change the country politically and socially. States that control their economic systems are more likely in the long-term to create more problems than they resolve. This is best exemplified by the defunct Soviet Union, although our country is also a good example. We all witnessed the statism that was in place over the past two decades. Panama, because of its history, nature, and geography, has had an economy different from that of other countries. The only way we can continue growing is by meeting our needs and by looking after the welfare of our citizens, and not by trying to satisfy or accept the demands imposed by other nations. The size of our bureaucracy must be reduced as much as possible to eliminate positions that have redundant duties and to prevent bureaucratic delays. In the long-term, the only way to improve the standard of living for the Panamanian people is by way of education, which must include diverse disciplines, such as the humanities, arts, technology, and science. In the short-term, the only way to improve living standards is by creating jobs immediately, and this is best done via state investment. State investment generates a great deal of manual labor and jobs. Our platform on the Panama Canal, military bases, foreign debt, agriculture, transportation, justice, and other issues will be discussed at the forums to which we have been invited. We will attend all of these, except those that may be manipulated to promote a particular candidate. Panamanians are the only ones that will decide who the winner will be on 8 May. Thank you very much. [Eisenmann] Our next speaker will be Samuel Lewis Galindo, candidate for the Solidarity Party [PS] and the National Unity Mission [MUN]. [passage omitted] [Lewis Galindo] Good evening, fellow Panamanians. Panamanians are facing a difficult crossroads. PS and MUN have shown the country a comprehensive development plan that proposes the modernization of all organizations of the Panamanian state. This program proposes the government's decentralization, granting broad and true authority to the governors in order that they become the foremost authorities in the provinces. We also will give honest assistance to corregimiento representatives, because they are more aware of the needs of the people in low-income areas. Our comprehensive development plan also touches on the administrative career. Public employees must have the same guarantees, security, and incentives that private sector workers do thanks to the union bargaining agreements. We have proposed an all-out war against unemployment. We have talked about and continue to uphold the need to have an emergency plan that gives immediate jobs to 50,000 Panamanians. These 50,000 Panamanians would be recruited directly from low-income areas. In this way, we would be tackling the social problem and the unemployment problem. We are basing our foreign policy on one word -- dignity. We cannot permit ourselves to move from being an enclave managed by a foreign power -- in this case, the United States -- to an enclave currently managed by an elite that caters solely to self-interests. The profits generated by the canal and its bordering areas must benefit all Panamanians. We are not going to create two different castes on our own territory. Canal revenues must be invested mainly in education, which constitutes the best investment the Panamanian Government can make. All of these plans can only be implemented if there is a national consensus. We do not foster hatred, engage in fruitless disputes, or have a past of which we are ashamed. Having said this, I believe we can implement these plans with Panama's militant forces, such as the unions, farmers, teachers, nurses, and all others who believe they have a civic duty to support a program such as ours. I ask them: Can others carry out these plans? Can others who speak and promote hatred rather than unity among Panamanians achieve these goals we have presented? Along with my party and its candidates, I need your help. We need your votes. We need you to help us reach power to enable us to serve Panama and not to simply take advantage of the nation. Thank you very much and good evening. [Eisenmann] We have just heard from Samuel Lewis Galindo. Ernesto Perez Balladares, the next candidate to speak, represents the PRD [Democratic Revolutionary Party], PALA [Labor Party], and Liberal Republican Party. [passage omitted] [Perez Balladares] Fellow citizens, the country cannot continue living in the past or continue to waste its energy on political recrimination, revenge, persecution, or the settling of accounts. I have been, and I am sure I will continue to be, the target of insults and slander. Nevertheless, this will not make me turn away from the path I have chosen. No matter how many provocations I have to face, and no matter how frequent the harassment becomes, I reiterate my pledge to citizens that I will not permit, much less encourage, political persecution against today's political adversaries or the representatives of the current government. Our proposal is designed to resolve the Panamanians' fundamental problem -- namely, unemployment -- with initiatives that do not necessarily entail state expenditures. The construction of infrastructure projects necessary for development, such as roads to bring produce to markets, as well as the Panama City-Colon, David-Paso Canoas, and Chorrera-Arraijan highways, must be joint efforts shared between the government and private enterprise. We already have concrete proposals for this. I only mention this because these projects are a priority and at the same time create jobs in the short-term. Nevertheless, our platform is much broader. It includes training programs and the modernization of education to guarantee adequate training for the jobs of the future. It also entails the best use of the reverted areas of the canal in order that this wealth, which belongs to all of us, will benefit everyone. I cannot initiate any government action without attending to the people's basic needs. For me it is unacceptable to have the government earmark more than $1 billion for the payment of debts to international financial organizations while not having the same concern in looking after the large segments of the population in urban and rural areas which do not have a water supply system, or if they do, they only have it for limited and unscheduled periods of time. This country cannot begin the 21st century without having resolved such a fundamental and basic problem for the health and well-being of the population. I do not plan to evade international obligations, and I understand the course the economy is taking very well. Therefore, I can categorically state that it is possible to honor international commitments and at the same time deal with the people's most urgent problems. It is also possible to modernize the economy without leaving agricultural producers without protection. Economic opening must be carried out gradually by discussing national interests and applying clear and specific regulations. In addition to training programs for the future, a coherent and comprehensive government plan should include immediate initiatives to prevent young people from becoming victims of vice, worsening the already worrisome problem of family disintegration. A single institution should centralize efforts to promote sports, develop cultural programs, and foster family values among young people. If we are going to directly attack the generalized corruption we are experiencing today, there must be exemplary and harsh punishment for the guilty. Nevertheless, we must also invest in the comprehensive upbringing of the men and women of the future. In the same way that drug trafficking is combated in the streets and in the ports, we have to adopt heroic measures to prevent money laundering in all of its forms, especially within the Colon Free Zone and within the financial system, because the very existence of those sources of employment and wealth depend on the decisions we make to clean up these areas. We are also concerned about the lack of security that worries every sector of society. The Panamanian people have ended up being frightened men and women because we always feel threatened by the possibility of being robbed, kidnapped, raped, or murdered. We plan to return security to everyone, not because it is a requirement for investment, but because it is an inalienable right of all Panamanians. Our decision not to stir up the past does not mean we will not try to correct the injustices that have been committed. One of them, if not the main one, is the infamy of increasing the retirement age for men and women. With a little more creativity, with greater leeway in negotiating, and, most of all, with more social sensitivity, the retirement age problem can be studied more thoroughly and better solutions can be sought. Fellow citizens, I foresee better days for the country. Our commitment to democracy means there will not be a return to authoritarian forms of power or to practices incompatible with respect for human rights. To what we do indeed have to return to, and return to soon, is a government that leads the country by way of consulting the people, not at the time of elections, but when decisions are made. [Eisenmann] The next candidate who will speak is Ruben Blades, candidate of the Papa Egoro Movement. [passage omitted] [Blades] For 90 years of republican life, the nation's political parties have failed in the task of resolving the Panamanian nation's fundamental problems. Papa Egoro, which was born as an independent movement, made the decision to become a political party to legalize its participation in the electoral process which will end on 8 May. Our objective is to reach government to govern with responsibility and correctly manage our country. This is what makes us different from the other political parties. They have not governed and do not want to govern. They want to reach power to repeat what they have always done. The traditional political parties are no different from one another. The results of their experience in the government clearly shows this. All of them are part of the failure to which they led the country's public administration today and yesterday. The only way to fulfill our principles and objectives for the country is to continue being independent. We continue to be free of ties to the present and past petty politicking, and, above all, we have no hatreds, selfish ambitions, or desire for revenge, which are the things that prevent true national reconciliation. National reconciliation is the only thing that can guarantee that all Panamanians have the opportunity to work as a great national team for a better future. The system of petty politics that prevails in the country wants you to believe that our project is impossible because we are a new party. It wants you to believe that the only thing that is important is to have the so-called political experience. It only wants you to believe that decency is madness and that the existing corruption is the product of involuntary mistakes, as if the act of governing were a game without referees or penalties and where one can cheat. They want you to believe that in these elections we can only choose between two options of the past, both of which have failed. The Papa Egoro Movement has not been created to replace a government with another. It has been created because the country needs and wants to change the way that things have been done so far. We propose concerted efforts in the national interest and the participation of the best men and women from all parties and leanings to form an honest and capable administrative team unprecedented in Panama. The Papa Egoro Movement offers itself as common ground where all Panamanians can sow the seed of national hope and see the growth of the tree that will shelter all of us with prosperity, health, and confidence in the future of our mother earth. This is possible because the Papa Egoro Movement does not owe its existence to any special group. The Papa Egoro Movement does not have to pay any political debts, nor does it owe positions or privileges to anyone because of financial support. This is what makes a party truly independent. Do you know the real responsibility we face in the 1994 elections? We need to change the reality of a country that is used to voting against something or someone and not in favor of good proposals. Unfortunately, in our country the presidents have been generally elected as an act of choosing a lesser evil rather than choosing the best. Let us not commit the same mistake. Finally, remember you will not only be voting for a president. Each vice president is a possible president and, therefore, will govern and publicly represent the majesty of the country. In this sense, we must carefully study what each presidential slate offers. Do you know who are the vice presidential candidates of the various parties? Do they adequately represent the capacity, honesty, sincerity, and dedication to work for all Panamanians? Do they represent a new image that will enable our country to again be credible and that will make us confident and proud of ourselves? The country can speak with pride about Fernando Manfredo and Ricardo Bermudez, who form part of our work team. People, our intention is pure, our effort is sincere, and our dedication is absolute. The Papa Egoro Movement represents the possibility of victory of decency and true civic spirit. Papa Egoro really represents everyone's victory. Thank you very much. [Eisenmann] We just heard from Ruben Blades. Now Eduardo Vallarino, presidential candidate for the Christian Democratic Party, will take the floor. [passage omitted] [Vallarino] [passage omitted] Our government plan is founded on the firm conviction that the single most important asset a country can have is its people, and only by giving them the best possible opportunities can sustained and sustainable development be achieved. Under our government plan, creating jobs is a top priority to halt the family disintegration process that unemployment entails. It is the private sector, however, that can and must provide the most and best job opportunities. This requires a more competent government economic policy and improvements to Panama's current judicial stability image. Therefore, these two issues are priorities. High employment and progress rates are sustainable only if we have a healthy population. Therefore, health and malnutrition are also priority matters. [passage omitted]. We submit that health investment, particularly preventive heath care, will require an even greater effort by the government. The number of health care centers operating properly must continue to increase throughout the country. A health plan requires a competent social security system. We propose the greatest possible independence for the Social Security Fund to isolate it from political interests. Furthermore, not only are we offering to restore the retirement benefits and ages that were changed, but we also propose to increase coverage in certain services through the implementation of an operationally independent administration. [passage omitted] We are addressing the housing problem starting with the premise that neither the government or the private sector have the financial capability to balance the enormous housing deficit at a price accessible to the majority of Panamanians. Based on this, our proposal is directed at promoting self-help and loan programs to provide homes for the poverty stricken sector. The state must provide priority attention to the more acute housing problems to provide solutions for those living in extreme poverty, at a price they can pay. [passage omitted] Sound preschool, elementary, and junior high school education must be made available to the greatest possible number of students. A significant level of participation by the private sector will be necessary in high school and technical education. [passage omitted] Security for the Panama Canal requires a specialized police force. We do not need an army because outside threats are covered in the Panama Canal treaties and should be included in a wise foreign policy. The Panama Canal and its reverted areas are the single most important challenge for the new government. The canal administration must be isolated from partisan greed. The canal's work force must be protected and well compensated so the best Panamanians can feel secure working for the commission. The reverted areas are our main opportunity to really take advantage of our geographical position. This will only be true if we use it to replace and surpass the benefits we now receive from the U.S. military presence. [passage omitted] [Eisenmann] We will now hear from Ruben Dario Carles, presidential candidate for the National Renewal Movement, the Nationalist Liberal Republican Movement, and the Civic Renewal Party. [passage omitted] [Carles] Fellow citizens: On 8 May, we will all go to the polls and make a very important decision for the present and the future of all Panamanians. For the first time in 25 years, we are going to freely elect the government we want. That government will have the enormous responsibility of guiding our future and prepare us for the present challenges. What is at stake is far too delicate not to be taken seriously. Not only does the consolidation of democracy as a system of government depend on the decision we make, but also our well being, prosperity, and future, and that of our children. In choosing a president, we must take into account each candidate's qualities as a statesman, their background, moral authority, government proposals, and the team he or she will work with to meet their goals toward a better life for all and particularly for our children. It is equally important to know each candidate's past as well as their views on the future to elect the best president. Neither I nor those who accompany me in this quest have absolutely anything to hide or fear from our past. It is no secret to you that any government program is worthless if the candidates, the work teams, and the government teams behind it lack the necessary personal qualities to direct and execute it. We have the experience, efficiency, character, and the personal will and honesty that the nation demands of its president. The people can rest assured that the proposed government plan will in fact be completed. Our civic and democratic convictions explain why we were never repressed during the 21 years of the military dictatorship this country endured. We never collaborated with generals, colonels, or lieutenants. I, along with my compatriots, experienced exile and was stripped of my civil rights. The seriousness of our government programs assures us sufficient national and international trust to attract investments. Without such investment there will not be enough new jobs to improve the quality of life of all Panamanian families within the urgent timeframe we require. My friends, job and housing shortages, limited public transportation service, the absence of urban sanitation, the deficiencies in basic services such as health, education, social security, water, power, and the administration of justice are problems that cry out for immediate solutions, decisions, and investment. We will maintain the present number of jobs in the agricultural and livestock sector by controlling basic products, specifically meat, milk, rice, sorghum, corn, beans, potatoes, and onions. We will do so in an effort to find efficient and reasonable costs for the farmers and fair prices for the consumer. There is no need to tell you how important the public force issue is for all of us. We guarantee that it will be directed and led by civilians. We will also protect the environment and create thousands of jobs in programs and plans dealing with the reforestation of the country. We will sponsor tourism and ecological tourism as well as processing zones for exports and centers for the transshipment of merchandise. We must solve the foreign public debt but we must seek options that protect the interests of the majority of the Panamanians first of all. You know that only serious decisions and specific and realistic investments will allow us to create jobs, build houses, equip the public transportation, improve education, and protect our existing services infrastructure, including the financial system, the regime of anonymous societies, and the Colon Free Zone. Decision, leadership, investment, more efficiency and honesty in the public administration sector, plus a constant struggle against corruption, impunity, drug trafficking, and money laundering is virtually all the country needs. [passage omitted] [Eisenmann] Everyone knows all the candidates were invited to participate this evening. Mrs. Mireya de Gruber declined our invitation. Dear viewers and listeners, we hope you will tune in on Monday, 28 March, when we will present the first televised presidential debate in Panama's political history. It will be broadcast in national radio and television network. On behalf of ILDEA and the media committee for presidential debates, have a good evening.
