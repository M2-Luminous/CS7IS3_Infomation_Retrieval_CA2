In the apartment police found a kilogram of so-called smoke-heroin. [passage omitted] A Kenyan married couple with three minor children received a shock when people from the Copenhagen Police Vice Squad suddenly were standing in their apartment in Stevnesgade in Norrebro Monday [28 March] afternoon. In the apartment were found small bags containing so-called smoke-heroin (``brown sugar'') which had just been readied for street sale. A total of around 700 grams were seized. In addition, police found 38,000 kroner and $22,000 thought to have come from drug trafficking. The heroin has a street value of around 150,000 kroner. But the police also searched a 33-year-old Tanzanian who was visiting. An additional 300 grams was found by police in the heel of his shoe. Heroin is most popular in its smoked form. Social workers and narcotics police are currently concerned that many of the very young have gone over to smoke-heroin in the belief that it is not addictive. The couple, aged 39 and 37, appeared yesterday with the Tanzanian in court, where all three were charged with drug trafficking. [passage omitted]
