It has been learned that the frequency of noise in 1993 was significantly lower than in the previous year. The Kadena Town government uses a gauge set up on top of the town hall building to monitor the frequency of noise over 70 phons lasting more than 5 seconds. Data from the monitoring effort for 1993 has been compiled recently. According to the statistics, noise was recorded 19,069 times last year, more than 3,000 times less than the 22,746 times recorded in 1992. Kadena Town's records show that noise was recorded more than 38,000 times at its peak in 1984, and the frequency of noise has been declining since then. Regarding the improvement in the frequency of noise, the Kadena Town government says that one of the reasons might be the departure of 18 F-15 fighters based in Kadena by December 1992. Seiyu Nakamura, vice chairman of the plaintiffs' group in the Kadena noise case, where a verdict is expected on 24 February, says: Although the frequency of noise monitored has declined numerically, we do not actually feel any improvement. The adverse effect on our daily life remains the same.
