In the first round of the elections on May 8, the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP) gained a considerable lead, while the MDF finished in third place. In Fur's view, the outcome of the first round will cause many voters to reconsider their position, or at least revise their passions. Fur claims the failure of the MDF and other conservative parties was mainly due to objective factors, including unfavorable external conditions and the special hardships of transition in Hungary, which were exacerbated by the opposition and the left-wing press that discredited Hungary. Of course, discontent was also generated by the errors of the governing coalition, Fur said, adding that the MDF's internal affairs were not perfect either. Most people were shocked to learn the outcome of the elections. Nor is a triumphant feeling manifest among the winners, Fur said. The MDF chairman qualified as unacceptable the statement of the left-wing press and some politicians that the failure of the MDF and the conservative forces was due to their ivory-tower arrogance, aristocratism, and lack of expertise. After the second round, the MDF will analyse the causes of the failure, Fur said. The MDF chairman announced that the party presidium had approved a strategy for the second round, including local deals between conservative candidates still in contention. At present, 99 MDF candidates are preparing for the second round, he said. Fur said voters should be made aware that all votes cast for the MSZP and the Alliance of Free Democrats would strengthen the left- wing coalition.
