[Begin Takemura recording] I saw [Social Democratic Party of Japan] Chairman Murayama conveying the tragic resolution on a TV program last night. Frankly speaking, I felt sympathy for him. Unless they pursue politics in a faithful or trustworthy manner, or more simply, in a good manner, they will lose the people's trust in politics. [end recording] Now, the reaction of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]. [Begin recording] [LDP President Yohei Kono] I think Sakigake as well as the SDPJ have felt that this political technique is wrong. But because this is a matter of political methods, they will naturally reach an agreement on political techniques. I mean they will agree on the techniques they should not adopt. [LDP Secretary General Yoshiro Mori] The current situation amounts to a state of anarchy. We are angry about this situation, rather than anxious. [end recording] Also, LDP's Michio Watanabe said: [Begin recording] [NHK Reporter] The SDPJ perceives the move as a betrayal to the party. [Watanabe] I do not understand why they think so. Is that move not a plot to form a single parliamentary group among the ruling parties? Usually, the notice of forming a parliamentary group is submitted before the prime ministerial election. It was unusual that they submitted the notice after the election. [NHK Reporter] How do you think things will develop from now on? [Watanabe] I do not know. If the ruling coalition decides to urgently form the new cabinet, they may leave posts to be filled by SDPJ members unoccupied and persuade the SDPJ to return to the coalition during the Golden Week holiday season. Or, they may try to entice some SDPJ members or LDP members who have adopted the same political stance into the coalition. [end recording]
