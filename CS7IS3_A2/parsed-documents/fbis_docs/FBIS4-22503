Kivelidi's Party of Free Labor, Volskiy's Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, Zatulin's "Entrepreneurs for a New Russia" Association, and Borovoy's Party of Economic Freedom have sat down at the new "table." It is planned to hold a founding congress in May, for participation in which already more than 5,000 applications have been handed in. OBSHCHAYA GAZETA columnist Yelena Dikun has met with "Roundtable" initiator Ivan Kivelidi. [Dikun] The "organization bureau" of your new association is made up of people who until recently did not especially regard each other with favor. What suddenly made you forget about differences? [Kivelidi] At one time we all began together, then already each one tried to completely subordinate the matter to himself, to his own ambitions. I don't think that in the future we will succeed in completely ridding ourselves of this, but nevertheless now we understand we won't achieve anything one by one. All the entrepreneurial associations failed at the elections. Only individual entrepreneurs by reason of majority districts or those who, like Zatulin, "leaned against" some party got through. This was an instructive lesson for us. The political consciousness of the entrepreneurs finally has attained an understanding of the need to unite. The entrepreneurs, as Konstantin Zatulin puts it, don't move in formation since this presupposes an alignment in order of size and clarifications of who is higher, who is greater, who is richer but, nevertheless, we are not a crowd. And in a position to jointly insist on common interests. The economy cannot develop further along the path on which it is now going--socialist or post-communist. The government is forced to take a new formation into account. If it does not intend to do this, then our critical mass already permits us to resort to acts of civil disobedience. For example, the strike of the commercial banks on the day of the funeral of the chairman of Agroprombank, Likhachev, killed "on order," passed seemingly imperceptibly; however, it caused extreme agitation in the government. If later they will treat us like "the cook's children," we are ready to repeat the strike, moreover no longer for a single day. Given the present non-payments crisis, this will bring the situation to a critical point in which the entrepreneurs themselves are not interested. However, if the authorities don't take us into account, then we have a right not to take them into account. [Dikun] Usually businessmen loosen their purse-strings for marginally utilitarian policy, for the creation of a lobbying system. [Kivelidi] We don't hide that the "Russian Business Roundtable" is a suprapolitical lobbying structure. Suprapolitical in the sense that each should rise above his own personal and political preferences in order to lobby for common interests. Lobbying is flourishing today in our country all the same, but it is the lobbying of narrow oligarchic groupings, which I would call by the simple Russian word "blat" [pull, protection, influence]. For example, today the government elicits $1.5 billion from the International Monetary Fund by begging while every oil- and gas-producing enterprise has unrestricted money in foreign accounts significantly exceeding this amount. This is not entrepreneurial money but state money; however, for some reason it doesn't return home. Why? It's no secret that the prime minister openly protects the oil and gas industry and that most favored nation treatment has been created for it. Although it is not a budgetary sector it does not belong to the poverty-stricken; on the contrary, it yields great profit. [Dikun] Ought one understand you that there won't be a place for representatives of the oil and gas complex at the "Russian Business Roundtable"? In general, according to what criteria do you accept into your company? [Kivelidi] We are open for all public and political organizations expressing the interests of entrepreneurship. As regards the big oil and gas "magnates," consulations with them are now underway. In particular with representatives of the Russian fuel and energy complex and of Minatommash [Ministry of Atomic Machine Building]. Moreover, we didn't initiate this process. The Federation of Commodity Producers, which Yuriy Skokov heads, has expressed a desire to affiliate with us. [Dikun] Don't you fear that such a powerful leader as Skokov is using you in the interests of his own political career? [Kivelidi] I know Yuriy Vladimirovich as a clever and tough politician who, in my view, has quite good prospects. However, there are enough strong personalities at our "table" so that Skokov will be one of them. Incidentally, after we began consultations with Skokov, I, for my part, have felt a certain estrangement on the part of the government. This can be taken as evidence of the fact that Yuriy Vladimirovich is a truly serious person. [Dikun] Ivan Kharlampiyevich, you are chairman of the Council for the Development of Entrepreneurship under the Russian Federation Council of Ministers. It's clear that you have great ties in the government. Do they help you to deal with business? [Kivelidi] Today the Entrepreneurship Council is an orphan. If previously, when Vladimir Shumeyko supervised and helped it, we gathered, worked, and succeeded in doing many minor things, for example, in protecting specific entrepreneurs from the arbitrariness of local authorities, now the impression is developing that no one needs this Council. Besides, it is naive to set one's hopes on some kind of favor from "the upper crust." I'll cite only one example of such "favor." Before the elections the president promised to allot 25 billion rubles to the Fund for the support of entrepreneurship. This is a drop in the ocean. However, in fact they scraped up only R8 billion with difficulty. But even that, as a result of secret manipulations, ended up in the Antimonopoly committee for some reason. From there it got into a bank by a closed tender which offered it to enterprises at a commercial interest rate. The government accuses the entrepreneurs of not developing industry but at the same time itself does everything possible to impede it. I am more inclined to production. We produce rather many different products, for example, television sets. However, we have been forced to reduce amounts and here and there to generally curtail production because of a tax policy which simply smothers us in its embraces. If one is to be honest, we have already become tired of feeling the economic models written by theoreticians on our backs. As we have already determined, they undergo changes already in the course of being written. In my view practical activity can yield greater results. The proposals of people of business precisely also constitute part of the "Entry into Power" plan drawn up by the "Roundtable." [Dikun] Does this plan include a demand for the immediate replacement of the government and the accession of entrepreneurs to key posts in the executive power? [Kivelidi] In speaking of accession to power, we mean the transformation of the state mechanism and the complete rejection of the monopolistic-totalitarian system which is alive as before. The usual change of government while retaining the existing order doesn't suit us. That is why I have regarded the departure of Yegor Gaydar and Boris Fedorov from the cabinet of ministers without any especial sorrow. They had only role functions; they hardly could change anything fundamentally. In its present role (ipostas) it suits the government to remain the largest owner and entrepreneur and to regulate relations between the remaining entrepreneurs on the basis of the laws which it itself promulgates. It turns out that one businessman, in the person of the state, gives directions to other businessmen on how to conduct themselves. Moreover, not with respect to it--it is separate--but among each other. This is illegitimate in my view. We no longer want to convince these people since they can't imagine another state. It is easier to simply accede to power and to change everything. The question, of course, is not one of a coup but of gradual entry, for example, into such a temporary organ that the State Duma is. For this, certain businessmen will have to forgo their own vital concerns.
