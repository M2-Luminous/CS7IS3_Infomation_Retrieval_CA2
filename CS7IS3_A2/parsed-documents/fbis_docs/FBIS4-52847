IAEA spokesman David Kyd said that the inspection team will leave Vienna on 15 May and arrive in Yongbyon, North Korea sometime on 17 May. He said that the inspection team will confirm whether North Korea has just started regular preparation measures to replace the fuel rods at the five megawatt-class atomic reactor or it has already reached "a serious stage" of carrying out the replacement work such as unloading the nuclear rods. He added that the inspection team is scheduled to stay in North Korea for eight days, but that their stay there may be extended.
