For two weeks, the U.S. capital has been holding discussions. In Port-au-Prince, however, some political players are predicting new developments within the coming days. Following is a synopsis of the situation with Clarence Renois: [Begin recording] In the 28th month of what is here and elsewhere considered an unprecedented crisis, the Haitian case seems to be rekindling interest in the eyes of the international community. Relegated to a number-three position of importance among the concerns of the world's great leaders, the Haitian case is gradually returning to a level of priority since the step taken by the American Center for Democracy, initiator of restarting Washington-Haitian negotiations. In fact, for two weeks, the principal leaders of the Haitian parliament have been visiting the U.S. capital where senators and deputies have been working on writing a plan for a solution to the political crisis. Approved from the start by the United States, this plan also benefits from the firm support of the four countries, Friends of Haiti; and today, from the support of the United Nations, brought to bear by Butrus Butrus-Ghali. The UN secretary general has thus quickly answered the letter from six Haitian legislators who were soliciting moral support from his organization. Everything could lead us to believe that this latest attempt might be the good one if the intransigence -- the word is from the [U.S.] State Department --President Aristide's intransigence did not present an obstacle in the execution of the plan for a solution to the crisis. But careful! Besides the position of President Aristide, an unknown is the position of the military, concealed behind a complete, disconcerting silence. The military institution has said nothing about all these negotiations, at least not publicly or officially, while it is again a question of the anticipated retirement of the Army commander in chief. Deputy Samuel Madistin asked the judicious question, quote: Do six legislators have enough authority to force Gen. Raoul Cedras to respect what has not been respected in the Governors Island agreement, unquote. Another unknown in this situation is the position of some legislators who openly dissociate themselves from the initiative by their six colleagues. Furthermore, the crisis in the Senate of the Republic does not facilitate things either. In any case, the coming days, even the coming hours, could be of importance because, FRAPH, [Revolutionary Front for Haitian Advancement and Progress] has launched an ultimatum to President Aristide, an ultimatum that expires today; and a senator of the republic has announced surprises for the coming hours. Today, once again, all eyes are turned on Washington, the capital of Uncle Sam, which for the past 28 months has been the center of political activities of the independent and sovereign Republic of Haiti.
