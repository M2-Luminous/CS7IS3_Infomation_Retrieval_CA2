In January-February 1994, industrial production of meat in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus was 26-28 percent less than in the same period of 1993; in Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Moldova--41-46 percent less; and in Kyrgyzstan--it declined by half. Production of whole milk products dropped by 17-18 percent in Russia and Kazakhstan; by 21 percent in Azerbaijan; by 38 percent in Moldova; and by half in Kyrgyzstan. As compared with January-February 1993, production of flour declined by 17 percent in Russia; by 20-22 percent in Moldova and Belarus; and by 38 percent in Azerbaijan; while production of groats declined by 16-19 percent in Belarus and Kazakhstan and by 34 percent in Russia. Production of the basic types of light industry output declined in most countries. The following table shows data on the changes in their production in January-February 1994 as compared to January-February 1993 (in percentages): Table 3.

Thus, production of washing machines declined by 18 percent in Belarus, by 39 percent in Moldova, and by 42 percent in Russia; production of radios declined to two-thirds its previous level in Belarus and by 53 percent in Russia; production of televisions declined by 13 percent in Belarus, by 17 percent in Russia, and by 24 percent in Moldova; and production of tape recorders--by 30 percent in Kazakhstan and by 51-58 percent in Belarus, Russia, and Kyrgyzstan. In January-February 1994, electricity production declined by 11 percent in Kazakhstan and by 14 percent in Belarus. The following data characterize extraction of the basic types of fuel in certain states of the Commonwealth in January-February 1994: Table 4.

As compared with January-February 1993, production of gasoline declined by 12 percent in Russia, production of diesel fuel--by 17 percent, and production of heating oil--by 10 percent; the corresponding figures for Belarus were 20 percent, 24 percent, and 30 percent; and for Uzbekistan--31 percent, 12 percent, and 31 percent. As compared with the same period last year, production of finished rolled metal products in January-February 1994 declined by 22 percent in Russia and by 36 percent in Kazakhstan. Production of steel pipe in Russia declined to roughly one-half its previous level. In machine building, production of some of the most important types of output declined significantly as compared to the January-February 1993 level. In the last 2 months, production of metal-cutting machine tools declined by 46 percent in Belarus and by half in Russia. In Russia 71 percent fewer pieces of forge-press equipment were produced than in January-February 1993. Production of motor vehicles declined by 56 percent in Belarus; while in Russia production of trucks fell to one-third its previous level and production of passenger cars fell by 41 percent. Production of tractors declined by 45 percent in Belarus, to one-quarter its previous level in Kazakhstan, and by 81 percent in Russia. Their production ceased almost completely in Uzbekistan. The lag in production of chemical output continues. Production of mineral fertilizers in January-February 1994 declined by 29 percent in Russia, to two-thirds its previous level in Uzbekistan, by 36 percent in Belarus, and to one-third its previous level in Kazakhstan. In Russia, production of chemical fibers and threads and soda ash declined by 49-53 percent and production of tires declined by 41 percent. In Belarus, production of synthetic resin and plastic and chemical fibers and threads declined by half or more and production of tires declined by 30 percent. Production of building materials declined in most Commonwealth states. Thus, production of cement declined to roughly two-thirds its previous level in Russia and Kyrgyzstan and by 55-57 percent in Belarus and Kazakhstan.
