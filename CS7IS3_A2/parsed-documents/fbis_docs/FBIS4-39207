The press-service for the Abkhazian Ambassador in Moscow said the postponement was caused by the refusal of the Russian Federation Council to agree to the deployment of the peace-keeping force along the confrontation line along the Inguri River from June 10 to 15. The Federation Council, which considered the problem last week, decided the reasons in favor of Russian troop deployment in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone as outlined in the letter to the upper house of the Federal Assembly by President Yeltsin were insufficient. Members of the Federation Council also pointed to the absence of a legal basis to determining the status of the Russian troops outside the country. Meanwhile, following the decision of the Federation Council, the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tbilisi that Russian president Yeltsin had assured him in a telephone conversation of the early deployment of Russian peace-keepers into conflict zone.
