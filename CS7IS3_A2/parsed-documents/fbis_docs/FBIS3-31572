[Divjak] Karadzic must explain to his people that he now wants peace. He is reacting to pressure from NATO and Boris Yeltsin. [Klingl] Will NATO intervene if the Serbs neglect NATO demands? [Divjak] NATO will not bomb the Serbs. We now have a stalemate in the political game. The Serbs are withdrawing a few weapons, others they will shift to other areas of war. [Klingl] Can a political solution be found through this stalemate? [Divjak] The Sarajevo solution could be successful one in other parts of Bosnia as well, which would have a positive influence on the negotiations. [Klingl] Can you accept Russian blue helmets as monitoring the Bosnian weapons? [Divjak] The Bosnian Army is pleased to be monitored by them. If they are used on the Serbian side, abuse cannot be ruled out. [Klingl] Would a division of Bosnia into three parts bring about peace? [Divjak] A division along ethnic lines would mean war again. Our culture, history, and economy are interlaced; 900,000 marriages are mixed marriages. [Klingl] Would you, a Serb, live in a Muslim state? [Divjak] I am staying where I am. Here we will not have a Muslim state but a country in which all citizens will have their rights. [Klingl] You negotiated the cease-fire with the Serbs. What is it like to sit at the same table with the aggressors? [Divjak] They did not want to negotiate with us because I was there. I told them that this is not a question of wanting but a question of a cease-fire. I am very glad that I am not on the side of those who are committing genocide on the Muslims.
