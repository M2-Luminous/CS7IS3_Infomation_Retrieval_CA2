The former commander of the Cavalry Academy, which in 1987 assumed control of the Justice Palace during the bloody takeover by the 19 April Movement, said the guerrillas are holding contacts with candidates through third parties to finance their campaigns. [Begin recording] [Plazas] I am talking about candidates for governor and candidates for mayor in the municipalities of Yopal, Tauramena, and Aguazul. [Government Minister Fabio Villegas] I do not believe the guerrillas have that kind of power in the political campaigns in Casanare. I am not aware that they are trying to exert influence on the political development of the region. [Former President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala] If that were the case, it must be condemned. [end recording] According to Col. Plazas, the guerrillas are extorting businessmen by means of this system in Casanare. [Begin Plazas recording] They are threatening candidates and asking them for allowances and if the allowances are not given they are included on a list of future kidnap victims in order to get the money anyway. [end recording] Plazas Vega said that to solve the problem in Casanare, it is necessary to appoint military governors and mayors in that region of the country.
