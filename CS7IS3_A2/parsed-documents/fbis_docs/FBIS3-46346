What major reform movements are there in the personnel system of enterprises and public undertakings? When will the reform plan of the new wage system be put into effect? How will reform of the social insurance system for government organizations and public undertakings get started? Can the flow of human resources be "released, but in good order, and be full of vigor, but not chaotic"? How will government personnel management move toward legalization?.... At the meeting of personnel department and bureau directors held before the end of last year, Personnel Minister Song Defu gave a LIAOWANG staff reporter a special interview on the above issues of social concern. Song Defu unfolded his talk on building a personnel management system complementary to the system of a socialist market economy; that is, a classified management personnel system, a scientific and rational wage distribution system, a multilevel social insurance system and macroeconomic personnel management system, a human resources market system, and a personnel rules and regulation system, which are new thoughts on reform of state personnel work. I. 1994: To Create A Good Beginning for Carrying Out the State Public Service System Song Defu spoke about carrying out -- from making experiments to gradually spreading out -- the state public service system against the particular background of government organizational reform and personnel reduction. He did not conceal that corresponding complementary regulations were still lacking, and that the rate of progress varied. Moreover, the efforts made on publicity were inadequate, which led to insufficient social understanding. For example, some people equated carrying out the public service system with wage reform. To ensure bringing the public service system onto track and putting it into operation, it is necessary to carry forward in an overall manner and stress the main points in implementation in 1994. Song Defu spoke about putting forward the following different requirements according to the deployment by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council: On the basis of organizational reform, various departments of the State Council and most of the provincial level departments and the municipal departments whose plans are listed separately, have initially built up the state public service system, and have completed the transition from existing personnel to public servants. Moreover, some county and city governments have acquired experimental experiences in building the public service system. Organizations that have not carried out organizational reform, except positions set-up and nonleading posts arrangement and other work, are required to implement the "Provisions Regarding the State Public Servants" by merging with the practical situation of personnel work, so as to lay a good foundation for building the public service system. Whether or not organizational reform has been carried out, a mechanism of openness, equality, and encouragement of competition should be built up gradually, and open examination and strict check- ups should be carried out to select the best for employing nonleading personnel below the position of section chief. The public service system being of immediate concern to the broad masses of government personnel, Song Defu emphasized: "It is necessary to do good work and take organization and implementation seriously. How can we determine in advance the scope of implementation? The implementation of the new wage system appears to be most pressing. This involves whether an organization is following the wage system of government organizations or that of public undertakings. It is necessary to take the functions of an organization as the basis, and uphold separating the functions of government and enterprises, and separating those of government and public undertakings. Due to reasons of set-up and establishment, if it is difficult to determine for the time being the nature of an organization, it may be temporarily excluded from the scope of carrying out the public service system." Song Defu raised the point that in organizational reform, personnel diversion should be combined with restructuring government personnel, and that a rational proportion of various levels of personnel should be maintained. If those diverted are ordinary working staff or young personnel, and those who should stay are leading members or elderly, then it would be very difficult for the public service structure to be rational. The job of improving the rules and regulations of the state public service system is being done intensely. Song Defu declared: "We will strive to promulgate as soon as possible `Methods for Implementation of the Classification of Posts for State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the Employment of State Public Servants', `Temporary Regulations on the Assessment of State Public Servants', and grasp firmly the work of investigation and study and drafting of temporary regulations for awards, training, promotion and demolition, appointment and dismissal, and retirement." II. Public Undertakings: "Separation, Classification, Decentralization of Power, and Reinvigoration" Enterprises: Gradually Build Up the Personnel System of Modern Enterprises Speaking about the reform of the personnel system of public undertakings, which are varied and complicated, Song Defu clearly pointed out: "Public undertakings, as relatively independent entities with corporate qualifications, require corresponding personnel decisionmaking power. At present, major reform moves of the personnel system of public undertakings include:" "Further reform the system of appointment and selection, adopt multiple forms for selecting and appointing administrative leading personnel of public undertakings, and experiments can be made in organizations with conditions for selecting leading members by public bidding." "The clerk system will be gradually carried out for managerial staff and a specialized technological post appointment system will be gradually carried out for specialized technological personnel." To reduce the state's financial burdens, it is necessary to reduce the number of public undertakings and people that eat "the emperor's grain." For public undertakings that get appropriations, it is necessary to introduce the mechanism of competition, encouragement, and risks, and to transition to revenue and expenditure by themselves. For public undertakings that are fully responsible for expenses by themselves, it is necessary to encourage them to carry out enterprise management, and make experiments on linking work with efficiency. For personnel of public undertakings that get full appropriations, such as those engaged in basic theoretical research, high-tech research, and secondary and primary schools, experiments should be made to be responsible for gross wages until the task is completed; that is, for over-strength, there will be no increase in gross wages, and for vacancies, there will be no decrease, so as to make the contingent capable and highly efficient. It is necessary to create an environment which enables outstanding talents to show themselves, and to train and bring up a contingent of academic and technological leaders that meet the needs of China's modernization program and are capable of entering the world's scientific and technological forward position. The pace of reform of the enterprise personnel system is being quickened to meet the requirements for building the system of modern enterprises. Song Defu spoke about carrying out the post appointment system for enterprises' managerial staff and specialized technological personnel. Enterprises enjoy the power of personnel management according to law, specialized technological personnel and managerial staff enjoy the right to choose their occupations according to law, and the rights and obligations relations of both parties are established by employment contract. Government personnel departments should protect the legitimate rights and interests of both parties. Moreover, it is also necessary to study how to abolish gradually the bounds between cadres and workers within enterprises, between cadres of different ownership, and between different types (fixed, employed) of cadres, so as to build up a personnel mechanism that enables cadres to be able to work at higher as well as lower levels and to enter and leave government organizations, and a mechanism that facilitates two-way selection and rational flow, and to train and bring up a contingent of high-quality and occupational entrepreneurs. Song Defu indicated that we should lose no time in solving the problem of separating the state-owned enterprise grades from administrative grades according to the principle of separating the functions of government and enterprises. In the future, no administrative grades will be fixed for newly built enterprises without exception, and the arrangement of their management personnel will be rationally determined according to the situation of the enterprises and their personnel conditions. Enterprises that originally had administrative grades should be separated from administrative grades, and no longer apply mechanically the administrative grades of the party and government organizations. Grades and treatments for various types of enterprise personnel should no longer be fixed in the light of the administrative grades of the party and government organizations. We are now making the best use of time to work out relevant methods for implementation and complementary management methods on listening to reports, reading documents, and taking part in meetings. Song Defu recommended: "To coordinate with the building of a modern enterprises system, it is necessary to study working out the 'Provisions Regarding the Personnel Management of State-Owned Enterprises' and 'Temporary Methods for the Personnel Management of Joint Stock System Enterprises'." III. The New Wage System: Onto the Track and in Normal Operation As Soon As Possible After the reform plans and the three implementation methods of the new wage system of state organs and public undertakings have been transmitted to the lower levels, various localities and departments are paying close attention to working out specific suggestions for implementation. Song Defu said: "To my knowledge, leading comrades of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council attach great importance to and are much concerned about the current wage reform. In the present wage system reform, the state has made great efforts for wage increases under difficult financial situations. It has brought the new wage system onto track and put it into operation by taking into consideration the interest relations of various aspects as best she can, and made gradual improvements. The starting point of the current wage system reform is to build up a corresponding wage system and a normal wage increase mechanism according to the respective characteristics of government organizations and public undertakings. The wages of public servants are determined and readjusted by the state according to the economic growth situation and referring to the average wage level of enterprises, and a normal mechanism for promotion and wages increase will be built up on that basis. Different management methods, wage system, and methods of distribution will be carried out for public undertakings according to the difference in the source of appropriations and the characteristics of trades. How do we bring the wage system onto track and put it into operation? Song Defu reiterated that personnel departments at various levels should, according to the unified deployment by the central authorities, "Be active and safe, be strict and tight, and control total amounts." No locality or department will go their own way and muddle things up. Various localities and departments should strengthen ideological, political work, and do good turns meticulously to help the broad masses of the personnel of government organizations and public undertakings understand that the current wages reform is mainly to build up a new wage system, and to bring it onto track and put it into operation, so as to lay a good foundation for the future. We should understand that the state is very much concerned about the life of the staff and workers under difficult financial situation, and it is no easy job to take out so much money. We should understand that the problems accumulated in wage distribution are many, that it is impossible to have all of them overcome by the present one reform, and that it requires a process for gradual improvement. IV. Social Insurance System of Government Organizations and Public Undertakings: The Easy Ones Come First and the Difficult Ones Later, Getting in Position Gradually Speaking about the present delay in reform of the social insurance system of government organizations and public undertakings, Song Defu declared: "The job of reform is very difficult. Some localities and departments have not started yet, and those places that have built up the insurance system are confronted with many difficulties. The progress of reform of the social insurance system of government organizations and public undertakings is slow, and has become the "bottleneck" constraining reform of the personnel system." In carrying out the old-age and unemployment insurance system by overall social planning, Song Defu said: "Adhering to the principle of easy ones first and difficult ones later, first build up the old- age and unemployment insurance system for contract-based workers of government organizations and public undertakings, and build up the old-age funds overall planning system. As for public undertakings, first start with those that are responsible for revenue and expenditure by themselves, and on the basis that the state continues to bear the expenses for personnel who have retired, explore the methods under which individuals are required to pay a part of the old-age pension to build up a part of the funds accumulation. It is necessary to study jointly with the financial departments about building a social insurance system of government organizations, especially that of state public servants." He stressed that the general principle for the raising and using of funds should be: "The rights, obligations, and compulsion are combined, and the state, organizations, and individuals share burdens. The administrative management of social insurance should be separated from the funds operation of social insurance." The current reform of the social insurance system of government organizations and public undertakings adopts the policy of "making experiments actively, easy ones come first and difficult ones later, and get in position gradually." Song Defu pointed out clearly: "On the basis of the general principle of reform, it is allowed to take different methods for experiments, and a certain difference is allowed among various localities. A number of different types of organizations should be selected for experiments in a planned way. In addition, make the best use of time to study and work out regulations on old-age insurance. V. The Human Resources Market: Rational Flow, Rational Disposition, and Rational Use of Various Types of Personnel Are Allowed As Much As Possible Against the background of increases in the demand for human resources, the contradiction between shortage and idle human resources has become increasingly acute. Talking about the thoughts on building and improving the human resources market system, Song Defu put forward "five changes": Change from human resources lying idle and shortages to market flow, making up the other's deficiency from one's own surplus, and rational disposition; change from organization and department ownership of human resources to social ownership, rational flow, and helping supply each other's needs; change from one-way selection to two-way selection of human resources flow; change from "fair market" to "location market" of human resources flow; change from the human resources disposition model of "overall assignment and disposition" to the model of bringing into play the basic role of human resources market in human resources disposition under the state macroeconomic management. Song Defu said that we should use human resources flow in handling circulation. To provide an opportunity for two-way selection we should minimize intermediate links as best we can. Pay close attention to working out and improving relevant policies and rules and regulations on the human resources market, make the best use of time in 1994 to transmit to lower levels the "Opinions on Speeding Up the Training and Development of Human Resources Market," and promulgate the "Temporary Regulations on Arbitration of Disputes Arising From Human Resources Flow." Protect the legitimate rights and interests of the employers' organizations and individuals so as to enable the human resources market to operate in an orderly manner within the scope of law. On the basis of human resources flow under existing personnel departments, gradually build up a regular human resources market and a nationwide human resources supply and demand information network to provide more timely, speedy, and richer information for organizations to select personnel and for individuals to choose their occupations. In policy guidance of human resources flow, Song Defu emphasized guidance and preferential measures toward the needs of the state's key projects and outlying and difficult districts where conditions are hard. It is necessary to take feasible measures to encourage human resources to stay in outlying and difficult districts, and the state should render appropriate support and protection in policy. It is necessary to explore through concerted efforts a new way of encouraging human resources to stay in outlying and difficult districts and of importing them. And it is also necessary to strengthen management and supervision over the human resources market. Song Defu finally stressed: "All of the five major links for building the basic framework of the system of a socialist market economy put forward by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Congress are directly related to personnel work. For example, to build up a modern enterprises system, we are held responsible for the reform of the enterprise personnel system. To build up a unified and open market system, we are held responsible for training, building, and improving the human resources market. In transforming government functions, we have to study organizational reform jointly with departments concerned, and have the task of transforming functions. In wage distribution, we undertake the task of reforming the wage system of government organizations and public undertakings. To build up a social insurance system, we are held responsible for the job of building up a social insurance system of government organizations and public undertakings. Personnel departments at various levels should enhance their sense of responsibility and continue studying the new situation with thoughts on reform, and solving new problems by the methods of reform.
