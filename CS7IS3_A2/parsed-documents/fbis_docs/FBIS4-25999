The full text of the message follows: To the OAU summit: On the occasion of triumphant convocation of the 30th OAU summit, I hereby extend to it my warm congratulations on behalf of the Chinese Government and people. The birth of new South Africa with Nelson Mandela as its president, and its attendance at the current summit as the 53d OAU member signify the inspiring great victory accomplished by the OAU and all African people in the political field, showing the further strengthening of unity and solidarity on the African continent. The admission of new South Africa to the OAU has added a new vitality to the African people in their efforts to seek a better future under the banner of the OAU, and has also ushered in a new epoch in the history of the OAU. We wholeheartedly wish the African people constant, new successes in their struggle to defend national independence and sovereignty, safeguard Africa's solidarity and unity, and improve living conditions. We are glad to learn that the African Economic Community Treaty has officially become effective. The acceleration of Africa's economic integration is of great significance to African people's revitalization of the African economy through a collective self-reliance. It shows the firm will and determination of African countries and people to become united and make themselves stronger in an unfavorable international environment. The Chinese Government and people greatly admire their will and determination and wholeheartedly hope that the African people's collective efforts in the economic field will succeed. With the changing international situation, it has become more and more important to maintain political stability in African countries so as to facilitate their economic development. Continued turbulence in some regions, and fighting in Rwanda in particular, has already taken a heavy toll and wrecked the economy, which has aroused widespread concern in the international community. We firmly support the OAU in its efforts to mediate in regional conflicts in Africa and maintain political and social stability in African countries. A profound friendship has been forged between China and African nations during long, common struggles. Under the present complex international situation, we should even more sympathize with and support each other, and make joint efforts to strengthen Sino-African solidarity and cooperation. The Chinese Government and people treasure very much the Sino-African friendship. To strengthen friendship and cooperation with Africa has always been an important part of the foreign policy of the Chinese Government no matter how international situation changes. I am convinced that the current summit will certainly achieve its desired results and triumphantly accomplish the lofty missions assigned by African nations and people. I wish the summit a complete success! [Signed] Li Peng, premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China [Dated] 11 June 1994, Beijing.
