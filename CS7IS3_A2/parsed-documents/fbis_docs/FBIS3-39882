It is also to Washington's credit that despite the 20 years of futile negotiations, it does not want to start a trade war. If sanctions were to be imposed against Japan, then these should only refer to one marginal event: the breaking of the 1989 agreement which reserved 33-50 percent of the cordless telephone market in Tokyo to the U.S. firm Motorola. Eventually, the Americans received only 5 percent. Maybe Tokyo will take this last threat from Washington seriously. Maybe Japan's border barriers will not go up for cars and car parts, computers, telephone systems, medical equipment, and insurance companies from the United States. It is more likely that Tokyo has once more gained time -- and the United States is once more using the threat to impose sanctions in vain. Such actions wear off, even if U.S. trade delegate Mickey Kantor has announced the reactivation of the ill-famed Article 301 of the 1988 Trade Law, under which the United States claims the powers of an international trade policeman. Irresolute International Trade Policeman The surprising element in the U.S. position is its irresolution, the apparent gap between words and action. If Washington really were to regard Japan's $58 billion in trade surplus with the United States as intolerable, and if Tokyo fails to fulfill concessions it made and draws out negotiations over decades, which is what the Americans think, then the threat to impose sanctions must not remain pure tongue lashing. Then Kantor must encourage his President in the White House to finally let action follow the many words, tragic as this would be for free international trade and the atmosphere in the GATT. Yet Kantor, who has been described as a "tough fellow," has again and again proved to be a hesitater and, in this manner, he is gaining very little for his country. Put Credibility at Stake Meanwhile, in their trade talks with Japan, American politicians only experience what they themselves are doing to other countries -- for example the FRG in the air transport negotiations. Washington's negotiators probably only laugh about German threats to cancel the meanwhile obsolete air transport agreement. Trade policy is always nationalistic, even if exercised on the seemingly neutral forum of the GATT in Geneva. Nobody blames trade politicians for representing the interests of their countries. Yet, they must be careful not to lose credibility. And it is this credibility that the United States is putting at stake in its negotiations with Japan. No one wants a trade war, even if it takes place in foreign regions; it would be an infringement on the GATT rules. Yet, if the United States still wants to be taken seriously, it must take itself at its word. The catalogue of sins that Japan has been confronted with for many years quite obviously does not have the expected effect. Trade delegate Mickey Kantor has a reputation for being tough. Maybe toughness is only a disguise for a lack of concept, a lacking conclusive policy.
