Since last year, some lawbreakers in Fujian society have disguised themselves as armed police officers and policemen and, under the pretense of performing official duties, have blackmailed restaurants and dance halls to extort money from them, detained people under the pretense of checking identity cards, or have manufactured fake armed police driving licenses to carry out criminal activities, thus damaging the image of the armed police among the people. According to reports, the Fujian Provincial Armed Police Headquarters has set up special organs to crack down on bogus armed policemen. It has also sent armed police inspector teams to the streets to arrest people who wear armed police uniforms without collar insignias, confiscate their uniforms, and severely punish those who carry out illegal activities under the disguise of policemen. In September last year, as two young men in armed policemen's uniforms wearing caps with a large peak, but without police insignia, were buying fruit at a stall in front of Fuzhou Railway Station, they accused the owner of the stall of blocking the way and demanded fines. Three armed policemen on patrol approached, exposed the fraud on the spot, arrested the two young men, and took them to the police station. Hong Shaohu, head of the Fujian Armed Police Headquarters, said that work to crack down on bogus armed policemen would continue for a long time to come.
