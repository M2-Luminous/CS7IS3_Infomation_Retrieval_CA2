Zhang joined a number of Hong Kong deputies to the National People's Congress [NPC] and other Hong Kong celebrities in visiting the troops of Guangzhou Military Region. When asked by reporters after the visit, Zhang expressed the following opinion. Zhang Junsheng said: This visit to the Guangzhou Military Region was an activity enabling the residents of Hong Kong to know the PLA better. Today's military show was superb. This time, the leaders, officers, and soldiers of the Guangzhou unit very warmly and thoughtfully received the visiting NPC deputiess and members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee from Hong Kong, members of the Preparatory Working Committee, and Hong Kong affairs advisers. A reporter asked: Will the press be able to cover this type of news in the future? Zhang Junsheng said: "We shall try by every possible means to enable Hong Kong people from all walks of life to come into contact with the PLA and understand the PLA, and this will include our friends in the mass media. However, it is not easy to arrange such visits." Another reporter asked: Will visits to the PLA barracks help remove Hong Kong people's misgivings about the PLA? Zhang Junsheng said: "If Hong Kong people have misgivings, this is just a misunderstanding. The people's Army is a strong force for defending our country. Without the PLA, how could we be able to conduct national reconstruction in a peaceful environment, and how could we live peacefully?" He stressed: If there is such a misunderstanding, then it is necessary to remove it by increasing understanding of the PLA. First, it is necessary to know about the fine traditions and history of the PLA. Second, there are many news reports about the PLA on the mainland. Third, in the future, more Hong Kong people from various social circles, including journalists, will be organized to come into contact with the PLA. This will all be conducive to communication between PLA troops stationed in Hong Kong after 1997 and local residents.
