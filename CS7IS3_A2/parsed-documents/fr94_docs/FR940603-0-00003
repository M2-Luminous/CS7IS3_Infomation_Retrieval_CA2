FR940603-0-00003 FR940603-0-00002 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 25 [Docket No. NM&hyph;96; Special Conditions No. 25&hyph;ANM&hyph;85] Special Conditions: Modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 Series Airplanes, High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final special conditions; request for comments. SUMMARY: These special conditions are issued for AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes modified by Duncan Aviation, Inc., of Lincoln, Nebraska. These airplanes are equipped with digital electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) that perform critical functions. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the protection of the EFIS from the effects of high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). These special conditions provide the additional safety standards that the Administrator considers necessary to ensure that the critical functions performed by these systems are maintained when the airplane is exposed to HIRF. DATES: The effective date of these special conditions is May 24, 1994. Comments must be received on or before July 18, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments on these final special conditions; request for comments, may be mailed in duplicate to: Federal Aviation Administration, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attn.: Rules Docket (ANM&hyph;7), Docket No. NM&hyph;96, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington, 98055&hyph;4056; or delivered in duplicate to the Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel at the above address. Comments must be marked ``Docket No. NM&hyph;96.'' Comments may be inspected in the Rules Docket weekdays, except Federal holidays, between 7:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mark Quam, FAA, Standardization Branch, Transport Airplane Directorate, Aircraft Certification Service, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056; telephone (206) 227&hyph;2145. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Comments Invited The FAA has determined that good cause exists for making these special conditions effective upon issuance; however, interested persons are invited to submit such written data, views, or arguments as they may desire. Communications should identify the regulatory docket and special conditions number and be submitted in duplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments will be considered by the Administrator. These special conditions may be changed in light of the comments received. All comments submitted will be available in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons, both before and after the closing date for comments. A report summarizing each substantive public contact with FAA personnel concerning this rulemaking will be filed in the docket. Persons wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this request must submit with those comments a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: '`Comments to Docket No. NM&hyph;96.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. Background On April 15, 1994, Duncan Aviation, Inc., of Lincoln, Nebraska, applied for a supplemental type certificate to modify the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes. The AMD/BA Falcon 50 is a business jet with three aft-mounted turbojet engines. The airplane can carry two pilots and 8 to 19 passengers, depending on the exit and interior configuration, and is capable of operating to an altitude of 45,000 feet. The proposed modification incorporates the installation of digital avionics consisting of an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS) that is potentially vulnerable to high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane. Supplemental Type Certification Basis Under the provisions of §21.101 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Duncan Aviation, Inc., must show that the altered AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes continue to meet the applicable provisions of the regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A46EU, or the applicable regulations in effect on the date of application for the change. The regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate are commonly referred to as the ``original type certification basis.'' The regulations incorporated by reference in Type Certificate No. A46EU include the following for the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series: §21.29 of part 21, and 14 CFR part 25, dated February 1, 1965, as amended by Amendments 25&hyph;1 through 25&hyph;34. In addition the following regulations apply to the EFIS installation: §§25.1303(b) and 25.1322, as amended through Amendment 25&hyph;38; and §§25.1309, 25.1321(a), (b), (d), and (e), 25.1331, 25.1333, and 25.1335, as amended by Amendment 25&hyph;41. These special conditions will form an additional part of the supplemental type certification basis. If the Administrator finds that the applicable airworthiness regulations (i.e., part 25, as amended) do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for the AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes because of a novel or unusual design feature, special conditions are prescribed under the provisions of §21.16 to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established in the regulations. Special conditions, as appropriate, are issued in accordance with §11.49 of the FAR after public notice, as required by §§11.28 and 11.29, and become part of the type certification basis in accordance with §21.101(b)(2). Special conditions are initially applicable to the model for which they are issued. Should the applicant apply for a supplemental type certificate to modify any other model included on the same type certificate to incorporate the same novel or unusual design feature, the special conditions would also apply to the other model under the provisions of §21.101(a)(1). Discussion There is no specific regulation that addresses protection requirements for electrical and electronic systems from high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF). Increased power levels from ground-based radio transmitters, and the growing use of sensitive electrical and electronic systems to command and control airplanes, have made it necessary to provide adequate protection. To ensure that a level of safety is achieved equivalent to that intended by the regulations incorporated by reference, special conditions are needed for the modified AMD/BA Falcon 50 series airplanes that would require that the EFIS be designed and installed to preclude component damage and interruption of function due to the effects of HIRF. High-Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) When the trend toward increased power levels from ground-based transmitters, plus the advent of space and satellite communications, coupled with electronic command and control of the airplane, the immunity of critical digital avionics systems, such as the EFIS, to HIRF must be established. It is not possible to precisely define the HIRF to which the airplane will be exposed in service. There is also uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of airframe shielding for HIRF. Furthermore, coupling to cockpit-installed equipment through the cockpit window apertures is undefined. Based on surveys and analysis of existing HIRF emitters, an adequate level of protection exists when compliance with the HIRF protection special condition is shown with either paragraphs 1 or 2 below:
