Chairman of the Guyana Committee for Support of Korea's Reunification Walter Bipat was elected chairman of the committee at the inaugural meeting. The chairman in his speech said the committee would actively join in the worldwide movement for the repatriation of Kim and Ham to the northern half of Korea. A statement adopted at the meeting said the refusal of the South Korean authorities to repatriate them is a harsh criminal act contrary to humanitarianism and the international law. Noting that the old men Kim and Ham earnestly want to be repatriated to the northern half of Korea and their families, too, aspire after their return to the bosom of the Republic, the statement demanded the South Korean authorities to immediately send them back to the northern half of Korea. Chairman of the Peru-Korea Institute of Culture and Friendship Angel Castro Lavarello sent a letter of protest to the traitor Kim Yong-sam in demand of the repatriation of the old men Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan. He in the letter expressed solidarity for the just demand of the Korean people and the progressive people of the world to send them back to the northern half of Korea so that they may meet with their families.
