For instance, as of 1 April, 1,084 enterprises were either completely or partially standing idle in Kazakhstan. Electricity generation had fallen by 14 percent, and coal extraction by 10 percent. The extraction of oil, gas condensate, and gas had fallen. In the first three months of this year, the fall in production in the Republic's food industry alone was 33 percent. As a result the production of butter, milk, cheese, canned food, whole milk and fish products, flour, groats, and pasta products decreased. The acceleration of inflationary processes has been reflected in the material position of the Kazakhstanis. During the past year, average monthly earnings increased by a factor of only 14.2, while consumer prices went up by a factor of 23. The price of consumer services jumped even higher -- by a factor of 24 -- but there was a record price hike in the housing sector -- by a factor of 62. And you now have to pay 37 times more for medical services than you did a year ago. In a word, the crisis in the economy and the social sphere has affected all strata of the population. Many Kazakhstanis are pinning their hopes for a better future on the professional parliament, whose first session opened last week.
