Hata told a news conference that there are priority areas in the ongoing trade framework talks with the United States and that Tokyo wants to do its utmost to come up with good results. Japan will negotiate with the United States with independence and will keep in mind the improvement of Japanese living standards, and not just place importance on its relation with the United States, he said. Hata also called for U.S. efforts in bringing the bilateral talks to a successful conclusion. He countered U.S. calls for Japan to boost market shares of foreign goods to the level of other industrialized nations, saying there is agreement on free trade.
