According to the chamber, the lobbying group, led by Chairman Gerald Murdock and President Frank Martin, will make it clear that "the chamber has been, and continues to be, adamantly opposed to any conditions placed on China's MFN." Murdock said, "while we believe the promotion of American values is and must remain an important part of American foreign policy, the current annual MFN debate, featuring human rights as the defining issue in our China policy, is both counterproductive to the overall relationship and ineffective in fostering long-term human rights improvements." He said his chamber will fully endorse the view expressed in Washington this week by Hong Kong Chief Secretary Anson Chan that "continuous, constructive dialogue and engagement with China "is the best solution." "Linking human rights or other conditions to a worldwide standard of trade is not in the interest of either country," Murdock said. He said, "over the past several years, the human rights situation in China has improved significantly." The delegation will meet with relevant U.S. officials in Washington from May 2 to 6. Six members of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing will join those from Hong Kong for a total of 23 delegates, the largest mission to date. In another development, Chief Secretary Anson Chan described her meeting with U.S. Vice-President Al Gore on Friday [29 April] at the White House as extremely useful and interesting. Anson Chan said, "we had a good discussion about the MFN issue, how this might impact on the U.S.-China relationship and on conditions in Hong Kong." She said Hong Kong in the 21st century will matter to the Chinese mainland, Asia and the rest of the world. "It will matter to U.S. business as a prosperous, open and externally-oriented market, as a gateway to China and as a business center for East Asia as a whole," Anson Chan added.
