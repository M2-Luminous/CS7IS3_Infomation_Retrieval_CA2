However, it cannot be said that everything is definitively over and that the clouds have rolled by, never to return unless this agreement is implemented in accordance with a definite timeframe. A good reading of this agreement will show that the Yemeni unity, which began in May 1990, is heading toward a confederation This is clear from the agreement's emphasis on decentralizing the Yemeni republic's administration. In fact, this would in any case prove to be a thousand times better than a shaky merger liable to explode at any moment. In addition to the decentralized administration, the agreement stipulates redeployment of forces and removing military posts situated in and outside towns. AL-DUSTUR has learned that efforts are now being made to prepare for a large ceremony so that Salih al-Bid can sign the agreement under King Husayn's patronage and in the presence of Omani Sultan Qabus and Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat. Other Arab officials may be invited to this signing ceremony in addition to the diplomatic corps. Obviously, the site of this celebration in which the president and his deputy will meet for the first time in five months, is still a controversial issue. [passage omitted] A senior Yemeni source which participated in drafting the agreement, regarded now by the Yemenis as a new proclamation of unity, said that al-Bid, who has been residing in Aden since August, informed the dialogue committee that he was prepared to meet with the president in any place and at any time that the committee sees fit and that he has no reservations on anything that is based on the contents of the agreement. While it is true that the agreement has ended the tension and imparted an atmosphere of relief represented by the drop in the dollar price from 75 to 50 Yemeni rials on the black market within hours of the announcement of the agreement, optimists put the rate of possible success in implementing the agreement at only 40 percent. [passage omitted] It is well known that there are currently four armies of different sizes and diverging loyalties in Yemen. These are the Sanaa-based army which takes orders from President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, the Aden-based army which takes orders from 'Ali Salim al- Bid, an army owing allegiance to 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, the former president of the former People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, and paramilitary militias which belong to the reform movement led by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar. Reliable information sources say that all the Yemeni groups which reached the agreement the day before yesterday have agreed to seek the assistance of Jordanian military expertise to reunite and rehabilitate the Yemeni Armed Forces. If all goes well, a Jordanian Army force will travel to Yemen within three weeks. [passage omitted]
