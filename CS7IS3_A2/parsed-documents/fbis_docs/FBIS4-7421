FBIS4-7421 "dreas083_d_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-083 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 South Korea Speculation on Expected Cabinet Reshuffle Speculation on Expected Cabinet Reshuffle SK2904042294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0320 GMT 29 Apr 94 SK2904042294 Seoul YONHAP English BFN [Text] Seoul, April 29 (YONHAP) -- While observing the seemingly endless wrangling between the ruling and opposition parties, President Kim Yong-sam kept silent during the past week since he wanted the National Assembly to approve his new prime minister. Moreover, Kim made no mention whatsoever of Yi Hoe-chang after he had the former prime minister step down for challenging the president's authority. Kim has refrained from commenting on the former premier as he felt a deep sense of betrayal by Yi Hoe-chang, according to some Chongwadae [presidential offices] aides. The chief executive, however, has by no means been inactive over the week. He visited a precision-instrument factory in Ansan on Sunday and invited 58 "new Koreans," selected from various segments of society, to Chongwadae for talks on Tuesday. He praised them for setting a good example for the rest of the country. On Wednesday, Kim presided over a meeting of the New Economy Promotion Committee at a Kwachon Government Building, showing he was concentrating on boosting the nation's economy and stabilizing consumer prices. He then went down to Asan, South Chungchong Province, to attend a cermony marking the 449th anniversary of the birth of Admiral Yi Sun-sin and visited the grave of Yun Pong-kil in Yesan to pay his respects to the independence fighter. Through all these activities, Kim may have wished to demonstrate to the people that their chief executive was busy even though the legislative branch was wallowing in one constroversy after another. No one can say the president is in a happy frame of mind these days, said one aide. It is apparent, however, that he is determined to lead the nation no matter what. But many officials at Chongwadae cannot deny that the past week seemed as long as a month, not because of a subdued president but because of the opposition Democratic Party's refusal to approve Yi Yong-tok as prime minister. The administration has been caught in a vacuum, so to speak, throughout the entire week. The execution of national policies has been put off and most Chongwadae and government officials await the National Assembly's approval of their top administrator. Chongwadae has stood ready since last Monday for a ceremony at which the president was to hand his credentials to the new prime minister, but had to postone it day after day. There had been speculation that President Kim would not simply sit idle and leave the National Assembly in an unproductive mess. He must be contemplating some action, observers said. He would surely act as soon as the National Assembly approved his prime minister, they said. In other words, the president had no intention of allowing the government to limp along in approving the prime minister-designate. He would patiently wait for the National Assembly to finally come to its senses and give him a full-fledged prime minister. "That is the Kim YS style -- the great and orthodox path," one commentator said. As soon as Yi Yong-tok is approved as prime minister, the president will consult with him and name Yi's replacement at the National Unification Board. There may be a limited reshuffle of the cabinet as well. But since the current difficulty -- or "national crisis" as the opposition party calls it -- resulted from the resignation of Yi Hoe-chang, his replacement will put the government back on track. No more personnel changes are needed, they said. In fact, some observers believe that President Kim will retain all of his senior presidential secretaries at Chongwadae and change very little in the cabinet, leaving its framework intact. At the first cabinet meeting to be followed by a reshuffle, the president will likely ask his ministers to rally around the new prime minister and work for his administration's overriding goal of reform.
