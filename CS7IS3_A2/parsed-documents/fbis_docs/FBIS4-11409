Petrella contends that "every solution based on the use of force sooner or later causes problems and grievances." This is why "the war was so bad for Argentina." Petrella said the war "destroyed the domestic consensus in Argentina and its consequences are there for everyone to see. It also prompted British diplomacy to be much more cautious." Moreover, it caused the British and the Kelpers to mistrust Argentina. Ruling out the use of force, Petrella notes that it is unethical, it does not offer any solutions, and besides "we value and need relations with the United Kingdom and with Europe, which is practically one and the same thing." The deputy foreign minister hailed the lifting by United States and Europe of the embargo on the sale of weapons to Argentina. He especially regretted that Great Britain has not yet lifted its embargo, "because a considerable part of Argentine military hardware was traditionally British." Petrella said Argentina does not need the oil that reportedly exists in the South Atlantic, as "it has huge reserves, while more and more oil fields are being discovered." Argentina intends, however, "to prevent the Malvinas Islands' administration and the United Kingdom from acting unilaterally," as "the legitimacy of any investment would prompt legal problems because it is an area under dispute."
