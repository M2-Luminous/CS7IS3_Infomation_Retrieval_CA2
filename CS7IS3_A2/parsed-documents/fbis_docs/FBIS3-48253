It is for this reason that we have persistently called on the government to overhaul the tax system -- by readjusting the ratio of direct and indirect taxes -- and to proceed with implementing income tax cuts on that premise [that the tax system will be overhauled]. The Tax Commission's interim report compiled in November essentially is based on this line of thinking, too. The problem is how specifically this thinking can be reflected in the tax system reform to be carried out next year. We would like to insist that the concept of "effecting in one package" the income tax cut and consumption tax increase -- as proposed in the Tax Commission's report -- should be interpreted flexibly. The Finance Ministry has recently been persisting in saying that "even if and when the income tax cut is implemented first, the relevant bill supporting it should state clearly when the consumption tax will be raised." But such a policy will substantially undercut the effect as an economic stimulus measure which it is hoped that the tax cut will have. As a matter of principle, no doubt, what is desirable is to implement the income tax cut and the increase in the consumption tax at the same time. But with the economic recession only worsening, there have emerged opinions that the tax system overhaul should be put to use in boosting the economy and that the income tax cut should proceed [prior to increasing the consumption tax]. But according to the Finance Ministry, even when that happens, it should happen only after it is written in the law that the consumption tax should be raised in turn to prevent the income tax cut from "continuing freely." That policy may be logical as far as the Finance Ministry is concerned. After all, it is the office which needs to guard against the national treasury growing poorer. The Economic Outlook Is Growing Grimmer But we think that such a policy is no longer realistic. We would like to note that economic conditions have further deteriorated while the Hosokawa government has stood idle. The mid-term and long-term assessments of the economy by corporate managers and consumers is growing grimmer. They appear to think that even if the nation does succeed in escaping its current swamp, there will be no hope of achieving the annual 3.5-percent growth rate envisaged in the government's Five-Year Economic Plan To Achieve a Better Quality of Life. The best indication of such a mood may be that major companies all have rushed toward revising their mid-term and long-term employment plans and readjusting existing jobs. Even where the spring labor offensive for wage increases is concerned, the best that the unions can hope for is a wage increase consisting of routine promotions. We cannot at this time hope that national consumption, which is being affected by the double blows of employment uneasiness and restrained wages, to increase. Naturally, the raise in the consumption tax should be effected only on the grand premise that the economy has fully returned on track. Under the given economic situation, it is impossible to make any predictions. There is no guarantee that the nation will be in any condition to implement the consumption tax increase by the spring of next year as is claimed by the Finance Ministry. Some in the government appear to think that "if the date that the tax will be increased is publicized beforehand, that can induce the people to hurry to spend before that time." No one can deny that possibility, but we also have to think about what will happen after that. It is only common sense to expect that there will be instances of backlash. But we object to the idea of uncoupling a consumption tax increase [from the income tax cut] which is being mentioned by some people in the ruling and opposition camps, as well as in business circles. Before the income tax is cut, it is only natural that the maximum available sources of revenue to cover the shortfall caused by the cut should be found -- through administrative reforms and by correcting the unfair tax system. But if that happens, the effect of cutting the tax is bound to decrease also. But, if that is not done, the financial conditions will worsen further. Moreover, it will become impossible to carry out the tax system reform pertaining to the upcoming aging society. Seen from that viewpoint, we believe that the concept of "effecting in one package" [the income tax cut and the consumption tax increase] needs to be maintained. We will not discuss the legal technicalities, but we do insist that the government come up with a way of incorporating in the bill a clause to the effect that "once the economy recovers, the consumption tax will be raised." What is important is that the basic position on implementing both the tax system overhaul and the income tax reduction [ahead of the consumption tax increase] not be altered. The scale of the income tax cut should never be reduced just because the time to implement the income tax cut has not yet been set. Since the announcement of the overall economic stimulus measures at the end of August, a total of 30 trillion yen's worth of projects have been launched, but they have made almost no contribution to economic stimulation. The reason for this is that there has not been enough so-called "fresh water" that could lead to the direct creation of demand. Besides, the measures came out piecemeal. The tax cut must be full-fledged in its scale -- in its role as an economic stimulus measure and as part of the tax system overhaul plan. As we have persistently pointed out so far, it is essential to secure a tax cut of at least 6 trillion yen by easing the progressive curve in tax burdens on the middle income bracket. The burdens of the income tax and residents tax on middle and higher income earners are now nearly back to where they were prior to the previous tax reform. What the tax authorities call "energy for reform" has accumulated adequately. Don't Fall Into the Pace of the Bureaucrats What concerns us is that while the politicians have stopped moving, the bureaucrats appear to have increased in power. As long as the Finance Ministry holds power, it is apt to persist in its position of demanding balanced finances. But the given conditions dictate that the financial functions play a valuable role in "shoring up the economy." We urge the government and the ruling coalition parties to begin discussions and to agree on the advance implementation of the income tax cut. The economy itself is not pausing. The longer the decision to deal with it is delayed, the harder it becomes for a policy decision to be effective. We also have demands of the Tax Commission. The commission is delaying discussions on the question of an income tax and the consumption tax -- which will be the central theme of the tax system reform next year -- using the excuse that the Hosokawa government has not presented a basic policy on it. But is that a good enough excuse? The commission should fill in the policy portion, which the coalition parties are not familiar with, by holding discussions on its own and by presenting many ideas. That will certainly not lead to a narrowing of the scope of political alternatives, as is claimed by some people in the ruling parties. The tax system has a direct impact on the lives of the people. The people are concerned about what will happen to tax rates and into which bracket they will fall under the system, and they want to find out if changes envisaged in the new tax system are reasonable. As such, they want to have information with which to make their decisions -- as much as possible and as soon as possible. But we wonder whether the Tax Commission has not fallen into the pace of the bureaucrats. We hope that the incident of Commission Chairman Kato recently retracting his earlier remarks, for instance, does not prove that that was what happened. We want the commission to do its work independently on its own.
