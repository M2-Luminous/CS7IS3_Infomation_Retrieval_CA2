"Japan has properly accepted (international) nuclear inspections," said the official on the condition of anonymity. "Nuclear armament will not benefit Japan...I can understand some countries think Japan will arm with nuclear weapons if North Korea does so." The official said Japan must clear the suspicion on such occasions as summit meetings and foreign ministerial meetings with every country. Earlier the same day, North Korea accused Japan of promoting a plan to become a nuclear power, according to the official KOREAN CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY (KCNA). "The commissioning of Monju fully reveals Japan's undisguised scheme to become a nuclear power by securing a large quantity of plutonium for itself and manufacturing nuclear weapons any moment," the KCNA said. Monju reached criticality Tuesday morning in Tsuruga, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. Criticality is the point at which the reaction in the reactor's fissionable material is sufficient to sustain a chain reaction. Some environmentalists have criticized the operation of Monju partly because plutonium can be used to produce nuclear weapons.
