Peng Xiaomin, of the Exit and Entry Administrative Section of the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department, said that the policy toward exit and entry for personal reasons--which are more preferential than those of other localities in China--are as follows: First, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department can issue visas directly to Taiwan residents upon arrival at the Haikou and Sanya ports. In accordance with the policy of "issuing visas on landing," Taiwan residents need not go through any formalities before they come to Hainan. With valid documents, they can fly from Taiwan to Hong Kong, change planes there, and come to Hainan. In addition, if compatriots from Taiwan wish to go to any open city on the mainland, but do not want to stay in Hong Kong or Macao to go through formalities, they also can come to Hainan first, obtain an "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan Resident Visiting the Mainland," then take a plane from Hainan to the hinterland. They can leave the mainland via any open port and without restriction. The Exit and Entry Administrative Section of the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department has set up visa offices at the airports and wharves of the Haikou and Sanya ports where incoming compatriots from Taiwan can obtain an "Entry and Exit Permit for Taiwan Resident Visiting the Mainland" immediately after showing valid documents, filling in a form, and submitting two photos. The formalities are very simple. Second, it will not only be easy to enter Hainan, but convenient to leave it as well. In accordance with Hainan's policy on formalities connected with the "Application for Exit Permit With a Certificate of Temporary Residence"--which has been approved by the Ministry of Public Security--working personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than six months and who have registered their residence outside Hainan may apply in Hainan for travel documents to visit other countries and Hong Kong. Working personnel who have lived in Hainan for more than one year not only can travel to other countries, but also can apply for passports for personal reasons, such as work, visits to relatives and friends, or for training abroad. In particular, Chinese citizens can go by sea to Vietnam following the Sanya-Da Nang sea route, and foreigners and compatriots from Taiwan can come directly from Vietnam to Hainan. It is said that this is China's only exit and entry sea link with Vietnam. In addition, the Ministry of Public Security and the Hong Kong Immigration Department have agreed that beginning 1 January this year, the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department may issue "Multiple Entry and Exit Permit for Visitors to Hong Kong and Macao" for personal reasons. This will be convenient for individuals engaged in trade, economic, and science and technology activities in Hainan who want to go to Hong Kong. The statistics indicate that the number of foreigners who came to Hainan for a short stay last year amounted to 22,887 -- an increase of 5.8 percent over the previous year. Last year, the number of Taiwan residents who came to Haikou by plane or by sea directly from Taiwan via Hong Kong amounted to 4,348.
