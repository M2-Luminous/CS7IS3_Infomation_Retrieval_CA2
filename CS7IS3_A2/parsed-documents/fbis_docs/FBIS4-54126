And then, on 8 April, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned, and Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata was designated his successor. Later, the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] left the coalition, a minority cabinet was formed, and there have been strong signs of an approaching political realignment. The effect of this on Japan-U.S. relations can be considerable. For the U.S. Government, since it was expecting continuity in foreign policy and the trade negotiations, and was anticipating the installation of a pragmatic cabinet even before Hata was elected prime minister, it was somewhat reassured. However, the SDPJ's withdrawal from the coalition came as a great surprise, even though it had been believed all along that such an event would come sooner or later. Undoubtedly, this has greatly enhanced the U.S. feeling of anxiety about Japan. How do we find a way out of this situation? More than anything else, the Japanese people should realize that "the framework talks' purpose is to see a tangible reduction in Japan's surplus. There are only two ways to do this: reduce the surplus numerically or through price adjustment. If we refuse to do it numerically, appreciation of the yen will be the inevitable consequence." Toward this end, while numerical targets would be out of the question at the microeconomic level, in macroeconomics, it would be advisable for the government to indicate its political will through numerical targets for the ratio of current account surplus to gross domestic product, or for efforts to narrow the price gap between Japan and foreign countries. Furthermore, in macroeconomic policy, measures that will have obvious and "impressive" effects in stimulating the economy, such as adding another 100 trillion yen to the 430 trillion yen public investment program, or implementing income tax reductions for at least three years in advance [before implementing the consumption tax hike]--which the Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association of Corporate Executives] has suggested--will be necessary. With regard to deregulation, a concrete and effective list should be compiled as soon as possible, and a powerful third- party watchdog organ should also be established. Applying the Objective Criteria Is Japan's Job A certain measure of progress will also be needed on the issue of numerical targets or objective criteria, which was the immediate cause for the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. summit and the framework talks. Specifically, Japan has to make the United States pledge not to demand numerical targets for each individual sector. President Bill Clinton and responsible U.S. negotiators repeatedly made statements to this effect at the news conference after the summit meeting and on other occasions. It would be possible to make this an official commitment. On the other hand, with regard to objective criteria, it should be possible to quantify and measure the relationship between the degree of "acceptance" of products and services--for instance, degree of customer satisfaction--and the degree of "penetration" in each other's market in the past and at present. It would also be possible to compare and evaluate the tempo of the penetration and expansion of U.S. products and services in Japan in terms of similar applicable indices in other markets. It would just be rational to reach prior agreement that: Through a comparison of the degree of "acceptance" at a future point in time with that of the present, or through a comparison of U.S. products with similar products from Japan and other countries, if a positive change can be confirmed, this will be taken to mean a corresponding progress in the penetration and expansion of such products in the Japanese market. It would certainly be possible to evaluate the relationship between actual degree of "acceptance" and "penetration" when that "future point in time" is reached, or even in the course of reaching such a point. While the United States is responsible for giving up its demand on sector-specific numerical targets, it is Japan's job to take the initiative in the matter of applying objective criteria. If objective criteria are used in the above-described manner, this cannot be termed managed trade. The important thing is, such an evaluation process should be conducted as an independent activity of the private sector in all areas, except for the "government-reach" sectors (sectors under government jurisdiction). The World Is Looking At Japan and the United States It must not be forgotten that, in building a new world order after the Cold War, Asia and the world look to Japan and the United States to exercise responsible, mature leadership. One issue here is domestic reforms in Japan. Another is Japan-U.S. relations, specifically, the solution of economic issues between the two countries not only from a bilateral perspective, but also dealing with them with a shared common perception between the two countries from a multilateral perspective. In this regard, Japan and the United States can experiment on the new approach of holding a joint "new Japan-U.S. summit" for both the governments and the private sectors of both countries to reach a responsible conclusion in economic negotiations, and to discuss major mid- and long-term bilateral issues. Japan and the United States hold summits twice a year. One of these can be held as a joint government-private sector summit alternately in Japan and the United States. If the boundary between government and private-sector meetings is demolished, leaders of the governments and private sectors in both countries, headed by the prime minister and the president, can sit down at the same conference table and build a consensus on bilateral issues of common concern. Such a venue may be able to come up with more coherent and more consistent solutions to various problems. In any case, time is running out. We certainly hope that Prime Minister Hata will exercise strong leadership to resolve the pending issues between Japan and the United States by taking the initiative in the issue of objective criteria, as discussed above, and by adopting the new approach to bilateral summits.
