Rumors Around the Republic Speak of Possible Coup d'Etat"] [Text] According to information from trustworthy sources, the state of health of Turkmenia [Turkmenistan] President Saparmurad Niyazov continues to worsen every day, and he is planning a new course of treatment in Houston (United States), where he recently was operated on for blood vessel problems, or in Turkey. For this reason he has been absent of late from ceremonial events including those held in his honor. The Turkmenia president's press service denies information on Niyazov's deteriorating health while rumors are circulating in the Republic about a possible coup d'etat. The rivalry for the Turkmenian presidency is already on. Those intending to compete for the position of head of state are Agriculture Minister Payzgeldy Meredov, and Kurban Orazov, head of the Mary Oblast administration. Notably, according to information from trustworthy sources, both "rivals" will not stop short of a coup d'etat in the president's absence. Payzgeldy Meredov has headed the republic's agricultural agency for many years, and he makes his own decisions on the destinies of Turkmenian cotton by setting prices and export quotas. As his comrades-in-arms think, he has amassed a vast fortune selling cotton and is the country's wealthiest man. Kurban Orazov has long been head of the republic's Mary Oblast in addition to heading Turkmenistan's central electoral committee. President S. Niyazov, who once gambled on these men, lately has been preferring Valeriy Otchertsov and Boris Shikhmuradov, vice prime ministers for the economy and politics. They, however, enjoy no prestige among the republic's inhabitants because they do not know national peculiarities, traditions, and the local language. Both vice prime ministers are openly hostile to one another and compete for influence with President Niyazov. Valeriy Otchertsov is a more devoted follower of President Niyazov. In Soviet times, he held the position of second secretary of the Komsomol Central Committee and, being Moscow's protege, controlled local leaders' activities. Local observers believe that rumors of a possible coup are being spread mainly by P. Meredov's men in order to psych up the public for this event. The majority of the Turkmen leadership gamble precisely on Meredov, regarding Vice Premiers Otchertsov and Shakhmuradov as temporary executors of the current Turkmenistan president's will. In the meantime, leaders of the Turkmenian opposition based in Moscow are alarmed at the rumors being spread about a possible coup d'etat in Turkmenistan, and they firmly state that the opposition, in the shape of the "Turkmenistan" fund organization, has enough resources and potentialities to hinder this. Characterizing the information about a possible coup d'etat in Turkmenistan, Murat Esenov, an opposition leader and the "Turkmenistan" fund general director, stated in an interview for your SEGODNYA correspondent that the actions of P. Meredov and K. Orazov could entail undesirable consequences for the country. Due to the absence of a social base and prestige among the population, they intend to gamble on the "power" ministries in the struggle for power. Therefore, heads of these ministries should take into account the experience of their close neighbors Tajikistan and Afghanistan, where civil war erupted after a similar situation had developed. Answering questions from your correspondent, Murat Esenov confirmed information on the deteriorating state of health of the head of state and added, "We would be glad to see the president in good health and compete with him on a legal basis in the 1997 presidential elections. Members of the opposition will by all means insist on holding them irrespective of the referendum results on extending President Niyazov's powers.
