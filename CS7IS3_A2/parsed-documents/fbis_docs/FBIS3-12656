He said: Following the Hebron massacre that claimed the lives of 53 Palestinians, it is necessary to remove the Jerwish settlements from the occupied territories to bring about peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis. He stressed that the Hebron massacre provided an opportunity for a two-stage settlement, and said that the lesson that has been learned shows clearly the need for the Israeli Army to withdraw from the occupied territories in implementation of the UN resolutions. Brother Bassam Abu-Sharif also said that U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to the Palestinians and the Israelis to hold serious negotiations in Washington gives an opportunity to President Clinton to prove to the Arab and Islamic world his interest in peace. Concluding, he said that it is Washington's duty to intervene, in its capacity as a partner in the peace process, to completely end the Israeli occupation and to finance the purchase of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for the Palestinians.
