When the U.S. President came to our city, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen briefed the U.S. press traveling with Clinton and said: If the rate of inflation in Russia remains just as crazy, I am afraid that there will be a question mark over aid from across the ocean. Quite little time has elapsed, and already the question of aid has moved to quite a different level. I will remark, however, that for those few days when the stir over Fedorov's resignation was continuing, informed sources were saying: America wants to see him as an "active player" and even allegedly links the granting of aid with specific personalities. To judge from the move which Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee of the U.S. Congress, made recently, this really is so. Addressing the committee, he declared the following: "Although I support aid for Russia and am convinced of the need to give it, I will find it very hard to say 'yes' to economic aid for Russia if the Central Bank generously issues credits to large state enterprises in a few months' time. If the Central Bank does not take tough measures against inflation, it will escalate into hyperinflation and reduce to naught all the efforts to assist Russia." The competence of the trans-Atlantic legislators and their desire to participate in the long-standing litigation between the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance are undoubtedly pleasant. [sentence as published] America's displeasure at the fact that the new Russian Government consists of "conservatives" is also obvious. Maybe it is not worthwhile to pull the wool over everyone's eyes: In allocating money, the U.S. Congress and Administration themselves then put the brakes on it, falling short in their gifts and payments. On the other hand, they lobby ardently for politicians whom they love dearly. How can we disagree with Vladimir Petrovich Lukin, who, having quit his ambassadorial post in Washington, has already spoken out with no allowances for diplomatic protocol: The Americans should refrain from commenting on the composition of the government being formed. It is indecent to exert such pressure, particularly as "not everything is paid for." During his visit to Moscow, Bill Clinton tried to persuade the Russians that he had "come as a friend," not as a mentor. Evidently impressed by these words, our president relaxed and failed to give him instructions to be passed on to the Congress as to who should be approved as secretary of defense -- after all, Perry advocates the preservation of major military programs....
