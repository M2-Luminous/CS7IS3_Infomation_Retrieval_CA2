[Munoz] Good afternoon Alfredo and friends. [Palacios] MAS [Movement Toward Socialism] will be in the government for the first time. Although it has been in the government at the regional level, it will now be in the government at the national level. MAS will be in the ruling group at a time when the country is experiencing a difficult period. For an example of this, we just have to think of the economic problems and the enormous fiscal hole in which we are. [Munoz] It is not a hole but a long tunnel of financial difficulties. [Palacios] We have spiraling inflation and constant Bolivar devaluations. Although we understand that President-elect Caldera will be the central figure, what will be the policy or guidelines that MAS will promote in the new government? [Munoz] You already said it. Definitely, a very important part of what will be done is in Caldera's hands. The specific guidelines to carry out the policies are in his hands. Of course, we will be a force within the government. We want that, and Caldera wants that. Thus, it should be very clear to everyone, the public, the president -- he is already very clear about it -- our people, and the MAS leadership that we will be a force that will enter the government through the big doors and with great responsibility. [Palacios] In specific terms, what does that mean? [Munoz] It means that we will participate in formulating the great policies of the new government. It will be done through a dialogue with Dr. Caldera and those who make up his government team, including MAS members and friends. It also means that we will act as a force that will watch and follow up the work done by the government. This force will also analyze the government and draw up conclusions. In the third place, we will be a link between the government and people in the streets, the civic society, and the world of the majority. We will not be a force that because it is in the government it becomes a staunch supporter, loses its critical spirit, forgets its autonomy, and only talks and acts as the government. [Palacios] Does it mean that at any given moment you could act as an opposition force? [Munoz] I am not saying that. I am saying that we must be a force that is not unconditional. Why? Because by being a government force, we have great responsibility to the country. In fact, we decided to enter the government and back Caldera because we felt that -- under the present historic circumstance -- we were fulfilling our responsibility to the country. Caldera seemed to be the candidate who -- under the present circumstances -- could best do the difficult job of facing the situation you mentioned when we were talking about economic matters. However, it is a situation that spreads to other areas of our lives. Consequently, our primary obligation is to the country. Our obligation to the country is partly fulfilled through our work with the government, but particularly through our direct contact with the people. [Palacios] But to have a position of weight within the government, you should hold important posts in that government, especially in what is known as the economic cabinet. Will you be present there? [Munoz] We have been holding talks with the president. It is no secret that he is not finished deciding who will be in his government. It is true that he is discussing that with us too. It is not our right but our duty to discuss these matters with him. We are not a force that will tell him: Here are our people ready to obey you. No, we will be part of the government, but we will discuss and reach a basic understanding as to what course the government will take. To support Caldera, we discussed a basic offer for the country. We reached agreements. [Palacios] To give the country that course... [Munoz interrupting] ...our presence must have the necessary weight. [Palacios] That is correct. [Munoz] Only if this presence has the necessary weight, will we participate in the new government. I think this is something Dr. Caldera understands very well. For this reason, we said that there will be an agreement. [Palacios] Amid the situation I described at the beginning, there is the VAT problem. This is one of the most controversial issues right now. [Munoz] That is true. [Palacios] And it will continue to be a hot issue until we see the measures that the new government will take. What is the proposal you have in this regard: eliminating the VAT once and for all, and if so, what will you replace it with? What will you do? [Munoz] Let me tell you what we MAS members think, what we have proposed to Dr. Caldera, what we are discussing with him. When I say discussing I mean we are exchanging opinions. During the electoral campaign we said the VAT should be suspended, not eliminated for good. We believe it is not correct for the VAT to never have existed. There are only five countries left in the world without VAT. These are countries with different characteristics and levels of development. We said it should be suspended to determine how the tax could be created within the framework of global tax reform and, above all, within the framework of global fiscal reform. Here, when the VAT was presented as a proposal, not under the Velasquez administration but under the Carlos Andres Perez administration, the government wrongfully tried to compensate for the enormous reduction resulting from the approval of the income Tax Reform Law, which reduced payments from higher-income sectors, with the VAT. We said this was absolutely absurd, that is to reduce the income tax contribution from the wealthy to such a level. We said it was completely unfair from the social viewpoint, and erroneous from the fiscal policy viewpoint. [Palacios] Does this mean that you are thinking about increasing income tax? [Munoz] Yes. That is one.... [pauses] our first proposal.... [Palacios, interrupting] Experience has taught us that taxpayers somehow evade income tax payments.... [Munoz, interrupting] That is right, but VAT payments are also evaded. World experience indicates that the level of evasion for income tax is higher than that for VAT, but VAT payments are also evaded. It has been estimated, in places where collections are performed more efficiently, that VAT payments are evaded by at least 30 to 40 percent. [Palacios] In this fiscal reform you have announced, is there any specific measure that can be made public? [Munoz] One, we will work to reform the Income Tax Law to increase collections of this tax. Two, we will reorganize the tax collections system and will implement new collections techniques that may include hiring specific specialized companies to perform collection duties. These techniques have been applied in other countries, and even in some Venezuelan states. Three, some taxes such as tax on luxury consumption, which is fair from the social standpoint.... [Palacios, interrupting] Will these taxes be enough to close the fiscal deficit? This is the great concern facing Venezuelans. [Munoz] We will also reduce spending as much as possible. The fiscal gap is reduced and is definitely closed not only by increasing fiscal revenues, but also by cutting government spending. [Palacios] Reduction of government spending usually translates into dismissal of personnel. [Munoz] Not necessarily. [Palacios] If a real spending reduction is desired, personnel must be dismissed. [Munoz] Listen, government spending is rigid in Venezuela. That means it has several components whose dimensions are seldom modified. But there is a part of spending that can indeed be reduced. This portion may not represent one fourth of total spending, but it may represent one tenth or one fifteenth. Following a path of alternative solutions that do not close the gap, the government may propose with the understanding and acceptance of the population -- which will see there are other decisions and actions being taken and promises being met, while the government is working efficiently -- a reformulation of the VAT-type tax. [Palacios] To conclude this interview because we are short on time, did you aspire to run for the post of Senate president. [Munoz] No, I did not hope to run. [Palacios] At least this is what you had said. [Munoz] MAS proposed that we should [words indistinct] continues to feel that way. [Palacios] National Convergence has proposed a different candidate. Does this mean you are experiencing your first big difference with National Convergence. [Munoz] No, it is only a difference and we are going to discuss it. [Palacios] We thank Freddy Munoz for being with us today.
