Containment measures are being pursued with the aim of ensuring safe navigation through the Three Gorges area and protecting the projected reservoir. The rockface, nicknamed the "Huangla Stone" with a total volume of 40 million cu m, is located at the juncture of the Xiling and Xixia gorges and is only 64 km away from the area where the gigantic water control dam is to be built. According to experts, the rocky outcrop is the most dangerous spot in the Three Gorges, with increasingly frequent slippage and poor stability in the main body of the rock heightening concerns over the past few years. Extended rains or a jarring earthquake in the region would be likely to cause the Huangla Stone to fall into the Chang Jiang River, triggering waves as high as 20-80 m to surge along the river. Moreover, if the rock happens to break loose, it will not only destroy the Badong County seat and nearby villages and farmland, but also block the entire navigable route of the Yangtze, bringing navigation of ships in the area to a standstill. In addition, several million tons of silt may follow the landslide into the Yangtze, further worsening water pollution in the river, said the experts. The State Council, China's central government, has attached great attention to the harnessing of the dangerous rock. Before the official launching of containment work, experts from nine national organizations were recruited to carry out research on the feasibility of harnessing the rock. According to Qu Xingyuan, chief of the headquarters in charge of Huangla Stone harnessing, they have adopted the method of building drainage projects on the surface of the ground and below the ground, in a bid to improve and enhance the stability of the rock. In nearby areas where landslides are most likely to occur, facilities with the functions of holding water back from the surfaces and draining water from inside have also been built to forestall landslides. So far, more than 500 workers have taken on the harnessing work, digging out 5,500 cu m of earth and building 2,300 m of drainage canals. The first-phase harnessing work is expected to be completed in May.
