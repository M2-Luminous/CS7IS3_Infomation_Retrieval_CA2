This ill-boding war confab set us on our guard because it took place at a time when the U.S. hardline conservative forces and war-thirsty elements in the military were letting loose war blasts without hesitation, shouting themselves hoarse that "a strict reaction must be shown to North Korea" and "the United States must make a showdown with North Korea with arms." Facts prove that the South Korean puppet clique is a group of bellicose elements who are bent on lighting the fuze of war to exterminate the nation, not wanting to fundamentally resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. However, it is a foolish dream for the South Korean war maniacs to overpower our republic by military force. If the South Korean puppet clique recklessly start a war at the instigation of the outside forces, our people and the heroic People's Army will mete out severe punishment to them.
