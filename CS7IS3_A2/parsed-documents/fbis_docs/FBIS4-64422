Both the plenary of the Strasbourg assembly and its Foreign Affairs Committee beat back attempts to get the biggest ever increase in the Euro-club postponed. The Parliament's struggle to win more power from the member states and the European Commission has held EU enlargement hostage for the past two months. Two weeks ago, leaders of the dominant Socialist and Christian Democrat blocs in Strasbourg agreed to put through the accession treaty, in exchange for pledges that Parliament would be closely associated with the 1996 review of the Maastricht Treaty and power-sharing in the EU. But party managers in Strasbourg are still nervous about whether enough Euro-MPs will turn up to ratify the enlargement, intended to bring Sweden, Austria, Finland and Norway into the Union next January. Failure by the Parliament to ratify could easily sabotage the four applicant countries' difficult referendums on membership this autumn, and very possibly complicate ratification by national parliaments of the Twelve. A first attempt yesterday by the far-right to get enlargement taken off this week's agenda was easily defeated by 287 votes to eight, with four abstentions. The unsurprising size of this quashing of the Euro-fascists is less relevant than the size of Euro-MPs' presence in Strasbourg, given that a third of MEPs [Member of the European Parliament] rarely turn up at all, that next month's elections are set to eject up to two-thirds of present members, and that many of those hoping to survive are on the campaign trail. In tomorrow's vote, 260 of the 518 MEPs must approve enlargement. The Socialists, the largest bloc, reckon they can guarantee 130-140 votes, but there are worries about the Christian Democrats' pledge of 100 votes, while the small groups are less disciplined. The two big blocs both sent their leaderships to lobby yesterday's Foreign Affairs Committee, and to stall the infinite variety of possible procedural snags. Even Mr Jean Louis Bourlanges, the French Christian Democrat who has led the campaign to hold up enlargement dismissed yesterday's skirmishes as "procedural trickery," arguing for a straightforward battle on Wednesday.
