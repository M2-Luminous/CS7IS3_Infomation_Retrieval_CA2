Let us listen to Dragan Bozanic reporting from Geneva: [Begin Bozanic recording] The result of the two-hour unofficial meeting between Yasushi Akashi and his closest military associates, Generals de Lapresle and Rose, with Radovan Karadzic, president of the Srpska republic, Vice President Nikola Koljevic, and Foreign Minister Aleksa Buha could solve the dilemma over whether the negotiations on the cessation of hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina will resume or not. After the Serbian delegation and the Croatian one, headed by Kresimir Zubak, had already arrived here in Geneva, the Muslims said they would not attend the talks until the Gorazde 3-km exclusion zone was allegedly entirely respected. After the UN forces in Gorazde investigate these claims this evening, it will be known whether the meeting on the cessation of hostilities in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is to be held at all. However, we have learned from unofficial sources in the Palais des Nations that the problem of withdrawing a small number of armed Serbian civilians from three villages near Gorazde can be successfully solved and that the representatives of all three warring sides will, after all, sit at the negotiating table tomorrow. This would mean that the international mediators' plans could be fulfilled: Making all three armies, above all the Muslim one, accept the cessation of hostilities; then one could also resume the consultations on a general solution to the crisis in former Bosnia-Herzegovina in the French town of Talloires near Geneva, most probably on 6 June.
