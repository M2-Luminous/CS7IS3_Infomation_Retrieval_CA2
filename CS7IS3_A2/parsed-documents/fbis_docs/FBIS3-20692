Otherwise, they would have voted again and a third, fourth, or fifth time, as many times as it took. That is why there have been no objections to the conduct and regularity of the elections. There have, however, been congratulations: Dr. Radovan Karadzic and Nikola Sainovic, M.A., have congratulated Martic on his election victory. Representatives of the pan-Serb interests of Slobodan Milosevic who have been campaigning with so much fervor at village meetings and over Radio-TV Serbia in favor of the Krajina police minister can now go off for a well-deserved rest. That means that Mihajlo Markovic, member of the academy, no longer has to wander around Banija, Brana Crncevic and Minister Zoran Bingulac do not have to freeze in Baranja, and Radmila Milentijevic does not have to explain to Krsto Bijelic why Milan Babic must not win. It probably was also a relief both to Dr. Franjo Tudjman and to the doves in Krajina. A Miracle in Krajina In the first round of the Krajina presidential elections, held 12 December 1993, Mile Martic received 60,000 votes less than Milan Babic. But all those--and there were many--who saw that as Slobodan Milosevic's defeat in any election proved to be very wrong. The Election Commission of the RSK [Serbian Republic Krajina], after an objection from Martic's headquarters, first nullified the elections in Knin and Benkovac Opcinas, and then in six other electoral units. Then, when they were repeated on 26 December, it found about 4,000 invalid ballots, so that Babic received precisely 49.27 percent of the vote and did not become president. Simultaneously with the official proclamation of the results of the first round of the elections, the Election Commission postponed the second round from 13 to 23 January 1994 without providing any coherent explanation. It was felt, that is, that it would take that long for the strategists in Belgrade to work out a new strategy. That is, it had turned out that pushing Martic beyond any limit of good taste and the failure to mention his opponent even in a single word over Radio-TV Serbia had not borne fruit. The interior minister had concerned himself with idle Serbianizing and commonplaces, which had departed greatly from everyday life in Krajina, and therefore did not interest very many people. The decision was made, then, to sling mud at Babic and to frighten the Krajina population into thinking that they would be left to their fate and to the Croats should he be victorious. Martic himself began it. He accused his rival of intending to take power with a hullabaloo in the media and said that he was not interested in anything else. He said all that could cause a situation in Krajina similar to the one in Cazin Krajina, and that he, disappointed with the methods used by Babic and his people, would withdraw from the election race unless there were changes in the makeup of election commissions and voter committees. The message could not have been stated more clearly--unless Martic's ultimatums are accepted, the elections and the transfer of power become uncertain, and a coup d'etat was certain. If Babic wanted to preserve anything of what he had achieved in the first round, he had to accept that offer. The impression that Serbia would give up on Krajina unless its president was satisfied with the outcome of the elections there was also intensified by some of the correspondents representing the government media in Knin. They accused Babic's people of crimes, separatism aimed against the Srpska republic (joining Krajina and the Banjaluka region), of treason to the nationality, of being close to the opposition in Serbia, and so on. As to how much effect it had, there is a story going around that Lazar Macura, who, it was thought, would become Babic's prime minister, felt it on his own skin. On one occasion, he declared over TV Knin that Dr. Karadzic was traveling around Krajina and campaigning for Martic and that "as a foreign national, he ought not to be allowed to do that." After that, Macura allegedly got on a bus to go from Knin to Belgrade. The police of the Srpska republic, when they were checking the identity cards of the passengers, asked him for his passport. When he said he did not have one, he was taken off the bus as a "foreign national." He tried to hitchhike back to Knin, but Dr. Karadzic's zealous police forbid drivers to let him in. He was allowed to call for a car to come for him from Knin only after he had waited around the whole night near the checkpoint. Nevertheless, Krajina felt what media pressure means when at the beginning of the year Martic's special police occupied all the TV transmitters and thus prevented operation of TV Knin, which was inclined toward Babic. At the same time, Serbian Radio-TV of Krajina, a government institution, was opened in Plitvice. Relying on tested personnel and equipment from TV Novi Sad, this television station mainly concerned itself with various Martic campaign rallies and press releases and passing on everything that Martic's sponsors had to say about Babic in Belgrade. The journalist Petko Koprivica (TV Novi Sad) won particular fame with his statement that "Babic wants unification of Serbian lands, but according to the lights of Vuk Draskovic, Vesna Pesic, and Ivan Djuric." There is no need to spell out that those who were attacked never had the occasion to respond to that propaganda. Martic's key statement was that he would like best to be president of Krajina only five days and then turn over the office to "Milosevic, president of all the Serbs." A sizable portion of Krajina citizens interpreted it this way: Who knows what might happen if Babic returns. The belief that a conflict with Serbia must not be risked at any price seems to have prevailed, and thus a miracle occurred in Krajina--Martic's victory in the second round. The Day After There are also explanations to the effect that Babic was simply told that Belgrade would never accept him as president of Krajina and that he must in the end reconcile himself to his loser's fate. Nevertheless, on the day after the elections Martic is not entirely in the saddle either. Babic's Serbian Democratic Party [SDS] of Krajina has a majority (30 deputies) in the RSK parliament. Together with the Radicals, who number 16, possibly reinforced by some of the eight independent deputies, he is in a position to bring down any candidate for prime minister Matic proposes. Accordingly, it is possible that the post of RSK prime minister will be offered to the former president of Knin Opcina. There are, of course, two conditions: the first is that Babic "get on the right track," and second that the Radicals support him. The first is not very likely, and as matters stand the Krajina Radicals are threatened with a split. That is, a large number of them never supported Dr. Vojislav Seselj in his attacks on Slobodan Milosevic during the Serbian parliamentary election. The names of Djordje Begovic and Boro Mikelic have been circulating as possible future prime ministers. The former has not stood out particularly as prime minister up to now, nor has anyone particularly reproached him in the showdowns between Krajina leaders. He is well-known as a neutral figure far readier to carry out orders than to shape policy. Boro Mikelic is much more interesting in this case. He emerged in Petrinja only when Abdic's Western Bosnia Autonomous Province, or rather its supply corridor through Banija, began to function. Babo from Velika Kladusa has worked out very elaborate trade with the Serbs, so that there are grounds for the assumption that Mikelic, who has been a businessman for many years, has found business interests. He was also one of Martic's propagandists, and the latter has often mentioned him as a patriot to be awed. If things are looked at through the declared intentions of Belgrade and Zagreb to normalize relations, one of the bridges to moderating tensions with Krajina might in any case be Mikelic after the pattern of Abdic. But Martic and Mikelic would be the last to make decisions about that. The Future The joint statement of the Republic of Croatia and the FRY cast great doubt on Martic's election campaign promises of an imminent union. Dr. Karadzic's statement that a unified Serbia must first reach the Una and only afterward the Kupa was also a cold shower. Although the interpretations of Belgrade and Pale that this does not signify renunciation of the proclaimed concept of all Serbs in one state, Krajina political life is moving more and more toward apathy. It has become evident that people are tired out by the elections, all the politicking, and television. Martic's first statement as president after the elections fitted well into the mindset that Krajina is the last to make decisions about its destiny. He said over Radio-TV Serbia that he would gather around him a team of intelligent and able people from all the Serbian lands--that is, both from Serbia and from the Srpska republic. When we recall that his election promises included a strengthening of the police, it is certain that a paramount objective of his authority will be to guarantee that orders from Belgrade are carried out. This is especially important, because power at the opcina level has mainly been taken over by Babic's Serbian Democratic Party of Krajina. Likewise, various emissaries from the Srpska republic are traveling around Krajina and making offers to people who might want to move into abandoned Muslim and Croatian houses there on a turnkey basis. For example, Prijedor and Derventa have been envisaged for people from Plaski. Finally, what else is one to conclude but that the process of a big trade of Krajina has gone pretty far. Martic's job is only to make that as painless as possible--regardless of whether he personally is aware of the role intended for him. [Box, p 12] Krajina Mathematics First Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK Registered voters 289,866 Voters voting 236,300 Votes for Milan Babic 116,014 Votes for Milan Martic 50,000[.sup]1[/] Other presidential candidates 70,000[.sup]1[/] Second Round of the Presidential Elections in the RSK Registered voters 295,611 Voters voting 207,550 Votes for Milan Babic 97,377 Votes for Milan Martic 104,234 [.sup]1[/]The figures from other sources fluctuate by approximately 1,000 votes. The size of the turnout in the second round of the Krajina presidential elections was 28,750 smaller than in the first round. Because it is usual for people to abstain in a runoff, we can assume that it did not affect the final score--especially because Martic was about 60,000 votes short of Babic in the first round. It is of interest, however, that the number of registered voters increased. Their number was 5,745 greater in the second round. The assumption that in the interval between the two rounds that number of citizens of Krajina came of age and that the mortality rate was minimal is not realistic. The matter is still more interesting when we find that in the second round Martic had 6,857 votes more than Babic. The inevitable conclusion is that the Krajina interior minister was given the necessary number of "dead souls" (inhabitants of Krajina who have moved away) necessary for victory. When we realize that the local election commissions and committees were changed to meet Martic's wishes after his defeat in the first round of the elections, this was no problem whatsoever.
