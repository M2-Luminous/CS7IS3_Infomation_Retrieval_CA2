This straightforward official told this reporter immediately after we met: There is a Chinese saying that "on festive occasions we think of our dear ones far away more than ever." We and our compatriots in Taiwan have the same blood ties. As a person specially engaging in Taiwan affairs, I would like to extend, through ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE, Spring Festival greetings from fellow- townsfolk in the northeast to our compatriots in Taiwan, wishing them a still brighter New Year. The northeast is China's heavy industry base and Liaoning is a big industrial province. In recent years, Liaoning has become a popular province in which Taiwanese businessmen and industrialists invest and the province attracts the greatest amount of funds from Taiwan. Director Wang Weifu was all smiles when talking about this matter. He told this reporter: In 1993, there were more than 400 new projects started by Taiwanese investors in Liaoning Province. The contracted amount of Taiwanese investment exceeded $320 million, which was greater than the total in the previous decade. At present, there are a total of over 800 Taiwanese-invested projects in the province and the contracted amount of Taiwanese investment exceeds $600 million, including over 10 projects with more than $10 million of investment and three projects with more than $200 million of investment. We can say that economic cooperation between Liaoning and Taiwan is showing a tendency to make giant strides. The development of economic cooperation and trade will definitely bring about frequent exchanges of personnel. Director Wang Weifu gave this reporter the following figures: Last year, more than 33,000 people from all circles in Taiwan visited Liaoning, an increase of 16 percent over the previous year, nearly half of whom were businessmen and industrialists. Last year, Liaoning also received more than 170 delegations and exchange groups from Taiwan. Meanwhile, more than 240 people from Liaoning went to Taiwan for private reasons last year, the highest figure ever. In addition, a total of 55 people from 16 delegations and exchange groups from Liaoning went to Taiwan, including athletes, college lecturers, poets, painters, juvenile actors, doctors, and artists. Director Wang Weifu once worked in the Liaoning Province Department of Engineering Industry, so he has a good understanding of Liaoning's basic industrial strength. He said: Liaoning has its own superiority. It has a coastline, a foreign border, and it has a vast hinterland, rich industrial strength, a large amount of scientific and technological talent, and a developed communications network. At present, Liaoning is "starting its business for the second time" and is vigorously trying to reinvigorate this old industrial base through opening up wider to the outside world. This will definitely give Taiwanese businessmen and industrialists a very rare opportunity for development. The 56-year-old director ambitiously predicted that economic cooperation and trade between Liaoning and Taiwan will remain very promising, proved by the fact that a large amount of Taiwanese funds are pouring into Liaoning. A large number of men of insight from Taiwan's industrial and business circles have taken the lead and a large number of Taiwanese investors are itching to have a try. In 1994, greater cooperation and exchanges between Liaoning and Taiwan are expected, there will be more than 1,000 Taiwanese-invested projects, and the prospects are very good.
