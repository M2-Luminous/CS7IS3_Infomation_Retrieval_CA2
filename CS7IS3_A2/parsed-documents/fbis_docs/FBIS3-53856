It is in the interest of both sides to reactivate their trade, which dropped by just over 20 percent in the first half of 1993, Rexrodt said in Riyadh today at the end of his two-day working visit. He was accompanied by 35 representatives of German industry. Primarily Saudi Arabia wants to export more oil and petrochemical products. Rexrodt sees great opportunities for expanding economic relations in joint ventures. So far there are only 70 joint ventures, mainly in the area of sales. However, there is German business interest in many areas, especially telecommunications, the sale of Airbus aircraft, ship building, power stations, sea water desalination plants, cement works and petrochemistry. Details of specific projects were not discussed. In order to encourage investment Rexrodt thinks it necessary to improve conditions for this. An agreement on investment protection, due to be concluded in May, will make a considerable contribution to this. It will be the first investment protection agreement between Saudi Arabia and another country. The availability of information about the Saudi legal system should also be improved. In connection with concern expressed by German businesses about the deterioration in Saudi payment morale, the German economics minister said he had raised this issue in his talks with the Saudi ministers for finance and economy, defense and aviation, industry, oil and trade. Another issue discussed at the talks was the planned European Union energy tax, Rexrodt said. Like other oil-producing countries, Saudi Arabia fears that this may cause a decrease in oil imports. Rexrodt stressed that demand would not be reduced by a higher mineral oil tax or higher energy taxes. He also pointed out that a CO2 energy tax would subject German coal to a much greater burden than oil. In 1992, German exports to Saudi Arabia reached a value of 4.2 billion German marks [DM], while imports from Saudi Arabia, mainly of crude oil, reached DM 2 billion.
