A source at the National Unification Board said on Sunday the measures being reviewed are for implementation in two separate stages: One for the period of reconciliation and cooperation and the other for the period of South-North Commonwealth. In the initial stage, the source said, the government plans to call for improved human rights conditions in the North in collusion with international human rights organizations like the Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Through these organizations, Seoul would ask Pyongyang to allow, for instance, visits by human rights inspectors and stop perpetrating torture and all other forms of maltreatment of prisoners. Another method under review is to adopt a human rights manifesto applicable to all member countries in return for economic cooperation for North Korea when a Northeast Asian multilateral security dialogue involving North Korea is held. The source said that when inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation are promoted in earnest, the South could extend support to the North with emphasis on those areas which could be helpful to elevating the quality of the North Koreans' lives, the source said. In this stage, efforts could also be made to resolve the dispersed family question on a priority basis without linking it to political questions, he said. The source said the board also feels the need to think about the method of obtaining the release of political prisoners and facilitating the reunion or meeting of displaced families in return for some prices. He noted that before their integration, West Germany paid 3,440 million marks in all to East Germany from 1963 to 1989 to have the communist regime set free 34,000 political prisoners and allow the reunion of 250,000 dispersed families. Measures reserved for the stage of a South-North Commonwealth are centered on the promotion of mutual opening of the press. In this stage the South could one-sidedly lift control on the viewing of North Korean television programs or subscribing to North Korean newspapers, and, based thereon, ask North Korea to reciprocate it, the source added.
