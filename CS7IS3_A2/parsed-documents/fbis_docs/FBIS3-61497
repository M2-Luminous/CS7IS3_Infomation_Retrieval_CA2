Water quality was evaluated using an index taking into account the pollution of river waters, river runoff and the type of water use. The most unfavorable situation with the quality of river waters in the middle latitudes of the European CIS and in the Baltic countries is anticipated with a global warming of about 1.2�C. A further warming, accompanied by an increase in water runoff, should result in a considerable improvement in water quality over almost the entire territory. With a warming by 1.2�C over an area of about 1 200 000 km[.sup]2[/] (46% of the total considered area) in which at the present time the norms are not impaired there will be a worsening of the quality of river waters to 1.5-2.0 of the maximum admissible concentration or more, which will cause definite difficulties in the case of use of these resources for drinking purposes. Further research must be centered on predicting the influence exerted on water pollution by probable changes in the intraannual distribution of runoff. Figures 4; references 9: 7 Russian, 2 Western.
