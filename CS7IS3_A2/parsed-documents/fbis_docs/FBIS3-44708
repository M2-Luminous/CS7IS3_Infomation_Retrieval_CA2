This is a major event for ideological and theoretical circles and is also an important component of the nationwide memorial activities. As a veteran party member and a veteran fighter who worked for a long time under Chairman Mao's leadership, I sincerely hope the seminar will be lively, serious, practical, and of a high level and yield valuable results so as to push forward the study of Mao Zedong Thought and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Comrades who sponsored the seminar hoped I would express my views on ways to commemorate Chairman Mao in connection with my book A Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and Events. In my view, at a time when our reform, opening up to the outside world, and modernization drive has entered a new stage and when Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping has just come out, the most important thing for the ideological and theoretical circles to do in marking the centenary of Chairman Mao's birth is to follow Chairman Mao's example by integrating the fundamental tenets of Marxism-Leninism with China's realities and by upholding the principle of proceeding in all cases from China's actual conditions so as to promote in an all-round way the study and propaganda of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, speed up reform, open China wider to the outside world, and stimulate a sustained, rapid, and healthy development of the national economy. Great leader Chairman Mao was an steadfast explorer of truth. In the late 1920's and early 1930's, when Marxism was regarded as a dogma and the Communist International's resolutions and the Soviet Union's experience were considered sacred and inviolable by those engaged in the international communist movement and by many comrades in our party, a group of Chinese communists represented by Chairman Mao independently pondered over the problems concerning the Chinese revolution in the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, braving all difficulties. Through long-term efforts, they gradually integrated the fundamental tenets of Marxism with China's realities and developed a strategy of encircling the cities from the rural areas and finally capturing the whole country. They formulated a complete set of theories, lines, principles, and policies for the new-democratic revolution, as well as the strategies and tactics for the people's war, which complied with China's actual conditions. It was by arming itself with these theories, lines, strategies, and tactics that our party was able to lead the people of the whole country in winning the great victory in the new-democratic revolution. In the process of putting the economy back on its feet and of turning China from a new-democratic country into a socialist country after the founding of New China, we copied the Soviet Union in its set-ups, systems, and economic strategies because we lacked experience, because the Soviet Union was the only socialist country at that time and enjoyed high prestige in the world, and in particular because we began the first five-year plan for the economic development with the great support of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, our party still managed to make innovations of its own. As far as I can remember, our party made following innovations in the socialist transformation and other fields in the early days of New China. 1. The party carried out socialist transformation and socialist industrialization simultaneously, which was different from the Soviet Union's strategy of putting state industrialization before the collectivization of agriculture. 2. The party transformed agriculture, handicraft, and the capitalist industry and commerce step by step, going from low levels to high levels, thus only causing a comparatively small shock in society, while the Soviet Union took over capitalists' factories and carried out collectivization in one step. 3. Adopting a peaceful buying-out policy toward national capitalists' means of production and subjecting the capitalists to education and transformation, treating them as our treasure instead of sending them packing, so that they would become self-supporting workers, which was different than the Soviet Union's practice. 4. From the very beginning the party made Chairman Mao's "all directions" policy its fundamental principle for economic development, which called for taking public and private interests into account, benefiting both labor and capital, mutual assistance between town and country, and exchange of goods between town and country. The party followed the law of value in handling its economic relations with peasants, which found expression, for example, in the policy of unified purchase and marketing of farm produce by the state in early days of New China. All these were entirely different from the Soviet Union's "system under which the peasants were committed to deliver and sell farm produce to the state" and its policy of exacting a large amount of money from the peasants to set up the accumulation fund. 5. In the early days of New China, while giving top priority to heavy industry in developing the economy (which was necessary at that time), the party did not neglect the development of light industry and agriculture. Chairman Mao frequently told us at that time: "Never neglect light industry while giving priority to heavy industry." As a result, while our heavy industry grew rapidly, our light industry and agriculture also made progress. This was different from the policy of the Soviet Union and of other Eastern European countries of "walking on one leg." 6. With regard to the political system, we upheld the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party while the Soviet Union introduced the one-party system. 7. "To settle the problem concerning ethnic minorities, the party introduced the system of regional national autonomy rather than setting up a federal republic. We believe this is a good system, because it complies with China's actual conditions." (see page 257 of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. Only the page number will be given when the book is quoted hereafter.) This system has played an important part in strengthening the unity of various nationalities over the last 40 years and more following the founding of New China. 8. The Chinese Government, together with the Indian Government, first put forward the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence -- mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual nonaggression, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence -- as the guidance for handling state-to-state relations. This principle has been widely accepted in the world. The above shows that the party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao successfully solved the problems concerning the setting up of a socialist system in China by creating original principles for carrying out socialist transformation, which were suited to China's actual conditions. Some of the original principles were designed for the stage of the new-democratic revolution, but they still hold good for the stage of socialist construction. Our comrades must remember that in early 1950's the organization responsible for the international communist movement actually preached two "whatevers": Whatever Stalin said brooks no skepticism; whatever experience the Soviet Union created must be copied indiscriminately. Our party did not follow their advice in every respect. Later we even clearly told leaders of the CPSU (the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) that we do not agree with some of the things they have done and with some of their practices." (see Chairman Mao's Speech at the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee) This distinctly displayed the spirit of maintaining independence and the originality of the party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao. If we had copied the Soviet Union's experience indiscriminately from the founding of New China, China's socialist transformation would not have proceeded so smoothly. At this point, I would also like to speak about my reflection on Chairman Mao's instructions on the focal point of work. At the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh CPC Central Committee, which was held immediately before the founding of New China, Chairman Mao said: "From the first day we take over the city, we must keep a close watch on the restoration and development of the city's production. We must not act rashly so that we will not forget the central task." All other work in the city "must be subject to and serve the central task of production and construction." On 1 June 1949 he clearly pointed out: "From now on, emphasis must be placed on development. Friends in all quarters are expected to join forces. In September 1954, in his government work report, Premier Zhou set the goal of achieving modernizations of industry, agriculture, communications and transportation, and defense. This is the first expression of the four modernizations. On 31 March 1955 when making a concluding speech at the national party congress, Chairman Mao said: We have entered a new historical period when we will apply ourselves to socialist industrialization, socialist transformation, modernization of defense, and studying atomic energy. He gave a speech at the Supreme State Conference on 25 January 1956, clearly pointing out: "The socialist revolution is aimed at liberating productive forces." This clearly indicated that while focusing on socialist transformation, Chairman Mao never forgot the central task of economic development and worked for a shift to this central task at an early date. In our party, Chairman Mao was the first person to discover the drawbacks of the Soviet Union's set-ups and economic strategy. After the death of Stalin, the Soviet Union's deep-seated problems were exposed in turn. This made Chairman Mao realize that the Soviet Union's experience was not flawless and perfect. Hence, in late 1955, immediately before the 20th CPSU National Congress, he talked about his idea of "taking warning from the Soviet Union" at a meeting attended by only a small number of members of the central leading body. Guided by this idea, he took more than two months to listen to reports made by 30 ministries and commissions and then set about evaluating our own experience so as to blaze a new path to socialism, a path which suited China's actual conditions. His speech entitled "10 Major Relations," which was his distillation of combined wisdom of the entire party, advanced a basic principle of bringing into play every positive factor at home and abroad to serve the cause of socialism. This was of far-reaching significance and served as a guide for a long time. I personally witnessed Chairman Mao's strenuous efforts to explore truth in this period. I profited greatly from his spirit and all sorts of feelings welled up in my heart. I will not say more about this because a special chapter of my book "A Review of a Number of Major Policy Decisions and Events" has been devoted to the matter. Here, I would only like to summarize the important viewpoints Chairman Mao raised or approved in the one-year period from the time he made the speech to the summer of 1957 and to discuss in brief the significance of these viewpoints. To my knowledge, the important viewpoints raised in this period can be summed up in the following 14 points. 1. The theory of two types of contradictions. This theory played an important part in deciding on the main subject of the political life of the country and party, in creating political unity and stability, and in focusing on socialist construction. 2. The theory concerning the shift of the principal contradiction and of the focal point of work. Since the "Decision about the Political Report" adopted by the Eighth CPC National Congress had confirmed that the contradiction between the material and cultural demands of the people and the failure to meet these demands had constituted the primary contradiction of the society rather than the contradiction between the proletariat and the capitalist class, it was undoubtedly logical that the focal point of work was shifted to socialist construction. 3. The theory of fundamental contradictions in a socialist society. This theory confirmed that fundamental contradictions in a socialist society remain the contradiction between the relations of production and productive forces and that between the superstructure and the economic basis and that the contradictions are no longer antagonistic in nature as they were in the old society. This indicated: The contradiction in a socialist society can be solved through self-regulation. The constant development and constant solution of the two contradictions provide driving force for the development of the socialist society. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: "More than 20 years of practice reveals that such a formulation is better than others." (Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, 1975-82, page 168) This theory can still serve as a guide for our present reform. The above three points constituted a whole set of theories concerning the contradictions in a socialist society. They were the scientific results Chairman Mao obtained by applying the law of the unity of opposites to observing the socialist society. They also made a major breakthrough of the traditional idea that only moral identity but no contradictions exist in a socialist society, representing an important development of Marxism. 4. The idea of giving play to the initiative of the central government and of localities. This meant that central government must delegate a part of its power over state affairs to local governments. Chairman Mao formulated this idea by integrating China's experience in national development and Western countries' experience in developing the economy. 5. While making it a rule that state-owned enterprises must be run by the state, allow enterprises to enjoy a certain degree of autonomy, and while stipulating that the state market must play a dominant role, allow free markets to serve as supplements to state- controlled markets in certain areas. 6. Allow individual economy to serve as a supplement to the public and collective sectors, "allow capitalism to be reinstated after being eliminated"; give underground factories a legal status and allow them to hire workers; and stipulate that overseas Chinese- funded factories will not be taken over for 20 or even 100 years. This represented a breakthrough in the traditional concept that regarded public ownership as the only ownership in a socialist society. 7. The principle of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual in interest distribution. This was a principle based on the Soviet Union's lesson. 8. The economic strategy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously and of developing of heavy and light industries simultaneously, which is a strategy of achieving industrialization the Chinese way. 9. The call for "marching toward the modernization of science," for "catching up with the advanced world scientific level," and for building up a mighty contingent of technicians of the working class. 10. The policy of letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of thought contend. This reflects the objective law governing the development of science and arts. This policy was different from the Soviet Union's policy favoring only the opinions of a certain theoretician and a certain school of art to the exclusion of others. 11. The principle of long-term coexistence and mutual supervision. This principle was the product of Chinese history, adding new content to the system of multiparty cooperation under the CPC leadership, a system formed under China's historical conditions. 12. The goal of strengthening democracy and the legal system. The goal is "to create a political situation in which there are both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of will and personal ease of mind and liveliness" so as to facilitate socialist construction and to put the country in a better position against risks. 13. The idea of "all patriots belonging to one big family, whether they rally to the common cause early or late" and the proposal to liberate Taiwan in a peaceful way. These were announced by Premier Zhou in his report to the third session of the first NPC in June 1956. 14. The strategy of "uniting all the international forces that can be united, persuade the forces that have a bias to observe neutrality, and split up and utilize the reactionary forces." Most of the above viewpoints were not put into effect and some of them were still under deliberations, but they showed that Chairman Mao did try to shake off the yoke of the Soviet Union's ossified formula and of Stalin's "leftist" ideological guidance in search of a system which is flexible and an ideological guidance which suits China's actual conditions. Regrettably, after the second half of 1957, Chairman Mao overestimated the gravity of the class struggle at home and abroad and developed arrogance and conceit and was overanxious for quick results because of a series of major successes. As a result, he provided "leftist" ideological guidance for China's economic and social development as well as for the state and the party's political activities, which led to "leftist" failings in the following 20 years. Comrade Xiaoping said: "Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes lay in going against the correct principles he had upheld." (p 262) According my understanding, "the correct principles" refer, among other things, to the ideological line of seeking truth from facts, which Chairman Mao upheld for a long time, and the correct viewpoints he raised in the process of his exploration. Nevertheless, Chairman Mao, after all, was a great explorer. After 1957, especially in early 1960's when the mistakes resulting from the Great Leap Forward and from "setting up the people's commune" were being corrected, he still put forward on a number of occasions many valuable opinions, which radiated with his ideology of marching forward in exploration. To the best of my memory, he raised six valuable opinions. 1. The law of value is "a great school." After suffering the serious setbacks in "removing bourgeois rights," "providing free meals," and the "communist wind characterized by extreme equalitarianism and the indiscriminate, unpaid-for transfer of resources from one collective to another or from one level of ownership to another," he realized that China is a country with an underdeveloped market economy, that it is necessary to vigorously develop the production of commodities as well as commodity exchange, and that peasants must not be exploited. 2. It would take China 100 years to catch up with advanced capitalist countries. China's socialist society could be divided into two stages: Underdeveloped socialist society and developed socialist society. He also predicted that the latter would last longer than the former. 3. The economic strategy of taking agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor and the opinion of arranging the national economic priorities in the order of agriculture, light industry, and heavy industry. 4. The idea of attaining the strategic objective in two steps: First, set up independent and comparatively complete industrial and national economic systems; and second, achieve the four modernizations of agriculture, industry, national defense, and science and technology. This idea was advanced in Premier Zhou's government work report to the first session of the third NPC held at the turn of 1964 and 1965. The standard term of the four modernizations in use now originated from this report. 5. Support for the pilot scheme of leading comrades of the central authorities in establishing trusts. This indicated that Chairman Mao was aware of the drawbacks of managing the economy by administrative means by the early 1960's. 6. The idea of "two participations, one reform, and three-way combination (cadre participation in productive labor and worker participation in management; reform of irrational and outdated rules and regulations; and close cooperation among workers, cadres, and technicians)." This meant applying the party's mass line to management of enterprises, a practice which was never found in enterprise management in the Soviet Union or in capitalist countries. At the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee in September 1957, Chairman Mao mistakenly changed the scientific thesis of the Eighth CPC National Congress on the primary contradiction of society, but at the 10th Plenary Session of the Eighth CPC Central Committee in 1962, he still made socialist construction a central task. In January 1958, he said: From this year on, "the party should focus on technological revolution." In late 1958 when meeting with foreign guests, he said that China is making a new revolution, a revolution against earth and nature. In the period around the National Day of 1959 when receiving foreign guests, he also said: In the next 10 to 20 years, we will concentrate our energy on economic development. Only in reality, he did not act as he said. Launching the Great Cultural Revolution was a glaring mistake which had a bearing on the overall situation. Nothing of the movement itself can be regarded as positive, and a historical conclusion on it was made long ago. Nevertheless, during the Great Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao still made important contributions to improving the international environment for China's socialist construction. He put forward the theory of the three worlds and the important principle that China will never seek hegemony. In addition, he succeeded in foiling U.S. attempt to enforce a diplomatic blockade of China. Elderly comrades must remember that one of the major events that attracted worldwide attention in the 1970's was that Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou made an important contribution to normalization of Sino-U.S. relations by seizing upon the opportunity offered by Richard Nixon, who expressed willingness to improve Sino-U.S. relations after he became master of the White House. Immediately after that, China established diplomatic relations with Japan, Canada, Italy, the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG), and Australia, thus greatly breaking the 20-year-old blockade initiated by the United States. After establishing diplomatic relations with these countries, China also improved economic relations with them. At that time, the Gang of Four, while keeping up a terrific row, tried by hook or by crook to prevent China from making contacts with the West. The "snail incident" [not further specified] must remain fresh in the memory of many comrades. However, with the support of Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou prevailed over all dissenting views and opened the door wide to introduce Western technology and equipment into China. In the 1970's, China imported 22 sets of major equipment from 10 countries including Japan, the FRG, and the United States. Does everybody not see clearly the positive role the equipment has played in China's economic development? At this point I recall the well-known verses of our great patriotic poet Qu Yuan: "The way stretched endlessly ahead, I shall search heaven and earth." On the endless road of China's revolution and development, Chairman Mao made untiring efforts to explore and clear the way to forge ahead. In the early days of New China he pondered over the strategy for building up socialism which complied with China's actual conditions. He made concentrated efforts in this respect in 1956 and in the first half of 1957. Thereafter, he committed "leftist" mistakes but did not give up his exploration until he died. We may sum up his efforts this way: He was correct when he made first explorations and advanced many important ideas which can serve as long-term guidance. Later his exploration proceeded in both correct and incorrect directions and ended up with the 10-year-old tumultuous Great Cultural Revolution. Therefore, it should be admitted that his exploration was not successful. There are no ready-made models to copy in building socialism in a big country in the east with a backward economy and culture like China. Making mistakes in such an exploration is understandable, but is still deplorable. Concerning this point, the "Resolution on Certain Questions in the History of the Party" pointed out: "Comrade Mao Zedong's mistakes are, after all, ones committed by a great proletarian revolutionary." "His tragedy lies in the fact that when he committed great mistakes, he still repeatedly called on the entire party membership to earnestly study the works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin and still believed that his theories and practice agreed with Marxism and were necessary for consolidating the proletarian dictatorship." Fortunately, with the end of the Great Cultural Revolution and the rectification of the party's guiding ideology, our party finally discovered the strategy for building up socialism which tallies with China's actual conditions. This strategy was gradually formed after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and this is the path charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, a path which has been confirmed by the 14th CPC National Congress. This is the road we must follow in developing socialism in China, in enabling China to become a prosperous and strong country and to gain a foothold among other countries in the world, and in ensuring that our socialist cause will withstand risks in a more effective way and be always invincible. Our comrades can decide for themselves: If we had followed the course favored by those who advocated resolutely upholding whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made and unswervingly following whatever instructions he gave, rather than the course charted by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, would the historic leap forward over the last decade and more have been possible? Would we have been able to stand up to the tests of the political upheaval and of the drastic change in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe several years ago? The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the product of the great practice of reform and opening up and bears the distinctive imprint of the times. Comrade Deng Xiaoping has made important and historic contribution in this regard, which everybody can see for himself. In fact Comrade Deng Xiaoping began to rectify the erroneous ideological and political lines as early as 1975, displaying his great political and theoretical courage. At that time he said: "It is necessary to overhaul and consolidate the Army, to reorganize industrial production, and to straighten things out in every field of work." Because all this, in essence, amounted to negating the Great Cultural Revolution, which was not allowed by Chairman Mao, Deng Xiaoping was ousted once more. After 1977, Comrade Deng Xiaoping undertook the strenuous task of leading the whole party in rectifying the erroneous ideological and political lines, beginning the mission by repudiating the doctrine of the "two whatevers." The documents included in the 1975-82 volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping convincingly reveal that after being reinstated, he was a de facto principal policy decisionmaker of the campaign against the erroneous ideological and political lines. After the 12th CPC National Congress, the party Central Committee adopted a series of major policy resolutions on the reform, opening up, and modernization drive to bring up a new situation of socialist construction, but most of these resolutions were based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's suggestions. The documents contained in the third volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" recorded accurately the historic contributions he made in the 10-year period and his foresight and sagacity as the chief architect of our reform, of the opening policy, and of the modernization program. While reading the two books our comrades will have little difficulty in finding out most of the nine contents of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics summarized in the report to the 14th CPC National Congress are contained in the two books, where you can find the source of the contents and their brilliant expositions. Therefore, it occurred to me that just as Comrade Mao Zedong was worthy of the practice of crowning the thought created in the course of China's revolution and development, which was an embodiment of the combined wisdom of the entire party, with his personal name, Comrade Deng Xiaoping is also worthy of the practice of preceding the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics created under the new historical conditions, which is also an embodiment of the combined wisdom of the entire party, with his personal name. In the process of exploring the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, Comrade Xiaoping incorporated all the positive results Chairman Mao achieved in his exploration, which can still serve as guidance at the present stage including those correct ideas which were not acted on or were in fact later negated by Chairman Mao himself. However, what is most important is that Comrade Deng Xiaoping drew lessons from Chairman Mao's mistakes, especially his mistakes in initiating the Great Cultural Revolution, thus changing the bad thing into a good one. So Comrade Xiaoping said: "It appears the event (the Great Cultural Revolution) was a bad thing, but, in the final analysis, it was a good thing, because it enabled people to think things out for themselves and see clearly where our drawbacks lie." "The present principles and policies are exactly based on the conclusion we deduced from the Great Cultural Revolution." (pp 172, 223) How has the erroneous Great Cultural Revolution prompted the formation of new ideas and new theories? Comrade Xiaoping said: "The most fundamental lesson is that we must gain a clear idea of socialism as well as communism and of the way to build socialism." During the Great Cultural Revolution, the Gang of Four absurdly claimed that poor socialism and communism is better than affluent capitalism. Comrade Xiaoping said: "It stands to reason that affluent capitalism is undesirable, but how can we advocate poor socialism and communism? As a result, China has stagnated. This compelled us to reconsider our problems. After consideration we decided that the first thing we must do was to uphold socialism. To uphold socialism, we must first of all shake off poverty and backwardness, vigorously develop productive forces, and give expression of priorities of socialism over capitalism. To achieve this, we must shift the focal point of work to the four modernizations and regard the four modernizations as the objective to be attained in the coming years. At the same time, to avoid making the same mistakes as we did in the past, we must not close the country to international interchange any more, must arouse the people's enthusiasm, and must formulate open and reform policies." (pp 223-224) In this passage, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly told us the relationship between the formation of the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the positive and negative historical experiences. The task of achieving the four modernizations, the need for the whole party to focus on developing productive forces, to give expression to the superiority of socialism over capitalism in helping develop productive forces, and other viewpoints, were set forth by the first generation of central leadership headed by Chairman Mao, but they were discarded afterwards. The erroneous Great Cultural Revolution proved from the negative side the correctness of these viewpoints. After the disastrous Great Cultural Revolution, when the questions of peace and development have become two top priorities on the international agenda, after socialism has suffered serious setback in many places in the world, and after we have introduced reform and the open policy for a certain period, however, we were not content with correcting our mistakes and restoring correct viewpoints, but greatly developed the correct viewpoints and put forward new viewpoints, which are, for instance: The socialist economy was a planned commodity economy based on public ownership; China was still in the primary stage of socialism; socialism was not antagonistic to the market economy; China could not separate its economic development from the rest of the world; and so on. It was on the basis of these viewpoints that the series of principles and policies for reform and opening up, the basic line of "one central task, two basic points," and the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics gradually took shape. Studying and propagating the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics is an important and long-term task for our comrades in ideological and theoretical circles. Gaining a clear idea of the relationship between this theory and the explorations Chairman Mao made will help us understand the source of this theory and the enormous cost we have paid for it. This in turn will help us understand the difficulty in theoretical exploration and deepen our understanding of this theory. All this will prove useful in making our work a success. The current domestic and international situation provides us with a rare and favorable opportunity for economic development. Based on Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the guidelines laid down by the 14th national party congress and after conducting earnest studies and investigations and evaluating past experience, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee timely made the "Decision on Issues Concerning the Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure," which drew up a blueprint for setting up a socialist market economic structure. The decision is our program for action in economic restructuring in the 1990's. Comrade Jiang Zemin recently said: "We must seize upon the opportunity to step up reform, opening up, and the modernization drive in an effort to initially set up a socialist market economic structure by the end of the century, achieving the second-step strategic goal of giving the people a comparatively comfortable life, and elevating our overall national strength to a new level." The task is heavy and the road ahead is long. In his talks given during his south China tour, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said in all earnestness and sincerity: "We have engaged in building socialism for several decades only. China is still in the primary stage of socialism. It will take a long historical period, as well as the unremitting effort of several generations, a dozen generations, or even scores of generations, to consolidate and develop the socialist system, so we must not treat the task lightly." (pp 379-380) I hope our comrades, under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, will firmly uphold the party's basic line for a hundred years, get down to earth to work, evaluate their experience while taking part in practice, study new problems, and explore new ways for solving new problems, thus making their due contributions to enriching and developing the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
