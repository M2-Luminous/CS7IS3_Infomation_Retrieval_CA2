The communique, reported by Otavio Mulembe, Voice of the Resistance of the Black Cockerel journalist, says that the Luanda government has used SU-25 aircraft to bomb the area, killing three people -- two children and a woman. Dozens civilians were seriously affected by gases coming from the explosion. The communique also reveals that People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] personnel, estimated at four infantry brigades and one motorized brigade, have begun yet another offensive to capture the city of Uige. The document says there are two groups, one moving along the right bank of Benge River through Nambuangongo, and the second is following the left bank of Benge River, passing through Ndalatando and Ucua with the intention of going to Uige. The patriotic and revolutionary FALA military command in the area alerts the international community and the United Nations to the danger such adventure may represent to Angola, and particularly to its negotiating process. The communique stresses that FALA is ready to adhere scrupulously to the unilateral cease-fire, but will never accept provocations, wherever they come from. It appeals to the residents to remain vigilant and calm, because FALA knows how to defend the people.
