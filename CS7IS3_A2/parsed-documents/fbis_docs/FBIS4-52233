Police in Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat were ordered to try to stop people gathering in either Chana District or Hat Yai town. A checkpoint will be set up at Don Yang intersection in Pattani's Nong Chik District and at an adjoining area in Narathiwat and Pattani Provinces. Police fear Muslims will come to Hat Yai in their thousands today to see off relatives leaving for Mecca on the annual pilgrimage and take the opportunity to stage a protest. This will make it difficult for police to differentiate between protesters and relatives. The four suspects, all Islamic teachers in Chana District, were arrested in Chana District on Wednesday. They are Sa-ali or Ali or Sali Hamanapden, Mut or Hamase or Mut Loman, Suroma or Daman Leduwi, and Ya or Kaya or Sakariya Hamanapden. The four have been charged with premeditated murder, rebellion and possessing ammunition illegally in addition to the bombing charges. Region 9 Police chief Lt. Gen. [Lieutenant General] Michai Nukunkit said police had acquired sufficient evidence to believe the four and 20 others still at large took part in eight different bomb attacks as follows: -- An explosion at a bridge in Bacho District of Narathiwat Province on May 13, 1991; -- A bomb attack on a train in Chana District of Songkhla Province on May 25, 1992; -- A bomb explosion at Hat Yai Railway Station in Songkhla Province on August 13, 1992, killing three people and wounding 75 others -- A bomb attack on a marine police boat in Pattani Province on December 6, 1993; -- An explosion at Dechanuchit Bridge in Pattani on December 25, 1993; -- A bomb attack on a train in Songkhla's Chana District on March 8, 1994; -- An explosion in front of a bookstore in Hat Yai on March 20, 1994, and -- An explosion on the rail track in Na Mom Sub-district in Songkhla Province on March 30, 1994. Pol Lt. Gen. Michai claimed the four and their colleagues were part of an organization with links to a foreign country. The evidence against them was strong enough for police to be certain they are not scapegoats, he said. He alleged the group had also worked together with the Pattani United Liberation Organization (PULO) with the objective of overthrowing the Government. Pol Lt. Gen. Michai does not believe the group is responsible for torching 36 southern schools on August 1 last year. Police will continue to gather more evidence to nail the suspects, he added. Police Director General Prathn Santipraphop said in Bangkok the four were certainly not "scapegoats" as police had acquired hard evidence against them. Arrests of "scapegoats" might have been widespread in the past, but not this time, he said. Songkhla Governor Yuwat Wuthimathi said the strong evidence meant the four suspects would face legal action despite being Islamic teachers. The four, who studied religion abroad, will be held for further legal processing in Songkhla. They will not be granted bail until questioning is finalised. said Mr. Yuwat. Asit Phithakkhumphon, chairman of the Islamic Committee of Songkhla, said the people of Chana District did not believe the four suspects were guilty as charged. They said it was not possible for the four to have conducted such serious crimes, he said. Fourth Army Region Commander Lt. Gen. Kitti Rattanachaya said he did not believe there would be an uprising over the arrest of the four Islamic teachers because all wrongdoers must face legal action. He said he had not received a detailed report of the arrest but believed the police must have sufficient evidence to take such action. Rewat Ratchamukda, chairman of the Islamic Committee of Narathiwat, said the arrest had sparked unrest among Muslim people. Never before have Islamic teachers been suspected of involvement in sabotage and there are doubts surrounding the arrest of the four, he said. Mr. Rewat said he hoped authorities would provide the suspects with due justice. He asked fellow Muslims to cooperate with authorities to prevent possible interference by a "third hand" in causing further divisiveness in the country.
