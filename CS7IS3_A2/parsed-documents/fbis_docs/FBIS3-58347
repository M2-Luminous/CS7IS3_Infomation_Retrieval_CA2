This is indicated in a confidential interim report by an internal Defense Ministry working group. The savings, which correspond to 10 percent of the current operational expenditures of the armed forces, are, however, only possible "in the long run." A new system for monitoring costs and performance must be established. In the view of the working group, first investments of approximately DM100 million are necessary for this purpose -- for new computers, for instance. Under the slogan of "Saving must pay off," all soldiers should be encouraged to participate in the "constant identification of rationalization potential." "As far as it is useful and possible," logistical tasks are to be transferred to private companies. In addition, the working group, which consists of military officers and representatives of civilian consulting companies, suggests that armament projects should be supervised more strictly. Tighter management could reduce procurement costs by approximately DM400 million per year. In 1993, the Defense Ministry spent almost DM7 billion on weapons and ammunition.
