These images, to be used for development and exploration of agricultural, forest, mineral, and water resources, were captured with a high-resolution side-looking synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and other advanced instruments carried on board the Canadian CV-580 aircraft flying at an altitude of 5,500 meters and having an imaging range of over 8,000 square kilometers. The current cooperative project with Canada, in addition to the aforementioned radar imaging flights, also included a symposium, data processing and analysis, and academic interchanges. Chinese scientists and engineers commented that the project will inevitably improve the nation's technological level in radar remote sensing, and scientists on both sides expressed satisfaction with the successful implementation of the plan flights.
