Shanghai is now actively seeking a better way to solve various problems caused by the increasing inflow of a migrant population. In 1993, about 2.81 million people came from other provinces to Shanghai, and 74.3 percent of these people came to seek jobs or do business. People at working ages of 21 to 59 accounted for 85.3 percent, and construction workers numbered 760,000. In the past few years, the inflow of the huge migrant population caused many problems for Shanghai. In particular, before and after the Chinese New Year, the huge tide of migrant laborers put heavy pressure on the railway, public security, labor, and urban transport departments. Urban residents also complained about the consequent inconvenience. On one hand, there were a lot of construction projects and commercial undertakings in Shanghai, and they needed a large external labor force; on the other hand, the inflow of millions of external laborers also caused difficulties and problems for city management. In late 1993, the public security, civil affairs, railway, industrial and commercial administrative, comprehensive management, and labor departments of the municipal government jointly set up a new organ for managing the external population. It then adopted a number of management measures. Recently, when the department concerned issued "labor certificates," it also issued "blue card" residence certificates to professionals, investors, and senior managerial personnel in enterprises. Recently, this reporter visited the Shanghai Municipal Office for Managing the External Labor Force, which issued the "labor certificates" to external laborers in Shanghai. Shen Zhiwei, deputy director of the office told this reporter that "labor certificates" were mainly issued to workers employed by Shanghai enterprises from other localities. The employing institutions included state-owned and collective enterprises, joint-stock companies, private enterprises, and individual businesses. The management office would examine the employment applications and labor contracts submitted by the employing institutions in order to prevent their paying wages lower than the standards to workers from other localities. The issuance of "labor certificates" would enable external workers to achieve legal working status so their legitimate working rights and interests can be guaranteed. At the same time, this would also enable the public security and labor departments to more effectively exercise management within their jurisdiction. In addition, the issuance of "labor certificates" may play a role in curbing the inflow of migrant laborers. Because migrant laborers have told each other about the new measure, they may be discouraged from pouring into the city before they can find jobs. At present, "labor certificates" have not been issued to construction workers, household assistants, and scattered odd-job workers. The department concerned is now considering the method of managing such people. Now, some 430,000 people have applied for "labor certificates," and the number of applicants will continue to increase. The official expected that the work of issuing this year's labor certificates would be completed by May. According to the people concerned, along with the development of Shanghai's construction and the expansion of the urban area, a large external population will continue to flow into Shanghai for a long time in the future. The adoption of a series of measures indicate that Shanghai has taken the initiative in exercising effective management over the external migrant population in the city.
