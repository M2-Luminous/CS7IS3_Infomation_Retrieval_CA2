The Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government, along with the alliance's propaganda apparatus, have been performing a new trick lately. They have been taking turns lying about their invading forces putting off military operations in the Pailin region in compliance with King Norodom Sihanouk's appeal. II. What is the reality on the ground? The reality is that the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government have earnestly pursued military operations in the Pailin region and western Cambodia without interruption. While their propaganda machine broadcast lies on 10 March about their invading forces postponing military operations, the invading forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government were ordered to conduct a two-pronged offensive on the battlefield. The first prong was launched from Treng along National Route 10, and the second prong was launched from the Komping Puoy Dam. Military operations were also launched on the south Sisophon, Samlot, and Malai battlefields. The people and the National Army of Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] resistance joined hands to resist, attack, and disperse the invading forces. They inflicted heavy losses. III. What is the purpose of the deceitful propaganda disseminated by the Vietnamese communists, the Vietnamese lackey puppets, the alliance, and the two-headed government? It has two main objectives: 1. To fool the national and international public into believing that they have respected and implemented King Norodom Sihanouk's appeal. Actually, they oppose the king's five points, national reconciliation, and peace. They continue to talk about sending thousands or even tens of thousands of troops, tanks, and heavy guns to launch military operations in various areas, including the Pailin region. The same deceitful maneuver was employed by the Vietnamese communists -- the master of the one-eyed Jack [Hun Sen] and his cronies -- to fool the United States between 1960 and 1973, especially during the Tet season. This is why his majesty the king says he cannot call a meeting or organize talks on his five points; because the two premiers disagree. 2. They are acting in this manner because they can increasingly smell the smoke of their defeat. As a matter of fact, on 28 February -- when they launched their first major military offensive in the Pailin region -- they were routed after four hours of fighting. On 4 March their second attempt was also severely defeated. On 8 and 10 March, they were again severely routed by the people and Democratic Kampuchea. IV. The Party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] and the NADK, along with the entire Cambodian nation and people, yearn for peace and the end of the bloody war triggered by the Vietnamese war of aggression. The PDK fully and unreservedly supports his majesty the king's five points. Nevertheless, in the face of the invasion by the forces of the Vietnamese communist puppets and the two-headed government -- carried out in accordance with the policies and strategies of the Vietnamese communists and the alliance aimed at destroying the NADK and thereby allowing the Vietnamese communists to do away with the Cambodian nation and race -- the people and the NADK resistance have no alternative but to continue their struggle to implement the king's five-point policy in order to achieve national reconciliation, restore national unity and peace in Cambodia, and finally end the war.
