Following the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Seattle last November, Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata visited Beijing in January and then Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji toured Japan this spring. The series of high-level contacts between China and Japan were brought to a climax as Prime Minister Hosokawa came to China. If Vice-Premier Zhu's visit to Japan had resulted in a "China fever" in Japan, then Prime Minister Hosokawa's visit to China has made the "Sino-Japanese cooperation fever" even hotter. The Japanese prime minister stressed that Japan-China relations are one of "the most important pillars" in Japan's foreign diplomacy and that Japan will provide effective support to China's modernization drive. The development momentum in the bilateral relations has swept away doubts in Japan's business circles. The Japanese side expressed that more Japanese funds and technology will be brought into China in the coming five years. Observers here believed that the "China-Japan cooperation fever" is the result of the evolution of the international relations following the Cold War, China's high-speed economic development and Japan's inside economic adjustment. Now the international situation is experiencing a transitional process from two poles toward a multi-poles. The development of the friendly relations and cooperation between China and Japan, two important countries in Asia and in the world, will enhance the stability and development of the economy in the two countries and in Asia, and in the establishment of a new international political and economic order. The frequent exchanges between the leaders of the two countries show that the two sides have reached common understanding and also signaled that Sino-Japanese relations have entered a period of maturity. People have noted that the exchanges between the top officials of the two countries have striking economic features. Last year the trade value between the two countries was 39 billion U.S. dollars, hitting a record high. Japan has become the no. 1 trade partner of China; Japan's technology exports to China rank no. 1; the rate of the actual investment from Japan to China ranks no. 1. But in view of the potential in Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, much remains to be done. China is stressing the development of the communications and transportation, energy and telecommunications sectors while Japan is exactly quite strong in these sectors. It can be said that once Japan's technology and funds are combined with China's market and resources, the trade value of the two countries may reach 390 billion U.S. dollars, just like Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji predicted in his recent visit to Japan. Of course, Sino-Japanese relations are not confined to economic cooperation and trade. The two sides share identical views on major international issues. With the deepening of mutual understanding, the two countries will surely make further progress in their cooperation in the areas of politics, culture and environmental protection. The 21st century is approaching. At present, Asia is experiencing a period of rapid economic development and relative stability. In his meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Chinese President Jiang Zemin noted that Asia has created an unprecedented opportunity of development in its history. The two sides agreed that they should seize the opportune moment to establish long-term stable friendly relations and cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit so as to meet the challenges of the new century. The frequent exchanges of visits between Chinese and Japanese leaders show the two sides are working toward this end.
