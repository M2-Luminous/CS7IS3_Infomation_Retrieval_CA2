She said that two of the three people were killed when soldiers evicted a group of Indians from a Catholic church in Guamote, Chimborazo Province, last night. The Guamote church was occupied by approximately 100 Indians early this morning. The Indians have the support of Victor Corral, the bishop of the diocese. Luis Macas, the president of the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, Conaie, said that the third death occurred when soldiers forced the Indians to return to their communities in Tungurahua Province last night. Conaie reported last week that three other Indians had been killed by paramilitary personnel who work for land owners in Canar Province; however, other reports attribute those deaths to merchants who charged that their stores had been looted by demonstrators. Conaie also reported the first death of an Indian in Tungurahua, who was killed by a driver attempting to evade the barricades. These events took place 18 hours after the state of emergency was declared. In total, seven people have been killed. Meanwhile, the Court of Constitutional Guarantees, TGC, declared the law unconstitutional and suspended it. TGC President Carlos Jaramillo said the six tribunal members had unanimously resolved to suspend the law completely because it contained flaws of form and substance. The TGC declared the law unconstitutional and suspended it. Carlos Jaramillo said that he ordered the resolution to be sent immediately to the Supreme Court in order for the law to definitely be suspended. Indians have charged that they have been repressed and assert that they will not quit until the law is repealed. Conaie and Episcopal Conference Indians are trying to start a dialogue to resolve the crisis started by the agrarian law. Peasant leaders have confirmed that they will not end the revolt until the law is repealed. [Begin unidentified peasant leader recording] We know that eight comrades received blows and were injured in Chimborazo Province. We also know that helicopters are bombing Azuay and Guayas Provinces. Those are actions against our comrades [words indistinct]. We totally reject the mobilization decree, which has exacerbated the conflict instead of resolving it. We know Article No. 79 of the Constitution stipulates that national mobilization can only be decreed in the event of an international conflict. [end recording] The Indians also charged that they have been victims of acts of aggression by the military and asked that the TGC repeal the mobilization decree issued by President Duran Ballen.
