Rydell was established in 1992 to preserve and enhance important wildlife habitat in western Minnesota and provide a regional wildlife and fish management education center. The 2,120-acre refuge is located in Grove Park and Woodside Townships in Polk County, just south of U.S. Highway 2 between the communities of Mentor and Erskine, Minnesota. The refuge is situated in the Prairie Pothole Region of western Minnesota between the flat Red River Valley flood plain on the west and the rolling hardwood forest and lake region on the east. The refuge is administered as a unit of the Detroit Lakes Wetland Management District (DLWMD). The DLWMD, which has its headquarters near Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, also currently administers 155 Waterfowl Production Areas, 322 perpetual wetland easements and 14 Farmers' Home Administration (FmHA) Conservation Easements in the five northwestern Minnesota counties of Becker, Clay, Mahnomen, Norman and Polk. Diverse habitat on the refuge attracts an impressive variety and abundance of wildlife. Besides a large white-tailed deer population, refuge habitat is used by both dabbler and diver waterfowl species, moose, mink, ruffed grouse, cormorants, herons, rabbits, raccoon, otter, beaver, muskrat, various hawk and owl species, and more than 100 neotropical, water and other migratory bird species. Opening the refuge to the hunting of white-tailed deer has been found to be compatible in a separate compatibility determination. This finding was based on findings that (1) hunting is widely recognized by wildlife managers as an integral part of a comprehensive wildlife conservation management plan; (2) the deer population of the refuge and surrounding area has become so large that habitat damage and excessive crop depredation is occurring; (3) reducing the deer population would improve the health and condition of the deer herd, eliminate the damaging effects of over-population on refuge habitat and reduce the depredation damage caused by deer on crops that surround the refuge; and (4) deer hunting would provide wildlife-oriented recreational opportunities in an area of Minnesota where hunting and fishing are important recreational activities. Historically, this area of Minnesota has attracted large numbers of deer, especially in winter, because both prairie and woodland habitat were available. Over the past 25 years, the previous owner actively encouraged deer to use the area by planting many acres of lure crops, limiting hunting pressure and providing a high degree of protection for the deer herd. Because of this, the deer population has increased and been concentrated in the relatively small refuge area. Today, the refuge and surrounding area host a white-tailed deer population of about 300 during the spring and fall and up to 500 in the winter. Preliminary surveys indicate that winter densities range from 18 to 20 deer per square mile of the total land area of the refuge and 100 deer per square mile of forested habitat in the 27 square-mile area that includes and surrounds the refuge. A large proportion of these deer use the three square-mile area of the refuge extensively throughout the year. The refuge winter deer population is estimated at 60 to 70 deer per square mile of the total land area of the refuge and more than 200 per square mile of forested habitat. Over-population by deer is evident by the presence of browse lines in the refuge woodlands. The goal of the hunt is to lower the deer population to within the statewide density range (1&hyph;15 per square mile of the total land area and 5&hyph;80 per square mile of forested habitat). Field studies will be conducted to monitor habitat conditions and population dynamics to determine what the appropriate deer population should be for the refuge and surrounding area. The Special Permit Area (SPA) will be hunted during the State's 4A and 4B firearms seasons. The SPA covers approximately 2,000 acres, excluding refuge facilities and occupied building sites. About 1,200 acres of the SPA are deemed huntable during a normal hunting season. Initially, until the herd is reduced and under control, only antlerless deer would be taken. As many as 60 permits will be issued for the two-day 4A season and up to 80 permits would be issued for the four-day 4B season. The maximum hunter density would be one hunter per 15 acres. Hunter and Service personnel safety will determine the actual number of permits that are issued each season.
