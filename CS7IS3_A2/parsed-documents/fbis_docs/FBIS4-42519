After an intervertebral disc operation, Mock is still undergoing hospital treatment. The EU referendum in one week will be the decision on a historic chance, Mock said. [Begin Mock recording] There are certain windows of opportunity in history, and if they are not opened at the right time, one misses historic chances for one's country. There was such a window in 1955. Everyone knew that after October 1956 -- after the Hungarians' crushed struggle for freedom against the communist regime -- it would no longer be possible to get the Soviet Union to agree [to the State Treaty]. There is such a window again today. [end recording] Foreign Minister Alois Mock also made a personal appeal: [Begin Mock recording] I will ask the Austrians to say yes. The country is at stake. If the government is to be taught a lesson, which is, quote, part of democracy, unquote, there will be the elections in October. Everyone will then be able to express his opinion on the party that provided a minister with whom he is not satisfied. The important point to be stressed is that this country and the continuity of its success is now at stake. [end recording] All in all, however, Mock concluded that the majority of the population will say yes to the European Union.
