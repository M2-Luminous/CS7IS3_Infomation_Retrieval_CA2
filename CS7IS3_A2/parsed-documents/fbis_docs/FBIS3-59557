The prefeasibility study, which bears the date 14 May 1993, traces a map of the demand and supply of personalized goods and services corresponding to specific needs. In the sector of telecommunications services, the trend toward personalization is seen primarily in certain areas, such as the possibility of choosing from a multitude of terminals with ever increasing multimedia features for example. Among these, the possibility of accessing a wide variety of network services: associating a number with a person (personal number), meaning that the user can maintain his own communication address whatever the terminal; mobility, meaning the possibility of communicating with people in movement; the possibility of performing activities (work, education, medical checkups etc.) even in a location that is far from the headquarters where the activities are based, even in one's own residence; personalized diffusion services (for example personalized television). The PFCP is part of this framework and, even though it is directed toward developments in the area of telecommunications, calls for an interdisciplinary committment in all the sectors of computer science and engineering, including computer, electronic, and electromagnetic technologies. The development of the project calls for synergies with other future targeted projects such as those on Materials and Devices for Solid State Electronics [MADESS II], Photonics, and Electromagnetic Compatibility. The areas included in the new finalized project are multimedia treatment; human factors, software architecture for services, methods for the creation of services, the safety and protection of communications, circuit and electromagnetic technologies, radio access, propagation in certain frequency bands, environmental impact, and interconnecting networks. Within this framework the prefeasibility study provides for both basic and applied research leading to six possible subprojects: fixed and mobile terminals, network infrastructures, wireless access networks, wireless local networks, management and planning methods, and field tesing. This project will therefore be characterized by its specific research objectives, both because of the scientific implications and because of the prospects for industrial applications in the medium to long term. The project is organized to make provision for wide-ranging interdisciplinary research topics. This will permit a wider group of research know-how from the CNR institutes, university departments, and industrial reseach laboratories to be involved. A fact to be emphasized is the all the industrial and nonindustrial bodies interested in developing the PFCP are also the potential users of the results. As for the sharing out of human resources from public and private bodies, the prefeasibility study also provides for the quotas to be 40 and 60 percent respectively. The PFCP project is expected to last five years. On the basis of these evaluations, the project should call for an investment of 120 billion lire by the CNR, a figure that could vary depending on the possibile costs and the quota to be covered by the participating organizations. As for the possible industrial spin-offs, the PFCP can provide all national industries in the entire information sector (telecommunications, computers, and microelectronics) with a decisive and important opporutnity to make their products competitive in the future. Moreover, it could become eligible for subsidies from the EC within the framework of European research projects that will be the subject of the Fourth Framework Program in the field of information and communications technologies. This would give our research world more chances of acquiring an important role in future projects funded by the European Community.
