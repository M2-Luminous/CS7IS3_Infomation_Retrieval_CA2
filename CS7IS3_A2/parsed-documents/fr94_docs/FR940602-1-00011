FR940602-1-00011 FR940602-1-00006 NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD 29 CFR Part 103 Appropriateness of Requested Single Location Bargaining Units in Representation Cases AGENCY: National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). ACTION: Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. SUMMARY: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is publishing an advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the issue of the appropriateness of requested single location bargaining units in representation cases. This rule would be applicable only in cases involving initial organizing in the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries. The Board is publishing this advance notice to seek timely comments and suggestions from the public, labor organizations, employer groups, and other interested organizations on how the Board may best fulfill its statutory obligation to determine an appropriate unit when a single location bargaining unit is sought in these particular industries. DATES: All responses to this notice must be received on or before July 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: All responses should be sent to: Office of Executive Secretary, 1099 14th Street, NW., room 11600, Washington, DC 20570. Telephone: (202) 273&hyph;1940. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John C. Truesdale, Executive Secretary, Telephone: (202) 273&hyph;1940. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The question of the appropriateness of a single location bargaining unit when requested by a labor organization has been an issue in NLRB representation proceedings for almost 60 years. See, e.g., Atlantic Refining Co. 1 NLRB 359, 364&hyph;5 (1936). In the vast majority of cases, the single location unit is found appropriate, but only after extensive litigation of such factors as geographical separation, similarity of employee skills and terms and conditions of employment, autonomy of the location manager, extent of employee interchange, contact between facilities, functional integration, and other miscellaneous matters. The years of litigation have not been enlightening. A presumption of separate appropriateness has evolved in most industries when the unit petitioned for is single facility in scope. See, e.g., Sav-On Drugs, Inc., 138 NLRB 1032, 1033 (1962); and Haag Drug Co., 169 NLRB 877 (1968). 1 One court spent nine pages reciting the facts in two separate cases, involving two separate industries, reaching opposite results in the cases despite combining them for purposes of decision. NLRB v Chicago Health & Tennis Clubs, 567 F.2d 331 (7th Cir. 1977). (In the course of its opinion, the court noted that the Board's approach in this area has ``fluctuated'' (pages 335&hyph;336, fn. 7). We believe it is time to strive for more certainty and less litigation and delay on this issue, and invite comments on how best to do this in the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries. 1 The presumption does not apply when the unit petitioned for is multi-facility in scope. See, e.g., Capital Coors Co., 309 NLRB 322 (1992), and cases cited therein. Many different industries have been involved in litigation of this issue, but large groups of cases have centered on the retail, manufacturing and trucking industries. See e.g., Red Lobster, 300 NLRB 908 1990 (retail); J&L Plate, 310 NLRB 429 (1993) (manufacturing); and Bowie Hall Trucking 290 NLRB 41 (1988) (trucking). Although this issue is litigated in other industries, cases involving these other industries fall outside the scope of the Board's concern in this proceeding. With regard to retail, manufacturing and trucking, however, the factors considered by the Board in these cases, including the presumptive appropriateness of a separate facility, appear to us to be well-established. The Board's decisions in these industries are reasonably predictable; with certain limited exceptions, the single-facility unit usually is found appropriate. We believe, that in normal circumstances, it is no longer necessary for the Board and the parties involved to expend extensive resources litigating the issue. Hence, the Board seeks to promulgate a rule or rules to limit to the extent possible the necessity to adjudicate the appropriateness of petitioned-for single facility units in these three industries.
