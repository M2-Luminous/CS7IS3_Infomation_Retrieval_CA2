According to a report by the Swedish military intelligence and security service, the Russian Armed Forces are now in such a weak state that they would not be able to attack Sweden. Timo Seppaenen reports from Stockholm: [Seppaenen] The Russian bear is sick and weak, says Jan Blomquist, the head of the analysis section of the Swedish general staff. The same view is shared by the defense forces' entire intelligence and security service, which lists a number of reasons for its assessment that Russia is militarily completely enfeebled. The manpower of the Russian defense forces is now 1.2 million men. The number of people in the war machine is nearly 50 percent smaller than in the feared Soviet Army. The current Russian Army is suffering a considerable staff shortage and it is not even capable of managing the training of conscripts properly. Russian conscripts are now given only simple basic training in guard duties, if one is to believe the Swedish experts. Russia's Baltic Fleet is barely a shadow of its former self, and because of lack of money it cannot carry out military exercises. For that reason, the Russian troops would no longer be capable of carrying out a landing. According to Swedish experts, the shortage of money has also cut the training of Russian pilots so much that air safety is already threatened. Russian Air Force pilots clock up from 20 to 40 flying hours a year while NATO pilots clock up at least 100 hours, or even over 150 hours a year. The Swedes are also reassured by the information that Russia's arms production has collapsed. In 1988, Russia still built 3,500 tanks, last year the figure was only 200. The leaders of the Swedish defense forces do remember, however, that the Russian Army is still in possession of almost inexhaustible arms reserves, where one can even find missiles with nuclear warheads. The size of those reserves is not, however, such a big deterrent as before, partly because Russia has gone over to democracy. According to the Swedish defense forces, as a consequence of this, Russia does not have the political will to raise the readiness of the country's army to the level required for an offensive. Hearing of the assessment by the intelligence and security service, Swedish Defense Minister Anders Bjork was quick to warn that the Swedes should remember that sharpening the claws of the Russian bear does not necessarily take very long. Sweden cannot lull itself into too strong a sense of security as long as politicians like Zhirinovskiy have a chance to rise to power in Russia, Bjork said.
