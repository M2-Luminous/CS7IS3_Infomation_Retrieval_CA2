FR941213-1-00034 FR941213-1-00009 The FAA estimates the pilot-error accident rate for part 121 pilots to equal 0.7 accidents per million flights. Since the pilot-error accident rate for part 135 operators equals 0.9478 accidents per million, the proportion of available benefits for part 135 flights equal just over one-fourth accident per million flights [((0.9478^0.7)/0.9478))=0.26]. Also reducing the available benefits, the commuter operators would not complete training for two years. Hence, the estimated value of the benefits of this proposed rule totals $62 million. Part 135␣Crew Resource Management Training During the period 1982 through 1992, 13 part 135 accidents resulted from crew coordination problems, resulting in an accident rate of 0.158 per million flights. These accidents resulted in 85 fatalities, 35 serious injuries, and 43 minor injuries. The average benefit value of avoiding an accident including fatalities, injuries, value of aircraft, and accident investigation costs equals $19.545 million. The FAA estimated the value of potential benefits by multiplying the average value of a part 135 CRM-related accident ($19.545 million) by the number of potential accidents (accident rate times projected flights). For 1995, the estimate equals: [.158 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS] × [5.0 MILLION FLIGHTS] × [$19.545 MILLION] = $15.411 MILLION The discounted benefits over the next decade equal $98 million. Part 121␣Crew Resource Management Training Between 1982 and 1992, there were 23 part 121 air carrier accidents reported by NTSB that resulted, in part, from CRM-related causes. These accidents caused 324 fatalities and 91 serious injuries. The part 121 CRM accident rate equals 0.3938 accidents per million flights. The FAA estimated the value of potential benefits by multiplying the part 121 CRM accident rate by the number of flights times the average value per accident. The CRM benefits for 1995, for instance, equal: [.3938 ACCIDENTS/MILLION FLIGHTS] × [6.6 MILLION FLIGHTS] × [$35.527 MILLION] = $87.139 MILLION Over the next 10 years, the FAA projects the discounted value of benefits is $619 million. However, about one-third of part 121 pilots (those not in AQP) will begin training in 1995 and airlines would finish training in late 1996. The estimated potential benefits for part 121 CRM training equals $581 million. Benefit-Cost Comparison Part 135␣Training Upgrade Benefits from upgrading part 135 flight crew training to the part 121 level would result in a reduction in pilot-error commuter accidents. The FAA estimates that the expected benefits of this provision would total $62 million over the next decade. This evaluation estimates that the discounted training costs for large part 135 operators would increase anywhere from $27 to $36 million. Hence, the FAA concludes that the benefits of this provision exceed its costs. CRM Training for Part 121 Operators The FAA calculates the discounted benefits from requiring CRM training for part 121 personnel to equal $581 million. The estimated additional cost to airlines would range from $473 to $569 million over the decade. Hence, the FAA determines that this proposed provision is cost beneficial. CRM Training for Part 135 Operators The FAA estimates the benefits from requiring CRM training for part 135 personnel to equal $98 million over the next decade. The cost of training would range from an additional $9 to $12 million for part 135 operators. Hence, the FAA determines that this requirement is cost beneficial. Each provision of this proposal has potential benefits in excess of expected costs. Hence, the FAA concludes that the proposal is cost beneficial.
