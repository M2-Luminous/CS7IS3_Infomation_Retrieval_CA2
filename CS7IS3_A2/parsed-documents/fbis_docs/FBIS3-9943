The meeting between Arias and the president lasted more than half an hour. In an atmosphere of cordiality, Arias told President Caldera of some of his beliefs on what has happened in the country. During a lengthy news conference after the meeting, Arias told journalists of the president's receptiveness toward his proposal. He affirmed his confidence in the president's capability to lead the country. The military officer ruled out any possibility of a coup in the new political scenario in Venezuela. [Begin Arias recording] All the proposals I made to the president were received honestly and sincerely, very openly and frankly. I informed him of the large number of officers who want only to return to the Armed Forces. Most of the officers who remain in prison have no political designs; they have no aspiration to power. They only want to serve their country, and they believe they can best do so in the Armed Forces. I also told the president the reconciliation process is not the victory of old ways. I told him the vision I, and many others, have about this pacification and harmonization process is one of a united Armed Forces. The Armed Forces, which for a long time have been considered the country's moral reserve, have had the capacity for division so as to originate this new situation the country is beginning to experience. [sentence as heard] [end recording] Arias expressed support for a pacification based on pardons and a concerted effort to build a dignified and honest country. He said that although for the time being he will not work to build his political career, this idea has not been totally ruled out.
