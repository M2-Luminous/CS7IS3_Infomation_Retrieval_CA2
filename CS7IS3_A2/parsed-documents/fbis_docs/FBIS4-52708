[Mori] Now, we can win back the political regime which is within our reach. It has become apparent that the foundation of the coalition government is unstable. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What is your impression of the new cabinet ministers? [Mori] I feel the true character of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] is being exposed. Also, the vicious aspect of the old constitution has surfaced. It seems that the politicians on the verge of retirement are feeling that, at any rate, (Prime Minister Tsutomu) Hata is not likely to stay in his position long, and have appeared on the stage requesting that they should be appointed cabinet ministers as they can not wait any longer. In that sense, I feel the new cabinet is "the Last Supper" cabinet. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How will the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] challenge the new cabinet? [Mori] Haste makes waste. Though people are talking as they like about (LDP President Yohei) Kono and Mori as being irresolute and indecisive, you should never corner your opponent hastily when the opponent is in a fix. If you deliberately drive your opponent into a corner, it is certain that he will reveal his true character. We are to attack our opponent by waiting. We have not failed at all. Even political reform has been carried out based on the LDP's proposal. We have performed our duties cleverly, utilizing the opponent's power. When a political regime collapses, it always collapses from inside, and not as a result of a nation being weakened. Election is the only other method for changing a political regime. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Discord is still being created within the party. [Mori] Though the members who left the party try to give plausible reasons for their behavior, there is a strong feeling among them that "Representative Masayoshi Takemura and other members of Sakigake [Harbinger] alone are enjoying their enviable positions after skillfully leaving the party". Besides, they are aware of the problem of electoral districts (that it becomes difficult to obtain party approval under the single-seat district system). Literally, they are merely concerned about their selfish interests and tactics. Anyway, wistful members have all left the party. There is no one left. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] A critical situation was created temporarily when Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime minister and foreign minister, was about to leave the party. [Mori] Though Mr. Watanabe did not say it expressly, he thinks the problem of reorganization of the political world, which has been discussed since last year, was originally started when the Keiseikai [Takeshita faction] was split. Therefore, he strongly believes that politicians of the same philosophy should work together to perform their duties entrusted to them by the people. It is very impolite to try to utilize such a person. As a human being, you should not do such a thing. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about your alliance with the SDPJ, which is on the same side with the LDP as a nongovernment party? [Mori] We should not touch on policy problems. The time is not yet ripe to obtain a consensus within the party. What matters seriously is the fact that a political regime has been established that excludes the leading party and the second party, which represent the people's will. No doubt, the result of the election is being disregarded. It is nothing but the selfish behavior of a particular party. It is literally power politics. We are asking the SDPJ to cooperate with us to restore sound parliamentary democracy. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Are you not aiming to form an LDP-SDPJ alliance? [Mori] If a policy consensus can be formed in the process of our discussions, we may establish an organization for discussion and study the problem. It is desirable for the two parties to coordinate their opinions in dealing with the problem of tax reform, as well as the problem of security, including the problem involving the DPRK (North Korea). However, it is not our final objective to do so. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is it not possible for the LDP to be allied with the SDPJ if their consensus consists of the nine items which constituted the consensus between the SDPJ and the coalition parties? [Mori] Well, you are right. Through participation with the coalition government, the SDPJ has also become quite close to us as far as their policies are concerned. The similarity between the two parties is being revealed. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] People say that "the Hata administration will face a crisis in June." [Mori] Dissolution and general election come under the prime minister's authority, and we are not supposed to handle such matters. We are now working on dividing the single-seat districts. The Hata administration may also be of the opinion that the next election should be carried out under the new system. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the circumstances do not allow the Diet to be dissolved until after autumn? [Mori] My answer is yes, if we see the situation in terms of common sense. Even if things go smoothly, the budget is to be approved in the House of Representatives in the middle of June. It is physically impossible to discuss the bill concerning the new electoral districts before that date. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Will the summit (meeting of leaders of seven major industrial nations) to be held in July affect [the political situation in Japan]? [Mori] It is internationally impolite for a prime minister who is to leave his post soon to attend such a meeting. Besides, the same situation will be repeated for two consecutive years. Domestic confusion should not be brought into the meeting. Depending on how Hata is going to deal with the situation, the LDP is ready to deal with the situation, taking the national interests into consideration. [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Yet, is it not possible that a vote of no-confidence in the cabinet will be called for, and an election under the existing medium-sized district system will take place with the dissolution of the Diet? [Mori] Such a situation can take place. The question is whether (Shinseito Secretary Secretary Ichiro) Ozawa is ready to admit the fault of his own techniques. Judging from his character, he is not likely to do so. We all must reap as we have sown. Last year, while staying in the center of power comfortably, they voted no-confidence in their boss (ex-Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa) under the flag of justice named political reform. God will not forgive, them even if they deceive the general public.
