David Stahlavsky has the details: [Stahlavsky] Andrey Kozyrev has confirmed that there is no direct clash of interests between our states. He attributed some differences to the complexity of the problems we must solve jointly. The Russian minister mentioned the need to prepare quickly the documents on the visit of Prime Minister Klaus to Russia, which was agreed last summer by Presidents Havel and Yeltsin. Although Minister Zieleniec thinks there are no great differences of view on the attempts of our country to become a member of West European structures, his Russian partner refused to comment directly on whether Russia continues to consider the Czech Republic to be in its sphere of vital interests. Good relations are the vital interest. Kozyrev repeatedly conceded to all countries, including the Czech Republic, the right to join any international organization, even NATO. He documented it jokingly by the possibility of our entry to the Commonwealth of Independent States. Russia would not be against it. Russia, however, maintains the right to express its views on the optimal construction of European security, which was confirmed by President Yeltsin in his letter to Western countries shortly after his visit to Warsaw and Prague, in which he rejected the admission of Central and East European countries to NATO before Russia. According to Kozyrev, however, this argument is no longer topical by virtue of accepting the Partership for Peace program. NATO is an organization with which one has to cooperate, and Russia will join this program. No organization on its own, however, can respond to Europe's problems, Kozyrev said.
