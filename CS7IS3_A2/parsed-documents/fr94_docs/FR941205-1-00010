FR941205-1-00010 FR941205-1-00003 II. Description of Proposal This proposal simplifies the current capital distribution regulation by replacing the ``tiered'' approach to allowing savings associations to make capital distributions with one that allows associations to make only capital distributions that would not cause capital to drop below the level required to remain adequately capitalized. The OTS believes that the proposed rule, which is revised to conform with the PCA, is, on balance, as stringent as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) treatment of capital distributions. Each agency provides guidance and standards relating to limitations on the amount of capital distributions permissible although the OCC has another statutorily imposed standard in addition to the PCA standard and the OTS does not. 6 In addition, each agency requires prior notification if capital distributions exceed these standards. 6 See 12 U.S.C. 60. Conformity with PCA The proposed regulation incorporates the standards established in the PCA Rule into 12 CFR 563.134 by defining ``capital distributions'' to reflect the language of section 38(b)(2)(B). Pursuant to the regulatory standards set forth in the PCA Rule, a savings association is ``adequately capitalized'' if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0 percent or greater; a core risk-based capital ratio of 4.0 percent or greater; and a leverage ratio of 4.0 percent or greater (or of 3.0 percent or greater, if it was rated composite 1 after its most recent examination).
