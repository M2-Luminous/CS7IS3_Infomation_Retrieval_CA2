In order to create an intelligent materials and structures which can deal with changing environments and usage conditions by effecting changes in order to optimize a state in which they find themselves, a new design method known as adaptive design will be required. In this paper, we deal with adaptive design and its application examples. Adaptive Design Fig. 1. Adaptive Design A method of designing a conventional composite material and structure has sought the optimum of passive variables for shape and other elements. In other words, in Fig. 1, within a second-dimensional surface created by an evaluation function and passive variables, an optimal combination which satisfies a particular condition at hand has been sought. However, as environment and conditions became more severe, it has become necessary to satisfy a large number of conditions simultaneously. When an environment condition changed through time, in some cases, no matter how many times passive variables are changed, the optimal combination satisfying the condition simply was not found. The inclusion of a sensor, an actuator, and a controller in designing materials and structures to deal with this problem, however, meant an increased number of passive variables and search for the optimal combination in a 3-dimensional space shown in Fig. 1. For instance, as in Fig. 1, conditions A and B could not be satisfied simultaneously using passive variables alone; however, if the scope of conditions A and B are changed by including active variables, the scope which satisfied conditions A and B can be formed within the range allowed. Thus, a method which designs the optimal material and structure by using both passive and active variables, namely, an adaptive design method, becomes necessary in designing intelligent materials and structures. 3. Functionally Gradient Intelligent Material System The functionally gradient material is a type of material designed to satisfy both thermal resistance and strength conditions by continuously changing the ratio of these two factors in material composition. Even if the two types of materials are mixed to produce the optimal gradient, with a thermal-resistant material maintained at super high temperatures and a strength material at normal temperatures, it is possible to relax the thermal stress of a functionally gradient material, thereby making it possible to place it within the allowable scope. However, this will be difficult unless thermal deformation is allowed. It also is difficult to produce the kind of a mixture ratio of the two types of materials enabling both thermal stress and thermal deformation of the functionally gradient material to be within the allowable scope. Moreover, even if stress has been eased when the thermal resistent material is maintained at super high temperatures when in use, still when both thermal resistant material and strength material maintain the same temperature when not in use, thermal stress may be generated, in which event problems will arise. In order to avoid this, it is necessary to introduce the concept of intelligent material, designed to adapt to any change which may occur in environment or in usage condition, into functionally gradient materials. This means the use of the adaptive method in designing of functionally gradient intellectual materials. Fig. 2. Functionally Gradient Intelligent Distribution of Temperature and Thermal Fig. 4. Distribution of Thermal Expansion Fig. 5. Distribution of Young's Ratio and Poisson As shown in Fig. 2, by adhering the laminated piezoelectric material to the functionally gradient material's low-temperature strength material side, a functionally gradient material system can be achieved. When the thermal resistant material side (Z<sup> r</sup> O<inf> 2</inf> ) is T<inf> 1</inf> =1 100°C and the strength material side (Ti<inf> 6</inf> Al<inf> 4</inf> V) is T<inf> 2</inf> =0°C, if the optimal functionally gradient material is designed by using the finite element method to achieve relaxation of thermal stress, as shown in Figs. 3-5, temperature, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio are distributed in the direction of board thickness. Thermal deformation and thermal stress are as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. By adding voltage to a piezoelectric actuator, thermal deformation can be suppressed while maintaining thermal stress within the allowable range. By equipping a part of the actuator material with the sensor function and inserting it into an arithmetic board possessing the control function, the material will be able to maintain the optimal state even if temperature conditions of the high temperature side material is changing by minute.

Flutter Vibration Control Effect Presented in Fig. 8 is an example of an intelligent material system in which piezoelectric film is bonded to both surfaces of a cantilever thin board, using one side as a sensor, the other as an actuator, and an external computer as a controller. When this cantilever thin board was installed in uniform parallel air currents and air speed exceeded a certain level, the thin board generated flutter and vibrated violently. The use of the actuator proved to be of no value as it was used after the flutter had occurred. The piezoelectric film was not powerful enough to stop the flutter. However, if control was activated even when the speed of air current was not sufficiently fast to create flutter, the system would sense the occurrence of flutter, and by activating the activator even when response amplitude was extremely small, it would be able to stop flutter. Consequently, as shown in Fig. 9, it is possible to realize a panel designed to prevent flutter from occurring until air current speed reaches the point where it exceeds the normal flutter flow speed. Moreover, if the actuator can generate powerful force, it will become possible to raise the limit of flow speed at which flutter will not be produced. This limit is determined by the use of an adaptive design which takes into consideration usage conditions. Intelligent Arch Fig. 10. Intelligent Arch Fig. 10 represents an example of the intelligent material system, designed to bond piezoelectric film to both sides of a half arch, using the portion of the film covering an area from O<inf> 1</inf> to X<inf> 1</inf> as a sensor, from X<inf> 1</inf> to X<inf> 2</inf> as an actuator, and an external personal computer as a controller. The adaptive design can be used to decide on the question of which part of the arch a piezoelectric film should be adhered to so that the response of the arch receiving forced vibration in both upward and downward directions can be minimized. As shown in Figs. 11 and 12, when a control input obtained on the basis of robust control theory was added to the actuator, we have found that results produced by a numerical simulation and an experiment for the most part were in agreement. Since control input 300V was added rapidly, a response at the initial point was large. However, this situation probably can be avoided if we are to increase control input gradually. Fig. 11.

Response Amplitude and Number of Vibration Fig. 16. Time History Response In MRI system, it is necessary to run high-frequency current through gradient magnetic-field coils, which then will turn into a uniformly strong magnetic field. In order to enhance MRI system performance, it will be necessary to strengthen the uniform magnetic field and increase the frequency of high-frequency currents. This means that a electromagnetic force with a large high-frequency must be applied to the gradient magnetic field coils, as a result of which a fixed drum will be vibrated violently by the coils. The vibrations will be so severe that they will be difficult to stop even with the use of a damper attachment. In order to control electromagnetic vibration and eliminate noise, it will be necessary to develop an intelligent coil drum. The gradient magnetic field coil drum, as shown in Fig. 13, has a cylindrical surface equipped with two ring-shaped coils and two pairs of curved surface coils. Electric currents are run through these coils periodically, as a result of which the electromagnetic force (Lorentz force) is generated as it interacts with the strong magnetic field in the axial direction. This causes violent shaking in the coil drum. As shown in Fig. 14, vibrations can be damped actively by using distributed piezoelectric actuators. When the actuator is controlled and operated, as shown in Figs. 15 and 16, the vibration amplitude of drum coils become smaller. It was found that when the optimal distribution of the distributed piezoelectric actuators was obtained by using the adaptive design method, as clearly indicated in Case 2, damping effects were further improved. 7. Conclusion We have demonstrated that by designing an intelligent material using the adaptive design method, it became possible to create one with improved performance. Although here we used piezoelectric ceramics and piezoelectric filters, the magnetostrictive and other types of functionally gradient materials can be used. Moreover, since the electromagnetic functional material is equipped with the combination of sensor and actuator functions, it is regarded as the most promising intelligent material to emerge.
