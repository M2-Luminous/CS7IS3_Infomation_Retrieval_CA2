The unit's troops worked hard to build defensive tunnels and to fortify positions for correctly conserving all weaponry and protecting soldiers and the population. The second secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba assessed the importance of these facilities in protecting weaponry and soldiers in case of enemy air raids. Raul Castro's words are known: We may not be the Armed Forces with the most available resources, but we can say that we are the best protected Armed Forces on the continent; therefore, they are the most enthusiastic and are capable of coming from beneath the Earth's surface after a surprise, large- scale air raid and making the enemy pay dearly for trying to land on our island. Unit Chief Colonel Lazaro Lopez said the troops are prepared for combat readiness through various exercises and the use of schoolrooms, maquettes, and trainers, as well as through gunnery practice and the use of shooting ranges. This results in a considerable savings of human and material resources, including fuel. The young men in the unit excel in various patriotic and social activities: minimizing misdemeanors and eliminating the need for discipline violations, strengthening personnel support to their leaders, and proving to be active participants in essential tasks. Agrarian development represents another important task for this tank unit, in its zeal to achieve self-sufficiency. They currently have two basic production units, a pig farm, a poultry farm and its slaughterhouse, a cattle farm, and a fodder factory. A total of 20 tanks are being built to breed fish. Out of 160 medical products that can be manufactured with herbs, the unit has managed to manufacture 125 products in a small laboratory, thus fulfilling basic needs at the unit's hospital. In addition to their work, these fighters have had time to support vital economic tasks, including the potato harvest, the sugarcane recovery, and the cleaning of Varadero beach. They are also in charge of the military community and its elementary school and excel in valuable blood donations.
