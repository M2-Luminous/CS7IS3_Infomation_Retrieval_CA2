"The use of targeted military measures, as offered to the United Nations by NATO on 9 August 1993, must no longer be ruled out," German Government spokesman Dieter Vogel said in Bonn today. The German Government most strongly condemned the bloodbath among the civilian population, he said. The brutal attack on innocent women, men, and children showed an "incomprehensible contempt for human lives on the part of those responsible." The German Government expressed its sympathy to the relatives and declared its willingness to support U.S. efforts to provide medical care for the surviving victims wherever possible. This act of violence clearly shows "the urgent need for an immediate peace settlement in Bosnia-Hercegovina."
