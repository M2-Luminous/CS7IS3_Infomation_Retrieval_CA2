W. de Klerk, African National Congress [ANC] leader Nelson Mandela and Inkatha's Mangosuthu Buthelezi. In a faxed letter to Mr de Klerk on Monday, the Zulu monarch said he was experiencing difficulties with the days proposed for the meeting. King Zwelithini said it would be "inappropriate" for him to talk about the future of his kingdom before victims of Monday's violence in Johannesburg were buried. He also expressed fears about an appropriate and safe venue. The Zulu king further said he was concerned about "commencing very difficult discussions and negotiations during this week which is a holy week in the Christian calender". "There is also the fact that the kwaZulu Legislative Assembly has risen until April 7." He proposed that the meeting be postponed until "the week after Easter" provided violence abated sufficiently and simmering anger in Zulu communities subsided.
