[Cardenas] I and other people from my party have been pointing out for a long time the ill-advised nature of the neoliberal technocratic model implemented in Mexico since 1982 and the macroeconomic unsuitability of this model here, which has prompted a heavy deficit in the balance of payments and maintains an overvalued currency. We cautioned about the possibility of creating situations of political and social instability. The problem is that this model is blind to social demands. [Cardoso] The neoliberal model becomes successful by expelling the people from the economic system... [Cardenas] The model imposed expels the people not only from the system, but from our national territory as well. Over the past few years about 500,000 to 600,000 Mexicans have left. According to U.S. census data, between 12 and 13 million Mexicans are living in U.S. territory. The government believed it would be able to handle the situation through repressive policies, through closing opportunities for democratic participation, through insufficient programs like Pronasol (National Solidarity Program), and through corruption and the connivance [cooptacion] of social leaders. The government was not unaware of the wild concentration of national income among just a few. The government was aware of the fact that the model would favor only certain areas of production. [Cardoso] The reality that your are describing involves a need for rectification. Bearing in mind the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), it is appropriate to ask oneself: Hasn't the Mexican economic reconversion gone too far for such a rectification to be viable? [Cardenas] Since 1990, when negotiations were initiated, we have been raising the need for a agreement that is different from the current one. In our opinion the agreement must respond to development rather than to the free trade imperative, and should not be restricted to North America, but should achieve a continental level. For us, this way is more in keeping with Mexico's interests during this phase of economic globalization, from which we do not intend -- or are unable -- to escape. [Cardoso] You are raising the NAFTA issue in a very sensitive way. After hearing your words, would it be correct to assume that, if you win in the August elections, the government would promote renegotiations? [Cardenas] It is not advisable to speculate so much in advance. We are convinced that it is possible to achieve a better agreement, and this was not achieved because the Mexican negotiators failed to do it right. From the perspective of a new administration, it must be taken into account that we would have 11 months until the inauguration to evaluate how NAFTA functions. [Cardoso] Yet those 11 months will not be meaningless, especially as there will be a strong impact on Mexico's primary production... [Cardenas] Before the agreement, this administration had already opened up various economic areas, notably the grain sector. The entire importation of agricultural and livestock products has been opened up on the basis of permits that yield substantial commissions for those who are negotiating them. These permits have dealt strong blows to the producers of grain, corn, sorghum, beans, rice, red and white meat, and dairy products. Mexico's entire agricultural and livestock basic production was ruined even before NAFTA's implementation. [Cardoso] Salinas' entire mandate has gone by under the never entirely cleared suspicion of an electoral fraud, of which you were the main victim. Salinas has not been cleared of this suspicion, and the Chiapas crisis has reinstated it... [Cardenas] I will correct you at this point. It is not a suspicion, but the certainty of fraud in the 1988 elections. This fraud is at the root of the Chiapas problems. [Cardoso] Salinas de Gortari does not have a very clean record. Before Luis Donaldo Colosio's "uncovering" (election of a successor), the president had not even conducted the empty and formal consultations that Miguel de la Madrid at least had conducted to elect the current president, so as to give his candidacy the veneer of consensus... [Cardenas] The goal of increased democratization has not become apparent. Nevertheless, there is a problem for the government: The results of the next elections must be credible for the whole of Mexican society and for public opinion abroad. If the government does not guarantee such honesty, I don't know what society's reaction might be. It will surely be one of popular wrath, as we have already seen in San Luis Potosi, Guanajuato, and Michoacan, involving our country's general mobilization against an abuse -- as our people tend to believe. This is the great problem that the government is coping with, especially now with a ruling party candidate who has apparently been punched and devalued within the government itself. [Cardoso] Are you not harboring any questions on the way in which the Chiapas crisis erupted when, within barely a few days, confrontation was replaced by negotiations? [Cardenas] This is food for thought. We are viewing the risk of seeing a division in our country between what is controlled by the state, and the territory that might belong to the Zapatistas in a border area with many precious natural resources. We may not ignore that this conflict broke out unexpectedly, but apparently is also being resolved even faster, very smoothly. One of the scenarios that one may not fail to consider is that the revolt might have involved a terrible and tragic orchestration. [Cardoso] Do you challenge the character of a true peasant revolt, as claimed by the people involved? [Cardenas] No, no. The social basis of the conflict is undeniable, but the possibility of manipulation may also not be easily ruled out. [Cardoso] In your opinion, what prompted the unyielding Salinas from the early moments of the crisis to be replaced by a conciliatory Salinas within just a few hours? [Cardenas] It may be explained by an old RCA Victor slogan: "The voice of the master." [Cardoso] Are you hinting at the United States? [Cardenas] Yes.
