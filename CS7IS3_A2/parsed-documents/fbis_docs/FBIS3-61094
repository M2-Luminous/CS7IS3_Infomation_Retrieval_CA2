For some, he is an obvious fascist, extremist, instigator.... Oh, my, how much more havoc will he wreck in politics? For others, he is a dark horse, who with a sudden dash at the elections to the State Duma overtook the "overfed," self-confident trotters. For still others, he is simply a favorite of fortune: He came, promised the sky--and the gullible people fell under the spell and voted for him.... One way or the other, the name of Vladimir Volfovich is on everyone's lips these days. By publishing today an excerpt from Sergey Plekhanov's book (not yet published, by the way, due to a quite obvious attitude on the part of publishing houses toward the author), we will attempt to appraise a figure who is relatively new on the political scene. What is the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon? What forces have brought this formerly obscure, ordinary jurist to the crest of high power? Finally, does Vladimir Volfovich have a future, and what then can Russia expect from him? Questions, questions.... This article--which, we want to emphasize, represents only one viewpoint--will not answer them all, of course. There may be other opinions. The editors will be presenting them to RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA readers in the new year. He Had Already Been a Presidential Candidate I sit on a cheap, threadbare sofa next to an equally shabby desk and look at a tall, large man in a tuxedo and a brilliantly white shirt. He adjusts the knot of his tie in front of a mirror attached to the closet door. This gorgeous outfit is in jarring contrast with the squalid surroundings, so painfully familiar from tens and hundreds of dwellings of our compatriots that I have seen over many years.... A man in a tuxedo, who looks like a messenger from another world brought to the sorry, orphaned Russian soil by some unknown force is nevertheless the owner of this sad two-room apartment on the 14th floor of a regular Soviet apartment house. Vladimir Volfovich casts a last glance at himself in the mirror before we leave for a television debate of Russia's presidential candidates. We all rise and file out of the apartment. The door opens, and we are accepted into the belly of a typical Soviet elevator, reeking of urine and covered with unprintable graffiti. Downstairs, everything is also covered with drawings and scribbles, bearing witness to the irreversible regression of humanity since the times of the Neanderthals, who amused themselves in the same way, by drawing on the walls of their caves. Intermixed with them are announcements informing the tenants about the distribution of sugar coupons, and the repair and maintenance department's orders. Not a single indication anywhere, however, that a man who lives in this wing is a presidential candidate.... The aluminum door, with its broken combination lock, opens, and we find ourselves in the street, facing a cortege of varicolored cars. The most luxurious among them is Zhirinovskiy's white Moskvich. Two old rustbuckets on worn-out wheels accept on board members of the team of a contender for the highest office in the country, and the cortege speeds up along the road cutting through Sokolniki Park. We disembark from the cars at the entrance to the television center. The leadership of the information empire and television debate moderator Igor Fesunenko hurry towards the prehistoric autos. Almost at the same time, black limousines with Ryzhkov's team pull up. The former prime minister with a firm step walks from his Volga toward Fesunenko. A mutual introduction follows. Two presidential candidates stand next to each other. They are of about the same height, slender, dressed in black. But Zhirinovskiy produces a better effect--whether it is the silk lapels or his youth, but in comparison with yesterday's head of government he looks more striking.... And my mind, for some reason, flashes back incongruously to the small two-room apartment, a den filled with motley furnishings, and a half-ajar door bound with vinyl on the inside.... The calendar shows 11 June 1991. Tomorrow are the presidential elections. I, however, think back to that August day in 1989, when I for the first time heard in the telephone receiver Zhirinovskiy's distinctive voice--a little raspy, sharp, abrupt.... He called me after reading in the papers the appeal of the organizational committee for the march of solidarity with the Russian population of the Baltic countries. The idea of that march was mine, and it was also I who took upon myself the organizational side of it--arranged to pay for 10 buses, and with the help of a people's deputy secured a motorized GAI [state motor vehicle inspectorate] escort for the march. Zhirinovskiy liked the idea of a demonstration against the Baltic nationalist forces, and he said that he himself and several of his confederates would participate. In the end, he was not able to take the trip, however, because he had to leave for Turkey during the time the march was held. When at the beginning of May 1991 I heard on the radio an interview with Zhirinovskiy, who by then was in the presidential race, I immediately recognized his voice. So I called the Moscow Hotel, where his headquarters were located. Having learned that I was working on a book about the right-wing movement in Russia, he immediately invited me to come over.... The candidate's energy had a contagious effect on everyone around him; as if, having entered a powerful magnetic field, people sharply changed their routes. The same happened to me--Zhirinovskiy listened to me and said abruptly: "Come ride with me; we will talk on the way; you will see and write down everything you need." And for a week, taking a detour from my normal routine, I remained in his orbit. A month later, when the presidential campaign was already behind us, I was on a train, traveling on business. My fellow traveler, a young female physician, chattered nonstop, telling me about her hospital, its chief physician, her colleagues. Her entire world was divided into Leos, Sagittarians, Cancers--apparently she never read anything except horoscopes. The chief physician, as one would expect, was the most prominent character in her tales: "You see, he is a classic Pisces-- nervous, edgy.... You know, I once saw on television an interview with Zhirinovskiy--I think he is a typical Pisces. Do you know by any chance his birth date?..." Even an astrology enthusiast did not remain unaware of the political show organized in holy Russia in the first weeks of June 1991.... Nevertheless, Zhirinovskiy is not a Pisces--he is an Aries. He was born on 25 April 1946 in Almaty. His loud voice was heard by the entire huge population of a three-room apartment, which his family had received three years before his birth. During the war, however, because of the influx of refugees, Vladimir's mother and her five children had to make room for more people. An impression of something many-headed, yelling, constantly moving--this is Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's first recollection of the world surrounding him. And this perception of life as a bazaar, as endless hubbub, which came to him with the first glimpse of self-consciousness, remained with him almost until the age of 30: a childhood in a communal apartment; a child care facility (five days a week with overnight stay); school, pioneer camps, university dormitory, Army billets and dormitories. Only at the age of 28, having purchased a cooperative apartment on the outskirts of Moscow, did he gain peace and time for contemplation.... Many of Those Around Him Believed That Zhirinovskiy Was a Loser Asking Vladimir Volfovich questions about the years of his childhood and youth, I was hoping to collect some vivid tidbits that would help to present the process of his spiritual coming of age. But my interlocutor kept emphasizing that he had lived for decades in the stagnant and stifling atmosphere of universal poverty, a human bazaar; not even a bazaar--a flea market. The latter definition of our society reflects its nature best--trading second-hand things, living off what had been earned by previous generations. In school, he was not a bright star, but did rather well. Considering that this was the best school in Almaty, one would assume that Vladimir Volfovich's classmates would have reached prominent positions. Zhirinovskiy explained to me in an easy-to-understand way, however, that this logic applies in other geographic zones. The point is that the best school in Almaty was a Russian school, and there was only one Kazakh in Zhirinovskiy's class. Therefore, when old school friends gathered together for a 20-year reunion, it turned out that no one had achieved anything in this life: All the young talents became good, ordinary engineers, doctors, teachers, metalworkers, electricians, and drivers.... Had they been Kazakhs, with all other conditions being equal, the classmates' reunion would have looked different: ispolkom [executive committee] chairmen, raykom [rayon party committee] secretaries, high-ranking officials in the Council of Ministers or the Central Committee of the local communist party, distinguished figures in science, directors of trade warehouses and stores, members of creative unions.... Over the decades of "reverse colonialism," the Russians in all national-state entities on the periphery of the former Russian Empire have become skilled servants of "indigenous nations," which concentrated in their hands the land and its output, the distributive functions and power. Suppression of national self-consciousness of the Russians was carried out in accordance with the Old Testament directives of the Bolshevik center going back to the 1920's, when "international" dictators were running the Kremlin. Swift and decisive confiscation of property from Russians and a forcible placement of "national cadres" in positions of power already by the end of 1930's had formed the social conditions for the emergence of national-communist regimes. Today President of Kazakhstan Nazarbayev says: "I openly admonish and warn adventure-seekers who are suffering from nostalgia for our evil past: We will not allow any changes in the borders between republics, which are recognized as inviolable in interrepublic treaties and declarations of state sovereignty. Neither will we allow to hold on the territory of Kazakhstan any celebrations of anniversaries of the Cossack service to the czarist regime, let alone formation of Cossack units." It looks as if no talk of the dignity of national cultures and self-determination of nations reaches Kazakhstan. On the contrary, entire villages that had never had anything to do with this region are moving in from the territory of China and settling in the lands of the Semirechnyy Cossacks. They are Kazakhs, and in the logic of the local authorities, they possess the right of primogeniture. National-Bureaucracy. What Is It? A majority of the Russian population of the former Soviet Union only now is haltingly learning of the existence of a national-bureaucracy and the oppression of their kin in "brotherly republics." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy belongs to that minority, which experienced this relatively mild oppression since childhood. For the first time the minority is gaining a voice. For a Russian who grew up in Russia, the notion of land as a common good is automatically assumed; for a Russian living among the aborigines of Asia or Caucasus, such a perception of the world is impossible. A Russian who is by the fact of his birth separated from ownership of land may be blown off the settled place by the winds of enmity at any moment.... Going to the countryside here, in Russia, we perceive the surrounding landscape as air, as native language--this is something that cannot be separated from our very being. A Russian going to a countryside over there sees the world with completely different eyes. This may explain why our compatriots living in those parts are strictly urban folks deprived of the life-nurturing connection "countryside--land--city," which one way or the other defines the being of a full-fledged nation. The suffocating atmosphere in which Russian "guest workers" grow up and the impossibility of jumping outside of the social status preordained for you result for most in a loss of national dignity; people of this kind become patriots of the climate and material supply, ready to go on for hours bragging about prices at a farmer's market and describing what and how much they have stored for the winter. There is no worse a creeping Philistine than a Russian who has accepted his role of second-class citizen. The usual topics of his conversation do not transcend the canning--clothing--housing concerns. And only a small number among those millions of Russians who have been dispersed by the hurricanes of history over the Asian and Western outskirts of the former empire find themselves able to overcome their "white slavery...." Vladimir Zhirinovskiy came to Moscow after graduating from high school, with a firmly established interest in international politics. The Moscow University's Institute of Oriental Languages [IOL] was one of the few institutions of higher learning that opened to its graduates a road into this sphere. These same institutions also traditionally had been the breeding ground for the elite. The Turkish studies group, where Vladimir Zhirinovskiy was accepted, consisted of only six students: a general's son, a deputy minister of foreign affairs' son, the son of a high-ranking official in the CPSU Central Committee, and the son of the chief of a main administration of the State Committee for Foreign Economic Relations. A boy from a poor family, who made his home in a dormitory on Lenin Hills and who was barely able to make ends meet thanks to the modest amounts of money sent by his mother, could not, of course, count on becoming friends with young bon vivants. They had money and fashionable rags; they could use their parents' cars and dachas, where they could entertain girls. In 1964, when Zhirinovskiy came from Almaty, flared pants had just become a fad in Moscow, and the future administrators of international policy spent much more time talking about them than about the fall of Khrushchev, which occurred on the second month after they began their studies. Over all the years in school, the everyday priorities of the "golden youths" have practically not changed, while Zhirinovskiy eagerly absorbed the new and gradually began to show himself as a personality. By the end of his studies, instead of a shy, unsure provincial boy, his classmates discovered an independent and even obstinate young man. An internship trip to Turkey was the first peak in Zhirinovskiy's life. Having worked for several months as a translator at various objects of Soviet-Turkish economic cooperation, he saw both big cities and backwaters. In those times the Soviet Union was not yet in such neglect as it is today, while Turkey had not reached its current stage of Westernization; therefore, one may assume that a stay in that country would not have instilled in an IOL student a great reverence for Western civilization. But neither did he engage in communist propaganda here. Both mutually exclusive accusations, however, have been thrown at Zhirinovskiy: first by those who had secretly made the decision to bar a specialist in Turkey from any more foreign travel, and then by the knights of freedom from the emboldened Soviet press.... Can You Believe This? He Engaged in Communist Propaganda The episode when the Turkish police arrested the student-intern for distributing Soviet pins was interpreted by such mass media in a manner worthy of Goebbels: He engaged in communist propaganda and was properly punished. It appears that this old episode involving Zhirinovskiy made an indelible impression on the official Soviet authorities. When in 1988 I went to Turkey as a member of a writers group, at the then-compulsory briefing I heard the incantation: Under no circumstances are you to give away pins with Soviet symbols; better still, none at all, to avoid problems with the police. I do not know whether this incident had any bearing on Zhirinovskiy's subsequent career, but the fact remains that despite excellent grades in his diploma, instead of exotic countries he was sent to the Transcaucasian Military District. Two years wearing a lieutenant's shoulder boards was not the destiny of those connoisseurs of fashion, wine, and female beauty riding in the parental limousines--they had their futures laid out for them regardless of the results of their exams. Two more years of barracks and dormitories, and Vladimir Zhirinovskiy regained freedom of action. He came to the Soviet Peace Committee, where he would eventually deal with Western Europe. He was fed up with the East and gladly began studying German. In addition to foreign language courses, he also took on another burden, enrolling in the evening study at the MGU [Moscow State University] School of Law. Despite all his academic and linguistic successes, however, the road to the free world remained closed to him. His peacekeeping activities did not last long--only two years. He had to surrender his job to a niece of the then secretary of the CPSU Central Committee. She immediately began hopscotching all over the world--nobody even asked her whether she were a member of her powerful uncle's party.... Zhirinovskiy, meanwhile, had to take a job at the trade union movement higher school, where he worked for a short while in the bursar's office handling the affairs of foreign students. Then he moved to the Inyurkollegiya [the Foreign Legal Collegium under the Moscow City Bar]. All these jobs seemingly were associated with international affairs; nevertheless, Zhirinovskiy was still not permitted to travel abroad: perhaps because he was not a communist party member, or perhaps for some other reason.... That Is What Is Amazing: He Was Never Ahead of His Time This dreary, grounded life went on for decades. For many years he made a living as legal counsel of the Mir publishing house. The 40-year watershed he approached without any particular achievements--no dacha; no decent car.... Had it not been for the changes that began after 1985, Zhirinovskiy, as millions of middle-rank intelligentsia like him, would be looking at an unenviable fate, with a 120-ruble pension and a six-hundredths of a hectare garden plot as the crowning achievement of his life. When he said at rallies: I am one of you; I live in the same kind of two-room apartment, am paid the same 200-ruble salary--he told an absolute truth. That is why a study of the Zhirinovskiy phenomenon can contribute much more to the understanding of the political potential of an ordinary Soviet man than a figure reflecting a rating of some or other public figure. When I asked Vladimir Volfovich from what age he began to feel himself a "political man," realized that his views were different, contrary to the officially imposed ideology, he said that he divides his spiritual evolution into three stages. At about the age of 21 he felt the need to formulate his views. Another 10 years passed before he could tell himself that he was not satisfied with the political situation in the country--this more or less coincides with the adoption of the 1977 Constitution. But the true awakening of his political temperament Zhirinovskiy dates to the beginning of perestroyka. His evolution at that time was again typical for the main masses of the intelligentsia. During the first years of liberalization he unquestionably supported Gorbachev, sympathized with Yeltsin as an underdog ("I was very upset when he was not elected to the Supreme Soviet at the first congress of people's deputies," says Vladimir Volfovich). It was only at the end of 1990 and the beginning of 1991 that Zhirinovskiy believes his divergence from the official reformers' political course began. Thus, he was never ahead of his time--he did not serve time in prisons, did not participate in the dissident movement, did not write "for the drawer;" like huge numbers of people of his circle, he habitually grumbled about obviously stupid things committed by the Soviet system, told jokes, occasionally praised the "rotting" [capitalism]. He did not create the current situation--it created him as a politician. And this is very important, since Zhirinovskiy has, figuratively speaking, the same blood type, the same arterial pressure, the same pulse as the middle class, with a middle-age population, who have reached the zenith of their life with empty pockets. Unlike those dissidents who, like Sakharov, Gleb Yakunin, Sergey Kovalev, or Revolt Pimenov, found themselves sort of living relics at the get-togethers of communist conformists, who have created a number of illusory parties, Zhirinovskiy does not feel himself an honorary general at well-attended rallies. While for "democrats" the presence of such persons is a necessary condition to prove the legitimacy of their gatherings, Zhirinovskiy strives to earn this legitimacy from his own compatriots who, like him, have had collectively participated in both the good and the evil of their time. It is indicative that he practically never turns to any authorities to reinforce his claim on power. None of the holy names of the democratic love-ins are dropped in his speeches. And those historic figures he does refer to as personification of his political ideal--Count P.D. Kiselev, P.D. Milyutin, S.Yu. Witte, P.A. Stolypin--signal to the audience: You have in front of you an intellectual, an expert on history, and a politician; he is a step above his competitors from the official camp. They started as tractor drivers or construction brigade foremen, and then for decades studied the science of meanness and servility in obkom [oblast party committee] corridors, while I, an ordinary intellectual pushed to the back seat of society, devoted decades of my outwardly ordinary life to the task of developing my mind: I studied the French, English, German, Turkish, and Arabic languages; I am a specialist on Eastern cultures and have a jurist's diploma; I have studied in depth the past of our country; I am knowledgeable in the most complex political issues, ethnic and social. I am familiar with modern economic theories. Hence, I am made from different ingredients than those who lay claim to power, although they had a lot of time to show their abilities. Refuse them your trust; give the mandate to run the country to a new politician--someone who understands problems big and small that each of us faces, who does not carry on his shoulders the burden of mistakes and vices of the old elite.... If we analyze the makeup of Zhirinovskiy's supporters, it will turn out that the majority of those who voted for him are young people--those who look up not so much to authorities as to themselves. Language and terminology understandable to them make Zhirinovskiy sharply different from his competitors, who are used to talking to the audience either in the wooden language of bureaucracy or in the bird language of intellectual gatherings. While the press was taking apart Zhirinovskiy's biography, relishing a few spicy episodes such as spending time in a Turkish prison, the ordinary voter was deciding for himself a simple question: "Do I or do I not like him?" In the final analysis, all components of the image--appearance, manner of speech, language--gradually form a personal attitude to a politician. Zhirinovskiy, who did not have the support of the press, enjoyed the highest "personal taste" rating: People either adored him or rejected him. Still, Why Do People Listen to Him Attentively? Now the time has come, however, to give thought to that complex of ideas he drew on--after all, in a political struggle, the heat of emotions is in direct correlation with the radicalism of statements and their correspondence to the frequency to which the masses are tuned. In this respect, Zhirinovskiy has also turned out to be a phenomenon. First, nobody expected of him the words that sounded in his speech at the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia and on television. Neither those who bet on Yeltsin nor communist dogmatists nor patriotic forces. For all of them Zhirinovskiy's statements were like a cold shower--all competing programs looked, when compared to the election manifestos of the totally unknown upstart, like a collection of platitudes. He was brighter, bolder, and easier to understand than all the regular actors on the perestroyka scene, and the solutions for political and economic problems offered by him looked actually implementable. The LDP [Liberal-Democratic Party] leader made the main issue of his program the issue of national-state system. He traced all the country's troubles to 1922, when by Lenin's scenario the Bolshevik authorities conducted an administrative reform as a result of which Russia was dismembered into a score of large and small quasi-state entities according to ethnic principle. In those times, creation of such structures was not dictated by an outbreak of nationalism, as one would think projecting into the past today's situation. On the contrary, it was a very difficult task to carry out in illiterate precivilization areas, populated by nomads. The uninformed cattle-breeders had to be dragged by their ears into newly formed structures. Which means that Lenin's design was not aimed at pacifying local separatists thirsting for independence. In order to rule over the enslaved people, the new masters needed the support of those who under no circumstances could claim the right to power under the normal course of events--lumpens and foreigners; they needed to create on a broad scale all-encompassing state structures, which were filled with those promoted from the lower strata and so-called national cadres. If the former could become at the initial stage the bulwark against a potential restoration of a Russian ethnic elite, the latter became a counterbalance against such a development on a more long-term basis. The Bolshevik dictatorship could not last very long, because it did not have in its set of tools anything except violence and organized lowering of the culture. But if the new rulers managed to split the subjugated country by ethnic attribute, then the new bureaucracy, which would receive power from them, would become a reliable ally, because the Russian nation in this case became their common enemy. Its suppression was conducted in a hidden form--it was impossible to keep it from moving into positions of leadership, but a capitulation of nationality of sorts could be made a condition of it. No strictly Russian institutions of power were created in the country--even the ruling party, which was built on the territorial-administrative principle, for some reason "did not notice" the largest republic; what was permitted for the big Ukraine and the small Estonia was not permitted for the enormous RSFSR. And any attempt to create a Russian Communist Party was an offense subject to capital punishment (the latest example--the "Leningrad affair" in the end of the 1940's). The newly created system of quasi-republics begat multistage structures manned by "national cadres," and today, in the environment of disintegration of the totalitarian regime, these hierarchies lacking vitality should have, as many thought, disintegrated, together with the machine of power that had produced them. Strange as it may be, however, the latter-day "democrats" do not even consider breaking up the parasitic entities that feed numerous ranks of all sorts of "political statesmen," "scholars," and "cultural figures." This entire semifeudal guard could not be competitive within a framework of a modern pluralistic society and would have to inevitably give way to more capable and socially useful people in all spheres of activities. In the northern areas of Kazakhstan, where the presence of the indigenous population measures in several percentage points, the "Leninist national policy" used to border on the ridiculous. A terrible commotion in a Karaganda construction trust--there is no suitable candidate for a trade union committee chairman: The director is a Ukrainian, the party committee secretary--a Russian, so the third member of the "triangle" cannot possibly be a non-Kazakh. It so happens, however, that in the entire trust there is not a single son of the steppes! Finally they find a semi-literate Kazakh woman who works as a timekeeper, and ceremonially present her to the bosses. A common sigh of relief is heaved: A national cadre is in place, and nobody will be able to find fault with them.... Zhirinovskiy has said what the democrats, who at every convenient occasion branded the vices and crimes of the communist regime, has never dared to say; this politician said for all to hear that the fallacious system of promotion by ethnic criteria should be scuttled; that it is necessary to dismantle Lenin's construct of 1922. This is the root of all the problems of today's Russia. Zhirinovskiy's recipe is simple: In order to overcome the permanent crisis, we need to get rid of the artificial division by the national-territorial criteria and restore the old principles: The province is the main unit of administrative division of the country; nations' rights to self-determination are realized in the sphere of culture; individual rights take priority over the rights of a nation. The LDP chairman has not invented anything new--these sensible foundations already realized in democratic states ensure stability and individual freedoms. No other country has ever had as burdensome a bureaucratic apparatus and all sorts of national subunits in science, culture, and the political sphere as the Soviet Union did. Neither the multiethnic India nor Indonesia nor African countries populated by tribes speaking different languages--none have adopted the principle of national-territorial division, because it represents a ticking time bomb capable of destroying the state at the time of any crisis. Let alone the fact that none of the modern democratic constitutions contains a clause on the right of individual territories to secede from the state. History Is the Best Teacher. But for Some Reason There Are Few Good Pupils By various estimates, there are between 1,500 and 3,000 peoples and languages in the world, but only a little more than 150 sovereign powers. This means that the self-determination principle is not universal at all; not every ethnic group is capable of creating a vital state. Besides, the prevalent trend in the most cultured regions of the planet is rapprochement of countries and people for the sake of solving economic, social, and ecological problems. And an increasing number of global crisis phenomena makes such a movement toward unification irreversible. Naturally, no historic lessons and objective trends set an example for flaming patriots of minute "fatherlands"--especially keeping in mind that their personal destiny depends completely on the realization of separatist dreams. Still, it would be useful to look into the recent past, for then we would see that all of this already has happened and all turned out much ado about nothing.... The Austro-Hungarian, as well as the Ottoman, Empire was perceived as a "sick man of Europe" in all the capitals of the world long before the advent of the twentieth century. The question of its disintegration had been massages in the press for decades. The first crack in the Habsburg empire formed in the course of revolutions of 1848. In order to assuage the nationalist aspirations of Hungarians, the German dynasty decided to change the state formula: The Eastern Empire (Osterreich) was replaced by a two-in-one monarchy. But this step did not stop the centrifugal tendencies: The Slavic population of the empire thirsted for independence. There was some talk about a three-in-one formula; even some names were tried on for size: "Austro-Slavo-Hungary" or something along these lines. But the "sick man" problem was resolved in a much easier way--as a result of a military defeat, the empire was pulled apart piece by piece with the benevolent consent of the victorious powers. Former Austro-Hungarian provinces went over to Poland, Soviet Ukraine, Romania, Yugoslavia, and so on. A community of nations turned into a bevy of small states, which for two decades warred among themselves, and then were occupied by the Third Reich. The map of the world was recut once again, and the former Austro-Hungarian provinces again found themselves under the thumb of an empire--this time a communist one. And now we witness a new chapter in their history. Yugoslavia has disintegrated; the former parts of the Austrian reich--Croatia and Slovenia--separated from it. And we hear increasingly loud voices in favor of restoring a long-dead superpower--at first perhaps in the form of a confederation. The first participants are identified: It is unlikely that Austria and Hungary, Croatia, and Slovenia can exist for long as autonomous entities.... So the question is: Why was it necessary to spill seas of blood? For what gain did the political demagogues of the end of the past and the beginning of the current century push nations toward a disintegration of their common house? Anyway, it is an idle question--there is no one to be held responsible. We are, however, able quite consciously to address our doubts to modern Masariks and Pilsudskiys: Are they certain that in seven or eight decades, having drunk the cup of suffering, the nations they lead will not condemn their names, and the wheel of history will not creakingly make a full turn and the buried empire will not rise again like a sunken continent?
