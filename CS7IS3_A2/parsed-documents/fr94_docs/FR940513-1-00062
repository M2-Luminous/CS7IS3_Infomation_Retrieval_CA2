FR940513-1-00062 FR940513-1-00017 40 CFR Part 63 [AD-FRL&hyph;4881&hyph;4] RIN 2060&hyph;AD02 Federal Standards for Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading Operations and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Marine Tank Vessel Loading and Unloading Operations AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Notice of proposed rulemaking and notice of public hearing. SUMMARY: Standards implementing two provisions of the Clean Air Act (the Act) are being proposed by today's notice. One set of standards is proposed under section 183(f) of the Act and would limit air emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from new and existing marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations. These standards would require the application of reasonably available control technology (RACT). An additional set of standards is proposed under section 112(d) of the Act and would limit air emissions of HAP from new and existing marine tank vessel loading and unloading operations. These proposed national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants (NESHAP) would require existing and new major sources to control emissions using the maximum achievable control technology (MACT). DATES: Comments: Comments must be received on or before July 18, 1994. Public Hearing: A public hearing will be held on June 15, 1994 beginning at 9:30 a.m. ADDRESSES: Comments: Interested parties may submit comments (in duplicate if possible) to: Air and Radiation Docket and Information Center (6102), Attention: Docket No. A&hyph;90&hyph;44, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. The Agency requests that a separate copy also be sent to the contact person listed below. Public Hearing: The public hearing will be held at the EPA's Office of Administration Auditorium, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.
