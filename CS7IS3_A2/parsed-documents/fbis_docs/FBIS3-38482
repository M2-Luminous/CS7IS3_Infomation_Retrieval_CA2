Finland's experiences, however, indicate that reality is more multifaceted than this kind of dogmatic analysis would suggest. Sometimes, even the distinction between neutrality and nonalignment has been like a line drawn in water. A good example of this is the direction taken by the Nordic countries, which was outlined in December of 1935. The purpose of this was to show that Finland was not a German satellite, but wanted, as did the other Nordic countries, to preserve its neutrality in the face of the confrontation between Germany and the USSR. There was also, however, a desire to use this to create a basis for military cooperation with Sweden in the event of a Soviet attack. The final goal was a defense pact between Finland and Sweden--an alliance with the purpose of securing neutrality. Negotiations with Sweden progressed so far that an agreement was reached about the joint defense of the Aland Islands. But Sweden pulled back when faced by opposition from the USSR. This was a fateful message to Stalin. It was later explained that the Finnish attempt at neutrality failed because Stalin could not trust the sincerity of that striving. But Stalin had no qualms about Finland's neutrality as long Germany formed a counterforce to the USSR in the Baltic. We still do not know what Stalin's ultimate motives were, at that juncture, but we know that the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement provided him with the chance of realizing them. The agreement allowed him to launch an attack on Finland without having to fear retribution from the Germans. The start of the Winter War indicated that the policy of neutrality conducted by a small nation can only succeed when a power balance has been achieved between the superpowers. After the Winter War had broken out, Finland embarked upon an active search for Western allies. In February 1940, England and France offered Finland military support, but it was too little, too late. But the offer of aid still had a significant effect in that it made Stalin willing to drop the Kuusinen government and sign a peace accord with the legal government of Finland, as he did not want to precipitate a conflict with the West. After the Winter War, Finland abided by a policy of neutrality, but was continuously under threat, as long as the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement was in effect. The situation changed in the fall of 1940, at which time Germany was willing to support Finland; the power balance had been restored. This saved our country from the fate of the Baltic states. Paasikivi wrote about this situation, that Snellman's often quoted statement, according to which a nation should only trust itself, is only a half-truth: "This only applies to a large nation. It is not enough for a smaller one. Naturally, even a small nation, such as Finland, should do all it can to defend itself, and fight for its own survival. But when Finland is facing an opponent as large as the USSR, Finland's own resources are not enough, and we must search for help from abroad, in this case from Germany." In 1941, Germany controlled all of the European continent and was preparing to attack the USSR. In this situation, Finland had no way of maintaining its neutrality. Even Sweden was forced to bend its policy of neutrality and permit German troops to move through Swedish territory. Finland was left only with two alternatives; either voluntarily participate in the German offensive or be forced to become a support area for German troops. But Finland did not become a signatory to a specific alliance with Germany. Finland went to war next to Germany, and fought its own war against the USSR, only in order to achieve its own national goals. This effort of combining the benefits of enjoying the support of a major power, with the freedom of neutrality, required some diplomatic acrobatics, but it succeeded in that it kept the United States from declaring war against Finland. However, in June 1944, Finland had to commit to fight alongside the Germans until the end, in order to secure military aid to stave off the offensive by the USSR. But as the commitment only took the form of a personal promise by President Risto Ryti, it could be abrogated as soon as the attack, with the aid of Germany, had been thwarted. In the situation following World War II, Finland was at the mercy of the USSR as long as the alliance formed by the victors stayed in effect. However, the favorable view taken by the West toward Finland had a dampening effect on the USSR. Stalin admitted to this later, during discussions with Tito. Finland was not occupied because he did not want to irritate the United States. Finland's position became stronger and stronger as the relationship between East and West became more and more strained, and the West started to demand a counterforce against the military power of the USSR. Because of this, Finland was able to reach satisfactory terms in the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance (FCA). But it was not until the return of the Porkkala Military Base--as a result of the superpowers' power balance turning in favor of the West--that Finland was given the opportunity to seek international approval for its policy of neutrality. Combining the FCA Treaty with a policy of neutrality again required exhibits of diplomatic acrobatics. The credibility of such policies was tested from both the East and the West, depending on from what direction the political winds were blowing at any given time. But overall, during the Cold War, Finland was able, together with Sweden and Austria, to utilize the situation created by the power balance between East and West, to stabilize its own position. History is not a cookbook from which one can glean complete recipes for solving today's problems. Paasikivi often quoted the Swiss historian, Jakob Burkhardt, by noting that we cannot learn from history for the next time--as next time will never come. But history can help us become wiser. We can also become wiser by studying the history of Finnish security policy. It shows that Finland, during the course of many decades, has survived wars and crises because it has shown a willingness to try different policies in ever changing situations--sometimes neutrality, sometimes nonalliance, and sometimes a combination of the two--to ensure its security. We must be just as willing today to consider all available options.
