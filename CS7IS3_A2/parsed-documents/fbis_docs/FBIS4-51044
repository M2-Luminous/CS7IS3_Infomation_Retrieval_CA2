In an exclusive interview with XINHUA on the eve of Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to China, Davydov said that since 1992, trade between Russia and China had been growing rapidly thanks to the economic reforms and encouraging policies being pursued by both nations. He said that the volume of two-way trade reached 7.68 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, a 30.9 percent increase over 1992. He noted that China had become Russia's second largest trading partner and that Russia ranked seventh on China's list of international trading partners. In the first quarter of this year, however, trade between the two nations for various reasons saw a decline, he said. But the minister went on to say that he was confident that there were bright prospects for a growth in trade and that the trade relations in general would continue to improve. He stressed that the two sides should take steps to solve the problems affecting the development of trade between them. He suggested that Russia and China amend their trade agreements to suit the different situation and that the central banks play a greater role in trade between the two nations.
