FR940606-0-00043 FR940606-0-00019 Economic Displacement, Temporary Relocation and Moves Within Project In some areas, HUD program regulations reflect policy determinations which go beyond the letter of the URA. The URA and the regulations at 49 CFR part 24 do not directly create eligibility for relocation assistance (as a ``displaced person'') for a tenant-occupant who is permitted to remain in the property but moves from the property because he or she cannot afford the rent charged upon completion of a project (economic displacement); who is required to relocate temporarily, but not permanently, while the project is underway; or who must move permanently to other space in the building/complex. Therefore, to protect such tenant-occupants, these program regulations provide that a tenant who moves permanently because the terms and conditions of continued occupancy, temporary relocation, or relocation within the building/complex are unreasonable will qualify as a ``displaced person'' who is entitled to relocation assistance at levels identical to those required in 49 CFR part 24. For purposes of determining whether the economic displacement of a tenant has occurred, these regulations establish as ``reasonable,'' a rent/utility charge that does not exceed the greater of: (1) A specified share of the person's income (e.g., 30 percent of income), or (2) the tenant's old monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs. A tenant who is required to pay a higher cost upon completion of the project may elect to remain in the project or move permanently and obtain relocation assistance at URA levels. The revisions to the various program regulations made by this rule reflect basic HUD policy. The HUD URA rule at 24 CFR part 42 (now superseded) contained similar policies, as do regulations covering other HUD-assisted programs (e.g., the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) Program regulations at 24 CFR part 570). Minimizing Displacement Because of statutory requirements (not superseded by the URA) governing some of HUD's programs, this rule provides, where necessary, that grantees minimize displacement. See, e.g., 24 CFR 510.52(a). This standard HUD policy urges grantees, consistent with the goals and objectives of the HUD program, to assure that they take reasonable steps to minimize direct and indirect displacement as a result of a project. For example, if feasible, residential occupants of buildings to be rehabilitated must be provided a reasonable opportunity to lease and occupy a suitable, decent, safe, sanitary and affordable dwelling unit in the building/complex following completion of the project. No comparable provision is to be found in the DOT rule. That rule's purpose is to implement the URA. Other Matters Environmental Review At the time of publication of the interim rule, a finding of no significant impact with respect to the environment was made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR part 50 that implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332). The proposed rule is adopted by this final rule without significant change. Accordingly, the initial finding of no significant impact remains applicable, and is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the office of the Rules Docket Clerk at the above address. Regulatory Flexibility Act In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule revises existing regulations to comport with recent legislation that treats individuals and businesses more favorably. Executive Order 12606, The Family The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this rule does not have potential for significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being, and, thus, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule ensures that families that are affected by displacement activity receive adequate assistance with respect to their relocation. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that the policies contained in this rule will not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between them and other levels of government. The rule's major effects are on individuals and businesses. States or their political subdivisions are affected by this rule only to the extent that they act as grantees of Federal funds, disbursing these funds to the ultimate recipients_businesses and individuals. This rule was listed as Item 1535 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20436) pursuant to Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program numbers are 14.134, 14.146, 14.156, 14.219, 14.221, 14.225, and 14.227.
