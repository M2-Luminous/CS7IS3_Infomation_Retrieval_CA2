The agency asked Bunji Nakamura, president of Yamatane Corp., to keep the company's outspoken chairman Seizo Yamazaki from making provocative remarks against Japan's food control system, in which the government keeps a tight grip on production and marketing of rice. The agency made the request on March 16 when it called Nakamura to ask for Yamatane's cooperation in sales of imported rice. The agency denied the accusation, but other reports said that it has asked members of farm ministry panels and food-services industry officials not to criticize the government's policies.
