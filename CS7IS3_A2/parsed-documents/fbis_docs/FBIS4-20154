Fabrizio Ferragni reports from the Quirinale [president's official office and residence]: [Ferragni] Behind me you can see President Scalfaro, who has just emerged. He came here about five minutes ago to say hello to us -- the journalists who have been following the meetings. The president made a short statement. There were no questions. Basically he said that he was the guarantor -- in the last few days the subject of guarantors has been discussed. I will be the guarantor of the Constitution, of the principles of the Constitution, and of the unity of this country, he said. Scalfaro is expected to ask someone to form a government tomorrow morning, and it is almost certain that it will be Silvio Berlusconi.
