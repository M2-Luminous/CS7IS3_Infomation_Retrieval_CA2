James Rowe and those of the late Senator Benigno "Ninoy" Aquino Jr. Biazon pointed out that the two suspected communist hitmen, Juanito Itaas and Donato Continente, who were convicted of the Rowe assassination, and the 28 soldiers serving life terms for the Aquino-Galman double murder can not be covered by the two latest presidential amnesty proclamations. Biazon made his statement yesterday before he joined President Ramos in the state visit to Vietnam. Biazon, chairman of the Senate committee on peace, unification, and reconciliation, classified the convicted Rowe killers and the Aquino assassins as criminals charged with "common" crimes or crimes committed not in furtherance of their political beliefs. "For the common criminals, such as the convicted killers of Aquino and Galman and the convicted killers of Col. James Rowe, the president may consider granting them Executive pardon which does not require a concurrence of Congress for it is a private act of the president," Biazon clarified. Under the country's 1987 Constitution, the grant of amnesty by the president is subject to concurrence of both chambers of Congress. The Congress had earlier concurred with Presidential Proclamations 10 and 10-A that Mr. Ramos issued granting amnesty to all rebels who applied for it on or before 31 December 1992. Biazon started Saturday his committee's public hearings on Presidential Proclamations 347 and 348 that Mr. Ramos issued last week which sought to grant amnesty to all rebels charged with common crimes in pursuit of their political beliefs and agents of state charged with human rights violation in relation to their counter- insurgency operations, respectively. However, the latest round of amnesty grant's was not welcomed by leaders of communist insurgents as well as by military rebels who said they preferred an amnesty grant as a result of their peace negotiations with the government. In the case of Rowe's killers, the U.S. government is against their coverage of the amnesty grant. "The objections of the rebel leaders to the amnesty are irrelevant because they have no right to decide for those who are already out of their control and influence because they have already returned to the folds of the law," Biazon pointed out. Biazon disclosed that about 4,000 of these rebels from both the left and the right have come down from the hills but were forced to return to the underground because they were being charged with common crimes by relatives of their victims. These rebels, he said, failed to avail themselves of the first round of amnesty grants which expired 31 December 1992. Thus, he explained, Presidential Proclamation 347 aims to grant amnesty only to rebel returnees who have already come out and opted to lead a peaceful life but are not covered by Proclamations 10 and 10-A.
