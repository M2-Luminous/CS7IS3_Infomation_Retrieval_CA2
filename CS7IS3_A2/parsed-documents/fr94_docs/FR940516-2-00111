FR940516-2-00111 FR940516-2-00074 [Release No. 34&hyph;34032; International Series Release No. 665; File No. SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;90&hyph;35] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc., Relating to the Listing of Warrants Based on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index May 10, 1994. On December 10, 1990, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PHLX'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to list warrants based on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Index (``FT&hyph;SE 100'' or ``Index''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on January 7, 1991. 3 No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1992). 3 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 28723 (December 28, 1990), 56 FR 543 (January 7, 1991). The Exchange proposes to list index warrants based on the FT&hyph;SE 100, a broad-based, internationally recognized, capitalization-weighted stock index based on the prices of 100 of the most highly capitalized and actively traded stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange (``LSE''). The Commission has previously approved the listing of FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants by other self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''). 4 The PHLX will list FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants consistent with the standards set forth in the FT&hyph;SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders. Specifically, trading in FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants will be subject to Exchange Rule 1026 (Suitability), which applies the options suitability standard to index warrant recommendations made by members and member organizations, and to Exchange Rule 1027 (Discretionary Accounts), which requires that a Senior Registered Options Principal or Registered Options Principal approve and initial any discretionary index warrant transaction on the day it is executed. In addition, Exchange Rule 747 (Approval of Accounts), which requires that member organizations obtain certain approvals prior to making brokerage transactions for customer accounts, shall apply to trading FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants. Finally, the Exchange will also distribute a circular regarding suitability requirements to its membership. 4 See, e.g. , Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 28627 (November 19, 1990), 55 FR 49357 (November 27, 1990) (approval for Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'')); 28106 (June 12, 1990), 55 FR 24955 (June 19, 1990) (approval for Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (``PSE'')) (``FT&hyph;SE Warrant Approval Orders''). Further, consistent with the proposals set forth and approved in the FT&hyph;SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders, FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants may be American-style 5 or European-style, 6 and may have a term of one to five years. Additionally, (1) issuers must exceed the Exchange's financial listing criteria and have assets in excess of $100 million, (2) the warrants must have a minimum public distribution of one million warrants with a minimum of 400 public warrant holders, and (3) the warrants must have an aggregate market value of at least $4 million. 5 American-style warrants may be exercised at any time prior to expiration. 6 European-style warrants may only be exercised during a specified period prior to expiration. The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of section 6(b)(5). 7 Specifically, for the reasons stated in the FT&hyph;SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders, the Commission believes FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants may provide a valuable hedging vehicle for investors, allowing them to hedge against stock market fluctuations in the United Kingdom. 8 Additionally, the Commission notes the PHLX is a member of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'') 9 and that the LSE is an affiliate member of the ISG. As an affiliate member, the LSE has agreed to provide certain information to other ISG members, including the PHLX, upon request. 10 Accordingly, the Commission believes the LSE's affiliate membership in the ISG helps to ensure the effectiveness of an information sharing arrangement that will assist the PHLX in its surveillance of trading in FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants. Finally, the Commission notes that other U.S. SROs have listed FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants pursuant to the FT&hyph;SE 100 Warrant Approval Orders for several years and the Commission is not currently aware of any prior or existing problems regarding the listing and trading of these warrants. Based on the above, the Commission finds that the Exchange's proposal to list FT&hyph;SE 100 warrants as described herein is consistent with just and equitable principles of trade and the protection of investors. 7 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(5) (1988). 8 See supra note 4. 9 The ISG was formed on July 14, 1983 to, among other things coordinate more effectively surveillance and investigative information sharing arrangements in the stock and options markets. See Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, July 14, 1983. The most recent amendment to the ISG Agreement, which incorporates the original agreement and all amendments made thereafter, was signed by ISG members on January 29, 1990. See Second Amendment to the Intermarket Surveillance Group Agreement, January 29, 1990. The current members of the ISG are the American Stock Exchange, Inc.; the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc.; the CBOE; the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; the PSE; and the PHLX. 10 The LSE has agreed to provide certain trading information to members of the ISG, including information relating to: (1) component securities of the Index; and (2) the identity, trading activity, and positions of LSE members or customers of LSE members. Id. It is Therefore ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 11 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;PHLX&hyph;90&hyph;35) is hereby approved. 11 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 12 12 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
