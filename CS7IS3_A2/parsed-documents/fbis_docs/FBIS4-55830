We told him Poland puts the goal of integration with the EU first, but is not neglecting other actions streamlining cooperation, particularly regional cooperation, chiefly with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and the CEFTA [Central European Free Trade Agreement]. We have intensified our work in this sphere. A very important part of the talks concerned the infrastructure in the broad sense, including communications, but also concerning the information infrastructure. These are the areas that will decide the future, on the conditions for the economy and our society's development. This enables us to look with greater faith at Europe's future. [end recording]
