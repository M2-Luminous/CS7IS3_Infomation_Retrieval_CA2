FR940216-0-00124 FR940216-0-00010 The regulations adopted for the reformulated gasoline program follow this same general structure. For example, if the gasoline in a storage tank, or at any other point in the distribution system, is found to be in violation of the requirements, then the following persons are presumed liable: All persons (including carriers) who own, lease, operate, supervise or control the facility; all persons other than carriers who manufactured, sold, transported, or dispensed the gasoline found at the facility; carriers who dispensed, transported, supplied or stored the gasoline where EPA can show they caused the violation; and the refiner or importer whose brand name is displayed at the facility, if any. They will not be deemed liable if they can show (1) they did not cause the violation, (2) that product transfer documents indicate the gasoline in question met all relevant requirements, and (3) they conducted a sufficient quality assurance program. Additional elements must be shown by refiners or importers for violations at branded facilities. The rationale for assigning a presumption of liability to all contributors to a batch of noncomplying fuel is that, as with gasoline volatility and the other motor vehicle fuel programs, EPA is in a particularly poor position to know who caused a violation that is detected at a point in the distribution system. In the case of a violation found at a retail station, for example, the retailer often will say it has no control over the quality of the gasoline delivered by the distributor (or by more than one distributor) and did nothing to cause the violation; the distributor will say it has no control over the quality of the gasoline provided by the terminal and did nothing to cause the violation; the terminal will say it only supplies the gasoline received from the pipeline and did nothing to cause the violation, etc. EPA normally lacks the information necessary to establish the cause of the violation because its inspectors were not present when the gasoline in question moved through the distribution system; yet EPA has a sample that is, in fact, in violation. In contrast to EPA, the parties responsible for the facility, or for supplying the gasoline contained at a facility found to be in violation are, collectively, in the best position to determine the cause of the violation. It is these parties who are presumed liable. The presumption of liability normally has the desired effect of forcing the presumptively liable parties to cooperate in identifying the violation's cause, which both resolves the issue of liability for the party or parties actually responsible for the violation and establishes defenses against liability for parties not responsible. In addition, branded refiners or importers are presumed liable based on the degree of control such refiners or importers have over gasoline that is sold under their brand name. The likelihood of commingling, the absence of quantitative thresholds, the degree of control exercised by the branded parties presumed liable, and the reasonableness of a presumption of liability for parties involved with the production or distribution of the gasoline discovered in violation is the same for the reformulated gasoline program as it is for the gasoline volatility and other motor vehicle fuel programs. In both cases, EPA is confronted with a fungible gasoline distribution system, with various persons either involved with the production or distribution of the noncomplying gasoline, or exercising some degree of control over the downstream facility where the violation was detected. In both cases EPA is not reasonably able to locate the cause of the violation, and the regulations reasonably require the parties involved with the noncomplying gasoline and facility to bear the burden of locating the cause of the violation. EPA has included in the final rule liability for branded importers for violations found at facilities at which that importers' brand name is displayed. This liability is parallel with the liability presumption that attaches to branded refiners for violations found at branded facilities. This change from the proposed liability scheme is included because the absence of liability for branded importers created a potential gap in the regulatory scheme. If any party meets the definition of a branded importer, it is reasonable that they be treated equally with branded refiners. Moreover, EPA does not believe the scope of the liability provisions should be narrowed. The scope of parties presumed liable is designed to ensure that each party in the reformulated gasoline production and distribution system with any opportunity to affect the quality of the fuel may be held accountable for noncomplying fuel. Otherwise, the substantial economic incentives associated with cheating under this program would result in the exploitation of gaps in the scope of coverage. As a result, EPA declines to adjust the range of parties presumptively liable for commingled fuels violations or to adjust the affirmative defenses. Certain commenters requested clarification of the volume of gasoline a party must contribute to a non-complying storage tank to create the presumption of liability. EPA's April 1992 proposal would hold each party responsible for a violation detected at a storage tank, or at any other point in the gasoline distribution system, if the party was involved with any of the noncomplying gasoline. This would include distributors for the most recent delivery, and in most cases would also include distributors for the several prior deliveries. See 57 FR 13471 (April 16, 1992). Commenters requested clarification from EPA as to what was meant by ``several deliveries.'' EPA has retained the proposed language that assigns presumptive liability to any party that contributes ``any gasoline'' to the noncomplying gasoline in the batch or storage tank. There is no single de minimis volume that would be appropriate in every situation. In addition, there is no single number of deliveries that would identify the source for all noncomplying gasoline present in the batch or storage tank yielding the noncomplying sample. EPA will evaluate the issue of non-causation as a result of a small volume contribution to a non-complying storage tank on a case-by-case basis.
