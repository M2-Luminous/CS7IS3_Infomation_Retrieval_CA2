Same sources added that Captain Rodomiro Rada, the San Matias Police chief, informed Santa Cruz department Police Commander Armando Morin Sanchez today that Puchol died on the evening of 10 February at the Monte Florida 14th Infantry barracks, following a beating by a group of military men. Radio Panamericana of La Paz reported that Army Lieutenant Marco Antonio Mejia Alarcon is responsible for Puchol's death. The San Matias Police report states that British subject Douglas James Morrison and some San Matias residents saw Mejia Alarcon brutally beating Puchol on the evening of 10 February. After declaring that he witnessed the brutal beating of Puchol by Mejia Alarcon and other military men, Morrison left San Matias last Thursday, sought protection at the British and Spanish Embassies in La Paz, and his whereabouts are now unknown. Despite the statement by Morrison, Interior Minister German Quiroga, Police Commander General Luis Rocha, and General Reynaldo Caceres--the Army Commander in Chief--emphasized last Friday that there was no evidence that San Matias military men had beaten Puchol and that he died of a cocaine overdose. Puchol, 33, was a Spanish Justice Ministry official who arrived on 10 February in San Matias, in the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz which borders with Brazil. A few days earlier, he made a study of the Xingu Indian tribe in the Brazilian region of Mato Grosso. Interior Ministry sources informed EFE on 16 February that early on February 11, Bolivian military men left Puchol's dead body at a San Matias hospital, explaining that they found it in a vehicle abandoned in a jungle zone.
