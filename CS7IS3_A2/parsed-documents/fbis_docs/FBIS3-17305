Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Thursday, Shumeyko said that Russia had been forming its foreign policy since it had declared sovereignty in June 1990. The process was hampered by political complications within the country, which distracted attention from foreign policy. But Russia has now approached the stage when it should build genuine democracy and a free civil society. The adoption of the Constitution and parliamentary elections have started the process of strengthening Russian statehood. Russia is a powerful, strong and sovereign state which remains open for cooperation, Shumeyko said. Speaking about Russia's accession to the Council of Europe, Shumeyko noted that previously Russia asked for allowing it to join the council on special terms. But now the situation is different. "At the talks in Strasbourg with the Council of Europe leaders several days ago we did not ask for any exceptions for Russia. All admission procedures will be observed and the question of Russia's admittance to the Council of Europe will be included in the agenda by the end of the summer," he said. Much will change in the Council of Europe after Russia joins it, Shumeyko continued. "Without our country it is impossible to solve European problems. It is impossible to do without taking into account Russia's opinion. This particularly concerns changes in Eastern Europe, including the states that have emerged in the former Soviet Union. There are laws by which empires emerge, but there are no laws by which they would disintegrate. Therefore, there are many problems to be discussed at the Council of Europe," Shumeyko said. Asked about President Boris Yeltsin's health, Shumeyko replied that he is in good health, adding that some politicians are trying to destabilise the political situation in the country which has become more stable than a year ago. Commenting on the results of the recent elections to local bodies of power in Russia, Shumeyko said that people did not show up at polling stations because they are tired of politics. However, he stressed that it is not the voters who are to be blamed but politicians who do not offer positive programmes.
