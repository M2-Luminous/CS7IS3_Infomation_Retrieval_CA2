Vavilov; UDC 621.373.826.038] [Abstract] Power lasers with widely variable characteristics have been built to serve as high-energy hyperdirectional radiation sources, as sources of luminous energy to be transmitted over long distances with minimum loss and to be received with subdiffractional precision. One of the largest research stands built at the Institute of Optics during the past 15 years is the 6-channel ``Progress,'' intended for the study of intense radiation and spherical target interaction relating to laser-induced thermonuclear fusion. It includes a Nd-glass master laser emitting pulses of up to 1.5 kJ energy and about 1 ns duration or a power of 3.5 TW in pulses of 0.1 ns duration. It also includes a chirp-pulse generator with a regenerative amplifier and a shaping-pulse generator, both feeding a common preamplifier with two inputs and three outputs. Pulses from one output pass through a compressor to the target inside a spherical chamber. Pulses from the other two outputs pass through a separator to a module which contains: a series of bar and disk amplifiers with successively larger (30 mm to 110 mm) apertures with vacuum-type spatial filters separating the amplifiers and preventing self-action, electrooptical deflectors, electrooptical (Pockels) shutters and magnetooptical (Faraday) shutters decoupling the laser from targets, and harmonic filters. From here pulses proceed along six channels to six targets. Some pulses are deflected through an amplifier with a 140 mm aperture to two detectors with 150 mm and 250 mm apertures respectively. Some pulses are diverted to another compressor. This stand was used in experiments with pulse compression during stimulated Mandelshtam-Brillouin scattering. For generating and amplifying ultrashort chirp pulses of only 1 mJ energy and 0.2-1.0 ns within a 2-4 nm spectral, a very inefficient Nd-glass laser is replaced with a mode-locked YAG:Nd[.sup]+3[/] laser emitting continuous sequences of pulses of 50 ps duration at a repetition rate of 100 MHz within a 0.2 nm wide spectral band. Chirp pulses of 0.15-0.6 ns duration are formed in single-mode fiber optics, where phase modulation and group velocity dispersion broaden the spectrum and elongate a pulse. Additional elongation of a pulse takes place in a lattice-type stretcher. Extraction of a pulse is effected by the electrooptical shutters, which are controlled by photoelectric switches. The regenerative amplifier then puts out a pulse of about 1 mJ energy, sufficient for transmission to the main amplifier channel with a 110 mm exit aperture. A second large research stand is the ``LAS'', which includes an Nd-glass laser with phase conjugation and a 110 mm output aperture. It emits pulses of up to 500 J and 25 ns duration in a beam with a divergence angle of 5 ï¿½rad so that the axial radiation intensity reaches 80 aW/cm[.sup]2[/]. A third large research stand is the ``Chibis'', which includes a CO[.sub]2[/]-laser operation in the pulse-repetition mode. Experiments with this apparatus have demonstrated the feasibility of a focusing-deflecting system which uses large compound mirrors and of compensating its aberrations by means of phase conjugation.
