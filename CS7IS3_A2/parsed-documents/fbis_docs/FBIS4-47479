This laser, inside a 144 cm long chamber with a 22x22 cm[.sup]2[/] large square cross-section and a 18x20 cm[.sup]2[/] wide aperture, is pulse- pumped by two relativistic electron beams entering laterally from opposite sides through vacuum-sealed windows made of 20 ï¿½m thick titanium foil, which separates the gaseous working medium inside from the beam accelerating vacuum diodes outside. The high-voltage beam accelerators consist each of four duplex shaping lines on deionized water which are electrically charged by a generator of voltage pulses. A pair of solenoids produces a pulsed magnetic field of about 1 kG intensity parallel to the counterpropagating electron beams which stabilizes the beams and minimizes diffusion of electrons from the active medium. This arrangement makes it feasible to form electron beams 12x100 cm[.sup]2[/] in cross-section carrying a uniformly distributed current of 60 kA behind the windows and delivering it in square pulses of 100 ns duration. The accelerating voltage is regulated by varying either the voltage of pulse generator or the geometry of interelectode gap in the vacuum diodes. The experimental apparatus includes a graphite calorimeter measuring the energy of both electron beams at the entrance to the laser chamber and a DMI-1 magnetic inductive instrument recording the pressure pulses in the active medium through an 8ANCh-23 strain-gage transducer on an S8-14 oscillograph, the time constant of this set being 0.3 ms and thus much shorter than the about 200 ms long pressure transient inside the laser chamber. Tests were performed with Ar*[.sub]2[/] and Kr*[.sub]2[/] molecules, 0.1-0.6% CO[.sub]2[/] being added for effective quenching of the excitation states. The theoretical model of electron transfer in the one-particle approximation disregards collective effects and plasma instabilities, all being negligible under conditions of the experiment. Only pairwise collisions of electrons with atoms of the noble gas are thus assumed to take places during electron beam and active medium interaction, in the course of which either the atoms become ionized (excited) by the electrons or electrons are being scattered by the atoms. Radiation losses attending elastic scattering are in this case also negligible. Analysis of this process requires calculating the trajectories of individual electrons between successive collisions with atoms by solving the equations of motion dP/dt = e[vB] and dS/dt = v (momentum P= m[.sub]e[/]v/[1- (v/c)[.sup]2[/]][.sup]1/2[/], S- distance traveled by electron, e- electron charge, B- magnetic induction, m[.sub]e[/]- electron mass, v- velocity of electron, c- speed of light, t- time). This system of equations has been solved numerically by the universally applicable and most precise of all Monte Carlo method. The results of the experiment and of the numerical simulation indicate the optimum conditions for pumping an energy of as much as 2.1 kJ and correspondingly a power of about 0.8 MW/cm[.sup]3[/] density into a ``Garpun'' Ar-laser with an about 60% efficiency, with the energy distribution over the aperture deviating less than 20% from a uniform one and the overall pump efficiency reaching about 16%.
