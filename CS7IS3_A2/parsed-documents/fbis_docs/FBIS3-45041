Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said yesterday that China wanted to issue the SAR passports before the 1997 change-over. "To achieve this, we need the co-operation of the British side in supplying information, and we are prepared to discuss this with them," said Mr Lu, shortly after expressing pessimism about Sino- British co-operation following the breakdown of talks on Hong Kong's political reforms. Although Article 154 of the Basic Law restricts the issuing of the SAR passports to after the change-over, Mr Lu said the Chinese Government hoped the documents could be handed over to people before July 1, 1997. He said SAR residents could still use documents such as the Certificate of Identity for travelling after 1997, although that did not reflect their nationality. "It would not be appropriate if one could not hold a document indicating one's nationality in the SAR under the Chinese Government," he said. The subject has been discussed by the social and security panel of the Preliminary Working Committee and Mr Lu said one way to prevent contravening the Basic Law would be for the passports to be officially chopped for use only after July 1, 1997. He refused to go into details of the design, but said the passport would have a bauhinia on the cover. The senior official also gave another assurance that Hong Kong people with a second passport would be able to retain the right of abode in the territory.
