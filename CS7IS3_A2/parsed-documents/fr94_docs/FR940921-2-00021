In its order, the Commission directed that the supplemental filing should show the Southern Fixed Charge account balances and include tariff revisions required to balance any outstanding customer fixed charge account totals. FGT states the instant filing is being made in compliance with the May 18 Order. FGT requests waiver of the provision of Section 25C of its GTC regarding the carrying charge calculation to permit FGT to waive carrying charges on amounts owed FGT between June 1, 1994 and November 1, 1994. FGT also requests waiver of the provision of Section 25C of its GTC which requires that refunds be made within 90 days of the end of the Annual Recovery Period. FGT requests that it not be required to make refunds pending Commission approval of the instant filing. FGT proposes that any refunds due hereunder be made within thirty days of a final Commission Order accepting this filing with carrying charges on such refunds calculated through the refund date. FGT requests that the Commission waive any other parts of its Regulations or provisions of FGT's tariff as may be required to allow the instant filing to become effective as proposed. Any persons desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations.
