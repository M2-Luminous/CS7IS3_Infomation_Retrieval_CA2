FR940722-1-00023 FR940722-1-00008 EPA will consider all public comments on its tentative determination received during the public comment period. Issues raised by those comments may be the basis for a decision to deny final approval to South Dakota. EPA expects to make a final decision on whether or not to approve South Dakota's program by October 20, 1994 and will give notice of it in the Federal Register . At this time, EPA and the State will enter into a memorandum of agreement to set forth the manner in which the State and EPA will coordinate the State's administration of the State program. The notice will include a summary of the reasons for the final determination and a response to all major comments. Compliance With Executive Order 12866 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Section 6 of Executive Order 12866. Certification Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that this approval will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The approval effectively suspends the applicability of certain Federal regulations in favor of South Dakota's program, thereby eliminating duplicative requirements for owners and operators of underground storage tanks in the State. It does not impose any new burdens on small entities. This rule, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis. List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 281 Environmental protection, Administrative practice and procedure, Hazardous materials, State program approval, and Underground storage tanks. Authority: This notice is issued under the authority of Section 9004 of the Solid Waste Disposal Act as amended 42 U.S.C. 6991c. Dated: July 5, 1994. Jack W. McGraw, Acting Regional Administrator.
