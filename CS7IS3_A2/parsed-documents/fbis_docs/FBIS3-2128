So he proposed giving at least $7 billion of it back. For the first time the Government revealed its forecast for the amount of cash that would be in the funds after handover in 1997, and the $269 billion available to the Special Administrative Region (SAR) government by March 1998 showed it could afford to be generous. Tax bills are to be slashed by $3.2 billion and almost half a million people will join those who pay none at all, companies will be left with more of their profits, the cost of buying a home will be shaved and welfare spending will be raised. Sir Hamish said there were four major challenges facing Hong Kong which must be remedied: inflation, the improvement of rail, road and air links, traffic congestion and the provision of financial security for the greying population. The overall theme was "Managing Prosperity" and was the sort of budget finance ministers around the world dream of. It was, said Sir Hamish after delivering his speech to the Legislative Council, a "pretty historic Budget" and almost certainly contained a record amount of concessions on salaries tax. The number of individuals who will not be paying income tax will jump from an already high 43 percent to 58 percent, described by Sir Hamish as "a fantastic difference". The measures take 420,000 people out of the tax net altogether and a further 1.13 million will find themselves paying lower taxes from this year. Huge increases in family allowances, including the introduction of a new one for taxpayers caring for a grandparent, meant that the very important middle and upper income groups -- and almost every civil servant -- will benefit. One of the big surprises of the Budget was cutting profits tax from 17.5 percent to 16.5 percent. This will leave Hong Kong companies with an extra $1.6 billion to invest in 1994/95, and will reduce their tax bills by more than $10 billion up to 1997. At the same time, Sir Hamish is planning to raise the cost of welfare spending, with funds being allocated to the elderly, disabled, sick and disadvantaged, with more places for nurseries and creches for children. Despite the growing fears about the rise in residential property prices -- which Sir Hamish shares -- the Government has decided that it can afford to reduce stamp duty on property transactions. Like many other proposals in the Budget, this is aimed particularly at the sandwich class and the reductions will apply only to properties priced at under $3 million. He said the Government believed that the cumulative effect of stamp duty on speculators who bought and sold flats several times before an end-user actually moved in would be a deterrent. Even visitors will benefit from the proposed measures. After listening to the recommendations of the tourist industry, the Government is to reduce the much disliked airport departure tax from $150 to $50. There was very little sour among the sweet -- even the usual step of raising taxes on the good things in life was resisted. There will be no rise in duty on tobacco, the incomprehensible system of charging duty on alcohol content will be simplified, to the benefit of the low end products in the market, and the tax on fuel will go up by only 8.5 percent, to reflect inflation. To placate the anti- smoking lobby, the Government is to donate an extra $7.5 million to the Council on Smoking and Health for anti-smoking campaigns, on top of the $4.1 million they already receive every year. If it looked a little over-generous Sir Hamish believed that Hong Kong could afford it, safe in the knowledge that the projection of future revenues and surpluses in the government finances meant that it would be comfortably, even luxuriously, within its targets for handing over a properly financed territory to the SAR in 1997. In his medium range forecast, Sir Hamish revealed that by March 1998, the outgoing government would have built up reserves of $268.9 billion. This compares with the $25 billion which the Government has committed to set aside for the SAR government, plus a further $7 billion in respect of civil service pensions. After last year's 5.5 percent increase in gross domestic product the sum total of goods and services purchased in the territory -- Sir Hamish is predicting that the economy will grow by the same amount this year. But the flip side of the growth coin remains inflation, and on this, yesterday's news was not so good for another year of rising prices is forecast, with no cut from last year's rate of 8.5 percent. He is also planning major overhaul of the companies ordinance, in what one official described as "root and branch" tidying up of the piecemeal legislation which has come on the statue books over the years.
