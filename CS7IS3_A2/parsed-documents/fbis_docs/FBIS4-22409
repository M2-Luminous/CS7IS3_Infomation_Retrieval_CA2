Even though the minister immediately joined in the events of Boris Yeltsin's official visit, the extreme importance of the issue made this interview essential. [Question] Batono [polite form of address for males] Minister, what was the specific purpose of the Georgian delegation's visit to the United States, and what difficulties did you have to overcome to accomplish it? [Chikvaidze] You will recall that on 1 February the mandate of the UN observer mission in Abkhazia was running out, and so the basic task was to extend it, which would necessitate further participation by UN and international institutions, without which any implementation of peace-keeping operations would be ruled out. [Original text missing or illegible except for phrase fragments] ...the Abkhazian side... an attempt to settle outsiders, which will make it easier for them to excuse their crime by a future referendum. Dismissing the [?agreements] reached earlier concerning the repatriation of the refugees, the separatists again imposed several preconditions. As a result, any practical results from the latest Moscow meeting became doubtful. It was essential, therefore, once more to gain the international community's recognition of the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders and, along with raising the question of the safe and unconditional repatriaion of the refugees,... ...the results of a referendum. [Many of the following lines are illegible except for phrase fragments] Immediately on arriving in America we met UN General Secretary Butrus Butrus-Ghali, the UN's Political Department leaders, members of the Security Council, and member country representatives. Our comments were taken into account in jointly formulating a draft resolution. Despite international support for Georgia (a "Friends of Georgia" group has been formed, consisting of the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, and Russia), all this was no easy task. According to the UN's own procedures, it takes at least 24 hours to make amendments to resolutions, and within that time every representative of the Security Council has to contact his country's capital, define its position and receive the necessary instructions, after which consultations are held and only then can the resolution be adopted. But time was too precious... We got the information about the Moscow meeting from Tbilisi on the evening of 30 January, but the session of the Security Council was scheduled for 31 January, and it was necessary to prepare a practically new draft of the resolution that had already been agreed on. Victory was won by our permanent mission to the UN, and all its members, under the leadership of Petre Chkheidze. We worked 24 hours, using everything we could--old and new paths and personal contacts. Fortunately, we achieved what we wanted and needed. [Question] Batono Aleksandre, what about the resolution specifically? [Chikvaidze] I would single out several important items in the resolution, in particular the UN observers' mission and peace-keeping forces, Georgia's territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders, and the refugees. The resolution expands the mandate of the UN observers' mission and extends it until 7 March 1994. In addition, the number of observers is increased to 88. And, after the third round of talks planned for 22 February, the General Secretary, on instructions of the Security Council, is to immediately present information on the circumstances which necessitate the deployment of peace-keeping forces in the conflict zone, along with an appropriate, concrete plan. But the picture will be incomplete unless one very important reality is taken into account. You know that the Georgian delegation, headed by Batoni Jaba Ioseliani, has already had successful talks with the Abkhazian side in Geneva on two occasions. The fact is that the groundwork has been laid for new and qualitatively different principles. Nevertheless, new and, for us, undesirable tendencies emerged from the Abkhazian side, which, from the standpoint of political logic, could have a negative impact on further developments. From this standpoint, the UN's resolution is very timely. During our head of state's visit to Paris, Batoni Eduard Shevardnadze met with the UN General Secretary, and their two-hour talk became the political litmus test which clearly brought out the further political tendency of the specific situation and, in principle, brought about the passage of the UN's resolution at the time we most needed it. This meeting played a decisive role in turning events to our advantage. The rest, as they say, was strictly a technicality. It was necessary to get the Security Council members effectively to see our side of the problem. Fortunately, the expected result was not slow in coming. Mr Butrus Butrus-Ghali already has two plans, which have been examined together with the Friends of Georgia group, with the participation of Mr Eduard Bruner [name transliterated], the General Secretary's personal representative. The first plan calls for the UN's traditional peace-keeping operation--2,500 Blue Helmets under its command will be sent first to Gali, in the vicinity of the Enguri and the Psou rivers and later to other areas, with a specific mission: to keep the two sides separate, to disarm illegal military formations, and, mainly, to work out firm guarantees of safety for the unconditional repatriation of refugees. The second plan has the same tasks in mind, with the difference that peace-keeping functions will be carried out by armed forces of the countries concerned, while monitoring and control will be provided by the UN observers mission, now increased to 200 men. Of course, it is impossible to make these two plans a reality at one stroke. Activating the peace-keeping forces is a very complex process. Preparations for it will take at least six months, a time in which a concrete plan will have to be worked out as to which country will take part in implementing the peace-keeping operations, and in what numbers. Technical questions will have to be decided, and there is the finance problem, and the various countries' willingness and readiness to activate their troops under UN auspices. During our UN meetings, opinions and advice were voiced to the effect that the correct thing at first would be to introduce Russian troops into the conflict zone on the basis of a bilateral agreement. Later on, those troops would be joined by troops from other countries. The UN is looking very closely at Russia's participation in the peace-keeping forces. Russian representative Mr Vorontsov stated directly at a Security Council meeting that it would be unacceptable to change borders by means of armed confrontation, but as for a possible referendum and its results, there can be talk of that only after the refugees are repatriated and the original character of the population has been restored. [Question] Batono Minister, that kind of attention on the part of the UN is not a new thing to Georgians. There is probably no precedent for passing so many resolutions concerning one country. Can you say something about the possible practical results of this? [Chikvaidze] Looking at things realistically, today's political reality, the solution to any question requires a political basis, and this resolution does lay that foundation. After the passage of the resolution, preparations for bringing in the peace-keeping forces should begin. Emphasis is again placed on Georgia's territorial integrity--at a time when the Gudauta gang is planning to hold a referendum. It was emphasized that it will be possible to determine Abkhazia's political status only if the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Georgia is respected. For the first time, the resolution has noted and, more important, singled out, our most painful problem--the refugees. Article 11 and Article 12 recognize every refugee's right to a safe return home without any preconditions whatever. The two sides must comply with the pledges they have made and a schedule of repatriation must be drawn up immediately. The resolution denounces the attempts to change the demographic picture, including the illegal settling of foreigners since the conflict. From the political standpoint, these two articles are a great balm to our pain and problems. In short, the mission was accomplished. [Question] What was the chronology of events? [Chikvaidze] The Security Council meeting started at 4:30 pm on 31 January. Georgia's representative to the UN, Petre Chkheidze, spoke. He stated repeatedly that the refugees' immediate and unconditional repatriation to their homeland must be the cornerstone of any political solution to the conflict, while any delay could bring about new tragedies and explosions. He was followed by Mr Yuliy Vorontsov, who affirmed guarantees of the principle of Georgia's territorial integrity and the inviolability of its borders. Great Britain's representative Sir David Henney [name transliterated] made an extraordinary statement in which the swift and unconditional repatriation of the refugees, and cooperation on this matter, was deemed to be a task of top priority to resolve the conflict, a touchstone of the Abkhazians' good will, and an essential precondition of prospects for achieving broad agreement on political problems. The U.S. representative, Ms Madeleine Albright, said: "My government will not support and is categorically against any half-way measures, for that would mean avoiding our obligations toward the refugees." The U.S. representative's statement, which is not empty words but represents the American government's official position, once more affirms that the international community will categorically reject any precedent of border revision. The same mood dominated most of the speeches. This itself makes it clear that the separatists' aims are doomed from the start. Abkhazia's attempt to change the demographic situation was denounced by the French and Spanish representatives, Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee and Juan Antonio Yanez-Barnuevo. The chairman of the meeting, Czech representative Karel Kovanda, denounced the ethnic cleansing launched against the Georgians by the Abkhazians, cast doubt on any referendum initiated by that side (which constitutes a minority in the region), and once again emphasized the supremacy of the principle of Georgia's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The resolution was passed unanimously. And so, the world's attitude toward the Abkhazian conflict has been affirmed once more, and it ought to make the Gudauta gang think. Moreover, the Russian Federation's position is also very important; the fact is that the palette of specific political realities linked to the Abkhazian problem is being filled with new, positive colors, in particular from the standpoint of the Russian Federation's attitudes. Incidentally, light was shed on many things by Boris Yeltsin's official visit to the Republic of Georgia. Most important, it brought out a tendency that is very favorable to us: I refer to the unity of the two countries' views, both with respect to global issues and specifically the Abkhazian conflict. It is obvious to the naked eye, nevertheless, that a political settlement and ultimate peace will not be an easy process. A great deal depends on further events and the talks that have begun in Geneva. The main thing is, however, that we are on the right path. The Russian Federation's interest in a unified, undivided Georgia is becoming increasingly apparent. And so, everything depends on our taking the correct political steps.
