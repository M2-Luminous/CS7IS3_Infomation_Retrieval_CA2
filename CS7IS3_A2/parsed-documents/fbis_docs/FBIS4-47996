Speaking at Ulundi, Dr. Buthelezi said there needed to be a constructive relationship between provincial and central government. His remarks are seen by observers as dispelling fears that he would not take part in the government of national unity, in which it is now speculated that he may occupy one of three IFP cabinet posts. Dr. Buthelezi said he accepted the elections to have been sufficiently fair and free, and he commended Mr. Nelson Mandela and Mr. F. W. de Klerk for their efforts to establish democracy in South Africa.
