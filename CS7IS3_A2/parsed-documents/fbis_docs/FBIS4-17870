According to Guliyev, the historical task of statesmen consists in preserving these traditions. He called on the Russian legislators to do their best to make friendship and mutual understanding a leit-motiv of future relations between the two countries. Azerbaijan takes on an important task of establishing friendly, balanced relations with the rest of the world and with Russia in the first place, he said. "In this respect, our general position consists in attaching an irreversible character to the positive development of the interstate relations; that is, these relations should not depend on momentary, time-serving considerations and move onward," the Azerbaijani parliament speaker said. Azerbaijan pays special attention to forming a legal basis of interstate relations, involving various fields. The supreme law-making bodies are playing a leading part in forming such a legal basis and in this connection he expressed hope that Russian and Azerbaijani parliaments would do their best to put the bilateral relations on this authoritative basis, Guliyev said. Guliyev described current situation in Azerbaijan as complex, characterized by a drop in production, destroyed economic ties, weakness of the financial system and other acute consequences of economic crisis. "One might try to get out of the tight spot on one's own, but one would have to pay an exorbitant price for such an attempt," he remarked. In his opinion, therefore, it would be reasonable for Russia and Azerbaijan to join efforts for the purpose of exchanging help and support. Azerbaijan attaches "great importance to Russian experience in implementing large-scale economic reforms, to cooperation in the field of safeguarding human rights and creating new state structuring", he emphasized. Guliyev also spoke at length about Armeno-Azerbaijani conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh. In his opinion, the most important thing now is to stop the bloodshed, to put an end to the war because this will meet the vital interests of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
