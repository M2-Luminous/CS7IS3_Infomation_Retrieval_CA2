To meet the requirements of the new development stage and the renovation, it is essential for us to formulate a general plan to more vigorously accelerate economic reform, while striving to improve the state management mechanism, especially national administration. Given the tasks that have been and are being done, and on the basis of the government's 1994 program of action, we must concentrate efforts to carry out the following tasks to accelerate our economic and administrative reform: A. Formulate a plan to fundamentally reform our financial and banking system. Regarding the financial sector, we must establish and apply the new accounting system to suit the market economy within this year, while accurately presenting our assets and business activities. We must make greater efforts to ensure that our accounting system is a reliable inspection tool of our state and society, while we strive to develop our auditing system. Efforts must be made to complete draft laws and other inventories to systematize various principles concerning the establishment, examination, scrutiny, and approval of the state budget. We must delegate authority in the allocation of the state budget and set up a machinery to supervise, inspect, and control it. It is essential to carry out the program to study and fundamentally reform the tax collection system to suit the new stage of economic reform. We must build a new mechanism to manage assets at various enterprises. We must formulate a plan to continue reforming the banking sector and fully establish and delegate authority in implementing a two-level banking system, namely state banking and commercial banking. Efforts must be made to gradually establish the money market by using various essential apparatuses to regulate the circulation of money, while ensuring suitable bank interest rates for the market economy. We must strive to ensure fair foreign exchange rates, develop the management of foreign currencies, and create a competitive atmosphere to enhance the efficiency of banking services. We must also strive to diversify the forms of debt by using the most modern methods, while ensuring that the bank functions as a reliable debt settlement center. Plans for the above tasks are being formulated by the agencies concerned. These plans are expected to be completed this year and efforts will be made to amend and supplement them during their implementation. B. We must continue to rearrange, improve, and enhance the efficiency of state enterprises and shift them into the business environment of the market economy. State enterprises, in making profits in the market system, should strive to meet public demands, while competing with other economic establishments in a healthy manner. These enterprises should set up a separate state management mechanism to strengthen their operations. We must issue guidance and implementation documents on these tasks by this year. We must also strive to complete the second phase of our debt settlement by this year, while continuing to deal with enterprises that are still operating at a loss. We must accelerate the application of the new accounting system in close association with the effort to improve the financial system of enterprises to enable them to take real responsibility in managing financial matters within the framework of the law. We must strive to limit the business monopoly of state enterprises, while creating conditions for healthy competition. We must improve the communications and transport network further this year. For a number of enterprises that still need to operate in a monopoly, the state should set up a separate management mechanism to control them. The above measures and the efforts to carry out the financial and banking reform will create conditions for each enterprise to effectively renovate itself, while taking appropriate actions to compete with other establishments in the market. The market economic system will help determine the efficiency of enterprises, accelerate and develop various forms of cooperation, promote the spirit of self-reliance, and create conditions for the setting up of major business corporations. In this context, it will gradually help to improve and fundamentally strengthen various state enterprises, promote the share-holding system, and clearly define direct ownership of public assets at state enterprises. It will also help form a new management mechanism to replace the old administrative management system at enterprises. From this juncture, we will be able to establish a state business bloc comprising various major business corporations to effectively carry out business activities and truly develop the autonomy of the market system. The state should formulate a legal framework to guide and support the implementation of this process to help it develop along the socialist orientation and in conformity with the law of the market. The efforts to carry out pilot projects in the implementation of state policies to promote the share-holding system and to eliminate the state managing system at enterprises are aimed at drawing experiences from realities to correctly apply them in the market economy. C. While carrying out the abovementioned two tasks, we will, at the same time integrate the economic reform with that of the administration. Administration reform, however, requires greater efforts because it is closely related to the renovation of the political system. Moreover, many major and fundamental issues in the administrative reform stem from the process of building a law-governed state of Vietnam which we are studying its contents for submission to the next party Central Committee plenum to be convened at the end of this year [time as heard]. It is imperative for us to resolve now a number of pressing issues, to create conditions for developing the relationship between organizations and state agencies, and to enhance the efficiency of our administrative system. Efforts must be made to improve administrative procedures to eliminate inconveniences experienced by the people and businessmen. The recent government's resolution on this issue has been warmly welcomed by the people. Various ministries, government agencies, and people's committees of provinces and cities are dutybound to implement this resolution. Heads of responsible agencies must control and closely supervise the implementation of this resolution to affect real changes. Criticism by the press, pressure by public opinion, and action by the people aimed at improving administrative procedures and inspecting work of state agencies and personnel are significant factors that will help accelerate administrative reform. At present, the government is making great efforts to formulate regulations on civil servants, conduct a study on public service system, and make preparations to set up a financial-administrative agency. The government will complete within this year the draft documents for these tasks to solicit ideas from various sectors before promulgation. There are still many issues to be resolved regarding the relationship between the central and local agencies in a uniform administrative system. Significant parts of these issues have been raised in the draft law on the people's councils and people's committees, the draft law on state budget, and the law on authority to promulgate legal documents. These issues cannot be resolved separately, but rather they must be settled on the basis of the general lines and policies on building a law-governed state. The most pressing tasks at present are to restore disciplines in the administrative system and resolutely deal with agencies that deliberately ignore the decisions and directives of the government and the higher administration echelons. Chiefs of the the higher administrative agencies must strive to supervise and control the implementation of key decisions, promptly commend outstanding officials, and quickly deal with cadres who violate rules and regulations. Dear National Assembly deputies, implementing the 1994 tasks during the past almost six months, we have found that we now have numerous opportunities to advance forward while facing some ordeals. This condition will pave the way for our nation to enter the new stage of development. Thanks to the fine development of the socioeconomic situation, our people's material and spiritual life has been further improved and social activities enhanced. This has been symbolized by the creativity and efficiency of various enterprises and businessmen, families in the delta and mountain regions, and people in the countryside. These sources of strength and intelligence can be exploited more vigorously through the continuation of the renovation process, especially in the efforts to accelerate economic reform in close association with the administrative reform. This will also serve as a basis for effective competition with and exploitation of foreign resources. In the new situation, the implementation of the policy on strengthening great national unity has reached a new peak in anticipation of the upcoming congress of the Vietnam Fatherland Front. We must strive to bring into full play all capabilities and efforts by Vietnamese at home and abroad for the great cause of the nation. This will undoubtedly open up a new prospect for attaining the objectives of making our people prosperous, our nation powerful, and our society just and civilized. In this spirit, the government, the National Assembly, the Vietnam Fatherland Front, and other mass organizations, in their respective role and duty will strive to organize, motivate, lead, and assist the people to make greater efforts to fulfill the 1994 tasks set by the National Assembly's resolutions, thereby satisfactorily creating a firm foundation for effective implementation of other tasks in 1995 and the ensuing years.
