Deputies and Ministers Plan Social Policy for This Year"] [Text] This term has been encountered so often in the political rhetoric of recent months that it has come to resemble an incantation, but we should not be surprised. Given that, according to sociological polls, "Reforms for the sake of people, not at the expense of people" is now one of the most popular slogans, the social dimension of every step taken by the government is becoming particularly significant. Deputies from the Federation Council Social Policy Committee together with Vice Premier Yuriy Yarov and the leaders of a number of ministries and departments recently discussed the draft basic guidelines for social policy in 1994. Committee Chairman Galina Karelova describes the details in conversation with a ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI correspondent. [Karkhanin] Galina Nikolayevna, it is no secret that there were many such drafts in earlier years too, but they usually remained only on paper. Does the present document contain any fundamental differences from its predecessors capable of providing hope that it will be implemented nevertheless? [Karelova] The similar drafts that emerged in past years represented a mechanical summation of uncoordinated "sectoral" programs, which were very difficult to harmonize. But the present draft is precisely a package of measures. An attempt has been made to create an integrated document possessing integrity and a single linchpin. Obviously, the attempt has not been a total success, but Yuriy Fedorovich Yarov and his "team" have done a very great deal of work. As we completed the preparation of our legislative program, we deputies needed to correlate our approaches with the government's and to agree on timetables so that the draft laws on social policy that Russians are so keenly awaiting could be more swiftly approved by the Federal Assembly. Moreover, we and the representatives of the government, endeavored to coordinate our actions connected with the budget. It is clear that the fine words about the priority of the social sphere pronounced from lofty rostrums are no impediment to continued funding of this sphere on the basis of the notorious leftover principle.... Our deputies particularly noted a fundamentally important point: A system of state social guarantees expressing in figures what the minimum needs of each Russian citizen cost has still not been formulated. I believe that this system has not been formulated precisely because at present, it is impossible to provide the money for it, since the state has almost none. But then, in my view, people should be openly and directly told what percentage of their needs we can provide for. Until recently, I worked in Sverdlovsk Oblast, and I know that the regions are keenly awaiting a law on the minimum consumer budget, which will make it possible at long last to determine who should be categorized as belonging to low-income groups. At present, anybody can categorize themselves as such. There is no officially approved criterion.... Incidentally, it will also be useful for enterprises to have a guideline as to what minimum wage they should provide for their workers. [Karkhanin] So far we have been talking about approaches, about the general nature of the draft basic guidelines. Could you cite a few sections to show what it is like? [Karelova] One of the most important sections is the one about policy in the sphere of labor relations. New forms of ownership have emerged, and hired workers often feel that they have no rights now that the code of labor laws effectively does not operate. So the document touches on questions of remuneration and insurance. The government has prepared a number of draft laws about the rights of employers and hired workers. Moreover, a federal employment program has been submitted to us -- this touches not only on the problem of the unemployed, but also on the problems of support for small and medium enterprises via the territories. Tremendous preparatory work has been carried out here, and the regions in primary need of assistance have been identified. [Karkhanin] You mentioned the government's lawmaking activity, although this role used usually to belong to parliament.... [Karelova, interrupting] We are not abandoning lawmaking, of course, but in my view the government's activeness is only to be welcomed. I already have in hand around 20 draft laws relating to labor relations, employment, migration, and the environment prepared by the government. I think it is important for normative documents, especially those relating to problems of social protection, to be prepared by those who will have to fulfill them. Having said that, there is a need for control. You cannot allow standards to be artificially lowered in the interests of irresponsibility. I know that many organizations, both state and public, took part in preparing these draft laws, and we are prepared to accept the documents that were discussed as the basis for work. Separate chapters in the draft basic guidelines relate to migration policy and social support for those who are unable to work and low-income groups. Incidentally, our parliamentary committee will soon receive from the government a blueprint for pension reform, and the draft law on nonstate pension funds will clearly be discussed by Federal Assembly deputies as early as April. Furthermore, under the present system there are 14 types of benefits for families with children, and there is a confusing situation which people find it hard to understand. So the government is proposing to introduce a clear unified system that everyone can understand. We support this stance. There is also the idea of restructuring the obsolete and cumbersome system for collecting alimony, which has meant unnecessary and often futile hassle both for the militia and mothers. Together with the State Duma deputies' commissions, we intend to work on a plan whereby the rights of the child will be protected by the state, to ensure that alimony is paid from the state budget regardless of whether the errant father who left the family without a livelihood has been found. [Karkhanin] Nevertheless, the most burning question for most people today is the income of family budgets. If it proves possible to implement the draft basic guidelines, how will this affect people's lives? [Karelova] The most important point is that their social rights, including with regard to remuneration, will be better protected. We will shortly begin to examine a new labor code which specially notes that delays in paying wages are impermissible. Various forms of payment were mentioned in the debates that our deputies had with Labor Minister Gennadiy Melikyan. If there is no cash, credit cards or promissory notes can be used. The banks have a whole system for noncash payments, and better use must be made of these. Unemployed people are appearing and the problem of employment is emerging, and it by no means always has to be solved by finding someone a new job. For instance, back home in Sverdlovsk Oblast the "Uralobuv" [footwear] enterprise closed, although its products were cheap and convenient and were snapped up for children and pensioners. So for socially important enterprises that find themselves in difficult economic conditions, there must be material support from an employment fund in order to preserve these jobs. For this reason, the federal employment program includes a number of sections aimed at supporting not only those who have already lost their jobs but also those who are employed in small and medium enterprises, especially those producing consumer goods. These mainly employ women and young people -- the social groups who make up around 70 percent of the unemployed. According to the draft state budget, it is planned to appropriate around 12 trillion rubles [R] for social purposes -- this is approximately the same level as last year. We believe that this sum must be increased -- I am talking about the regions that suffered as a result of the Chernobyl disaster and the environmental disaster zones with equivalent status -- Kamensk-Uralskiy, Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk Oblasts, Altay Kray. Even if expenditure is kept at last year's level, the sum of R3.8 trillion is needed, but only half of that sum has been agreed, so we are asking the government to fund the aforementioned regions at least at the level of 1993. Clearly, increasing expenditure means increasing the budget deficit, but our committees and the Duma committees still intend to make an in-depth examination of a number of issues and identify where savings can be made. But I think it would be immoral to making savings out of the calamity that befell the victims of Chernobyl. [Karkhanin] Incidentally, how did the debates with government representatives go at the enlarged sitting of your committee? What was the atmosphere like? [Karelova] Each minister spoke about his sector's problems. This is the information we badly need. We received all the necessary documents. The debate was very amicable, and we remain inclined toward businesslike cooperation. Obviously, the draft basic guidelines along with our comments will be approved in the government in the very near future. Our comments mostly boiled down to saying that insufficient account was taken of the regional aspect. We Federation Council deputies have worked in the regions and we know that the state gets 80 percent of its funds from the provinces. So why does Moscow dictate to the local authorities how to spend them? This does not allow the oblasts to solve social questions in an effective manner. Although the local authorities must become a real player in social policy. Moreover, the draft has virtually not been agreed with nonstate players in social policy. They too should have been made into allies. One final point -- the programs on most topics are integrated only in terms of their elements. However, this is natural: Ministries have always been isolated from each other. So it is one of our main tasks to unite. Our deputies' committee is already setting up an interdepartmental expert commission that will prepare draft normative acts. So we are already taking the first steps.
