The government should "drastically" expand budgetary appropriations for reinforcing Japan's overall technological foundation in line with the guideline, a MITI official told a press conference. The official said the level of a country's techno- infrastructure can be enhanced by improvements in various factors, such as human resources, information, facility construction, fund raising, protection of intellectual property rights and the deregulation of research activity. Japan's technological standards should be raised through active research activity, not only by specialized organs like MITI institutes but also by private-sector research entities, the official said. The public sector should devote itself to improving the general research environment for private organs and universities, the official said. The guideline cited nine major industrial and scientific sectors as areas of priority study. Among them are new materials, biotechnology, space technology, medical equipment, clean energy development, new resources and information and communications.
