SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On April 22 of 1993, Earth Day, Oregon Governor Barbara Roberts petitioned the Secretary of the Interior to add an 11-mile reach of the upper Klamath River to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The section of river under consideration extends from the John C. Boyle Hydroelectric Powerhouse (river mile 220.3) downstream to the Oregon-California border (river mile 209.3). Under section 2(a)(ii) of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (P.L. 90&hyph;542, as amended), the Secretary has the authority to add a river to the national system at the request of a state provided the state has met certain conditions and the river meets eligibility criteria. These preconditions are: (1) The river is already designated into a state river protection system. (2) The state has the ability to manage the river at no cost to the federal government, except for those lands already in federal ownership. (3) The river has resources of regional or national significance and is free-flowing as defined by the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture. (4) The state has adequate mechanisms in place to protect the resources for which the river is eligible in the first place. Upon the request of a state governor to the Secretary, the National Park Service, acting for the Secretary, undertakes an evaluation of the state's request. The National Park Service requested the assistance of the Bureau of Land Management in the preparation of the report and environmental assessment. This was done for two reasons: (1) The Bureau manages 75% of the area under consideration and (2) the Bureau has conducted two previous assessments of the river_one for a congressionally authorized wild and scenic river study, and one as part of its normal resource management planning process. The Bureau of Land Management agreed to act as a cooperator in the preparation of the assessment. As a result of the evaluation, the National Park Service has concluded that the state of Oregon has met all requirements to include the upper Klamath River in the national system and the river itself meets all eligibility criteria. The National Park Service is recommending as the preferred alternative that the Secretary designate the upper Klamath as a National Scenic River. Dated: February 22, 1994. John Reynolds, Acting Director, National Park Service. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;4963 Filed 3&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;70&hyph;M
