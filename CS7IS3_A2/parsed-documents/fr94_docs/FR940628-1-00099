FR940628-1-00099 FR940628-1-00016 The proposed order submitted by PromoFlor is summarized as follows: Sections 1208.1&hyph;1208.22 of the proposed order define certain terms, such as floral products, qualified handler, producer, and retailer, which are used in the proposed order. Sections 1208.30&hyph;1208.37 include provisions relating to the establishment, membership, nomination procedures, appointment, terms of office, and reimbursement of members of the Council. Also PromoFlor would be designated as an election committee for the initial nomination of members to the Council. After the Council is appointed, the Council would be the election committee. Sections 1208.40&hyph;1208.43 include powers and duties of the Council, which would be the body organized to administer the order through the implementation of plans, projects, budgets, and contracts to promote and disseminate information about cut flowers and greens, under the supervision of the Secretary. Further, the Council would be authorized to incur expenses necessary for the performance of its duties. Sections 1208.50&hyph;1208.57 would authorize the collection of assessments, specify who pays them and how, set forth procedures for granting a postponement of the payment of an assessment for any qualified handler who is financially unable to pay such assessment, set forth procedures for the handling of a one-time refund should the order fail to be approved in referendum, authorize the Council to make determinations as to who are qualified handlers and who are exempt handlers, and for establishing an operating monetary reserve. The initial assessment rate would be 0.5 percent of a qualified handler's gross sales during the first three years the order is in effect. Thereafter, the rate may be increased or decreased by no more than 0.25 percent per year. A uniform factor would be used for determining the assessment due on non-sale transfers to retailers and sales by importers who are qualified handlers directly to consumers. Another uniform factor would be used for determining the assessment due on sales directly to consumers by producers who are qualified handlers. Sales of cut flowers and greens to export markets would be exempt from assessment. The assessment sections also outline the procedures to be followed by qualified handlers for remitting assessments; establish a 1.5 percent per month interest charge for unpaid or late assessments; and provide for refunds of assessments paid if the program does not continue after the initial referendum. Sections 1208.60&hyph;1208.62 authorize the Secretary to suspend or terminate the order when deemed appropriate, and prescribes proceedings after suspension or termination. Sections 1208.70&hyph;1208.72 concern reporting and recordkeeping requirements for persons subject to the order and protect the confidentiality of information obtained from such books, records, or reports. Sections 1208.80&hyph;1208.85 are miscellaneous provisions including the provisions involving authority of the Secretary; personal liability of Council members and employees; separability of order provisions; handling of intellectual property, such as patents, arising from funds collected by the Council; and amendments to the order. In addition to the proposal from PromoFlor, the Department received proposals addressing the nomination of the Council's retailer members from Florists' Transworld Delivery Association (FTD) (see Proposal II) and the Produce Marketing Association (PMA) (see Proposal III). Proposal II FTD's proposal specifies that one of the three retailer members be appointed from nominations submitted by the American Floral Marketing Council (AFMC) in accordance with the Act, that one retailer member be appointed from nominations submitted by FTD, and that one retailer member be appointed from nominations submitted by a coalition of traditional retail florist organizations. The FTD proposal also defines ``traditional retail florist organization'' as an organization having membership exceeding 1,000 of which 75 percent would be traditional cut flowers and greens retailers and such organization spends a portion of its revenue on marketing cut flowers and greens. The FTD proposal defines ``traditional cut flowers and greens retailer'' as small business establishments that operate from owned or leased premises and derive 40 percent of their total volume of sales from cut flowers and greens. This definition would not allow for mass-market retailers such as supermarket chains to be eligible to nominate candidates as members on the Council. The FTD proposal further states that no traditional retail florist organization, including AFMC, would be eligible to nominate members for more than one of the three retailer member positions. It is FTD's position that it is the largest traditional retail florist organization in the industry and that it should be entitled to one member and alternate on the Council. Proposal III The Produce Marketing Association (PMA) also submitted proposed definitions of ``traditional retailer'' and ``traditional retail florist organization'' which would be used in determining eligibility to nominate retailer members for the Council. PMA is the national trade association that represents the mass-market floral industry though its division, the Floral Marketing Association. It is PMA's position that the definition of the term ``traditional'' should be very broad and include any retailer whose primary business is the sale of floral products, including cut flowers and greens or has a specific department dedicated to the sale of floral products including cut flowers and greens. Also, PMA recommended that nominations be limited to national organizations. Further, PMA is in favor of keeping the two retailer seats that were not designated for AFMC open to as large a segment of the floral industry as possible.
