"In the light of the direction of China's reform, we shouldn't rule out the possibility of locality governments being given some flexibility in the implementation of local taxes, such as deciding on tax rates and ways of collection," said State Tax Bureau general deputy commissioner Li Yonggui. In the race for foreign investment, many municipal governments have proposed refunds on property gains tax for foreign investors, making the tax ineffective. The move has been publicly censured by Beijing. "The property gains tax is an income to locality governments but its implementation rests with the central government. Locality governments are not empowered to add something to it or abandon it," said Mr Li. He confirmed that details of the property gains tax would be released and implemented this year. "Before working out the details, we'll consult locality governments, the authorities concerned and Hong Kong developers. We'll consider the interests, returns and risks of Hong Kong developers (in their mainland property projects). We'll also take inflation into account," he said.
