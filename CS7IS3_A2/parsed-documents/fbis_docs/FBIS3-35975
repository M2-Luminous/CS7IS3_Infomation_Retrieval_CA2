"Russia stands against the escalation of the conflict and against air strikes" on positions of conflicting sides, he told a press conference. However, the priemier also opposed the statements of Russian nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirnovskiy who said in Bosnia that U.S.-proposed air strikes on serbs would be viewed as an attack on Russia. "This is an exaggeration", Chernomyrdin commented. "The settlement of the Bosnian conflict is not an easy problem and it cannot be solved overnight", Chernomyrdin said.
