FR940328-2-00035 FR940328-2-00019 4. ANR Storage Company [Docket No. CP94&hyph;291&hyph;000] Take notice that on March 16, 1994, ANR Storage Company (ANR), 500 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan 48243, filed in Docket No. CP94&hyph;291&hyph;000 a request pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Commission's Regulations to increase the authorized maximum volume of natural gas to be stored in its northern Michigan storage fields, under ANR's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82&hyph;523&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. ANR proposes to change the maximum inventory level of the storage fields as follows: ‚ê£ 1Current 1Proposed 2Maximum depth Storage field (Ft, TVD) 2Maximum inventory (MMcf) 2Maximum reservoir pressure (psia) 2Maximum Inventory (MMcf) 2Maximum reservoir pressure (psia) Rapid River 35 6,599 16,976 4,649 17,327 4,649 Cold Springs 12 6,699 27,227 4,642 28,884 4,642 Cold Springs 31 6,840 5,734 4,630 5,302 4,630 Excelsior 6/ East Kalkaska 1 6,718 11,089 4,615 12,310 4,615 n,s Maximum Inventory Totals 61,026 63,823 ANR states that engineering evaluation and actual operational experience has indicated that the size of ANR's Cold Springs 12, Rapid River 35 and Excelsior 6/East Kalkaska fields are slightly larger than predicted when originally authorized. These increases are partially offset by the slightly smaller estimate for the Cold Springs 31 field, it is stated. ANR states that it does not propose to increase the maximum authorized reservoir pressure, construct any new facilities, or impact the storage services ANR currently provides its existing customers. ANR indicates that these changes in maximum inventory levels would conform to the actual operational characteristics of the fields and would provide ANR greater operational flexibility by allowing ANR to use the maximum storage capability, within allowable pressures, of each of its storage fields. Comment date: May 5, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph G at the end of this notice.
