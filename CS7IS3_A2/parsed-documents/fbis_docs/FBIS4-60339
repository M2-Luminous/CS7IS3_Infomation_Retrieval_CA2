Interviewed by IRNA, al-Tufayli criticized the Lebanese Government for its silence vis-a-vis the crimes being committed by the Zionist regime, and held the government responsible for the abduction of Mustafa al-Dirani, leader of the Mu'manah resistance group. Al-Dirani was abducted from his home in al-Biqa' by the Zionist commandos last Saturday. "From now on Lebanese people cannot trust the security provided by the Lebanese Government," he said. Al-Tufayli warned that silence of the Lebanese officials would further encourage the Zionist regime to continue its crimes and violate the human rights in Lebanon.
