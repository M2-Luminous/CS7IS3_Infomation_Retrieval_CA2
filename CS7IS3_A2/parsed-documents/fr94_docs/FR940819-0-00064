If, due to leaks in the appliance, evacuation to the levels in Table 1 is not attainable, or would substantially contaminate the refrigerant being recovered, persons disposing of the appliance must: (i) Isolate leaking from non-leaking components wherever possible; (ii) Evacuate non-leaking components to the levels specified in Table 1; and (iii) Evacuate leaking components to the lowest level that can be attained without substantially contaminating the refrigerant. In no case shall this level exceed 0 psig. * * * * * (b) Effective October 18, 1994, all persons opening appliances except for small appliances and MVACs for maintenance, service, or repair and all persons disposing of appliances except small appliances, MVACs, and MVAC-like appliances must have at least one piece of certified, self-contained recovery or recycling equipment available at their place of business. Persons who maintain, service, repair, or dispose of only appliances that they own and that contain pump-out units are exempt from this requirement. This exemption does not relieve such persons from other applicable requirements of §82.156. (c) System-dependent equipment shall not be used with appliances normally containing more than 15 pounds of refrigerant, unless the system-dependent equipment is permanently attached to the appliance as a pump-out unit. * * * * * (i) *␣*␣* (1) Owners of commercial refrigeration and industrial process refrigeration equipment normally containing more than 50 pounds of refrigerant must have all leaks repaired if the equipment is leaking at a rate such that the loss of refrigerant will exceed 35 percent of the total charge during a 12-month period, except as described in paragraph (i)(3) of this section. * * * * * 5. Section 82.158 is amended by revising paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(6) to read as follows: §82.158 Standards for recycling and recovery equipment. * * * * * (b) *␣*␣* (2) Recovery or recycling equipment whose recovery efficiency cannot be tested according to the procedures in ARI 740&hyph;1993 may be certified if an approved third-party testing organization adopts and performs a test that demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the recovery efficiency of that equipment is equal to or better than that of equipment that: (i) Is intended for use with the same type of appliance; and (ii) Achieves the level of evacuation in Table 2. The manufacturer's instructions must specify how to achieve the required recovery efficiency, and the equipment must be tested when used according to these instructions. * * * * * (6) The equipment must have its liquid recovery rate and its vapor recovery rate measured under the conditions of ARI 740&hyph;1993, unless the equipment has no inherent liquid or vapor recovery rate. * * * * * 6. Section 82.161 is amended by revising paragraph (a) introductory text to read as follows: §82.161 Technician certification. (a) Effective November 14, 1994, persons who maintain, service, or repair appliances, except MVACs, and persons who dispose of appliances, except for small appliances, room air conditioners, MVACs and MVAC-like appliances, must be certified by an approved technician certification program as follows: * * * * *
