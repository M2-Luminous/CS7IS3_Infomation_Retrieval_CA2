Lambeck; place and date not given: "A Disgrace for Social Democracy"] [Text] [Lambeck] Mr. Chancellor, next week the IG-Metall trade union will decide in a strike ballot on whether or not to go on strike. Do you still see a chance of preventing a strike at this unfortunate time? [Kohl] I will not interfere in the wage negotiations. I am a convinced supporter of autonomy in collective bargaining. However, I think of the 4 million unemployed and of the urgent need to ensure with all our strength a climate that is beneficial for investment so that further job losses can be stopped. Therefore, I would welcome it very much if every opportunity were used, right up to the last minute, to reach agreement. I refer to the example of the agreement in the chemical industry. That was a sensible agreement. [Lambeck] What should a sensible agreement in the public sector be like? [Kohl] In the public sector I am in a different situation than regarding the aforementioned wage negotiations. As chancellor I represent one third of the partners in the wage negotiations, in this case the employers. I do not want to give you any figures here now. However, the following principles apply: 1. Everyone, including the trade unions, know the situation with regard to public budgets. 2. We all know -- perhaps now more than in the past -- how important a secure job is. A job in the public sector is a secure job. This is an important asset; and, I think, this must also be taken into consideration. I myself have already pointed out that the budget situation does not permit any increases in the public sector. We should think of the social situation of the affected individuals. I would imagine that we would offer a different settlement for the lower wage groups than for those who get higher salaries. [Lambeck] The latest mediation procedure involving the nursing-care insurance once again threatens to fail. Do you see any chance of a compromise at the last moment? [Kohl] I am in favor of trying up to the last moment to get nursing-care insurance through parliament and to reach a positive agreement. In a few years we will have more than 3 million people over 80. This demographic development shows that the number of senior citizens is increasing considerably. The decision is overdue. I myself do not understand the entire controversy at all. And I believe that millions of our fellow-citizens do not understand it, either. What is the problem? Everyone agrees that nursing-care insurance is necessary, the only differences of opinion are about compensation. In Germany an employee has an average annual leave of 30 working days. In addition, there are 12 to 14 public holidays. Added up, this is eight weeks of annual leave and free time. The point is whether we are ready to give up two holidays in such a way that the holidays remain but are not paid. In a country that has the longest vacations in the world I find it absurd that we are still quarreling. [Lambeck] There have been discussions about the contacts of the Social Democratic Party [SPD] and the Bonn coalition with the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] leadership. The SPD now speaks of mudslinging. Is the past here being turned into an election issue. [Kohl] The SPD always speaks of mudslinging as soon as things get unpleasant for them. What is the real issue? The real issue is not the Stasi files. The facts are being distorted deliberately. First, the point is that after the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961 all laender together established the recording office in Salzgitter. The purpose of this documentation office was to record the barbaric human rights violations committed against German citizens in the GDR. This small office had a great psychological effect in the former GDR. I know from former prisoners, who were in Bautzen or in other prisons in the former GDR, that many people cherished the hope that the evil deeds of the henchmen there would not go unpunished in the long run. After all, it was no coincidence that in his Gera Demands Honecker demanded that this office be abolished. He made this demand at every occasion, also when he talked to me. I think it is a disgrace that the SPD-governed laender canceled their subsidies to the documentation center. They did it just to do Mr. Honecker a favor. This has nothing to do with Stasi files or with mudslinging. It is a disgrace for the great, traditional German social democracy, which has otherwise advocated human rights. Advocating human rights in Guatemala is one thing, but advocating human rights for fellow German citizens in the GDR is something quite different. And when Mr. Rau now calls himself the presidential candidate of all Germans, he must explain to the 17 million Germans in the former GDR why he stopped financing this documentation office in 1988 when he was minister president of North Rhine-Westphalia. The other big demand of the SED [Socialist Unity party of Germany] leadership under Honecker referred to the recognition of an independent GDR citizenship. Once again one does not need the Stasi files to prove that the majority of the SPD leadership wanted to meet this demand had they won the Bundestag elections in 1987. This would have had disastrous consequences for the refugees from the GDR in Hungary and in Prague in 1989. I do not intend to permit the SPD to tell me what to say. [Lambeck] Let us turn from the problems in Germany to the situation in the Balkans: The NATO ultimatum to the Serbs has made the situation around Sarajevo relatively calm. Now the bloody war is raging in other Bosnian regions instead. Does the credibility of the United Nations and NATO continue to suffer because of that? [Kohl] All those who talk about credibility have not found a panacea, either. I am very, very happy that the common NATO decision exists. I am also very happy that President Clinton has now accepted a certain leadership role for the United States. I myself have emphatically advised him to do so. I also think that we have to make every effort to integrate Russia and Boris Yeltsin in this decision. I myself have discussed the matter with Yeltsin several times. Now there is once again an opportunity to put an end to this horrendous war in the Balkans and, above all, to the terrible suffering of the people. [Lambeck] Will the Bundeswehr provide logistical support in the event of NATO air strikes in Bosnia, if the allies ask you? [Kohl] For well-known reasons, the Bundeswehr itself cannot provide any troops for operations in the former Yugoslavia. If it is necessary to provide logistical support outside the territory of the former Yugoslavia and if we are asked to do so, I am strongly in favor of it. [Lambeck] Russia has serious reservations about NATO air strikes on Serbian positions. Now it is known that you, Mr. Chancellor, have a particularly close and good relationship with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. Are you mediating between the United States and Russia regarding the issue of Bosnia? [Kohl] We Germans cannot presume to have a mediating role in this connection. I have excellent personal and friendly relations with both Yeltsin and Clinton. I try to be helpful within the framework of my capabilities.
