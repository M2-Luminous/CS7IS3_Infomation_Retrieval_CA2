[Lobo] What have you learned from the last three or four weeks, from the events of Gorazde and the actions of the international community in this crisis? [Silajdzic] The United Nations has developed a very negative role. It has not used the mandate it was given and did not accept NATO's offer to bomb Serbian positions when their artillery continued to kill civilians after the ultimatum was issued. It appears that someone very high up (politically -- EL PAIS editor's note) has tried to save these fascists from being punished. In Gorazde alone, and nobody knows why, they killed 719 people. Their aim was to force the inhabitants out and to conquer the territory. This has been going on for the last two years. There are still people who call this a civil war which, translated into political language means "I do not want to get involved." Everyone knows that this is not a civil war but aggression, and that the tanks, artillery, and soldiers come from Serbia. Everyone knows that, and yet nobody wants to call it genocide. Do you know why? Because if they did, they would have to intervene. Everything is just an excuse, and when NATO and the United States take the initiative and the alliance is ready to put a stop to this hell, the United Nations then says no. [Lobo] When you say that someone very high up is playing dirty, to which country or to whom are you alluding? [Silajdzic] If I had wanted to say who, I would have said so before now. Clearly, there are people very high up who have allowed this to continue for two years and at the same time they have kept our hands tied (by the embargo -- EL PAIS editor's note). They have prevented us from defending ourselves and they have let the Serbs do anything. This is not a war, it is genocide. Now, the United Nations comes here and tells us: Look, there are two parties involved and we do not want to take sides. What is happening here is not just a violation of the basic UN Charter, it is a violation of every principle. If the United Nations will not respect its own charter and its own resolutions, why doesn't it just get out? [Lobo] Are you asking the United Nations to leave Bosnian soil? [Silajdzic] I believe that, since Gorazde, there should be a major change in the UN leadership. Srebrenica was a year ago. Now the same thing has just happened to Gorazde. They allowed this (the Serbian offensive -- EL PAIS editor's note) to last almost four weeks, and despite this being a safe area. Why didn't the United Nations defend this protected area? Who is supposed to protect it? And all the while, these people are sitting in the UN building in New York raking in huge salaries! [Lobo] Some people think that the Bosnian Government has been dreaming too much of the possibility of foreign military intervention and that, after the events of Gorazde, you have realized that this intervention will never come. [Silajdzic] I'm sorry? So all this has been a way of getting this message across to us? Perhaps. If this were the case, we would be faced with mass murder planned by the international community itself. However, I do not think this is the case. I think that the United Nations and some people high up in the organization hate Bosnia. This has been most apparent over the last two years. They have been against any action. [Lobo] What do you think of UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali and his special envoy Yasushi Akashi? [Silajdzic] I think they have held up NATO action. I can name 20 towns that have been destroyed before Butrus-Ghali's very eyes. When the alliance wanted to act against this murderous machine (the Serbian Army -- EL PAIS editor's note), they stopped them. Why? I don't know, but it is a violation of the resolutions passed by the UN Security Council. These now are nothing more than pieces of paper. Who is responsible for implementing these resolutions? The answer is very simple: the secretary general. What is he doing?! [Lobo] What do you think of the role played by the United States in this crisis? [Silajdzic] At the end of the day, it has been the United States that has done everything. Right from the air drops of humanitarian aid... We would have preferred everything to have been done much more quickly. For some things, it is now too late, yes, but in the final analysis it was the Americans who forced the others into the Gorazde ultimatum. Maybe it is very little coming very slowly. [Lobo] What about the European Union's stance? [Silajdzic] It has been more positive in recent months. Before, the Community was a witness to a tragedy. For a long time, it is true, they sent us supplies, but they have to answer the question of why they imposed the arms embargo on us and left so many people to die. That is a moral responsibility. [Lobo] Are you ready to sign a cease-fire agreement? [Silajdzic] Yes, for three or four months, while negotiations are under way. However, they want to keep the situation as it stands and want the United Nations to award them the territory they have conquered. That will not happen, however. Bosnia Herzegovina will remain a single country. I have nothing against Serbia's size, as long as it remains within its own borders and does not grow at the expense of Bosnia. [Lobo] One last question... What do you think of the role played by the Spanish soldiers in Mostar? [Silajdzic] I did not like it. There were problems. There are many signs that they took the side of the Croatian extremists. We are not very pleased with them. I intend to talk with the Spanish Government on this subject.
