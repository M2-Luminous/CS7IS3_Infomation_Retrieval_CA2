Recalling that the Kim Yong-sam group incriminated peasants' rally held on February 1 to check the rice market opening and has countered it with ruthless fascist suppression, the news analyst says: The traitor Kim Yong-sam who deserves stern punishment by the people for his arch crimes is exasperatingly brandishing the sword against the people, growling. This tells that the Kim Yong-sam group is, indeed, a pack of despicable and wicked traitors who are lost to human reason and without an iota of national conscience. Always miserable was the end of the successive traitors who attempted to find a way out through ruthless suppression. Brutal suppression by the traitor Kim Yong-sam will only touch off a fiercer resistance of the South Korean people who rose to overthrow the "civilian" regime.
