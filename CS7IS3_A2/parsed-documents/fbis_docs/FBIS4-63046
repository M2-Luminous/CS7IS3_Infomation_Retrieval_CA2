The deputy minister's letter is devoted to the arrival of the Tibetan Dalai Lama, who is on a private visit to Russia. Since all more or less official contacts by the Tibetan exile are very disturbing for China, Mr. Panov recommended to State Duma deputies to take no part in any meetings with the leader of all Buddhists.
