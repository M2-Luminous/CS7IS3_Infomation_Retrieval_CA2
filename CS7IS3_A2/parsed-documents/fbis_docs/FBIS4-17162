Ossetian President Speaks Prior to Moscow Trip LD2104183894 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service in Russian 1058 GMT 21 Apr 94 LD2104183894 Moscow ITAR-TASS World Service Russian BFN [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Valeriy Shanayev] [Text] Vladikavkaz, 21 Apr -- The upcoming parliamentary hearings in the Federation Council and the meeting of the Russian Security Council, both of which will discuss the situation in the conflict zone, are yet another attempt at achieving a peaceful settlement of relations between North Ossetia and Ingushetia, Akhsarbek Galazov, president of the Republic of North Ossetia, said today in an interview with the ITAR-TASS correspondent before leaving by air for Moscow. Akhsarbek Galazov said that North Ossetia is extremely interested in establishing normal relations with all its neighbors in the North Caucasus region and Transcaucasia. But the multinational people of the republic will not accept strong-arm methods to resolve these questions. Nor should one force the process involving the return of refugees to villages in Prigorodnyy Rayon. This complicated problem must be resolved by conciliation commissions on the basis of the Kislovodsk Agreements. Speaking of the upcoming signing of the agreement on achieving civic accord in Russia, the republic's president stressed that North Ossetia supports the ideas of this document that are aimed at consolidating all the healthy forces in society. However, Akhsarbek Galazov noted that "the sides are appealing to national movements and parties to declare a moratorium on putting forward demands for changes to be made to borders and existing administrative divisions." It is necessary to take off the agenda the issue of redrawing borders in the region. Galazov said that this could lead to a new tragedy not only in the North Caucasus, but also in the south of Russia.
