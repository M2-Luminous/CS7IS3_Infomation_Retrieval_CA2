Vladimir Shumeyko and Medetkhan Sherimkulov, chairman of the Jogorku Kenesh, addressed journalists. [Begin recording] [Sherimkulov] I am pleased to greet Vladimir Philippovich in Kyrgyzstan. He is highly respected by all of us. We have centuries-old friendly relations with Russia and I hope that we, with Vladimir Philippovich and our parliaments, will do everything so as to maintain and facilitate friendly and close cooperation between our states and our people. [Shumeyko] A parliamentary delegation from Azerbaijan has visited us recently. It was led by the chairman of its Supreme Soviet, and he and I have agreed to give an impetus [words indistinct] to the meeting in Bishkek and peacemaking efforts, which are being taken by a group from the Interparliamentary Assembly led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovoch, his personal visit to [words indistinct]. I believe it is useful for three heads of parliaments of the three member-states of the Interparliamentary Assembly to gather here. We have agreed to consider Nagorno-Karabakh as one of the sides involved in the conflict. I emphasize here: one of the sides of the conflict. You know that Azerbaijan's policy was that only two states are involved in the conflict, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Nagorno-Karabakh is [words indistinct] of the conflict. I believe that considering it as one of the participants of the conflict is a (?major step). A possibility for holding talks at the level of heads of parliaments [words indistinct] the previous activity of our peacemaking group which is led by Medetkhan Sherimkulovich. It has done quite a lot in preparing grounds for the talks. I pin hopes on common sense. [Sherimkulov] [Words indistinct] the Interparliamentary Assembly led by Vladimir Philippovich Shumeyko will give a certain weight to the talks [words indistinct]. Indeed, we hope that we will be able to get off the ground in solving this problem. We know that both Azerbaijan and Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh [words indistinct] this pointless bloody war which killed people, has made thousands of people homeless, increased the number of refugees and destroyed their homes. There has never been a case before when heads of parliament gathered together and sat around a negotiating table. This has never happened before at such a level. I think that this is a good sign. [Shumeyko] You can't look without optimism at life. I can't give any other example [words indistinct]. We, at the Interparliamentary Assembly, or in other words parliamentarians, representing their own people, do not have the right to leave this mattter unattended and to be pessimistic about it despite all the difficulties. We should work hard on settling this conflict, no matter how long it takes. That's what we intend to do. [end recording]
