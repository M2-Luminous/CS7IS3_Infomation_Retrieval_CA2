According to the Serbian Chamber of Commerce, work at 10 shipyards in Serbia has ceased, resulting in lost revenues of about 150 million German marks. The chamber said Monday that the 6,000 employees in the shipbuilding sector could build about 300 million German marks worth of ships a year, providing work for another 150,000 workers in industries ranging from the iron and steel to electrical sectors. The chamber group dealing with shipbuilding has announced plans for constructing a new river fleet over the next several years. The government will put up 40 percent of the funds, with rest coming from shipyards, customers and banks. Before the imposition of the UN sanctions, Yugoslav shipyards spent about 80 percent of their time on production for export, with many Yugoslavs working overseas on such ships. The chamber group said that today, most Yugoslav ships that had been based abroad are moored in dock, where they are steadily decaying and have lost their navigation permits. According to the Jugoregistra register of shipping, only 360 of a total of 906 Yugoslav vessels still hold valid permits. Serbia previously had one of the largest fleets on the Danube.
