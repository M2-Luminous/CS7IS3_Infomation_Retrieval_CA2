Income before Taxes,'' which listed average expenditures for families earning similar incomes, organized into eight income ranges. Runzheimer analyzed these data to develop typical spending patterns for the three income profiles identified in 2.1.2.2. (The table below displays the results of the analysis.) Seven income ranges encompassed the salary range of the General Schedule: $10,000 to $14,999 $15,000 to $19,999 $20,000 to $29,999 $30,000 to $39,999 $40,000 to $49,999 $50,000 and over All respondents combined The 1988 CES grouped expenses into small, logical families of items. For example, the report divided money spent by families on beef into four groups: ground beef, roast, steak and other beef. The steak and roast groupings were further separated into smaller clusters of items (e.g., sirloin and round steak, chuck and round roast). Drawing on this survey of expenditure data, Runzheimer sorted the item groupings into the four main cost components specified in the OPM regulations: Consumption Goods & Services, Transportation, Housing, and Miscellaneous Expenses. Runzheimer observed that families in the lower income ranges spent more of their money, as a percentage of total expenses, on goods and services and housing than families in higher income ranges. Also, families spent approximately the same percentage of their total expenses on transportation, regardless of income. Consequently, the Miscellaneous Expense component which includes such things as medical-care expenses, contributions, gifts to non-family members, pension funds, long-term savings and investments, and life insurance premiums_increased as a percentage of total expenses as income increased. To develop accurate and defensible weighing patterns for the three income levels, Runzheimer performed linear regression analysis on the selected 1988 CES data. Listed below are the results of Runzheimer's analysis for the income ranges listed on the preceding page: Component Expenses Expressed as a Percentage of Total Expenses 1Income level 1991 1Income level 1988 (Est.) 1Goods & services 1Housing (percent) 1Transportation (percent) 1Misc. (percent) 1Total (percent) $18,000 $16,700 39.59 24.35 20.76 15.30 100.00 28,400 26,300 39.15 23.48 20.33 17.04 100.00 45,200 41,900 38.74 22.66 19.94 18.66 100.00 Runzheimer further sorted Goods & Services into ten categories and used linear regression techniques to provide accurate ratios of renters to homeowners at each income level. Statistics on these component groupings appear later in this report. 2.2␣General Formulae and Applications An ``index'' is a mathematical way to compare one price (or set of data) with another. For example, if a price index for a can of green beans is 110, that means that a can of green beans costs 10% more in the pricing area (i.e., allowance area) than in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area). Runzheimer computed indexes for hundreds of items. To combine these indexes, Runzheimer applied weights from the CES that reflected the relative amount consumers normally spend on the items. For example, the price of a can of green beans has a lower weight than the price of a pound of apples because, according to the CES, people generally spend less on canned green beans than on apples. Runzheimer employed an indexing methodology known as Laspeyres to derive total cost indexes for each of three income levels and for each costed location. As applied to living-cost research, the Laspeyres index reflects the expenditure patterns of the people in the reference area (i.e., the Washington, D.C., area) to weight the prices. Because detailed CES data by income level are not published for the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer used nationwide CES data to compute weights. Consequently, Runzheimer did not technically apply the Laspeyres index methodology in its pure form. Nevertheless, Runzheimer firmly believes that this nuance does not invalidate the price comparisons presented in this report. As described in the example above and in greater detail in sections 3.2 and 6.2, Runzheimer applied the Laspeyres methodology to compute price indexes for the Goods & Services and the Miscellaneous Expenses components, respectively. For the Transportation and the Housing components, Runzheimer used a combination of a cost-build-up approach and the Laspeyres methodology to compute component indexes.
