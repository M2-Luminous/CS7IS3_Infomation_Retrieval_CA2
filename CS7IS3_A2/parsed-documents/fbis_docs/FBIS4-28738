He is optimistic about Cambodia's situation compared with that in the 1980s when he was the communist state's prime minister. But he is pessimistic about achieving a peaceful agreement with the group he calls an "historical inheritance", the Khmer Rouge, a group which begins another round of talks with the government in Phnom Penh tomorrow. "There is no hope. Not little hope but no hope," said Hun Sen, referring to Wednesday's discussions. "I'm almost fed up with talking to the Khmer Rouge. What I am doing is in accordance with the king's wishes. At least we would like to use the last chance for peace in Cambodia," he said in an exclusive interview last week. Hun Sen gave the same gloomy message before leaving for last month's failed Cambodian peace talks in North Korea. The reason for such pessimism is Khmer Rouge strategy. "I have a document written by Pol Pot and received in late March. The Khmer Rouge goal is to increase its armed forces to 25,000 in two years from May 1994 to May 1996 and step to the stage of offensive," Hun Sen said. Government information ministry spokesman Sieng La Presse said the guerrillas were trying to recruit villagers in Cambodia's north and west by offering money to volunteers and their families. Despite recent military setbacks by government troops, particularly the rapid Khmer Rouge recapture of Pailin, Hun Sen claims the guerrillas are very weak. "After their non-participation in the (UNTAC) peace process their strength has decreased equal to that of the 1970s," he said, referring to the Khmer Rouge remnants who fled the advancing Vietnamese army in 1979 after Hanoi's invasion toppled Pol Pot. Sources close to the Khmer Rouge acknowledge supply problems but independent military analysts say the guerrillas can still total 20,000 troops including militia, although regular troops are estimated at 8,000. But no matter its size, the Khmer Rouge remains active. The way to beat it, according to Hun Sen, is with a mixture of military stick and social progress. "The powerful grenade which can destroy the guerrilla is development of the economy and society. "We will not stand on one foot. We will stand on both -- meaning we will not use the gun and abandon development or develop our country and abandon the gun, but use both ways," he said. Using "both ways" has meant Cambodian leaders asking for weapons. Foreign countries have responded cautiously to these requests, fearing an escalating civil war as the arms are sold to Khmer Rouge by corrupt, undisciplined Phnom Penh troops. King Sihanouk described Cambodians as "champions of corruption before he left Phnom Penh 1 month, but Hun Sen sees corruption of government forces to a less extent. "There is some corruption but not to the extent that all military aid would be sold to the Khmer Rouge even though we feel we have strengthen the discipline and efficiency of the army," he said. Foreign countries which refuse to supply weapons could help in other ways, he said, hinting at military indiscipline problems which King Sihanouk recently said were alienating Cambodian villagers. "Those countries who are concerned military aid will be sold to the Khmer Rouge can help us set up military training schools and also camps. The army does not have camps and stays in people's house so it is very difficult to control it, Hun Sen said. He wants to throw the Khmer Rouge out of its Phnom Penh compound which it maintains under Cambodia's 1991 peace agreement. The government has already cut the guerrillas land and mobile telephone lines and state officials have banned guerrilla press conferences. "I would like to outlaw them and force them to leave their compound as long as they do not participate in society there is no need to keep them as one political organisation," he said. This will be debated by Cambodia's parliament at its next sitting. Reports of Hun Sen's wanting to formally outlaw the guerrilla group are not new in Phnom Penh. But somewhat surprising during last week's interview was the Cambodian leader's conciliatory remarks toward Thailand. When the Khmer Rouge recaptured its Pailin base on April 18, Cambodia's second prime minister accused Thailand of helping the guerrillas and threatened to raise the issue at the United Nations. Cambodia's First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and other Phnom Penh officials have repeatedly spoken of Thai "interference". But last week Hun Sen was more diplomatic. "I suggest you should clearly quote my words. My concern is that there might be a misunderstanding between Phnom Penh and Bangkok. Thailand recognises only the royal government," the premier said. "The border is long. There are bad men from Thailand who hide themselves in Cambodia and there could be bad men from Cambodia hiding in Thailand. The Khmer Rouge problem is the aftermath of history," he said. But for all Hun Sen's measured diplomacy the scale of the illicit border trade in logs and gems between Thai companies and the guerrillas remains a major worry. The premier said country-to-country talks would always be the most effective way to solve Cambodia's border problems with all its neighbours, not just Thailand. But he does not object to America raising concerns, at the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July, about alleged Thai support for the Khmer Rouge. "A bilateral solution is the basic solution. That does not mean I oppose any talks by the foreign minister of America with ASEAN. The 1991 peace agreement's third part mentions guarantees of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia," he said. Hun Sen has changed his rhetoric of conflict with Thailand into that of measured diplomacy. But there were no words of conciliation for his former comrades, the Khmer Rouge, a group he fled from in 1977 after almost 10 years in the revolution. "I do not understand those who accuse me of being a hardliner toward the Khmer Rouge, I just raise the question of whether to arrest the thief and imprison it or leave it to live with the people," Hun Sen said.
