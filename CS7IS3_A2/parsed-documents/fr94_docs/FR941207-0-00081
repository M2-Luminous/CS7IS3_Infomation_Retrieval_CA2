Suspension of DART Distribution As discussed above, the Office adopted the Interim Regulations to establish a regulatory framework in time for the start of DART distribution. The Office postponed the date for determination of controversies to the 1992/93 DART royalty pools from March 30, 1994, to June 30, 1994, to prepare for the possibility of convening a CARP for DART distribution. We published a request for comment on the existence of a controversy for the 1992/93 funds, adopted the Interim Regulations, established a procedural schedule for the filing of comments and motions leading up to a convocation of a CARP, and published the arbitrator list all before June 30. See 59 FR 9773 (1994) (Request for comments as to existence of controversy and consolidation of 1992 and 1993 funds); 59 FR 23964 (1994) (Interim Regulations); 59 FR 25506 (1994) (Schedule of procedural dates); 59 FR 24486 (1994) (Arbitrator list). In response to the Office's request for comments as to the existence of controversies, the Office received a motion, supported by a majority of the 1992/93 DART claimants, requesting that the 1992/93 DART royalty distribution be consolidated with the 1994 DART distribution. The movants argued that although they anticipated the existence of controversies, the amount of royalties in the 1992 and 1993 funds was insufficient to justify the cost of a CARP proceeding. They therefore requested that the Office suspend all procedural dates and defer all consideration of DART distributions until 1995. On July 13, 1994, the Librarian of Congress granted the claimants' motion for suspension of the 1992/1993 DART distribution proceeding and consolidation of that proceeding with the 1994 DART distribution. 59 FR 35762 (1994). The result of the Librarian's action is that the first DART distribution proceeding will begin no sooner than March 30, 1995. The Librarian also authorized distribution of the 1992 and 1993 Nonfeatured Musicians and Nonfeatured Vocalists DART subfunds_two subfunds not subject to CARP proceedings_and scheduled a public meeting for September 27, 1994, to discuss what would constitute the best evidence for distribution of the Sound Recordings Fund and the Musical Works Fund. Id. With the suspension of DART until 1995, the first proceeding conducted by a Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel will likely be distribution of the 1990 and 1991 cable royalties. The claimant groups to 1990/1991 cable royalties have informed the Copyright Office that they wish to begin proceedings in accordance with final, not interim, regulations. The Office has already received written comments on the Interim Regulations; therefore, the Copyright Office is adopting Final Regulations that will govern all rate adjustments and distributions of royalties prescribed by the CRT Reform Act. 3 3 It is important to note that while today's Final Regulations replace the rules contained in the Interim Regulations, there are several policy determinations and decisions discussed in the preambles to the Interim Regulations and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking which remain in effect. For example, the Office will continue to consider proceedings pending before the CRT at the time of its elimination as null and void and without binding effect. See 59 FR at 23965&hyph;66 (1994). Parties practicing before the CARPs should therefore be familiar with the preambles to the Interim Regulations and the NPRM in this docket in conjunction with today's Final Regulations. III. Joint Claims Commentators had extensive comments about the interim rule governing the filing of joint royalty claims. Sections 252.3(4) and 257.3(4) require claimants filing a joint claim to cable and satellite carrier compulsory license royalties, respectively, to identify at least one secondary transmission containing a claimant's copyrighted works for each claimant listed in the joint claim. See 59 FR 23992, 23994 (1994). Performing rights societies were exempted from this requirement by ยง252.3(a)(4) and ยง257.3(a)(4). Because these sections generated much controversy, and because some of the commentators filed a motion requesting that the Office reconsider this part of the regulations, we find that the issue deserves reconsideration and resolution separate from the general discussion of amendment to the Interim Regulations. The former CRT's rules and regulations governing the filing of claims of the CRT, which we adopted on an interim basis in December 1993, are brief. Section 302.7(a) of the CRT's old rules simply permitted the filing of joint claims for cable royalties, but provided little else:
