The source stated that "a general known for his hard-line position toward Islamists and his hostility to the Arab, Islamic line is in charge of the plan." The source stated that this general "has great influence inside the military and enjoys Maj. Gen. Nezzar's confidence." The source added: "According to the report, the general in question (he declined to reveal his name) assigned a group of retired colonels in the military security organ to conduct a secret investigation to identify the quarters behind the bombing operations not attributed to Islamic groups. The results of the investigation revealed Maj. Gen. Nezzar's responsibility for them, including the attempt on his life and the attempt on the life of Gen. Toufik, chief of the military security organ." The source stated that a European official "put Dembri in the picture with regard to the report, telling him that the general himself convinced his colleagues and a number of colonels that Nezzar is responsible for what has happened to the country and for the losses inflicted on the military and that his insistence on the method of holding a dialogue with the fundamentalists will eventually lead to handing over power to the Islamic Salvation Front." The source added that the European official stressed to Dembri "the existence of a petition signed by senior officers, urging Nezzar's removal in preparation for a coup to be led by the military's hard-line general." The report indicates that Nezzar's adversaries accuse him of monopolization and have detected "several secret contacts" he made with Salvation Front leaders via various channels, "including assigning Mohamed Cherif Messaadia, former secretary general of the National Liberation Front, to make contacts with the Islamists. He was seen frequenting a villa in the Draria area, west of the capital." The report stresses that Messaadia "was the target of an assassination or abduction attempt but the security services foiled it."
