FR941227-0-00003 FR941227-0-00001 Section 3303, as amended, specifically authorizes OPM to promulgate regulations requiring agency heads to ensure that employees and applicants receive notice of its provisions. Therefore, OPM is amending Part 300 by adding a new Subpart H&hyph;Notification Requirements Relating to the Statutory Prohibitions on Political Recommendations in Personnel Actions. Section 300.801 of the new Subpart H states that agency heads must ensure that applicants and employees are notified of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 3303, as amended. Section 300.802 lists strategies for issuing notifications, but also specifies that the list is not exclusive and gives agency officials the discretion to consider and implement other means of notification. Regulatory Flexibility Act I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because they relate to internal personnel matters within the Federal Government.
