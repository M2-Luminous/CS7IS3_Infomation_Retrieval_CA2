"We call upon our brothers in Fatah to join hands and escalate the intifada and holy war against the enemy," said an open letter signed by Hamas. In a separate statement, the group, which is dominant in the occupied Gaza Strip, warned Palestinian negotiators to quit the peace talks or face unspecified consquences. [passage omitted] "The (massacre in Hebron) in which hundreds of our people died confirms the righteousness of the resistance and armed struggle... and exposes the Zionists' claims that they wish to live with our people in peace," said the statement. In its open letter, a copy of which was made available to the JORDAN TIMES, Hamas urged "our brothers in Fatah ... to respond to this brotherly and national call ... to abort the surrendering scheme led by the Oslo men." Hamas, while vowing to wreck the autonomy accord through escalated attacks against Israeli targets, appeared to drop its earlier stand that it would not take up arms against fellow Palestinians. In its message addressed to the Palestinians in the occupied territories, Hamas threatened Palestinian negotiators with attacks if they do not withdraw from negotiations with Israel. "We demand that the Oslo team announce their immediate withdrawal from the negotiations with Israel ... we will not allow a handful of us (Palestinians) to continue negotiations with those murderers at the expense of the Palestinian people," said the letter. The letter also called on the Palestinians in the occupied territories to observe a three-day general strike, escalate the intifada and carry out revenge attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers and engage in fights with them. "We call on our people to avenge the killing of our martyrs and consider the occupation troops and settlers as permanent targets wherever they may be," read the letter. The letter also called for demonstrations and marches throughout the occupied territories. It also called on the people of Hebron to protect the Ibrahimi mosque and continue praying in it.
