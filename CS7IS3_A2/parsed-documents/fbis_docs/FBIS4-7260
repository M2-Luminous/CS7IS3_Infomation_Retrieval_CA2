Senator Evans said he supports the decision and hopes the show of force will bring all parties back to the negotiating table. However, he warns that the threat of bombing alone may not be enough to stop the violence in Bosnia. [Begin Evans recording] Well, it is not clear that there is any other alternative at the moment. I mean the downside risks are that the bombing won't be enough without ground support of the kind that there is still no will to supply. The risk is also that this kind of action in these new exclusionary zones will simply generate additional complications elsewhere. [End recording] Meanwhile, Senator Evans has welcomed the Zulu Inkatha Party's decision to participte in the South African elections, saying it should reduce the level of violence in the country. Senator Evans said although sporadic violence can still be expected in South Africa in the lead-up to the election, the across-the-board bloodbath which was feared can hopefully be avoided.
