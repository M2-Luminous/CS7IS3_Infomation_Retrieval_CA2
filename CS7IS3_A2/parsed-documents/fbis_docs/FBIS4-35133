If a punishable crime is perpetrated, police authorities shall adopt the necessary or urgent provisional measures that are indispensable to ensure the investigation of the incident and the trial of the culprits. The law will stipulate a brief and strict time limit in which such measures must be take with the pertinent judicial authority. The law will also set a deadline for the judicial authority to issue a decision, with the understanding that these measures shall be revoked and rendered ineffective if the judicial authority does not confirm them by the set deadline. This first paragraph is suspended. Article 62 establishes that residences are inviolable, and shall not be searched, except to prevent a crime or to comply, in keeping with the law, with decisions issued by the courts. Visits for health reasons [visitas sanitarias], conducted in keeping with legal stipulations, shall be made only with prior notice of the officials who are either ordering or conducting such visits. Article 64 says that everyone shall move freely throughout the country, change abode or residence, leave the country or return, bring or take out possessions from the country with no additional restrictions than those established by the law. Venezuelans shall enter the country without need of any authorization. No government action shall impose the penalty of expatriation against Venezuelans, except as a commutation of sentence or at the request of the accused. Article 96, which refers to economic rights, stipulates that everyone shall be free to pursue the profitable activities of his choice with no additional limitations other than those provided in this Constitution or those indicated by the laws for security, health, or social interest reasons. The law will dictate norms to avert usury, profiteering, or any other abusive practices aimed at hindering or limiting economic rights. Article 99 guarantees the right to own property. By virtue of its social function, property ownership shall be subject to the contributions, restrictions, and obligations established by the law with regard to public use or social interest. Article 101 indicates that assets of any sort shall only be expropriated for public use or social interest purposes through a final judgment and fair compensation payments.

Provisions on these constitutional articles are henceforth suspended.
