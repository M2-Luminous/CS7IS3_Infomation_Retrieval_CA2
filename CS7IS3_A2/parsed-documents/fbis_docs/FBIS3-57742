Nor is he likely to make use of the right granted by the Supreme Council to annul the Crimea's legislative acts in the event they are not in accordance with the Ukrainian Constitution. This was a statement made by presidential adviser Mykola Mykhalchenko. In his words, there is now no formal reason for such interference. It is only after the election of the peninsula's president, in the adviser's view, that any specific steps by Kravchuk can be expected in this area. This was a report by Rukh-Press.
