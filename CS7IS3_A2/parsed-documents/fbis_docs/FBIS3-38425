Mr Adams, continuing his high-profile first visit to the US in 20 years, listed three points connected with the December document signed by Mr Major and Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds which he said needed further explanation. He told an influential New York audience these were: - Aspects of the declaration itself; - Contradictory statements about it made by the two premiers; - The issue of processes, measures and steps envisaged by the declaration. He spoke out as the US administration sent what may well be a signal to him, by calling on all parties to the Northern Ireland conflict to embrace the Downing Street peace declaration. The US statement, speaking of an "historic opportunity" to end the violence, was released after Vice President Al Gore met Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd in Washington. Mr Adams, the Sinn Fein president, listed his demands during an address to the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, the high point of his 48-hour stay. He told an audience of 300 in New York's Waldorf-Astoria hotel -- venue for the Committee's conference on Northern Ireland -- that the US could make a "significant and positive" role to achieving peace. But he accused the British Government of stalling by refusing to clarify the December 15 peace declaration. But his statement brought a strong retort from Mr Major. In the Commons, the Prime Minister accused Sinn Fein of "prevarications" and "evasions" about the ending of violence. Mr Major said: "There has been no commitment by Mr Adams or the Provisional movement to end violence for good. "That is the commitment that this House and everybody in this country and Ireland is waiting to hear." Mr Adams was on day two of his visit, authorised by President Clinton against the wishes of the Major Government. He has conducted a series of coast-to-coast TV interviews amid huge press interest, as well as meetings with top American politicians. He told his audience that Irish republicans had to decide whether the Anglo-Irish document was a first step for the British Government in the direction of lasting peace, or merely a political response by a government under pressure, aimed at avoiding a political confrontation with Dublin. He said: "The Joint Declaration is described by its authors as `the first step' towards a peace settlement. "Sinn Fein is committed to such a settlement and I am concerned -- I am indeed anxious -- to be persuaded that the Downing Street declaration can provide the basis for this. "And even if this is not the case -- if there is a gap between what it required and what is on offer -- then we should all move to bridge that gap." Mr Adams said the exercise of the right of Irish self-determination required a change in British policy and the removal of the veto on change in Northern Ireland held by the majority Unionist community. He acknowledged the democratic rights of the Unionists, but claimed they would be upheld in an independent Ireland. "The argument that the consent of a national minority, elevated into a majority within an undemocratic artifically-created state, is necessary before a constitutional change can occur is a nonsense," he said. Mr Adams also claimed that the Downing Street declaration was a response to proposals made after a series of talks he had with Ulster's Social Democratic and Labour Party leader John Hume last year. He said it would be judged on whether it advanced the peace process or just a "cosmetic response" to that peace initiative. There was a degree of suspicion and scepticism among nationalists and republicans regarding the real motives and intentions of the British Government. He did not mention whether the IRA would declare a ceasefire, Britain's precondition for Sinn Fein's participation in peace talks. Awaiting him back in Belfast was a letter he requested from Mr Reynolds clarifying the declaration from the Irish government's point of view. He added that the British government's refusal to "provide clarification for Sinn Fein must be a matter of deep concern to everyone interested in peace." "In contrast...it is clear that for the first time a Dublin government is making a serious attempt to address the issue of peace and a political settlement in the north of Ireland," he said. "I wish to commend Albert Reynolds. He has taken a postive and commonsense attitude to the need to provide clarification. "The potential for peace in Ireland has never been more realisable." And he made clear that Americans and the Clinton administration could be actively involved in the peace process and bring pressure to bear on Britain to break the deadlock. "Progressive opinion in the U.S.A. can assist in the development of a peace process in Ireland. The U.S. government can play a significant and positive role in encouraging the process by helping to create a climate that moves the situation on," he said. He said the U.S. government could achieve that goal in two ways -- by facilitating the free exchange of information and, obviously referring to Britain, "actively seeking to encourage dialogue and agreement." Mr Adams added: "It is clear that the British government have used all their influence, as in the past, to impede any progress on this or in any other matter which could influence or inform perceptions about the current situation in Ireland and the British government's responsibility for the present intolerable standoff." He again praised President Clinton for permitting his visa to enter the U.S., and drew a parallel between the situation in Northern Ireland and current political moves in South Africa and the Middle East. The lessons from those two areas were clear -- and "the conflict in Ireland is no different." Mr Adams was the third of three Ulster political leaders to speak at the conference, behind the middle-of-the-road Alliance Party chief Dr John Alderdice and Mr Hume. Absent, though, were Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party boss the Rev Ian Paisley and Ulster Unionist leader James Molyneaux. Both stayed away in protest at the involvement of Sinn Fein and to underline their distaste at Mr Adams finally getting his visa. The US statement released by the White House said Mr Gore, in his meeting with Mr Hurd, "underscored our admiration for the courage and vision of Prime Ministers Major and Reynolds in putting forward a new framework for peace in Northern Ireland." "He (Gore) reiterated our conviction that the December 15 Joint Declaration of the two governments provides an historic opportunity to end the tragic violence," the statement said. "It provides a process by which all parties who eschew violence -- in deeds as well as words -- can participate in building a peaceful and prosperous Northern Ireland," it read. Mr Gore also emphasised "the importance the U.S. attaches to close cooperation with our British ally on a range of global issues," the statement added. British officials, although reportedly unhappy with the decision to reverse the 20-year policy and allow Mr Adams into the U.S., have not criticised Washington publicly. In London, Mr Major declared that the peace initiative "leaves no conceivable excuse for violence." "And all the words, all the prevarications, all the evasions of Sinn Fein will be utterly and completely hollow until they end violence." Mr Adams was being subjected to only low-key security. Volunteer members of the New York police pipe ban were assigned to protect him "in a discreet way," according to security sources.
