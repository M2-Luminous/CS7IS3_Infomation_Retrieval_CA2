Particularly, when at around 1800 that day they heard the news that the "sanctions process had stopped," a statement Carter reportedly made, they looked perplexed and were busy trying to confirm whether the report was true. At 2000 that day the ROK Foreign Ministry released a commentary that casts doubt on the remarks. Immediately after that, the U.S. White House released a statement that says that "what Carter said was not true." The Foreign Ministry, then, said it had thought so in the first place. Chongwadae [presidential offices] looked relieved later that night when the White House notified it that the report was not true. The government officials concerned complained about, among other things, a lack of information throughout that day. It was difficult for them to know, from foreign news reports, what Carter told [DPRK] President Kim, what Kim told Carter, and what Carter and Clinton discussed over the telephone. They looked helpless. [passage omitted] Some officials concerned said: "Our objective in pushing for sanctions is to hasten the resolution of the nuclear issue through dialogue. Therefore, resuming North Korea-U.S. dialogue is nothing strange." They also pointed out: "Nevertheless, North Korea's `true intention' must be verified." Foreign Ministry officials concerned looked embarrassed all day long. They said: "The West may not be being fooled by a few words of Kim Il-song, which are nothing new." They also said: "We have no choice but to see how the United States will change until North Korea's intention is revealed at upcoming U.S.-North Korea talks." [passage omitted]
