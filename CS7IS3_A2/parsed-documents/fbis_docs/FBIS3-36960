Will that agreement be carried out? [Zlenko] Kravchuk and Yeltsin had already discussed that matter at meetings before Massandra, such as those in Yalta and Dagomis. Ukraine's stance was clear. As an heir to the former USSR, it is entitled to part of its property, including part of the Black Sea Fleet. This fact, acknowledged by everybody, was confirmed at the Yalta meeting. It was agreed there that the Black Sea Fleet would be divided into two parts -- a Ukrainian part and a Russian part -- and also that the fleet would remain under joint command until complete agreement on its apportionment. Proceeding from its economic and military interests, Ukraine, as a sovereign state, is entitled to dispose of its part of the fleet. That is why in Massandra Yeltsin and Kravchuk signed a document which mentioned the possibility of Ukraine's selling to Russia its part of the fleet. Following Massandra, we are discussing aspects of the valuation and apportionment of the fleet, but it is premature to speak of a final agreement and even of its implementation. [Poch] Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasyuk said that any attempt to exploit the situation in Crimea will call into question the agreement on disarmament signed by Kravchuk, Clinton, and Yeltsin. Are you making the disarmament agreement, which has now been signed, conditional upon stability in Crimea? [Zlenko] The situation in Crimea in general and its presidential election are internal matters of Crimea and Ukraine, and are outside the Foreign Ministry's scope. With respect to the agreement's signatories' reactions to the election, we do not see what you would call clear official attempts on Russia's part to use the situation in Crimea to its advantage. The United States has deemed Ukraine's stance on this matter balanced, and has warned Russia against actions which could destabilize the region.... Parliament's decision to lift its conditions for the ratification of the START I agreement and the Lisbon agreement should finally dispel any doubt: Ukraine remains firm on the path of nuclear disarmament and in its resolve to fulfill its international commitments, including the tripartite agreement. [Poch] CIA Director Woolsey has said that it is possible that Ukraine will fragment over the next two years. Crimea and the Donbass want at least greater integration with Russia. Western Ukraine does not. What is the government's policy to prevent Ukraine's disintegration? [Zlenko] The danger of separatism must in no event be underestimated.... We are aware of the economic, cultural, and social differences which history has created in Ukraine's various regions. Some irresponsible politicians, who, using the economic problems, are repeatedly inspiring separatist ideas, are trying to exploit them. However, even taking into account the enormous difficulties existing in Ukraine today, I cannot agree with the assertion that our state is on the verge of disintegration.... Ukraine is one of the CIS' most stable states, where the ethnic minorities' rights are respected. [Poch] Russian nationalism, which is growing, is breaking you up. Why do you not acknowledge that economic and military reintegration with Russia is vital for Ukraine? [Zlenko] We deem it a priority to develop good-neighborly relations with Russia.... Far from rejecting economic relations with Moscow and the CIS, we wish to bring them to a new qualitative level. As far as military union is concerned, Ukraine's stance was laid down in the declaration of sovereignty, which says that we are a neutral state.
