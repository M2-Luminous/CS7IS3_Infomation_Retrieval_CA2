In his political report to the General Secretariat meeting, NADP Secretary General Diya'-al-Din Dawud said that with the deteriorating situation in the country, the call for national dialogue has lost its credibility. He noted that violence is constantly increasing and there are more than 25,000 detainees in prisons. Nevertheless, he said, the government is repeating its claims about security and stability, imagining that it is in full control, refusing to listen to the views of the opposition, and believing that the security solution is enough to confront violence. The secretary general said that government decisions are being determined by the policies and dictates of foreign quarters, like the World Bank and the United States. He noted the feeble government position on GATT and the government's promotion of the Middle East market from a position of impotence and capitulation. Dawud saluted the valiant Palestinian intifadah and NADP youths and leaders at universities and in all positions for rising up to entrench the concept of pan-Arabism, defend the firm Arab right to Palestine, and confront the continuing Zionist massacres against our Arab people. He stressed that the Nasirite voice in our people's anger in the wake of the al-Ibrahhimi Mosque massacre was the loudest, strongest, and the best. Meanwhile, the NADP has issued a statement to the nation on U.S. President Bill Clinton's description of Jerusalem as Israel's unified capital. The statement said the American remarks are a natural result of the humiliating agreement known as Gaza-Jericho and the full surrender to the Zionist enemy's designs.
