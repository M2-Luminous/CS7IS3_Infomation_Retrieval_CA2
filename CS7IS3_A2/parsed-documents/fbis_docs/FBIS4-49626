"The coming negotiations are expected to focus on more than 1,200 agricultural products," said Chen Wu-hsiung, director of economics and planning development for the Council of Agriculture's [as received]. Chen added that the talks may also cover non- agriculture products. Chen, who will participate in the talks slated to begin May 12, said Taiwan will make some concessions in the consultations, but he declined to elaborate. The ROC delegation will be led by Vice Economic Affairs Minister Sheu Ke-sheng. The US is expected to ask Taiwan to lift its existing import bans and control measures, Chen said, but the Taiwan Government will insist on some sort of protection for local farmers. For instance, he said, import controls on citrus fruits, apples, and pears will not be eased until after the year 2000. The US first asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 8,048 products last November as a condition for Taiwan to enter the Geneva-based world trade body. It demanded Taiwan lower tariff rates on industrial products to below 10 percent and on agricultural goods to below 20 percent. The two sides failed to reach agreement in the first round of formal consultations held here in February. The talks failed after the US demanded a 50 percent tariff cut on all agricultural products, which was 20 percent higher than Taiwan's offer. Taiwan applied to join GATT in 1990 under the name "Customs territory of Taiwan, Kinmen and Matsu," and is expected to be admitted before the end of this year.
