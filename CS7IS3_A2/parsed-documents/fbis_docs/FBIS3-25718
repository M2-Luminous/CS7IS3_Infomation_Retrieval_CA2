The CAR agreed to assume this historic responsibility of peace broker at the request of Chadian President Idriss Deby. The talks are designed to restore peace in southern Chad. To demonstrate the CAR Government's willingness to play its mediating role, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Mandaba made a point of personally presiding over the opening ceremony which was attended by the leaders of the two delegations and members of the president's office as well as cabinet members, officials from the prime minister's office, the judiciary, the National Assembly, and representatives of the CAR political parties. Speaking on this occasion, the prime minister stated that the time had come to silence arms and give priority to dialogue. He called for the setting up of a follow-up committee to monitor the implementation of any accords that will be reached during the roundtable talks. He pointed out that the CAR and the Chadian people were interested in seeing these negotiations yield positive results. [Begin Mandaba recording] It is with much hope that, at your request, we have agreed to play the noble task of mediator between the government of President Deby and the delegation of the political-cum-military opposition movement based in southern Chad. The choice of the CAR was not made by chance since we share a long common border. We have always been a natural safe haven for our Chadian brothers. Our exchanges and relations in all sectors have been cordial and frank and our two countries have always resorted to dialogue in settling any border dispute in compliance with the OAU and UN principles and ideals. Chadian and CAR nationals have always worked hand in hand in their efforts to safeguard their common interests. [passage omitted] We hope that the two delegations did not come empty-handed and will not leave here empty-handed. That is why we strongly appeal to them to ensure that 1994 will be the year of peace, an indispensable factor for the much needed economic and political development of Chad.
