The infantry attacks were accompanied by the shelling of our defense lines and suburban settlements (?Glokotici), (?Prisic), Lukavica, and (Lukavica-Rijeka). The chetniks were particularly active between 2000 and 2200 hours when over 200 projectiles of various calibers landed on our lines and the aforementioned civilian settlements. This was followed by a ferocious infantry attack. By resisting successfully this attack, our fighters have liquidated a great number of Chetniks, who were left between the lines and are still lying there, which says enough about the enemy's attitude toward their dead soldiers. The late night saw a concentration of the Serbian forces and sporadic shelling. However, as of 0400 this morning the attacks have intensified. The aim of these enemy attacks is to gain control over important elevations (?Pribevine), Oblic, and Banjic in order to widen the security ring around Doboj. As of 0900 a general alarm has been in force in Gracanica.
