FR940907-0-00010 FR940907-0-00003 Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the rule that might suggest a need to modify the rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this AD will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this rule must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;03&hyph;AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing Amendment 39&hyph;8151 (57 FR 5379, February 14, 1992), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), Amendment 39&hyph;9021, to read as follows: AD 94&hyph;18&hyph;08 McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company (MDHC) and Hughes Helicopters, Inc.: Amendment 39&hyph;9021. Docket Number 93&hyph;SW&hyph;03&hyph;AD. Supersedes Priority Letter AD 92&hyph;22&hyph;14, issued October 16, 1992, and AD 92&hyph;02&hyph;15, Amendment 39&hyph;8151. Applicability: Model 369, 369A (OH&hyph;6A), 369D, E, F, FF, H, HE, HS, and HM series helicopters, equipped with the following tail rotor blades with bonded tail rotor abrasion strips (abrasion strips) installed, but without abrasion strip rivets (rivets) installed as described in paragraph (c) of this AD: part numbers (P/N) 421&hyph;088; 369A1613&hyph;7, &hyph;503, &hyph;505; 369D21606; 369D21613&hyph;11, &hyph;31, &hyph;41, &hyph;51; 369D21615, &hyph;21; or 369A1613&hyph;3M; and any of these P/N with a suffix (such as the letters ``M'' or ``M&hyph;STC'') added to the dash numbers, certificated in any category. Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously. To prevent the loss of abrasion strips, separation of the tail rotor, and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following: (a) Before the first flight of each day, until two rivets are installed as required by paragraph (c) of this AD, visually check each abrasion strip for any evidence of debonding along the entire abrasion strip bond line. This visual check may be performed by the owner/operator holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with sections 43.11 and 91.417 (a)(2)(v) of the Federal Aviation Regulations. (b) If performance of the visual check required by paragraph (a) results in evidence of debonding, conduct the following inspections before further flight: (1) Remove the tail rotor blade from the helicopter, and perform a dye-penetrant and a tap-test inspection in accordance with the applicable helicopter maintenance manual to ensure that the abrasion strip is secure. Note: MDHC Service Information Notice HN&hyph;197.2, DN&hyph;130.2, EN&hyph;19.2, and FN&hyph;17.1, dated March 23, 1987, contains additional information on the inspections required by paragraph (b). (2) If debonding is confirmed, remove the tail rotor blade from service and replace it with an airworthy blade, which has been modified by the installation of rivets. (c) Within 25 hours time-in-service or on or before 7 calendar days after the effective date of this AD, whichever comes first: (1) Inspect the tail rotor blades in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this AD, and if no evidence of debonding exists, install rivets in accordance with Part II of MDHC Service Information Notice (SIN) HN&hyph;232, DN&hyph;179, EN&hyph;70 and FN&hyph;57, dated September 27, 1991.
