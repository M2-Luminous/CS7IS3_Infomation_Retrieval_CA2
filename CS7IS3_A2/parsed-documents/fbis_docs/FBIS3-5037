FBIS3-5037 "dreas042_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-042 Document Type:Daily Report 3 Mar 1994 North Korea Newspapers React to Comments SK0303072794 SK0303072794 Article Type:BFN [Editorial Report] On 3 March, Seoul vernacular newspapers react to Tom Hubbard, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state, who expressed the hope that the "ROK would abolish the National Security Law." The conservative CHOSON ILBO on page 3 carries a 1,000-word editorial entitled "United States and the National Security Law." It first says that abolishing the National Security Law is not a matter that a third country can intervene in, and adds that, unlike what he has said, the law does not exist to hinder the promotion of human rights in the ROK, and that he should have been cautious in commenting anything on the ROK because he is a leading member of the U.S. delegation to the scheduled third round of North Korea-U.S. talks. Noting the possibility that North Korea persistently raised the issue concerning the National Security Law during the recent North Korea-U.S. negotiations, the editorial suspects that in a hasty effort to make North Korea accept nuclear inspections, the United States may have agreed during its negotiations with North Korea that it would later say something about the National Security Law. The editorial then concludes: "Hubbard made such remarks at a time it has been learned there may be some conflict or disharmony between the ROK and the United States concerning the North Korean nuclear issue. Such remarks may possibly make us an 'uneasy spectator.' This is the problem." The moderate HANGUK ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "True Intention of Hubbard, Who Hoped for the Abolition of the National Security Law." The editorial questions why he made such remarks at a time when North-South dialogue is about to resume. The editorial concludes that before expressing the hope that the National Security Law would be abolished, the United States should ask North Korea to "stop suppressing its people and abolish its criminal laws" which bear a resemblance to those of the Stalinist era. The moderate CHUNGANG ILBO carries on page 3 a 1,000-word editorial entitled "What a U.S. Official Should and Should Not Say." The editorial first says that his remarks are "inappropriate" and "undesirable." The editorial even suspects that the National Security Law may have been a topic in the negotiations between the United States and North Korea. The editorial concludes: "An ROK- U.S. cooperation system must be further strengthened to prevent a similar confusion in the future."
