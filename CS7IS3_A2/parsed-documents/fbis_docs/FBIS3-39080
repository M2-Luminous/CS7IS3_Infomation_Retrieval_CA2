Despite this calm assurance, European experts in Brussels do not hide the fact that they will be following these talks with the greatest attention. "So far, Tokyo has categorically refused to commit itself to actual import figures, but you never know what might happen. We could be forced to totally revise our approach," commented a close collaborator of European Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan. Sir Leon's staff explain that the Community, like the United States, intends to create a bigger opening in the Japanese market, but that it is totally opposed to the method chosen by Washington. "There is no question of negotiating import figures. On this point, we side fully with Japan." This is a position of principle that barely conceals the bitterness of certain officials in the face of the EC's powerlessness to impose the same concessions on Tokyo as the United States has done. This irritation is exacerbated by the fact that the concessions demanded by Washington are, generally speaking, "seriously discriminatory to European exports." "Take the example of semiconductors," stressed the expert. "The Japanese made assurances that the 20 percent of their market offered to imports was open to all countries, while everyone knew that a secret clause reserved this 20 percent for the United States." "Do not be impressed by the American song and dance," insists another expert nevertheless. "We continued to reduce our trade deficit with Japan last year." In other words, unless the "Clinton method" leads to a genuine success this weekend, Brussels should continue its strategy: Examine all the obstacles -- with Tokyo and on a sector by sector basis -- facing EC exporters and the ways of surmounting them. "Seven working meetings have already been held since January 1993, and we hope," stressed this expert, "to be able to report concrete results at the next interministerial meeting in late April."
