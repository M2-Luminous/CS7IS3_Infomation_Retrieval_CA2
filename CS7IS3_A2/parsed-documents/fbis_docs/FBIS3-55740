In a regular Monday radio interview he said that a country which cannot instill law and order on its own did not deserve independence. This was his response to the statement made by parliament speaker Vakhtang Goguadze Sunday that law and order could not prevail in Georgia unless Russian troops were called in and Georgia entered the ruble zone. Nevertheless, Shevardnadze admitted that there could be no law and order in Abkhazia and North Ossetia without Russian help. Shevardnadze noted that entry into the ruble zone should be given serious thought. In his words, the introduction of a national currency in Georgia was an erroneous and premature action. "The state and every family had to pay dearly for this," he emphasized. Shevardnadze said that during his visits to Turkey, France, and the U.S., and talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, he might seek advice of foreign statesmen on entry into the ruble zone.
