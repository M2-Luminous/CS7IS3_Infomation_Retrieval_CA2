We would like to recall that Manucharyan announced his intention to create a new analytic and sociopolitical structure intended to promote the settlement of the Karabakh problem. Moreover, he came out with sharp criticism against the activity of the republic's Ministry of Internal Affairs and proclaimed a categorical disagreement with the presidential edict on KGB reorganization. Since the criticism against the Ministry of Internal Affairs was of a general nature and new analytic centers of such a trend multiply very actively in Armenia, nothing promised a political storm. However, Vano Siradegyan, the republic's minister of internal affairs, unexpectedly took up arms against Manucharyan. He held a briefing, in the course of which scandalous information was promulgated. Thus, according to the minister, it turned out that the entire activity of the former national security adviser was directed against the republic's national interests and Manucharyan himself, being by nature a "remarkable schemer," almost seized real absolute power. According to Siradegyan, Manucharyan kept an eye on the KGB, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the army, and the tax inspectorate, placed his people in key posts in the Council of Ministers, in the Administration of Special Programs, who maintain communication with Karabakh, and in the Armenian Industrial Construction Bank, as well as "tried to seize national television." At the same time, Siradegyan recalled that Manucharyan played a destructive role in the previous Karabakh Committee, out of which the Armenian Pannational Movement grew subsequently. According to Siradegyan, it was Manucharyan who at one time broke up the planned combination and cooperation in the Karabakh question between the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia and the Armenian Pannational Movement. He enlisted many morally unscrupulous individuals from Komsomol organs in the movement and set prominent leaders of the Armenian Pannational Movement at loggerheads. Siradegyan asserted that Manucharyan did his utmost to cause a split between the present president and former prime minister Vazgen Manukyan. Furthermore, the opinion that power in Karabakh, allegedly, belongs to the Dashnaktsutyun Party has become popular since Manucharyan's service. However, in Siradegyan's opinion, power, not party-political, structures had real authority in Stepanakert. From Siradegyan's speech it became known that the former chief adviser contributed to the transformation of the KGB into a criminal commercial structure, under the aegis of which currency machinations flourished and illegal deals with arms and strategic materials, in particular with copper and aluminum, were conducted. With all this Manucharyan never sought to occupy a high, responsible post, preferring to remain in the background and to act through his puppets. Among the latter the following were named: Gevorg Vardanyan, former minister of state; Ambartsum Galstyan, former mayor of Yerevan; Vagan Shirkhakyan, former deputy minister of defense and adviser to the president, and many lower-ranking officials. According to Siradegyan's assertion, enjoying the high patronage of the chief adviser, all of them committed criminally punishable acts: They took diamonds and antiques out of Armenia, dictated the currency rate to the black market, transported stolen cars from Armenia to Georgia and back, and transferred currency funds abroad. In particular, with the participation of the former management of the Almaz Plant and with Vagan Shirkhakyan's help 2 million dollars were transferred to the United States and only recently part of the funds have been brought back with great difficulties. It was also declared that a certain "Moscow Armenian" manages the circulation of criminal money. As Vano Siradegyan said, the state succeeded with great difficulty to squeeze Manucharyan out of his positions and to rid ministries and departments of his influence, bringing them back under government control. The minister declared that all the individuals mentioned by him have long been in the focus of attention of operational services of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Their fault is so obvious that the only thing the procuracy can do is to institute criminal proceedings against them. The only person against whom this will not be simple to do is Manucharyan himself, who, as it appears, does not have the "harmful" habit of signing any documents. However, the minister expects that testimony will help to prove Manucharyan's guilt. Vano Siradegyan also noted that Ashot Manucharyan's present high activity and his attempt to again begin exerting influence on the solution of the Karabakh problem, undoubtedly, are instigated from without by forces, for which the existing social and political calm in Armenia is not advantageous and which do not want a stabilization of the situation in the conflict region. It is these forces that have brought to life the figure of the former adviser from political nonexistence. "It is ridiculous to say that foreign political problems can be solved at the party level and at the public level, as Manucharyan asserts," the minister stressed. "The poorly camouflaged attempt to again try to get back the lost influence and the opportunities connected with it lies behind all this." In general, in Siradegyan's opinion, in Armenia there is a widespread faulty practice, under which public figures, who have tarnished themselves, try to change their image, appearing as members of the opposition so that any actions against them may be perceived by the public as an attempt by the authorities to restrict civil liberties. The minister's admission of his intention to hold a briefing, of which he advised the president only at the very last moment, was also curious. Levon Ter-Petrosyan received this fact without enthusiasm, because he himself was not at all inclined to attach serious significance to Ashot Manucharyan's words and actions, considering him an unbalanced person. However, the head of the police department does not share such an approach, because, as he said, he sees well all the danger emanating from his former companion-in-arms. Therefore, by his own admission, he decided to "wash the dirty linen in public." The minister's revelations evoked the strongest public reaction in Armenia and placed the country on the brink of a criminal political scandal. A certain confusion is observed at the headquarters of the Armenian Pannational Movement. In principle, here people are in agreement with Siradegyan. However, they consider his action impulsive, unprepared, and capable of causing harm rather than good. In the camp of leftist Dashnaks and communists there is an unconcealed jubilation in connection with the self-exposure in the camp of their ideological opponents. Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, declared that, apparently, all this was the beginning of a big quarrel between two mafioso clans inside the Armenian Pannational Movement, with which, of course, opposition forces had nothing to do, and all the attempts to lend a political nature to what was going on were provocative. Ashot Navasardyan, chairman of the Republican Party, also agreed with this opinion. At the same time, he noted that, undoubtedly, forces seeking a destablization of the situation in Armenia stood behind Manucharyan. The transparent hint by the chief of the police department about some "Moscow Armenian" mixed up in mafia affairs seems not at all accidental. Not so long ago the Armenian minister and Serzh Dzhilovyan, a prominent Moscow businessman, exchanged very painful attacks. Dzhilovyan accused Siradegyan of organizing an attempt on his life, while Siradegyan, in turn, declared that the mafia itself (the minister also includes the businessman in it) sooner or later would eliminate Dzhilovyan and "Armenia will have nothing to do with this." The Moscow businessman's negative attitude toward Yerevan's present authorities and his desire to return to Armenia as a new leader are not concealed in the least. Furthermore, the phrase about Manucharyan's "Komsomol entourage," probably, was by no means accidental. A hint about Suren Arutyunyan, former Komsomol boss, later former first secretary of the Communist Party of Armenia, and a prominent representative of Russian-American business, is noted here. Moreover, it is no secret that in the question of the solution of the Karabakh problem Manucharyan has always been inclined to use Moscow's recommendations. Incidentally, the republic's present leadership is also inclined to follow the Kremlin's advice and not only in the sphere of foreign policy. Therefore, it is possible that certain forces in Russia, indeed, have decided to use Manucharyan's figure in their interests. There is nothing strange in all this. It is only surprising that this circumstance has become the cause of such a sharp and prompt reaction. Many people in Yerevan assume that this is connected with the fact that Manucharyan possessed information compromising a number of figures in the present presidential entourage and was preparing to promulgate it at a convenient moment. Therefore, the minister of internal affairs simply tries to forestall Manucharyan's blow. At the same time, the compromise, evidently, concerns mainly the Department of Internal Affairs. Possibly, that is why the minister's actions were of a spontaneous, not completely thought out, nature. After all, as it was accurately clarified, the president, in fact, did not know about Siradegyan's intentions until the last moment and found out about the specific content of the briefing only after it ended. At some moment it seemed that Levon Ter-Petrosyan would make a statement, in which he would dissociate himself from individual pronouncements by his minister, especially on matters of a foreign political nature. However, this did not happen. Probably, the president decided to "remain above the skirmish" for the time being. On the other hand, on the same day ambassador at large David Shakhnazaryan met with Russian and U.S. ambassadors and it may be assumed that these talks were far from simple. In a private conversation with a person from the presidential entourage, Manucharyan himself expressed surprise at Siradegyan's action and stressed that he did not intend at all to go over to the opposition, but only aimed at strengthening the intellectual aspect in the discussion of the problem of Nagornyy Karabakh. Meanwhile, there is no doubt that the "skirmish" will take place and very soon at that. Ambartsum Galstyan, Yerevan's former mayor, has already announced his intention to hold his own press conference and to expose the abuses in the system of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Moreover, many former members of the Karabakh Committee are preparing to make a joint statement. The parliamentary opposition is about to send a whole series of questions to the government and the procuracy. In turn, the procuracy is also not inclined to fulfill the minister's recommendations and to hastily institute criminal proceedings. As experience shows, the procurator-general, whose removal Siradegyan, in fact, demanded during the briefing, is not afraid to enter into complex relations with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Therefore, the retaliatory attack on Siradegyan promises to be a mass attack and the moment when the president will have to have his say in order to calm passions is inevitable. The piquancy of the existing situation lies in the fact that, according to the results of the quarrel, this say may by no means be in support of the still strong minister.
