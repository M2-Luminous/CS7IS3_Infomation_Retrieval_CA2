The cooperative farms in the plain have tilled vast tracts of paddy and non-paddy fields in a few days by raising the operation rate of the tractors. The plain, known as a granary on the West Coast, covers broad areas of Chongdan, Yonan and Paechon counties, South Hwanghae Province, the central western part of Korea. In the preliberation days the peasants there toiled with dull hoes and wooden ploughs. The comprehensive mechanization of agriculture, which began making a rapid development after the publication of the socialist rural theses in February 1964, has now reached the stage of completion. In Paechon County the number of the tractors increased 3.1 times, lorries 7.4 times, rice harvestors 10 times and weeding machines 15 times over the past twenty years with the constant supply of modern farm machines. The agricultural working people of the plain do nearly all categories of farm work ranging from ploughing to rice seedling plucking, rice transplanting, weeding, manuring and harvesting with machines. Each cooperative farm in the plain has nearly one hundred technicians and experts. Of late the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il sent 500 tractors and some 250 lorries to the cooperative farms in the plain so as to further consolidate the material and technical foundations of agriculture. The rural villages of plain have turned into modern socialist rural communities good to work and live in; they hold a big share in the nation's grain production. Last year tens of thousands of more tons of grain was produced than in the previous year in the plain.
