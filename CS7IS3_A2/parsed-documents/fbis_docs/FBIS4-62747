Rutskoy and his associates to overthrow the present "police" regime before the 50th anniversary of Victory Day, have not passed unnoticed in the Kremlin. V. Shumeyko, speaker of the upper chamber of parliament, came to see President B. Yeltsin about this incident 17 May, and he was closely followed by Premier V. Chernomyrdin. V. Shumeyko told your IZVESTIYA correspondent that during their discussion about the problem of ensuring stability in society, opinion had been unanimous: Any actions by intransigent elements that violate Russian Federation laws and the Russian Federation Constitution must be stopped. For example, with regard to the burning of the national flag: Video footage showed specific individuals, and the Prosecutor's Office should initiate criminal proceedings immediately. The same applies to A. Rutskoy's appeals. Extremely gross violations of the Constitution and Russian laws are plainly evident, and these cannot be allowed to occur without some sort of reaction from the authorities. Of course, the problem of meeting the commitments agreed under the Treaty of Accord was also discussed, V. Shumeyko said. At issue are the principles of establishing an observer commission to implement this document. Unless both chambers of parliament take part in forming the commission, the operation will be impossible. It is most likely that the commission will include representatives of the most influential and largest political forces. The commission chairman, I think, should be a politically neutral person who is prepared to accept proposals from any political group. Academician Topornin figures in this list, but I would not like to deflect him from his business in the Public Chamber, V. Shumeyko stressed.
