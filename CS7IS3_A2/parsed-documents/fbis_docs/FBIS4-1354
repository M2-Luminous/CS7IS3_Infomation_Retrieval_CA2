Out of this total, 63,000 metric tons will serve Lagos, some states located in south-western part of the country, central and north-western part of the country, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said in an official statement, a copy of which was delivered Tuesday to AFP. The remaining 40,000 tons would be destined for the eastern part of the country, where there is "a lean stock", said the text, signed by the official spokesman of the NNPC, Edem Duke. More imports have also been ordered for next month to augment supplies to the southwestern part of the country, where Lagos, the nation's economic capital, accounts for more than 60 percent of vehicles in the country. In addition to the imports, a substantial quantity from the two refineries in Port Harcourt will be used to service the eastern part. The old Port Harcourt refinery with a capacity of about 150,000 barrels per day, which has been down for about four years due to fire that damaged some parts of it, is now operating at 64 percent capacity, while the new one, located alongside the other, is now functioning at full capacity, said the same statement.
