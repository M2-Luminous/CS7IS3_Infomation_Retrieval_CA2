According to a decision of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's [FRY] Supreme Command, 16 June has been proclaimed Yugoslav Army Day and it will be celebrated for the first time this year. Prompted by this, we asked Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff Colonel-General Momcilo Perisic for an interview. General, at the beginning of our conversation I would like to congratulate you on the holiday. August will mark the first anniversary of your appointment as chief of general staff. [Word indistinct] one of the youngest generals at the head of the army, among the army leadership. Tell me, what are your war experiences? [Perisic] Yes, the war found me in Zadar, in the post of commander of the Artillery Training Center. The Artillery Training Center was situated in a facility that was not convenient for training and molding future officers because antagonism in the environment was evident to the extent that freedom of movement was limited. Later, when the situation had escalated, and when the Yugoslav Army, that is, the Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] was proclaimed to be the occupying force in the region of Croatia, clashes broke out which drew the army -- despite its wishes and will -- into the war. Of course, in Zadar -- where we possessed immense knowledge, extremely capable people, and top-of-the-line technology -- we had to accept this war only after the lives of people who were there became endangered. Since I headed the training center, and since I was trained to nurture the greatest responsibility, the most humane responsibility which involves caring for the people I am responsible for, I -- together with these people -- had to oppose them because their lives were in danger [sentence as heard]. And of course, in the course of opposing them, since we were far superior in terms of training and technology, we won and forced the Ustasha units to comply with all the conditions we had set them. They complied with these conditions, and even engaged their people for many things [sentence as heard]. Therefore, we left Zadar together with all the hardware, personal property, and the entire education material base [nastavno materijalna baza] and mobile infrastructure. We did not leave anything for the Ustashas. Of course, after leaving Zadar, the Artillery Training Center was relocated to Sarajevo, and after the new education center was installed, I was transferred to eastern Herzegovina and appointed commander of the Bileca Corps, which later evolved into the Herzegovina Corps. Consequently, since I had already learned the war lesson, I undertook a series of preventive measures to avoid putting the people of eastern Herzegovina -- that is, the people who accepted the JNA as their own -- in a position similar to the one we had been in in Zadar, that is, in the region of Croatia. Of course, thanks to the extremely high degree of awareness of the Herzegovina people, the Montenegrin people, and the Serbian people -- which at the time aided the armed struggle and provided the material backing for it -- we succeeded in defending the area from the onslaught of the Ustasha hordes, and in saving material goods. I stayed there until the FRY was constituted, and until the JNA was ordered to withdraw from those areas to the FRY. [Petrusic] Your friends say that you are a modest and decisive man, which became evident in this war. With this experience, you were appointed to head the Yugoslav Army General Staff, at a time when Yugoslavia is in peace and is striving for peace? [Perisic] If professional soldiers were to decide in matters of war and peace, they would always opt for peace, because it is professionals who know best what war entails and what it takes away, that is, how extensive material destruction can be. Unfortunately, soldiers were never the ones to decide whether there was or was not going to be war, and of course, as a professional army, we carried out the orders of the state structures and implemented political decisions. [Petrusic] General, what forms the basis of the new process of establishing the Yugoslav Army, the new Yugoslav Army, and what is the doctrinal approach to the country's defense? [Perisic] The transformation and the establishment of the Yugoslav Army is primarily based on state control over national defense, that is, All National Defense [Opste Narodna Odbrana], and on the new military doctrine and all other positive regulations. The essence is for us to remain masters in our own home, which means defending the territorial integrity of the FRY people, that is, Serbs and Montenegrins, and all other national minorities because this is a civic state. It is important to maximally develop the defense capability of society as a whole, and particularly the combat readiness of the army, not in the sense of deploying this army outside the FRY borders, but rather as one of the possible ways of deterring any aggressor from undertaking measures that would endanger the country's security. [Petrusic] You mentioned the transformation of the army. Tell me, in what phase it is now, and what is your view of the transformation? [Perisic] The transformation of the Yugoslav Army is based on a series of realistic factors that we examined studiously and then -- in terms of quality and quantity -- dimensioned the army in such a way that it completely corresponds to our doctrines, that is, so that it provides protection for our country's population. We primarily had in mind the real danger threatening us from abroad; furthermore, we had in mind our realistic material potential, human resources, and birth rate. In addition to this, we needed to dimension the JNA -- which actually provided the basis for creating the Yugoslav Army -- in such a way that, through organizational and structural changes, in a new environment, we could create units that in peacetime are capable of preventing surprises, yet at the same time flexible enough to create, in wartime and in a short period of time, a massive army. Of course, the transformation of the army is an ongoing process, a process that encompasses everything from organizational and structural changes, to the modernization of weaponry and equipment and the army's visual identity. [Petrusic] A good part of the military industry remained on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. Could this present a problem for us today, for the military industry of the FRY? [Perisic] Certainly, the loss of territory and installations of the military industry is a problem for the current Yugoslav Army and the overall defense capabilities of society. However, by carrying out an organized evacuation, we managed to retrieve most facilities and to salvage all our technical documentation. Thus, parallel to carrying out the transformation of the Yugoslav Army, we are also securing conditions in domestic companies for the manufacture of equipment vital for waging an armed conflict. [Petrusic] There was mention of our industry's new weapons. Can you say something about this? What type of weapons are we talking about? [Perisic] Well, the modernization refers primarily to modernization of the combat training system and supplying the army with new hardware, that is, weapons and systems. In the course of this period we managed to replace or substitute the manufacture of equipment we used to have until recently, either by modernizing or by utilizing collective scientific knowledge in order to develop new systems that substitute the systems we used to manufacture, but with far better features, that is, with far better combat specifications. [Petrusic] I believe that the need to defend the country is greater than ever. Is the budget adequate to this need? [Perisic] Since our country is under economic blockade, and since a war was waged and is still being waged on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, all this has had an adverse effect on our general economic potential, and thus also on the Yugoslav Army. Anyone who forgets the connection between the country's economic potential and the financial resources earmarked for the Army is being unrealistic. That is why the budget earmarked for the Yugoslav Army precisely correlates to the amount society could set aside and that is 7.43 percent of the estimated national product. [Petrusic] General, there has been criticism of the new Yugoslav Army that it has retained certain features of the army of the former Yugoslavia? What is the basis for such opinions? [Perisic] Since our country has introduced a multiparty system and since many leaders would like to have an army tailored to their wishes, consequently, not all of these wishes can be fulfilled. The most dangerous thing for the Army, any army in a multiparty society, is to have a political party interfering with the Army's personnel policy. Therefore, the fiercest criticism is precisely directed at the fact that the Army -- through the process of transformation -- has been depoliticized, thus creating a barrier preventing parties from influencing the Army's personnel policy. Moreover, we devote a lot of attention to the Army's personnel policy and perhaps the greatest contribution to the Army's transformation is that we now appoint extremely capable people to command the units of the Yugoslav Army -- people who posses a high quotient of knowledge, capability, dignity, and pride, and who are ready and capable of foreseeing events and making decisions appropriate to both the combat readiness of their particular unit and our society's overall potential. [Petrusic] You once said that a good commander was one who does not surrender and does not allow himself to be deceived? [Perisic] One of the very important things in the education and training of officers was, and still is, to ensure that they are extremely honest toward their own people and their troops, yet at the same time extremely cunning with respect to the enemy. I usually say that you must have a multitude of faces for the enemy, while you must have only one face for your own soldier and your people. It is only in this way that an officer can succeed in motivating and leading people in carrying out orders, in peacetime and particularly in wartime. However, unfortunately, owing to incorrect training of officers in the JNA, all of their capability was directed at training them to organize themselves and lead the army in a way designed to defend the country from external enemies, not counting on the possibility of an internal enemy. Because they were naive, many of them acted in a way they should not have. Of course, in the course of this civil war, starting with Slovenia through to Bosnia, many officers were not up to their duties, and they got what they deserved. I would like to stress that every unit of the JNA that was headed by a capable officer lost neither manpower, hardware, nor surrendered. Everything that the Croats and Slovenes accomplished, they accomplished through deceit, certainly not through armed combat. [Petrusic] How much attention is devoted today to the issue of patriotism? [Perisic] Patriotism is a quality that develops and grows throughout one's life. The extent to which this is developed in the educational process is reflected in the Yugoslav Army. It is a very important quality, I might even say virtue, in the Yugoslav Army, without which an assignment cannot be successfully carried out. Therefore, in some important aspects, the officers -- and I particularly stress this -- must be proven patriots. This means that an officer is ready to help his people in their most difficult moments, that he is in a position to share the people's fate, and that he is ready for the greatest sacrifices. We have had many such officers throughout our history. We had them in both World War I and II, and even in this war, and -- owing to their high degree of patriotism -- they ultimately succeeded in defending the people who accepted them as their own. [Petrusic] How important is it for all of us -- not only the Army -- to defend national interests? To contribute? Is this generally the case in society today? [Perisic] The degree to which the FRY's social structures are ready to defend their country should be tested in practice, yet that it impossible without war. Since we are fighting for peace and not for war, we actually cannot discuss this without drawing on the conclusions and experience gained by the people in the Srpska republic and the republic of Serbian Krajina in the course of their resistance. Therefore, we know that there is a high degree [of readiness to defend their country] over there. The resistance encompasses all structures of society and both armies; they succeeded in carrying out all tasks. Unfortunately, many structures have, in a certain way, isolated themselves because they resorted to the line of least resistance, which is why we have a lot of people both from the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Srpska republic, that have moved to other areas, where they lead a comfortable life and often boast that they are helping their people, yet the truth is they would help them most if they were with them. This applies equally to all structures, and particularly to intellectual structures. In addition to this, there is a number of relevant factors that -- owing to ignorance or intentionally -- prompt people to criticize their own army because they do not see it as their own. They have forgotten the lesson of history that says that it is always better to have and feed thousands of one's own troops, than a single foreign troop. [Petrusic] NATO and the United States troops are in close proximity to our territory. As a military expert, can you give me your interpretation of their presence, their presence in close proximity to our territory? Can this presence threaten our security, and to what extent? [Perisic] You know that NATO is an alliance created to protect the interests of its member states. Therefore, it certainly ought to be in the service of all these countries equally. However, it has opted for serving the interests of only one country which is the architect of the new world order. Theretofore, it is quite clear that it has been abused in a certain sense, and after all, its raison d'etre after the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact is pointless, unless it wishes to continue doing what it is doing now. Many NATO operatives have been stationed in the vicinity of the FRY with the aim of supporting the forces that were actively involved first in the disintegration of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and are now actively involved in the attack on the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the Serbian Republic. Since they are in the immediate vicinity -- I mean the operatives -- they are indirectly threatening the security of the FRY. However, we need to know that they have not come here only to help the secessionist forces, but also to create pressure on our country. Our country is under a multifold blockade; on the one hand, it is under complete economic blockade, and on the other hand, it is surrounded by NATO vessels that are in a certain sense threatening the security of the FRY. [Perisic] We have lots of experience because, throughout the four-year-long war fought by our fellow men outside the FRY, we have been made aware that their presence can -- in a sudden change of sorts -- bring into question the security of the FRY. For this reason we have been implementing certain measures to prevent any kind of surprise. [Petrusic] NATO planes have been violating Yugoslav airspace. After all, there are documents regarding this in the United Nations. Tell me, what is the tolerance threshold and your opinion on it. Why is this happening? They have been warned. [Perisic] The civil war on the territory of the SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia] started primarily due to the influence from abroad, of course with a skillful manipulation of internal contradictions. Since this civil war is based primarily on religious, ethnic, and -- one would say -- other antagonisms, then the danger exists of it spreading to the territory of the FRY according to a similar principle. Since the creators of the new world order in their scheming had, of course, not counted on the heroic resistance of the people in the two Krajinas, they were in a way stopped, and that process was thwarted. If we are united to the degree necessary for the defense of one's own ethnic entity, then we can stop that process. Bearing all this in mind, the FRY is optimally committed to ending the war in Bosnia as soon as possible, and in that respect is giving optimal support to all peace-loving forces in the world toward preventing the spillover of the war toward the East, that is, to this area. [Petrusic] How do you assess the recent Navy exercises? [Perisic] Although the Navy is going through extremely difficult times because the infrastructure has remained on the territory of Croatia, it has still managed in a relatively short period of time to build enough of the infrastructure and material base for a successful build-up of combat readiness. Tactical exercises involving live ammunition were held to that end, to test to what degree the Navy is capable and ready under new conditions and with a new organization to defend the territorial integrity of its theater of operations, that is, our part of the coastline and territorial waters. [Petrusic] Mr. General, they are constantly threatening us. They have been threatening us with sanctions, they have been threatening us with bombing. Is there any cause for fear? [Perisic] Of course, when our social entity is endangered, there has to be some kind of fear. However, we have been shown throughout history and the present war fought by our fellow men in the republic of Serbian Krajina and the Serb republic, under extremely unfavorable circumstances, that for four years they have been successfully defending their territorial integrity, and that they have been resisting a far more numerous enemy supported by the world media -- not only in the moral sense but also logistically, even through the use of the air force. We can conclude that in this region the Serbian and Montenegrin soldiers and the Serbian and Montenegrin people, and other ethnic minorities, are ready and capable of defending themselves with, of course, the help of the Yugoslav Army. [Petrusic] Vlada Popovski, defense minister of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], has recently said that the Yugoslav Army has been instigating conflicts, and that the Yugoslav Army troops have been amassing on the border. What kind of conflicts is this about? [Perisic] As we know, Macedonia [as heard] has accepted on its territory the UN forces, among which the U.S. troops are in the majority. Of course, they are not there to protect the Macedonian people but to form their own bases, and to help them in securing the borders since the Macedonians have neither troops enough nor material means enough to build a more modern army. Quite frequently during this help in the border security -- out of ignorance but most often out of misinformation as to where the border exactly is, since the border is only administrative, and not fixed -- the U.S. soldiers quiet often stray and enter the territory of the FRY. Every such entry has been registered, some have been prevented and even detained without any incidents. However, since someone in the world wants to turn any border violation into an incident, we have often been accused of that. In that sense I have had several meetings with the UN commander in Macedonia, warning him of the frequent violations of the border, and he has been promising that it would not happen again. However, I am not sure that many of these violations are not deliberate. As for the accusations that the Yugoslav Army has been amassing forces along the border with Macedonia, that is a mere media lie. [Petrusic] There have been similar accusations concerning the border with Albania. [Perisic] The border with Albania is somewhat different, even though the borders with Albania and the western part of Macedonia where the population is mostly Albanian is similar as far as border violations are concerned, since young men from Kosovo and Metohija and even the Raska region [Sandzak], that is, Albanians and Muslims, are mostly avoiding serving with the Yugoslav Army. However, since they have illusions about a forceful secession, they have been sending these young men for training to various centers abroad through various channels, and upon their return -- to test their training and to bring in a large amount of arms, they enter our country illegally -- and now, since they are most often prevented by the members of border units, there are incidents. [sentence as heard] These incidents most frequently amount to their using arms when they are stopped by our border patrols whilst crossing the border illegally and, naturally, when someone tries to physically liquidate our members defending our borders he is met with an adequate response, and unfortunately these incidents frequently end in serious consequences for those trying to cross illegally, which again the world, which is not inclined toward us, has been using very effectively in the media propaganda against our country. [Petrusic] The foreign media says that there is a possibility of transferring the hot spot of war to Kosovo. This is aided by the statements, for example, by Ibrahim Rugova, who on his recent tour of Europe, in France, to be precise, asked for a protectorate of the international community in Kosovo, which implies the presence of a military force, that is, NATO. To what degree is the Yugoslav Army today a factor of stability on the south of Serbia? [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army is a factor of stability of Yugoslavia as a whole, and thus the stability in the region of Kosovo-Metohija, thanks also, of course, to other elements and the people's support. However, I personally believe that an average Albanian, that is a Shqiptar in Kosovo, would never choose the war options because he can see clearly enough what is happening in regions where people are trying to resolve something by force. Second, they can also clearly see what the living standards of their compatriots in Albania are in comparison with Kosovo. It suffices to climb mountains bordering Albania to realize what a vast difference there is between the economic might and standard of living of Shqiptars on this and on that side of the border, for the Shqiptars in Kosovo-Metohija live at least ten times better than their compatriots in Albania. I believe that all they have been creating under the fold of the FRY, in the former SFRY, and Serbia today, is such material wealth that they would certainly not want to lose in some showdown not of their own choosing, a showdown that could be imposed by their leaders. But they were wise enough not to have accepted this. If they had, they would have lost so much. They are aware of this, so I do not believe such a thing could happen. Even if it does, the army and militia in Kosovo, as well as other social factors, will be ready and able to defend the territorial integrity of the their own country. [Petrusic] The situation on the territory of the former Bosnia-Herzegovina is very tense. How do you see the denouement of the situation from the military-political point of view? And, do you think that the Serbian Republic can defend itself from an even greater aggression by the Muslim-Croatian federation, and to what extent? [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army and the FRY leadership are making tremendous efforts through various international factors and through political and military factors in Bosnia to effect peace there as soon as possible, because we know that only peace, not any kind of peace but a just peace, can put an end to destruction and halt the suffering of all three peoples. However, there can be no peace if all three sides are not equally determined to achieve it. Will there be fresh aggression, an offensive of wider proportions? I am certain that a major offensive is a realistic possibility if the international factors that contributed and even caused the civil war in Bosnia do not exert pressure on the Muslims and Croats. I am sure that it will not be more successful than the ones so far, and you know that all of them ended in failure. The results of the fighting so far are after all a clear picture of that. This proves that the army has done whatever it could under extremely difficult conditions and has successfully resisted all offensives for three years. If these Muslim-Croat forces, the Muslim-Croat coalition, were to be aided by certain international factors, especially NATO, then the situation would naturally be by far more difficult. However, I believe that the international community will not allow such a thing to happen, and if it did, the consequences would be disastrous, not only the for the people of the Serbian Republic, but for the entire population of the Balkans, Europe, and even further afield. [Petrusic] Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has said on many occasions recently, as has Croatian UN Ambassador Nobilo, that they would return Krajina into Croatia's borders and the state system by force. What do you think about these threats? [Perisic] In view of the fact that there has been a political rift in the Republic of Croatia and that Tudjman is losing ground, everything is possible. He could push the Croatian nation into another war in a desperate attempt to hold on to power. What the chances are to return the Republic of Serbian Krajina into Croatia's borders by forces are perfectly clear from the operations on its borders so far. Even though they engaged the entire country with the help from the international community in a war against a far smaller nation, they did not manage to do anything. The Serbs have managed to protect their territorial integrity and did not allow deeper incursions to be made. [Petrusic] We are all witnesses of a parties' struggle for power. Even foreign powers are being called to help in this. Can you tell us to what extent can this inter-party bickering affect the Yugoslav Army and to what extent has the Yugoslav Army protected itself from internal political divisions? [Perisic] It is obvious that the unity of the country is inevitably reflected on the unity of an army. The army is a social category that in every country, ours included, to a greater or lesser degree reflects developments in society. The stronger the consensus between parties on vital issues of importance for the survival of a nation, normally the more positively this is reflected in the overall situation in the army, particularly its combat morale. The stronger the disunity, the stronger influence it has over the army, but as we have said, the army has been depoliticized, it has gotten a well-built defense mechanism for the prevention of such negative influences, I think that the party influence on the overall combat readiness of the army is marginal. [Petrusic] People talk about a professional army? Do you think that a partial professionalization of the army has become a necessity? [Perisic] Every army in the world, including ours, is partly professional, because we have permanent and temporary staff. The permanent staff are officers, noncommissioned officers, and civilians in the army. The temporary staff are soldiers doing their military service. To be more specific, we are currently involved in the process of turning the army into a professional army. According to the number of the professional soldiers, there are considerably more of them now than in the Yugoslav People's Army. However, disproportion between the needs and capabilities has also arisen in this sphere. This means that we need to professionalize the army as much as possible, but society's potential is small. This is, after all, reflected in the budget, and we cannot have so many people, so many paid soldiers, or as we say, we cannot have so many professional soldiers on contract. Naturally, the level of professionalization will grow with economic growth and the increase of our country's general potential. [Petrusic] Mr. General, can you tell us something about the FRY Army's current level of combat readiness to defend the country from possible aggression. [Perisic] The Yugoslav Army peacetime force is qualitatively and quantitatively completely equipped to prevent any surprises. By evaluating and analyzing situations, it is always capable of taking adequate measures to prevent any surprises, even under the most adverse conditions. This means that only a very short period of time is necessary to transform the peacetime force into a war-time force of over 500,000 men, which is completely sufficient to protect the nation from foreign threats of any kind. [Petrusic] And finally, a personal question. How strenuous and difficult is it to be the chief of the General Staff of the Yugoslav Army today? [Perisic] It is not easy to be the chief of the general staff of an army that, if I may say so, has inherited many negative traits from the Yugoslav People's Army, nor is it easy under the present economic conditions, in the present ongoing war situation on our borders. Had the conditions been any better, I probably would not have been given this job, but considering that the situation is very complex, I came and accepted this duty for three important reasons. The first is to prevent, together with other elements of society, a civil war in this region, as the enemy has created such a scenario. According to that scenario, it has achieved everything it wanted on the territory of the former SFRY, using primarily the Yugoslavs in the realization of its aims. Using the same principle, it wants to accomplish other aims in this region. However, thanks to the substantial role played by all factors, including the Yugoslav Army -- perhaps its role in this is the most important -- we have avoided this civil war. Naturally, the danger of that has not vanished, but I hope that we will overcome that. The second reason for accepting the post of chief of the General Staff is that I wanted to prevent decent people -- who are in the majority in the army, there are over 90 percent -- from being unjustifiably attacked by, for example, an irresponsible military leadership. I think that we have had much success in this, because I believe the current General Staff gives no reason for other Yugoslav Army members to be attacked because of our mistakes or some other omissions. And the third reason I have accepted the post of chief of the General Staff is to help preserve the social character of the Yugoslav Army and the social being of our nation that is now more imperiled than ever before in its history. I think that, together with other elements of our society, in which the role of the media, and others, is not insignificant, and in which I would say this role is very important, we can present the Yugoslav Army for what it is and not present it as better or worse than it actually is for various interests. One should be completely objective, critically objective. The assessment of the Army will help us a lot. Uncritical and tendentious attitudes, which do exist, are hindering us in many ways. [Petrusic] Mr. General, I wish you much success in performing your current duties. Thank you for this interview. [Perisic] Thank you. I would like to urge all the viewers throughout the FRY to help their soldiers as much as they can to overcome the problems that the Yugoslav Army and our society face at present, and through firm and unbreakable links with the Yugoslav Army, help it become an army that will certainly be a guarantor of freedom and peace.
