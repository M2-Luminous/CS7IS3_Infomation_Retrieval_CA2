FR941028-0-00086 FR941028-0-00009 Under the provisions of final §773.25, the existence of the violation at the time it was cited could also be challenged in a proceeding under 30 CFR part 775 (involving administrative or judicial appeals of permitting decisions), unless the challenger has failed to take timely advantage of a prior opportunity to litigate the violation or is bound by a previous administrative or judicial determination concerning the existence of the violation. In addition, certain minimal changes have been made to the proposed rule with respect to the submission of documents in the proof of challenges. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of proposed §773.26 provided that certified copies of corporate documents and certified copies of documents filed with or issued by State, Municipal, or Federal government agencies could be submitted. Paragraphs (c)(2)(i)(B) and (c)(2)(i)(C) of final §773.25 clarify that copies of such documents can be submitted only ``if certified.'' Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D) of final §773.25 provides for a challenger's submission of an opinion of counsel in support of his or her position. Such opinion would be appropriate for submission when it is supported by evidentiary materials; when it is rendered by an attorney who certifies that he or she is qualified to render an opinion of law; and when counsel states that he or she has personally and diligently investigated the facts of the matter or where counsel states that such opinion is based upon information which has been supplied to counsel and which is assumed to be true. In accordance with the discussion above, the proposed rule has been renumbered as final rule §773.25 and adopted as modified. Deferral of action on proposed §773.27_Periodic Check of Ownership or Control Information . In the September, 1991 proposed rule package, OSM proposed this section which would have required that the regulatory authority engage in periodic review of a permitted site to assure that basic ownership and control information contained in the current official record of the permit was and remains complete and accurate. Subsequent to the publication of that proposal, OSM published a modified version of such proposal as part of a comprehensive rule proposal designed to address permit information requirements; ownership or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34666 (June 28, 1993). OSM intends to address the proposed rule within the context of the subsequent rulemaking. Accordingly, OSM defers any decision with respect to this proposed rule. 3. Part 778_Permit Applications_Minimum Requirements for Legal, Financial, Compliance, and Related Information Deferral of action on proposed §778.13_Identification of Interests. In the September, 1991 proposal, OSM proposed to revise the provisions of paragraphs (c) and (d) of then current 30 CFR 778.13 to clarify that permit applicants would be required to disclose relevant information with respect to both ``deemed'' and ``presumed'' owners or controllers within the meaning of the definitions of ``owned or controlled'' and ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5 (a) and (b), respectively. Subsequent to the publication of that proposal, OSM published a new proposed amendment to 30 CFR 778.13 as part of the comprehensive rule proposal cited above which was designed to address permit information requirements; ownership or control; and the transfer, assignment and sale of permit rights. See 58 FR 34652, 34668 (June 28, 1993). Accordingly, OSM hereby defers any decision with respect to the amendments proposed to 30 CFR 778.13 in today's rulemaking. Instead, OSM will address proposed amendments to 30 CFR 778.13 within the context of that subsequent proposal. Section 778.14_Violation information. The proposed amendment would have provided that the introductory language in paragraph (c) of 30 CFR 778.14 be amended to require a permit applicant to disclose all violation notices received by the applicant within the preceding three years. In addition, such introductory language would have been amended to require the disclosure of all outstanding violation notices for any surface coal mining operation that is deemed or presumed to be owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who is deemed or presumed to own or control the applicant under definitions of ``owned or controlled'' or ``owns or controls'' under 30 CFR 773.5. The regulation to be amended required the applicant to disclose violations of various laws listed in 30 CFR 778.14(c). Use of the proposed amended definition of ``violation notice'' from 30 CFR 773.5 would have obviated the need for such a list. The regulation to be amended further required that the applicant provide only a list of unabated cessation orders and unabated air and water quality violation notices received prior to the date of the application by any surface coal mining and reclamation operation owned or controlled by either the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant. With respect to this second list, that regulation did not require that an applicant list notices of violation received or unpaid penalties or fees incurred by any surface coal mining operation owned or controlled by the applicant or by any person who owns or controls the applicant.
