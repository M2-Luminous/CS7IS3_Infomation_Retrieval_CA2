(c) If persons who reported and paid royalty do not reconcile between themselves any differences in royalty payment obligations arising as a result of a reallocation as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each person who pays royalties for the lease must report and pay any additional royalties due, or file a request for refund or credit in accordance with the requirements of this subpart to recover the excess payment, as applicable. Any person who reports additional royalties due for the prior sales month must pay interest pursuant to 30 CFR 218.54 on the underpayment from the last day of the month following the sales month until the date the additional royalties are paid. §230.458 Unauthorized credit adjustments. (a) If a person reports a credit adjustment on Form MMS&hyph;2014 that results in a credit before MMS approves the recoupment pursuant to §230.455, and if the credit adjustment does not qualify as one of the transactions not subject to section 10 as provided in §230.461, then that person has taken an unauthorized credit adjustment. (1) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that MMS received more than 2 years before the date MMS received the Form MMS&hyph;2014 which includes the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person must repay the amount recouped plus late payment interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the unauthorized recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. Unless the person filed a request for refund or credit pursuant to §230.453 within 2 years of the making of the excess payment for which the unauthorized credit adjustment was reported, the excess payment is not subject to refund or recoupment. (2) If the unauthorized credit adjustment recouped a payment that MMS received less than 2 years before the date MMS received the Form MMS&hyph;2014 with the unauthorized credit adjustment, the person must repay the amount recouped plus late payment interest determined pursuant to 30 U.S.C. 1721(a) and 30 CFR 218.150 from the date the unauthorized recoupment was taken until the date it is repaid. The report of the unauthorized credit adjustment on the Form MMS&hyph;2014 does not constitute a request for refund or credit that tolls the 2-year period in section 10(a), 43 U.S.C. 1339(a). The person may file a request for refund or credit pursuant to section 230.453 for the payment for which the unauthorized credit adjustment was reported. MMS will review the request pursuant to the requirements of this subpart only if the request for refund or credit is received within 2 years of the making of the original payment for which the unauthorized credit adjustment was reported. (b) A person who reports an unauthorized credit adjustment to MMS on a Form MMS&hyph;2014 will be assessed $500 for each unauthorized credit adjustment reported. §230.459 Stopping or tolling of the section 10(a) 2-year period.
