[Weiss] The coalition government is a certain experiment in Slovakia. Our most recent political tradition did not know this form of government before. From this viewpoint, it is good that we have made this experience, and not only for reasons of the development of political culture. It also means an enrichment for political entities, which are forced to build on what they have in common and not on what divides them. It requires the ability to talk and harmonize views. We have been successful in that so far, even if things were not ideal. When looking back at the 100 days of this government's work, I admit that, when we started, my worries were greater. [SME] Before this coalition was formed, you operated as an opposition party. By taking control of some important economic government posts, you have been forced to "show" your cards, especially in the economic sphere. Do you think this was a benefit or a loss for the SDL [Party of the Democratic Left]? Views have appeared to the effect that, in some areas, you are pushing for overly "socialist" methods.... [Weiss] We decided to join the coalition after considering all domestic and foreign political factors. Being in power after spending four years in opposition also brings with it, apart from the possibility of influencing the course of the economy, for example, by one's own policy, certain negative aspects. In particular, we were taking over the heritage of the economic policy of three governments that we had criticized. It is possible that shortcomings with their roots in the previous period will be ascribed to this government. This showing of cards that you mentioned was, in my opinion, not only of domestic political significance, but also of foreign political significance. For example, following the appearances by Deputy Prime Minister Brigita Schmognerova, no one can have any doubts about the SDL's attitude toward economic transformation. Quite the contrary, it is clear that we have our own ideas about transformation. Of course, there are differences of views with the other [coalition] parties regarding the timing of certain steps and their scope. For these reasons, being in opposition was easier. [SME] You spoke about "accelerating transformation," which is not a typical SDL term. [Weiss] I would like to know where you got this. If you carefully studied our documents at least once, you would never have been able to make such a statement. [SME] I know your preelection program, about which we agreed with [SDL Deputy Chairman] Mr. Fogas that it is not a typical left-wing program.... [Weiss] I cannot agree with you. Economic realism cannot be passed off as a right-wing attitude. Our program was realistic. For example, all of our warnings regarding small-scale privatization have come true. Employees [of privatized businesses] have lost motivation, Dutch auctions [during which the price is bid down, if no buyer can be found for the calling price] have brought with them negative concomitant phenomena, privatization has been criminalized, the credit portfolios of many banks are burdened with credits that they were often forced to extend for political reasons, and so forth. What is right-wing about this SDL attitude toward small-scale privatization? It has simply been proved that we had more political realism than the then government. Economy is something objective. We want the inevitable changes to be carried out in the socially most acceptable manner. [SME] Let us return to the coalition. What unites you, and what divides you? [Weiss] There were several key factors. First of all, it was necessary to put an end to the protracted political crisis. We had a minority government for a long time. It was in a minority position through the fault of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS] and the Slovak National Party [SNS] because the parliamentary groups of these parties had broken up, and the ruling HZDS was unable to find permanent allies. The second factor that united us was interest in the stability of the constitutional system. Clear tendencies were making themselves felt toward a self-serving change of the constitutional system--away from the parliamentary system toward a presidential regime. This was to be achieved through the renewal of the balance of forces after the elections, by means of a referendum that was being prepared. The third thing that united us was the essential need to react to the frequently chaotic and improvised economic policy and to the fact that, in some areas, the transformation processes slowed down or ground to a halt. Fourth, it was necessary to change Slovakia's image abroad because we were drifting, literally, into political isolation. Of course, it was also inevitable to establish conditions for a solution to the minority issues and, thereby, meet the obligations assumed by the previous government on being admitted into the Council of Europe. Fifth, it was the perception of politics as politics of cooperation. We rejected a continuation of the policy of creating the image of an enemy, the policy of a permanent search for traitors and Judases, which is a residue of the deeply ingrained neo-Stalinist political culture or, rather, lack of culture. What divides us? The very fact that this is a left-center-right coalition with different ideas on economic and social policy. There exist two instruments for overcoming these differences. The first is the government policy statement, which is a measure of compromise on programmatic issues that is acceptable to everyone. The second instrument is the Coalition Council, whose decisions are conditional on everyone's agreement. [SME] In this context, we could mention the so-called screening law, [the amendment of] which probably will not pass, precisely because of this mechanism in the Coalition Council. Do you consider it normal that members of the government cannot defend themselves against accusations of cooperation with the [communist-era secret police] StB only because there is no one to issue screening certificates? [Weiss] The screening law must be abolished because screenings have, from the very beginning, served as an instrument of dirty political struggle. [SME] Yet the law exists. It is valid but, in reality, it is not being enforced. One possibility is to abolish it, the other to amend it.... The coalition has so far been unable to sort out this problem. [Weiss] We were aware of our coalition partners' different views and were therefore ready to accept a solution that would not force any political partner to breach his election program. We proposed an amendment to the screening law, under which only those sections would remain in force regarding StB collaborators who were involved in the struggle against the so-called internal enemy. It is therein that I see the biggest moral burden requiring a solution. In other words, we proposed that people be exempted from this law who had to protect state secrets, for example, and the like. The coalition partners from the center grouping subscribed to a similar view. The idea of the Christian Democratic Movement [KDH] is that the screening law must be preserved. Each entity is simply bound to its voters, and, because no solution has been found, we will have to wait for one until after the elections. [SME] However, the failure to resolve the situation could be regarded by voters as the coalition's defeat.... [Weiss] Why should we characterize it as defeat? I was convinced that we would find a way of amending the law that would be generally acceptable. The KDH refused to accept an amendment, and, therefore, it is not within the powers of the coalition to resolve the issue of screenings. [SME] What, in your opinion, is the most realistic model of a political grouping that will form the government after the elections? [Weiss] That will be determined by the specific election results. It is generally true, however, that, when a continuation of the present coalition will be considered, there will be more time to prepare the government's programmatic aims and to deal with problems we have deliberately put aside during this term of office because of lack of time. [SME] Apart from the model of the present coalition, is there any other scenario of government that the SDL would accept? [Weiss] The government must be founded on a majority that will be capable of action and will enable laws to pass in parliament. [SME] Is there a model that is absolutely unacceptable to the SDL? [Weiss] In which sense absolutely unacceptable? There are at least four or five postelection scenarios.... [SME] Is some political entity unacceptable to you as a coalition partner? [Weiss] A coalition alliance with nationalists and extremists of any kind is unacceptable to us. We realize, of course, that a certain programmatic proximity and respect are necessary for a coalition to be formed. Therefore, we can scarcely imagine coalition cooperation with those who want to break up their future coalition partner and straighten its leadership, with those who have a completely different understanding of politics and of the stability of the constitutional system. [SME] Do you think those ideas correspond with the ideas of SDL members? [Weiss] Seventy percent of our members have endorsed the decision of the SDL club of deputies to join the coalition. Our problem is not the attitude toward the policy of the previously ruling HZDS. Rather, it is the attitude toward the KDH that constitutes a problem, owing, on the one hand, to programmatic differences and, on the other, to the statements made by KDH representatives about the SDL, which are still vivid in our sympathizers' memories. Of course, a problem also rests in the support that this government gets from Coexistence and, more specifically, Mr. Duray, in view of some of his statements. [SME] If we understood you correctly, you can scarcely imagine a coalition with the HZDS, judging from what you said. Whom are we supposed to understand by the terms "nationalists" and "extremists"? [Weiss] As for nationalism, it is quite evident that this path has been embarked upon by the SNS and by a part of the Coexistence movement, which is actually the SNS's partner in this game. Extremists organized in political groupings, such as exist in Germany, for example, are fortunately nonexistent in Slovakia for the time being. I can say, however, that we cannot imagine cooperation with the Communist Party of Slovakia [KSS] because it is engaged in a policy that we have abandoned, and we do not want to return to the past. What is interesting in this context is the unanimity of views on some issues between the KSS and the HZDS, as presented, for example, in the daily REPUBLIKA. Regarding the HZDS, I would like to say that it was, is, and will be differentiated. I do not lump all of the people from the HZDS together. There are groups in it that I know would never think of giving the Nazi salute in parliament [allusion to a recent incident in parliament, during which HZDS deputy Ivan Luptak greeted Ludovit Cernak, deputy chairman of parliament, who has black hair and wears a moustache, with "Heil Hitler"]. We would be able to imagine cooperation with those people. They regret themselves that the HZDS leadership did not sincerely try to cooperate [with other parliamentary parties]. Right now, I do not have the feeling, however, that the currents represented by these people have prevailed in the HZDS, also on the basis of the general style of HZDS policy and its ability to cooperate with others as true partners. It seems, for the moment, that the present coalition will continue, provided all of the constituent entities get into parliament. Everything will be determined by the voters. Our coalition quatrefoil [reference to the "Left Choice," the SDL-led coalition of four left-wing parties and movements] naturally seeks to win the largest possible number of votes.
