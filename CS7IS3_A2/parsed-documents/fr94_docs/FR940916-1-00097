FR940916-1-00097 FR940916-1-00016 FRA also intends to prohibit the movement of cars with cut-out or ineffective brakes beyond points where repairs to the defective condition could be made. FRA will consider a car's brakes ineffective if the piston travel exceeds 1.5 inches less than the total possible piston travel for that car. FRA plans to require each railroad to develop a formal program to train and to qualify personnel, including contract personnel, responsible for the inspection, testing, and maintenance of train brake systems. The detailed requirements are stated in Subpart C of the rule text. The contemplated program is similar to programs being instituted voluntarily by several of the major railroads. The vast majority of the comments and the experience of FRA inspectors support the contention that many of the people inspecting and testing train brake systems do not have the training and background to understand what they are doing and why they are doing it. As part of these programs, railroads will be required to notify employees and contractors of their current qualification status and to require periodic requalification. Railroads will be expected to update their training programs as they introduce new train brake system technology. FRA proposes that first-line supervisors should be required to perform frequent and random spot checks of train brake system inspections, maintenance, and tests. FRA intends to get supervisors out of the office on to the shop floor, outside to repair tracks and repair points, and off site to locations where train brake system inspections are performed. Only by active involvement can these supervisors improve the quality and effectiveness of their railroad's train brake system inspection, maintenance, and test program. Performing and keeping records of these spot checks are required if a railroad wishes to take advantage of the flexibility built into the proposed rule to allow trains to travel much greater distances between train brake system tests. Requiring spot checks is a means that FRA will use to ensure supervisors are jointly responsible with the employees they supervise for the correct performance of safety critical train brake system inspection, test, and maintenance tasks. Based on FRA experience and the statements of several commenters, it is evident that the use of chemicals in the trainline causes untimely wear and tear to brake system components and has a long-term detrimental effect on train air brakes. Comments provided to FRA indicate that air dryers on locomotives are very effective in improving the performance of train brake systems particularly under cold weather conditions and generally eliminate the need to use alcohol and other foreign substances in the trainline. Several railroads commented that they have already equipped their locomotives with air dryers in order to curb the use of chemicals in the trainline. Furthermore, several railroads frequently operating under extreme cold weather conditions commented that they have prohibited chemicals from being placed in brake air systems to prevent freeze-up. These railroads stated that they have been able to operate trains in cold weather without resorting to chemicals, such as alcohol. Based on these comments and experiences, FRA intends to ban the use of anti-freeze chemicals in train air brake systems. In addition, FRA proposes that all new and rebuilt locomotives be equipped with air dryers with a capacity that can be achieved by current commercially available equipment, unless the new or rebuilt locomotive will not be operated in cold weather conditions, will power only trains limited to 30 mph or less, or will power only trains of 20 cars or less. FRA believes that exception from the requirement to equip new and rebuilt locomotives with air dryers for these types of operations is warranted based on the comments received and on FRA's experience that moisture in the brakeline in these types of operations has never been a problem. Comments received by FRA heavily favored the single car test as an effective tool for ensuring the safe operation of railroad equipment. Rail labor representatives acknowledged the value of the single car test, but suggested that railroads are establishing special expediter or light repair tracks in place of repair tracks to avoid the current requirement to perform single car tests. The experience of FRA inspectors in the field supports this contention. Consequently, FRA proposes to require single car tests whenever any one of a specific list of components of the air brake system on a car is removed, repaired, or replaced. FRA also plans to require periodic freight brake tests and single car tests at calendar intervals. These requirements are independent of the type track or facility where the cars are worked on. Experience of FRA indicates a proliferation of equipment with other than standard ten-inch brake cylinders. As a result, mechanical forces and train crew members performing brake system inspections often do not know the acceptable range of brake piston travel for this non-standard equipment. In an attempt to improve this situation, FRA intends to require badge plates or stencilling of cars with the acceptable range of piston travel. Section 232.17. These proposed conditions for the movement of equipment with defective brakes without civil penalty liability incorporate the stringent conditions stated in the proviso to §13 of the Safety Appliance Acts (45 U.S.C. 13, recodified at 49 U.S.C. §§20302, 20303, 21302, and 21304). Except for cars or locomotives having their brakes cut out en route and except for defective locomotives moving lite or dead within a yard at less than 10 mph, FRA proposes that all cars or locomotives found with defective braking equipment be required to be tagged as bad ordered and determined safe for movement by a qualified person. An important clarification has been made in an attempt to eliminate misinterpretation of the regulation. FRA clearly states that equipment with defective brakes shall not pass a location where repairs to the defective condition can be made. Consequently, if a car or locomotive is found with defective brakes during a Class 1 or Class 2 inspection and that inspection is performed at a location where repairs of the type that are needed can be performed, that car or locomotive may not be moved from that location until such repairs are performed. However, if repairs to the defective condition cannot be performed at the location where the defect is discovered, or should have been discovered, this proposal will require a railroad to drop off the equipment with defective brakes at the nearest point on its line where the defective brakes could be repaired. A location that has been visited within the last 365 days by a repair truck or vehicle, capable of making repairs of the type required, will be considered the nearest point where repairs could be effectuated.
