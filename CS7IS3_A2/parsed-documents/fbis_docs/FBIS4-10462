Gerardo Segura filed this report from Tijuana, Baja California: [Segura] Two people may be implicated in the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio. According to reports disclosed by Federal Judicial Police agents present on the day of the murder, the bullet fired at the head of the PRI candidate was different from the one that hit the abdomen. They stated that the bullet in the skull destroyed a large amount of brain because it fragmented, contrary to the one in the abdomen, which did not seriously damage the internal organs. The informants, who in light of the current events asked to remain anonymous, expressed their distrust in the official report. Given this situation, Dr. Gustavo Salazar Fernandez, legal medical expert, affirmed that the autopsy performed on Colosio did not establish whether one or two firearms were used for the attack. [Begin Salazar recording] We recover projectiles left inside the body, if any, or state if there was fragmentation. It is impossible to retrieve them in each and every case. The autopsy report does not officially establish the caliber of the projectile. This is done by special request of a prosecutor or at a given time when the ballistic tests are performed. From a strictly medical viewpoint, we try to be descriptive. [end recording] [Segura] Salazar added, however, that it is possible that two different guns may have been used by two different perpetrators, but the exhumation and new inspections of the body would not provide sufficient evidence to confirm or support such hypotheses. Informants of the Federal Judicial Police said that the second shot may have come from the person who dove at the feet of Luis Donaldo Colosio. Authorities are still searching for that person.
