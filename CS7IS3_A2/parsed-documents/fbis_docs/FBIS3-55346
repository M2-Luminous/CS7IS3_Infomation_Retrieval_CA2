Estonia's current ambassador to the United Nations, the country's oldest diplomat Ernst Jaakson has announced plans to resign this year, Prime Minister Mart Laar said. It was decided earlier that Velliste would take over the office in New York. "It is in every way logical that the change takes place now," Laar said. "The man to take over the foreign minister's office is the so far Defense Minister Juri Luik, of whom I believe that he will be more useful in that position," Laar added. "I believe that Indrek Kannik is able to successfully take over as the defense minister," he said. Finance Minister Madis Uurike, who is also to be replaced in the same series of changes, will take up an adviser's position with the government. Uurike is to focus on issues connected with foreign loans, their usage and repayment, the prime minister added. But he also said the necessity of changes in the Finance Ministry had been "long talked about." "A certain working against the reforms or delaying them has been felt in the Finance Ministry every now and then," Laar said, pointing out the tax reform as one example. He said Heiki Kranich, who is appointed to take over as the finance minister, had been one of the parliament's main "driving forces" behind the tax reform. Laar said that Toomas Sildmae, who is to quit as the economics minister, was to resume his office as the head of Finest Hotel Group Ltd., one of the country's three largest hotel companies. The prime minister expressed the hope that Sildmae would keep up his ties with the government, but added that Sildmae as minister was at variance with the majority of the ruling coalition MPs. "There is no reason to search where these variances had their beginning. But it is clear that in a parliamentarian system no minister lacking the trust of and cooperation in the parliament is able to work effectively," he added. Toivo Jurgenson, to take over as economics minister, is to continue Sildmae's policy, at the same time increasing the pace of working out legislation in the sphere of the economy, Laar assured.
