K. Katyal: "Protest Over Remarks Conveyed to U.S."; boldface words as published] [Text] New Delhi. Oct. 29. Taken aback by the stridency of the latest note struck by Washington on Kashmir -- that it does not recognise the State's accession to India -- New Delhi today conveyed its protest and anguish to the U.S. What particularly upset the Government of India was the attitude on issues with a close bearing on the territorial integrity of India. The acting head of the U.S. mission, Mr. Kenneth Brill, who was called to the Foreign office by the Joint Secretary in charge of America, Mr. Haridip Puri, was told of India's concern. In an aide memoire given to the U.S., India took strong exception to Washington's "studied tilt" towards Pakistan, as contained in the background briefing of the Assistant Secretary of State for South Asia, Ms. Robin Raphel to South Asian journalists based in Washington. The perception in Pakistan of a considered U.S. tilt, it was pointed out, would not be a helpful factor for the commencement of a dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad, for which the U.S. had been playing a useful and constructive role. The backgrounder, official sources said, contained elements which were most disconcerting because of their fundamental and direct bearing on India's vital interest. The aide memoire, according to sources, regretted Ms. Raphel's remark, questioning the "status" of Jammu and Kashmir, a stand never taken by Washington in the past. India drew the U.S. Government's attention to the drastic legal and political implications of not recognising the accession of Jammu and Kashmir. Did the U.S. intend to question the territorial integrity of India and reopen the issue of the accession of the erstwhile Princely States? Ms. Raphel's briefing, according to the Indian Government, would certainly be regarded by the public as biased and tendentious and not in harmony with the Indo-U.S. relations. Ill-timed: India's regret was all the greater because Ms. Raphel's statement came at a time when Jammu and Kashmir was in the grip of a complicated situation. A delicate exercise was on to persuade the terrorists to leave the Hazratbal shrine, and initiatives were on for reopening the dialogue with Pakistan on all sensitive issues of mutual concern. Her downplaying of Pakistan's role in instigating insurgency in Kashmir was also regarded as a matter of concern. This attitude was seen as running counter to the political understanding that marked the Indo-U.S. exchanges. One-sided public statements of the type made by Ms. Raphel, it was felt, would only encourage obdurate elements. The aide memoire was believed to have found Ms. Raphel's remark out of tune with the recent diplomatic exchanges, especially between the Foreign Secretary, Mr. J. N. Dixit and the U.S. Under Secretary of Political Affairs, Mr. Tarnoff. Diplomatic circles, which were agog with the talk on the subject, ascribed her comments to her inexperience. Fresh dimension: Two days ago, Ms. Raphel, while repeating an earlier formulation -- that the entire State of Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory -- elaborated that the U.S. did not recognise the State's accession in 1947 and as such, did not regard it as forever an integral part of India. This gave a disturbing dimension to what, so far, was considered, at the most the U.S. adherence to a technicality. At one stage, when a senior Cabinet Minister conveyed to the External Affairs Ministry his worry over the U.S. description of the "entire" State as a disputed territory, he was told that Pakistan should have a bigger reason to be upset as the areas controlled by it too were sought to be covered by the "dispute." Ms. Raphel's comment would strengthen doubts about U.S. evenhandedness. Some in the U.S. may well argue that its stand, as spelt out now, was all along implied in its stated position and, hence, there was no departure or a new tilt. However, it was one thing to say that the State or the "entire" State was a disputed territory or to suggest that its accession to India was not valid or that it was not to be regarded forever as part of India. Does it mean that the U.S. now did not see any use for the ambiguity, consciously maintained in the past for purposes of diplomatic flexibility? Doubts over Shimla Pact: Equally surprising now were the strong doubts over the efficacy of the Shimla Agreement as an instrument for resolving the Kashmir problem. Three years ago, the U.S. swore by the Shimla Agreement which, it was stated, had superceded the U.N. resolutions of 1949 and 1950. Of late, however, doubts began to be expressed on its efficacy on the plea that its framework had not been put to use for over 20 years. Simultaneously, the U.S. began to refer to the need for "taking into account the views of the Kashmiri people." There was thus, a switch -- from support to bilateralism, incorporated in the Shimla Agreement to what may be loosely called trilateralism. Significantly, the U.S. also sought to project itself as a potential mediator, of course, with one qualification -- "if that is desired by both sides." The latest remarks from Washington pointed to a continuing U.S. interest, though what shape it could take was not clear. According to Ms. Raphel, the cost of the Kashmir dispute was "unacceptably high" and "it is time to look at the cost of this dispute in human terms and in budgetary terms.... in 1993." At another stage, she said the U.S. would consider a mediating role if it were requested by all relevant parties, but "we are not putting ourselves forward at this time as mediators." The U.S. President, Mr. Clinton's reference to Kashmir, it was explained, was meant to convey that "we see Kashmir on our radar screen, along with Yugoslavia, Somalia and parts of the former Soviet Union where there is a civil conflict." However, "it was not a signal to suggest a secret U.S. strategy" on Kashmir. Gains neutralised?: The U.S. position, as enunciated by her, now went far beyond what was stated some four months ago by a visiting official, Mr. John Mallot. His utterances led to sharp attacks on him, leading him to complain that the messenger was sought to be shot for the message. Then followed a conscious bid to undo the resultant damage to the Indo-U.S. relations. Mr. Dixit went to Washington along with a group of officials for comprehensive talks. The gains of that mission may be neutralised now. Ms. Raphel's comments, ironically, came in the wake of steps that ought to have met the U.S. concerns -- like the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, and the Prime Minister, Mr. P. V. Narasimha Rao's offer to talk on all issues, including those related to Kashmir.
