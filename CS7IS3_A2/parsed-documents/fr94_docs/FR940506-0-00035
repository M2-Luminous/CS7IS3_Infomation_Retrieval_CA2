FR940506-0-00035 FR940506-0-00012 PEC Pipeline Group contends the Commission should not be issuing mandatory standards for non-capacity release transactions. It asserts mandatory standards for such transactions would be inconsistent with the Commission's position in restructuring orders that Order No. 636 required only the posting of information related to available capacity and not information on nominations, scheduling, and gas flow. PEC Pipeline Group and Tenneco Gas assert that implementation of non-capacity release standards should be determined by the market, not regulation. Tenneco Gas also states that the industry is working on standardization related to nominations and that these standards should be reviewed first before additional standardization is attempted. Natural seeks clarification that the Commission is not prejudging or dictating the items to be standardized, but is relying on Working Group 3 to make this determination. On the other side, NGC and NGSA contend the Working Groups are deadlocked on whether pipelines should be required to implement the high priority data elements. They contend the Commission should direct the pipelines, in conjunction with Working Group 3, to develop an implementation schedule for all 33 high priority data elements. NGC suggests that the schedule for the ten high priority items should be submitted by April 1, 1994 and for the remaining 23 by June 1, 1994. On March 25, 1994, Working Group 3 filed a consensus agreement regarding the development of standards for non-capacity release business transactions. They anticipate completion of 12 upload and download data sets relating to confirmations and nominations by June 1, 1994. 43 At the time of the filing, 55 trading partners, including a number of pipelines, have committed to begin implementation of these data sets in June 1994, with pilot testing by December 31, 1994. Several pipelines and their trading partners are expected to be in full implementation by January 1995. The Working Group encourages other industry participants that are EDI capable to support these data sets by September 1995. 43 These data sets deal with the nomination, the request to confirm, the confirmation, and the scheduled volumes. Working Group 3 anticipates it will complete its consideration of the other high priority data sets by January 1, 1995, with development of data sets by January 1, 1996 and implementation within the 6 month period from January to June, 1996. The Group states this schedule may be affected by the Group's analysis of the transactions involved and its evaluation of the use of EDI for capacity release and for nominations and confirmations. The consensus of Working Group 3 was that significant and sufficient progress can be made in developing and implementing these standards without the Commission mandating implementation. It, therefore, recommends that the Commission accept the consensus agreement without mandating compliance with the data sets by the pipelines. 44 The Working Group commits to making quarterly progress reports, starting July 1, 1994, which will be made available to the Commission and other interested parties. 45 44 If parties are dissatisfied with progress under the voluntary agreement, they have reserved the right to request Commission action at a later time. 45 Great Lakes filed a comment supporting the Working Group 3 proposal and stated that it will be adding its name to the list of trading partners intent on meeting the time table set out by the Working Group. Although the Commission began the standardization process with capacity release, the Commission recognizes that the process now needs to be expanded to include other business practices in order to facilitate the movement of gas across multiple pipelines. In addition to standards governing electronic communication, such standards could include other business practices, such as standardization of gas days and nomination times to help shippers schedule deliveries across multiple pipelines. The Working Group's use of a pilot program, implemented as quickly as possible, appears to be a worthwhile approach for assessing the value of proposed standards and approaches, so that lessons learned can be applied to other areas and the process can move forward quickly. At this point, the Commission will honor the consensus agreement of Working Group 3 and allow the industry to proceed in developing such standards, without Commission mandate. The Commission applauds the progress of the industry to date and hopes that a consensus can be achieved on implementing the nomination/confirmation standards on schedule as well as implementing the additional proposed standards by the targeted dates if not earlier. The Commission also recognizes that other efforts are underway in the industry to standardize business practices. The Working Group should keep abreast of these developments and coordinate these efforts. The Commission staff will continue to actively monitor the Working Group's progress in developing these standards. Depending on the progress made by the industry in this endeavor, the Commission will evaluate the need for mandating compliance with such standards either in this docket or in another appropriate forum. VIII. Recovery Of EBB Costs In Order No. 563, the Commission responded to comments addressing the mechanism for recovering the costs of standardization. As a general matter, the Commission stated that its policy of permitting recovery of fixed costs through a reservation charge and variable costs through a usage charge was appropriate for the basic EBB service, which would include the downloadable data sets and communication protocols of this rule. The Commission stated that these services should be included in the basic EBB package because they were needed to provide a viable capacity release market and would provide system-wide benefits to all users. For enhancements to the basic EBB package, the Commission stated it was open to cost recovery approaches that would recover fixed costs from the limited number of users deriving benefit from the service.
