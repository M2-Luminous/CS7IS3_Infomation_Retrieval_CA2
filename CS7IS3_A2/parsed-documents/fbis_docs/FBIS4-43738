Europe did not issue a supranational vote, but merely vented confused and conflicting national feelings. It did not debate or choose its destiny but rewarded or punished governments and opposition forces within the context of its regional borders. Moreover, it voted apathetically, disenchantedly, without enthusiasm, despite the good news about the Austrian referendum. Of its 266 million voters, 54 percent abstained. It is possible to agree with this theory, which has appeared in the American newspapers, and thus explain the difficulty of forming a truly European assessment of the elections. Overall, the right-wing forces advanced, but the Socialists still remain the largest parliamentary group in Strasbourg. Nationalist extremism was defeated (the Republikaner in Germany, Le Pen in France) but the adversaries of the Maastricht Treaty seem to have been strengthened in the European Parliament. European integration is not threatened, since the assembly itself is dominated by two groups of committed Europeanists: the Socialists, with 200 seats, and the European People's Party, with 148 deputies. But the right-wing groupings together could control 250 seats, and the intensification of political union could risk paralysis, in favor of a scaled-down free trade arrangement. So there is no certainty about Europe's future, and the only clearly European result comes from Austria, a country outside the Community. Will the process of European integration slow down? Will the Franco-German axis survive? Will Britain's isolationism diminish? Will the federalist vision grow stronger, or will the free-trade vision prevail? Perhaps the votes do not provide an answer to these questions, and were merely national polls on the strength or weakness of individual governments. [German Chancellor] Kohl and [Prime Minister] Berlusconi were rewarded. But Italy's Europeanism in the near future remains an unknown quantity, as does its position among the parliamentary groups. Kohl's Christian Democrats of course provide a guarantee; they want a federal Europe and are aiming for 1996 [intergovernmental conference]. But France's political landscape has fragmented, it will not be easy for any government in Paris to sustain an intensification of the supranational institutions in Brussels, and the Franco-German axis has certainly been weakened. It remains to wonder whether it will be strengthened by Major's spectacular defeat. But this raises the new problems posed by the victorious British Labor Party. In order to gain power it will have to take votes away from the pro-free trade Conservatives. It will have to dilute its reluctant Europeanism, which it embraced only a decade ago. How far will the British Labor Party back the Franco-German axis? Furthermore, Kohl's success could set in motion a series of reactions connected with the danger that Europe will become too "German." The record level of abstention in the Netherlands reveals the emergence of some backtracking in the tough pro-German kernel, the losses by Belgium's Christian Democrats entail a new uncertainty, and the victory by the Danish Europeanists is threatened by the anti-Maastricht groups strengthened by the Socialists. Before judging Kohl's victory as an optimistic event for Europe, we must therefore assess all the interactions that a solely German leadership could entail in the center and the North. Even the enlargement to the East could become more complicated. Obviously people are wondering whether the 12 "local" elections together reveal a more right-wing Europe than before. A simplified reckoning shows that there were three major winners and five major losers. Clear victories were scored by Berlusconi's center-right, Kohl's Christian Democrats, and Margaret Beckett's Labor Party. A defeat was suffered by Rocard's Socialists in France, Scharping's Social Democrats in Germany, Gonzalez's Socialists in Spain, the Italian left-wing forces led by Occhetto, and Major's Conservatives in Britain. The whole panorama shows that, except in Britain, Greece, and Portugal, the left-wing forces are losing ground everywhere in favor of the center or the right-wing forces. Everywhere a crisis of the social democratic forces is taking shape, with the resurrection of the Labor Party as the only exception. The emergence of this crisis entails three consequences. The first is that the European Parliament, having long been the private domain of the Socialists and in which the Christian Democrats and Liberals were in a minority, has undergone a shifting of the balance in favor of the center-right. The second is that, without the help of the Labor Party, the European social democratic forces would have been canceled out and the Labor group will be the leading force in the new Eurosocialist alignment. The third is that the defeat of the Italian left-wing forces must also be set within this context. Although it reflects a "local" and national election, it also reflects a crisis common to all the European left-wing forces. But this being so, three major questions arise. Is the eclipse of social democracy in Europe temporary or final? What contribution will the rebirth of the British Labor Party bring to European integration? Will the Italian left-wing forces succeed in analyzing their defeat against this background, rather than losing themselves in questions of alignment, in internal struggles between unidentifiable leaders? Indeed, the 12 "local" elections reveal only one factor common to Europe: the widespread decline of the social democratic forces. They will have a decreasing influence in European integration, and this entails more than a few fewer seats in Strasbourg. It entails basic questions about the very nature of the Left and its future. We must consider why the Left was defeated everywhere, why it is not winning any more, and why it is losing ground at a time when European political union is being attempted. Answers to these questions were sought years ago by David Caute, the historian of the book The Left-Wing Forces in Europe From 1789 Until Our Own Time. Indeed, it may be that the crisis of the Left stems from its difficulty in defining itself two centuries after its birth. It may be that, by dint of being pragmatic, it has been left without a doctrine and without programs and become a nebulous ideology. It may be that, having been born with the industrial revolution, it finds it difficult to represent a postindustrial society that is seeking new ways to organize itself. The end of communism called into question not only Leninism but also the socialism that preceded it. It may be, therefore, that the Left is losing because it is unable to consider what historical factors contributed to its development or decline, from which social classes it has commonly drawn support, and whether by chance it no longer knows what to be in a world that resembles less and less that which created it.
