The circular outlines its suggestions on punishment. The circular notes: The "commissioned college level medical course" at the Hengyang City Medical Training Center was approved in 1992 by the Henyang City Education Commission, which overstepped its authority in granting the approval. With this approval, the city Public Health Bureau has in the past two years recruited 120 students in Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces. The students -- who were required to pay a yearly tuition of 2,200 yuan, excluding living expenses -- were promised a college level medical diploma from the Henyang Public Health School. Most of the enrollees were students who had failed to pass the college entrance examinations. Some of them were senior high or middle school dropouts, and some were workers. None of them were officially enrolled by the Provincial Admissions Offices. In September 1992, the training center rented some floor space from the Zhongnan Engineering Institute. It also rented two classrooms from the middle schools affiliated to the engineering institute. They were used as classrooms and dormitories for the "commissioned college level medical course." The circular points out: 1. The operation of the "commissioned college level medical course" was a serious violation of state policy and regulations. The Hengyang City Education Commission, which did not refer the application to higher competent authorities and overstepped its authority in giving the approval, made a serious mistake of violating the provision that "no unit or individual is allowed to set up schools, enroll students, collect fees from them, or issue diplomas without authorization." 2. The "training center's" objective in offering the course was illegitimate. State laws clearly provide that profit-making should not be the goal of schools run by nongovernment sectors. By inaugurating the course, a commercial vehicle for making a profit, the training center diverted from the legitimate goals of school operations. 3. As a secondary vocational school, the Hengyang Public Health School has committed a serious violation by, without first obtaining approval from the state, accepting the assignment of the "commissioned college level medical course" and giving college level instructions. The incident also uncovers problems with regard to implementation of state policy and school administration at the Zhongnan Engineering Institute. To increase revenue, the institute -- in violation of state regulations -- supported the "commissioned college level medical course" sponsored by the city public health bureau. Leasing out floor space made conditions at the once relatively commodious institute rather cramped, creating confusion in campus administration. Moreover, the institute also violated state regulations by turning its evening school into a full-time school. The circular criticizes the aforementioned units for their violations. In the circular, the SEC requested the Hunan Provincial Education Commission and the Henyang City People's Government to investigate the responsibility of -- and severely punish -- officials of the Henyang City Education Commission for giving the go-ahead to the "commissioned college level medical course" in violation of state regulations as well as those involved in illegally conducting the courses and enrolling students. The SEC instructed the Henyang City Education Commission, Public Health Bureau, and other units involved to abolish the "commissioned college level medical course" and properly deal with problems arising from the incident. The "Letter on Suggestions for Dealing With the `Shaoyang Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province,'" which was reissued by the SEC, notes that in July 1992 the Shaoyang city people's government, in Hunan Province, approved without authorization the establishment of the "Shaoyang Institute of Village and Town Enterprises in Hunan Province" and took it upon itself to register applicants, compile examinations, administer tests, and enroll students. It admitted 106 students in 1992 and 141 in 1993. The Hunan provincial people's government took the matter seriously and instructed the provincial education commission to investigate. After a thorough investigation, the provincial education commission took a firm step to redress Shaoyang city's blunder by abolishing the institute. The SEC pointed out: Higher education has developed rapidly in China over the years. Infractions of discipline and transgressions of authority, however, have been reported frequently in regard to the establishment, name changes, and enrollment of institutes of higher learning. Driven by the profit motive, some units, schools, or individuals are taking advantage of people's admirable desire to obtain a higher education -- in violation of specific prohibitions and repeated injunctions and in undermining state plans -- by offering college-level courses and recruiting at will students who have failed to pass college entrance examinations, youths awaiting job assignments, and currently employed workers from society at large. Some of these educational establishments do not have any facilities or teaching staff of their own. They hold courses by renting primary or middle school classrooms or floor space from factories or hotels and by scraping together a teaching staff. Even though some courses are given at secondary or other schools, these schools lack the facilities, teaching staff, and administrative support needed to carry out higher education. The circular notes: The frequent recurrence of incidents involving illegal student enrollments, illegal courses, and illegal diplomas can be attributed to the leaderships of a few localities' departments who either did not understand the gravity and the possible serious consequences of their actions, or who have failed to implement the relevant state policy or have even connived at or supported such actions. The circular points out: Enrollment in 1994 at institutes of higher learning will start soon. It is hoped that localities and departments will, while further emancipating their minds and accelerating the pace of reform and opening up, step up the macroadministration of higher education, strictly observe state laws and regulations, thoroughly investigate any incident involving illegal schools, enrollment, or diplomas in their respective jurisdictions, and consolidate order in educational circles. Where severity justifies it, the unit or individual involved shall be criticized by circulating a notice or shall be given the pertinent administrative punishments. The individuals involved shall be called to account for any serious consequences arising therefrom.
