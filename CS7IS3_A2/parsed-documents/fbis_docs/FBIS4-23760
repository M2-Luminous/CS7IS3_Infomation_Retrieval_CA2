He attributed this to the recent introduction of political reforms, which have contributed to easing the violence and calming the tension that prevailed in the country during the apartheid era. In an interview with AL-SAFIR on the sidelines of the Nonaligned Conference last week, Nzo said that the political situation in his country will improve once the five-year transitional period is over. Then political and economic institutions will be reformed and human rights will be respected, he added. He pointed out that the South Africans are thirsty for freedom and democracy and that everyone is serious about proceeding toward democracy and eliminating apartheid. [passage omitted] Nzo stressed his country's support for Arab rights at international and regional forums. He added: "We support steps to restore all the Arab rights and occupied territories and back the Arabs' endeavors in this area, particularly the Palestinians, because the policy of occupation has been rejected by us. Recently we have curtailed South Africa's relations with Israel and have suspended all previous cooperation activities with that country in the political, economic, and military areas. This is in line with the instructions and clear policy adopted by the current government of President Nelson Mandela, who has voiced support for the Palestinian people and those whose lands are usurped and who live under oppression and dictatorship and strive to regain their full rights." The South African minister disclosed that his country has expelled dozens of Israeli experts and military personnel who were working in Johannesburg and some other districts. They were replaced by blacks, who had been banned from working in those areas in the past, he added. He pointed out that when the Israeli Government tried to sneak back into the country through back doors, these doors were slammed shut in its face and it was told that bilateral relations had to follow a certain course and that they must not come at the expense of relations with neighboring African or Arab states. He added: Thus, now there is no military or nuclear cooperation with Israel, as in the past. South Africa has become a state committed to international legality and policies or relations that do not enjoy international acceptance cannot be pursued. [passage omitted]
