Together with Lieutenant-General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th Russian Army, he is known recently for having accused the leaders of the Dniester Republic of "untalented leadership" and for having urged citizens to demand their resignation. Mikhail Bergman noted that the decree by Igor Smirnov, president of the Dniester Moldavian Republic, says nothing about the collapse of the economy or steps to overcome it. However, the population is being prohibited from holding mass demonstrations and the press is being instructed strictly to cover only government activity. Failure to implement this decree will result in the dismissal of heads of state enterprises and organizations and the immediate shutting down of private enterprises. Mikhail Bergman also said that the leaders of the Dniester Republic "deliberately refused to compromise in the talks with Chisinau and to regulate currency circulation with other republics". As a result, former Soviet rubles still in circulation have flooded in from all over the former Soviet Union. Runaway inflation has brought the economy to catastrophe, Bergman stressed in conclusion.
