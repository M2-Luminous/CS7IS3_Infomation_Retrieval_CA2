Seoul's action comes after North Korea agreed to allow International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections in its nuclear sites from March 1 in a working- level meeting with the United States late Friday. The North Koreans said they will resume inter-Korean dialogue if the South proposes it in the New York meeting. Seoul's telephone message to be sent under the name of Prime Minister Yi Hoe-chang to his North Korean counterpart Kang Song-sang will propose a working-level contact on March 2. If realized, South and North Korea would be resuming their first dialogue in four months after the third meeting last October broke down. The government is likely to announce suspension of this year's Korea-U.S. military exercise "Team Spirit" if North Korea fully cooperates with IAEA inspections and shows sincerity in inter-Korean dialogue around the same time South and North sit down for working- level talks. If the talks go smoothly, the first exchange of presidential envoys is expected to take place sometime in March 10-15 before the third round of high-level Pyongyang-Washington talks. Seoul and Pyongyang have so far differed in the form, schedule, and content of discussions by their special envoys, but Seoul officials say they hope to sign an agreement on the exchange in the fourth or fifth contact.
