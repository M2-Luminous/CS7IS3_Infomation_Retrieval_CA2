Is it possible to contain the effects of this massacre? How? [Al-Najjab] The Ibrahimi Mosque massacre cannot be contained. The same goes for the continuing massacre committed by the Israeli Army all over our occupied territories. The effects of what happened cannot be contained on the Palestinian, Arab, Israeli, and international levels. Any attempt to bypass the massacre, similar to what Israel and the United States are trying to do, will result in the failure of the peace process. There is a national Palestinian consensus on the need to suspend the negotiations and to have a more serious stand toward this far-reaching Israeli crime. The crime has raised again the question of providing security and protection for the victimized Palestinian people, and not for the Israeli settlers and Army, who carried out this massacre. This is not the first massacre the Israeli occupation committed against our people that has elicited worldwide condemnation and anger. The Israeli side, however, has continued to get away with these massacres. All sincere people should now work to prevent the repetition of this bestial crime. This is very important. Another point is that the impact of this massacre on the negotiating process, as well as Israel's actual stand -- apart from sympathy -- should be assessed. This massacre and subsequent developments have cast a heavy shadow on the entire negotiating process. Regrettably, the U.S. position, which has not stopped being hostile to our people despite the end of the Cold War, is still keeping the Security Council and the world community from taking the necessary steps to prevent a repeat of this crime. The Security Council has been holding deliberations for a second week without reaching a serious resolution in this regard. The Palestinian side and the other Arab brothers should reflect on what happened and draw lessons about the true U.S. position and how to deal with it as it is without embellishing it. We should consider that the European and Russian positions are better than the U.S. position, which still insists on imposing an Israeli solution on all Palestinians and Arabs and which is playing a serious role in obstructing the progress of negotiations. On the Palestinian level, whether the negotiations continue or not, the question of ensuring protection for the Palestinian people and stopping the crimes committed against them must top the agenda of the Palestinian leadership. In the aftermath of the massacre, the Rabin government has imposed a curfew and comprehensive siege against more than two million Palestinians under occupation. The Israeli side has also adopted other measures to fully isolate Jerusalem from the rest of our occupied territory and to bolster its annexation to Israel. In addition, the confiscation of territory and expansion of settlements has not stopped. More than 10,000 Palestinians remain in the occupation prisons. Moreover, thousands of deportees are still away from their homeland. The question being asked by every Palestinian citizen is: How can we believe Israel is serious about reaching a settlement based on Resolution 242 when the first item of this resolution stipulates Israel's withdrawal from all the 1967-occupied territories, including Jerusalem? The isolation of the Palestinian negotiator from his people will weaken him and weaken the front of negotiations if we regard it as a new struggle and and a new front to end the Israeli occupation. The recent massacres have put the Oslo and Cairo agreements to the test and shown the serious gaps in these accords, particularly with regard to the question of settlements, which is postponed until the final status negotiations. The criminal acts practiced by settlers and the measures taken by the Israeli Government to curb them are trivial and can deceive nobody. I would like to ask: What will be the state of Palestinian authority in Gaza and Jericho if one of the settlers in Gaza, Jericho, or Hebron -- who is fully protected in accordance with the Cairo accord -- commits a new crime? If we are talking about a real withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, all settlers must withdraw from these two areas. Regrettably, the Cairo accord, which was signed by President 'Arafat alone, thereby violating the Executive Committee's decision, has turned the withdrawal from Gaza, stipulated by the Oslo Declaration, into a redeployment of forces because it has given the Israeli settlements -- under the pretext of maintaining their security -- an area which is three times the actual areas of these settlements. The Cairo accord also gave the Israeli Army the right to control and move patrols on three roads in Gaza, which have fragmented the strip into separate parts. The Israeli side refuses to expand the Jericho area to more than 50 km under the pretext that there should be no Israeli settlements in the area. This situation simply calls for going back on what was agreed upon in Cairo and Oslo in this regard and for insisting on the withdrawal of the settlements together with the Israeli forces in these areas so that there will be no excuse to maintain the Israeli Army in these positions. Furthermore, the recent massacre and subsequent acts have canceled any sense of security among the Palestinians, particularly if the settlers, such as the gangs of settlers in Hebron, are close to them. This requires the immediate evacuation of these settlers-- a matter adopted by one-half of the Israeli Cabinet. The crime also exposed the serious mistake represented by delaying the discussion of settlements to the final stage. This mistake must be rectified before there can be any talk about resuming the negotiations. We have paid a heavy price for the Palestinian side's acceptance of the Israeli concept of peace and the Israeli interpretation of the Declaration of Principles, as was very evident in the Cairo accord. ['Abid] Following the massacre, we have seen a split in the Palestinian arena. Some people call for withdrawal from the talks and others call for suspending these talks. Where do you stand in this regard? [Al-Najjab] First, we do not call for withdrawal from the talks. The overwhelming majority of our people support the talks that will lead to a political settlement on the basis of Resolution 242. Suspending the talks is something else. That takes place in any talks. And the suspension in itself is a negotiating stand that shows that the party that adopts such a stand adheres to its stand, seeks through pooling other national, sisterly, and international forces to influence the other party, and mobilizes world public opinion, including Israeli public opinion, to stand against stands that are undermining the peace process. We must always remember that the Rabin government is held responsible for obstructing the talks and eroding its credibility in the Palestinian and Israeli streets. Putting the issue of settlements on the top of the agenda receives unanimous Palestinian and large-scale support. Therefore, we should exploit this. The large-scale criticism of the performance of the Palestinian leadership with regard to exploiting this is correct and legitimate. The hesitation and confusion in announcing the suspension of talks -- even following the suspensions of these talks by Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon in solidarity with our people -- have weakened the credibility and seriousness of this leadership in responding to a general national stand. President 'Arafat was quick to accept U.S. President Bill Clinton's invitation to move the negotiations to Washington, without referring to the Executive Committee. By this he contributed to giving the U.S. Administration credibility that it does not deserve. He also gave the illusion that the reason for what is happening is the geographic location of the negotiations, which is not close to the White House in Washington. We saw how the United States used this acceptance at the Security Council and we now see the current U.S. attempts to prevent the council from adopting a resolution that meets the requirements demonstrated by the recent massacre. I would like to say here that the U.S. side is trying to force us to pay the price for a formal condemnation of the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre by excluding Jerusalem from the occupied territories in the draft resolution. Regrettably, some Palestinians have the illusion, the same ones as the U.S. side, that delaying the negotiations for a few days will calm the situation and that the negotiations could then be resumed as if nothing happened. This idea is an illusion because the bullets fired at the faithful worshipers kneeling before God were at the same time fired at the policy followed in the negotiations. The facts raised by this crime are solid and cannot be overcome with the passage of time. As for the argument that says it is impossible to review the agreements, this conclusion is totally wrong because the agreements are not an objective in themselves. They are a means to implement Resolution 242 and all its articles, to secure the Israeli withdrawal from our occupied land, to guarantee our right to self-determination, and to attain peace and security for all parties in the region. These agreement proved that they are incapable of securing all these demands, therefore, they should be revised in a manner that serve their purpose. We should consider the meaning of Rabin's insistence on these agreements, and on the Cairo agreement in particular, in refusing to reconsider the subject of settlements and the timing of discussing this subject. Backing off from unjust and dangerous agreements will not undermine the credibility of the Palestinian leadership, but not considering the dangers contained in these agreements and the possibility that they may lead to more Israeli massacres and entrenchment of occupation will. ['Abid] Some people hold 'Arafat responsible for the massacre, and say that the massacre was the result of the agreements he signed with the Israelis, especially the Cairo agreement. Do you share this view? [Al-Najjab] I do not believe that a Palestinian or an Arab could say such a thing. How can the victim be responsible for the crime? I can say that the Israeli Government--not 'Arafat as some went too far in saying--is responsible for the crime. We should not make mistakes about this and we should continue to work to let the criminal pay for his crime. The one who occupies our land is the Israeli Army, and it is the Israeli Government that builds settlements, arms settlers, and remains silent toward their recklessness and crimes. In this, the Israeli labor and Likud governments are equals. ['Abid] Some Palestinians have urged 'Arafat to resign, saying he does not represent the Palestinian people any more. Do you share this opinion? [Al-Najjab] First of all, and in this particular situation, fights and demands should be focused on the perpetrators of the crime. We should distinguish between the measures that should be taken to force the perpetrators of the crime to pay for what they did, and the internal Palestinian demands, or what we call reorganizing the Palestinian house in a manner that develops the performance of the leadership and the Palestinian establishments and restores people's confidence in the PLO. What should be toppled is the current policy, which has been proven untenable by all the challenges and tasks of the new stage of our national struggle. There are very strong and wide criticism of President 'Arafat's policy. It is up to him now, and he has to decide whether to continue this policy, thus leading to more isolation, or to rise to a new situation. If this is how I see things, this is because we are talking about an issue of concern to the entire Palestinian community. We are talking about the protection of Palestinian rights and gains. All the national forces, figures, and institutions must join hands to secure international protection for the Palestinian people and to tackle serious problems caused by Israel's arrogance and the open U.S. support it enjoys, as well as the sorry state of Arab solidarity and coordination. Additionally, the performance of the Palestinian leadership leaves much to be desired and the legitimate Palestinian institutions, including the PLO's Executive Committee, have been in a state of inertia. Nor has there been a commitment to the PLO's plan of action or the peace initiative. ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to be very much in control of the Executive Committee. Why is it that some members are boycotting its sessions most of the time? [Al-Najjab] I would first like to draw a line between two groups within the PLO, although they have much in common. There is the group of six who tendered their resignation from the Executive Committee. Their resignations, however, are not valid, since it is up to the Palestine National Council to accept or reject them. Another group is supportive of the negotiations. As for me, I made my boycott of the Executive Committee's sessions known twice. The first time was when 'Arafat unilaterally signed the Cairo agreement, thus presenting the committee with an fait accompli. I and others did not show up for that session and, therefore, it lacked a quorum. The second was when 'Arafat unilaterally accepted President Clinton's invitation for the talks to continue in Washington. 'Arafat thus turned a deaf ear to the voice of local and dispora Palestinians, all of whom want the negotiations to be suspended until international protection is secured. Hence, the call for an Executive Committee meeting so that 'Arafat may explain a decision he made on his own. Only seven members turned up for that session. Five members did not attend in order to deprive the session of a quorum. It is not too late yet for the Executive Committee to reconvene, according to rules. To facilitate this, 'Arafat should break off the negotiations and go along with the Palestinian consensus. That would open the door for a serious assessment of the negotiating process and, having drawn the necessary lessons, put it back on track. Such a development would also arrest the deterioration in the Palestinian position as happened when the Palestine Central Council endorsed the Oslo accord by a majority, if with certain qualifications. We have asked the brothers who resigned from the Executive Committee to attend at least one session at which it may be possible to take a vote on and abrogate the Cairo accord. ['Abid] 'Arafat is said to have files on each and every member of the Executive Committee so that he can win over whoever he needs to whenever he wants to. Is this true? [Al-Najjab] I have been asked this question often enough by journalists. Regrettably, the cake has been carved up so as to reflect the closeness of this or that PLO member to 'Arafat. As an old political party [reference to the Palestinian People's Party], whose participation in the Executive Committee is fairly recent, we can claim to have nothing to do with such tactics. How close we are to 'Arafat or other PLO Executive Committee members depends on how much or little we have in common. We support serious and persistent efforts to defend our people's rights and promote coordination and cooperation with fraternal countries. We participate in a serious mechanism to achieve all this. As is known, we participated in the Washington talks, but we suspended our participation in the ninth session for well-known political reasons in protest against the course of the negotiations and the performance that unfortunately still prevails. ['Abid] But one of your party central committee members still participates in the Taba negotiations? [Al-Najjab] Hasan 'Asfur was elected as the People's Party Central Committee member at the second party congress. As was announced at the time in the statement and by 'Asfur himself, his participation in the negotiations was a personal decision and he represents no one. It is known that his case was referred to a party commission to have him account for not abiding by his party's decision not to participate in the Taba negotiations. The fate of 'Asfur, whether he remains a Central Committee member or not, will be decided by the party congress. We are making arrangements to hold this congress. We are a democratic party, and will respect the decisions of the congress, which is the highest authority in the party. As yet, the violations Hasan 'Asfur has committed are organizational and not political violations. ['Abid] Many voices are being raised calling for revenge against the Israelis following the Hebron Mosque massacre. What do you have to say to this? [Al-Najjab] If we want to really avenge all the victims of the Palestinian people, we must pursue work to seek salvation from the occupation and to wrest our people's national rights. I do not support any personal reaction and I am against attacking Israeli civilians. Our cause is just and the weapon we use should remain clean. It is impermissible to give the Israelis any justification to cover up for their crimes or to give those who defend them in Washington the excuse to speak about terrorism without specifying the party they mean. We must take into consideration the need not to lose the Israeli voices that condemn the settlers massacres and call for their removal by not carrying out individual operations against civilians. ['Abid] What is required on the Palestinian level at the present stage? How can one develop some of the stands that were shaken by the Hebron Mosque massacre? [Al-Najjab] Our battle is a protracted one. What is important now is to enhance our national unity, as well as Arab coordination and cooperation, particularly with Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon. We wish success to the efforts under way to restore coordination among the parties participating in the negotiations, especially since all the parties abide by the comprehensive solution, which means the implementation of all the provisions of UN Security Council resolution 242 on all the tracks. We must also pursue work with all of the international parties angered by the recent crime to have them continue and develop their support for our people and rights, taking into consideration that these parties are getting more and more convinced that peace cannot be achieved at the expense of these rights, or by ignoring them.
