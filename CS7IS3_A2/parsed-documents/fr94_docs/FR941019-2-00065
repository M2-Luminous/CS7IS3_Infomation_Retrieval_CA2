FR941019-2-00065 FR941019-2-00040 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION [PR Docket No. 94&hyph;105; DA 94&hyph;1115] Commercial Mobile Radio Services; California State Petition To Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; order waiving certain pleading rules and denying deferral of filing dates, and dismissing a request for issuance of public notice. SUMMARY: The amendments to the Communications Act in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 preempted state rate and entry regulation of commercial mobile radio services. States were given the opportunity to file petitions for the authority to continue regulating these intrastate rates. Under Commission rules, this proceeding contemplates only the filing of comments and replies on the state's petition. This Order waives the prohibition on additional pleadings found in ยง20.13(a)(5) of the Commission's Rules and permits additional pleadings to be filed, pursuant to the terms of ยง1.45 of the Commission's Rules. The Order also denies a motion filed by Cellular Resellers Association, Inc., Cellular Service, Inc. and ComTech Mobile Telephone Company to defer filing dates for the filing of replies for reasons of efficient administration and docket management. This Order also dismisses as moot a Request for Issuance of a public notice filed by National Cellular Resellers Association. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regina Harrison, Private Radio Bureau, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Waiving Certain Pleading Rules and Denying Deferral of Filing Dates In the Matter of: Petition of People of the State of California and the Public Utilities Commission of the State of California to Retain Regulatory Authority Over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates. Adopted: October 7, 1994; Released: October 7, 1994 By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. The Commission's rule governing the filing of pleadings in this proceeding contemplates only the filing of comments and replies on the state's petition to retain authority over intrastate cellular rates. It thus excludes Section 1.45, 1 which governs the general filing periods for motions, from the procedural rules which may apply. 2 This proceeding, however, raises confidentiality issues that have generated the filing of several motions and requests. 3 1 47 CFR 1.45. 2 Second Report and Order, Implementation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, Regulatory Treatment of Mobile Services, 9 FCC Rcd 1411, 1522 (1994), 59 Fed. Reg. 18493 (Apr. 19, 1994) (to be codified at 47 CFR 20.13 (a)(5)). 3 See, e.g. , Motion of the Cellular Carriers Association of California to Reject Petition or, Alternatively, Reject Redacted Information (Sept. 19, 1994); Request for Access to California Petition for State Regulatory Authority Pursuant to the Terms of a Protective Order, filed by the National Cellular Resellers Association (Sept. 19, 1994); Emergency Motion to Compel Production to the California Public Utilities Commission of Information Contained in Oppositions to California's Petition to Retain State Regulatory Authority over Intrastate Cellular Service Rates (dated Sept. 29, 1994). We have also received PR Docket No. 94&hyph;105 Notice of Ex Parte Contact and Request for Issuance of a Public Notice (Sept. 23, 1994), filed by the National Cellular Resellers Association (NCRA), asking that the Commission issue a Public Notice permitting any interested party to participate by telephone or in person in a September 30, 1994 meeting on confidentiality issues. All parties to the proceeding were given actual notice of the meeting and permitted to participate either in person or by telephone. Moreover, on September 30, 1994, the Commission issued a Public Notice of Comment Sought on Draft Protective Order, DA 94&hyph;1083, announcing that all interested parties could comment by October 7, 1994 on a draft protective agreement that had been distributed to all parties of record. We believe that these actions have rendered the NCRA request moot and we dismiss it on that ground.
