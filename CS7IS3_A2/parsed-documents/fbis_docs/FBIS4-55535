A NATO reconaissance plane and a bomber violated the Yugoslav air space on April 24 in the region of the Perucanlake, western part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, while similar incidents have become an increasing practice, Jovanovic said in the letter which was published as an official U.N. document on Monday. Jovanovic also warned that NATO aircraft frequently break the sound barrier over the rural regions of the Bosnian Serb republic (RS) in order to frighten the local population. According to the Yugoslav foreign minister, these incidents are the more concerning because the United Nations failed to react to earlier Yugoslav warnings and take corresponding steps with the NATO command. The continuing provocations and violations of the Yugoslav air space pose a serious threat to peace and security in the entire region the flagrant violation [words indistinct] territorial integrity and sovereignty and a direct threat to the peace process which aims to halt the war in the ex-Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia- Herzegovina, Jovanovic said. I call on you once again to take the corresponding steps within the U.N. and in the NATO command to end the dangerous provocations, he said. In October 1992 the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution imposing a no-fly zone over Bosnia. Its implementation is monitored by the NATO air force.
