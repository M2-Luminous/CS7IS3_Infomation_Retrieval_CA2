If this demand is not conceded Sudan will reject the report in its entirety and will review its cooperation with the UN agenda on human rights. This was stated in letters sent by Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih to the UN secretary general, the chairman of the Human Rights Committee, the ICO secretary general and the OAU secretary general. A responsible source at the Foreign Ministry told SUNA that the letters explained that the report contained paragraphs serious in their meanings and aims, but reflecting a lack of respect for Islam. Biro called for action against the Sudanese penal code, which is derived from Islamic law [word indistinct] international and demanded that it be canceled. The letters pointed out that because the rapporteur's allegations had wronged the whole Muslim nation, he must be interrogated and condemned by all states, organizations and bodies which respect the right of all peoples to choose their legal and political systems. Moreover, the people's organization in defense of faith and homeland in a statement today called on the UN secretary general to withdraw Biro's report, to put the rapporteur on trial immediately, and to expel him from the United Nations. The United Nations should also apologize to the Islamic nation.
