It has identified itself as the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan [Kurdistan Islamci Hareketi, IMK]... The IMK militants attacked the supporters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which is headed by Jalal Talabani. The attacks took place last Saturday, Monday, and Tuesday. The militants also clashed with the supporters of Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Democratic Party of Kurdistan. The incidents were in Raniyah, Kifri, and Kujah... The Hizballah in Iraq has established itself in Kuldazah and Raniyah, which are close to Iran's border. That organization is not represented in the Federal Assembly of Kurdistan, which is based in Irbil, because it only secured 5.1 percent of the votes in the elections in 1992. Seven percent of the vote was needed for representation. Iran's Support The Hizballah organization in Iraq is mainly supported by Tehran... It has received aid from Iran in the form of cash, arms, and provisions, particularly since 1991. That is common knowledge. According to Ahmad Bamarni, who is a close associate of Jalal Talabani, the Hizballah organization is also supported by Saudi Arabia and even by Afghanistan. That organization's ideology is based on Imam Khomeyni's teachings. Naturally, that provides for Tehran's support. Nevertheless, the Hizballah members have not renounced their religious sect. They are the followers of the Sunni sect. Of course, that accounts for Saudi Arabia's support. The recent weakening of the economy in northern Iraq has had a significant bearing on the strengthening of the Hizballah organization. The gradual worsening of poverty has disappointed the people in the region. Consequently, that state of affairs has nourished Islamic radicalism, as has been the case among the Palestinian people and in Algeria. Obviously, Islamic radicalism has strengthened as a result of poverty and the central administration's failures. Beards and Islamic Dress We met Ahmad Bamarni a few days ago. Referring to the Hizballah organization, he said: "We have a university in Irbil. It provides education for 5,000 students. We have colleges for agricultural and medical studies in Dahuk. We also have an institute for veterinary studies and a medical college in al-Sulaymaniyah. Students from many families do not attend them because they are poor. However, the IMK gives them an opportunity to study, provided that the male students wear a beard and female students wear Islamic dress. In fact, the number of young people who join this organization is gradually increasing." Yes, the Hizballah organization employs several tactics to strengthen itself. Meanwhile, it also helps many people to have their own shops or establish their own businesses. I have observed the poverty in northern Iraq. In view of that, I am aware of what can be achieved even through small amounts of material aid. What Does Tehran Fear? What does Tehran, which supports the Hizballah organization, wish to achieve in northern Iraq? Bamerni replied as follows: The Hizballah organization is playing Iran's game. Tehran wishes to create instability in northern Iraq. Iran's military aircraft repeatedly bombed the northern Iraq border area some time ago. That country closed its border about three weeks ago. It closed down the border gates that give access to al-Sulaymaniyah, Hajj 'Umran, and Irbil. What worries Tehran is this: A democratic, pluralistic, and secular system is being established in northern Iraq for the first time. Political parties exist in Irbil and other large cities. There are newspapers, magazines, and radio networks. The people are expressing their opinion. The people also appear on television. The modernization process has made Tehran feel very uneasy. Iran's officials fear that the Kurds in Iran and the rest of Iraq may decide to adopt a similar model. They believe that that would be an unfavorable example for their country. [passage omitted]
