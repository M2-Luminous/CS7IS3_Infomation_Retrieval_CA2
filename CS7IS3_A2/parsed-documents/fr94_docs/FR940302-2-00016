ACTION: Notice of preliminary results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Review. SUMMARY: In response to requests from one respondent and one U.S. producer the Department of Commerce has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on polyethylene terephthalate film, sheet, and strip (PET film) from Japan. The review covers three manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States and the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992. We preliminarily determine that margins exist for the period. Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. EFFECTIVE DATE: March 2, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Arthur N. DuBois, or Thomas F. Futtner, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230, telephone: (202) 482&hyph;6312/3814. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On June 8, 1992, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' (57 FR 24244) of the antidumping duty order on PET film (56 FR 25660, June 5, 1991). On June 30, 1992, one respondent, Toray Industries Inc. (Toray), requested an administrative review and one U.S. producer, Toray Plastics America (TPA) (see Decision Memorandum dated December 28, 1992, regarding Toray's status as a producer in the United States), requested an administrative review for two other Japanese manufacturers/exporters of PET film. We initiated the review on Toray, covering November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992, on July 22, 1992 (57 FR 32521) and the reviews on Teijin, Ltd. (Teijin) and Diafoil Co. Ltd. (Diafoil), on August 26, 1992 (57 FR 38668). The Department has now conducted the review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Tariff Act). Scope of the Review Imports covered by the review are shipments of all gauges of raw, pretreated, or primed PET film, whether extruded or co-extruded. The films excluded from the scope of this order are metallized films and other finished films that have had at least one of their surfaces modified by the application of performance-enhancing resin or inorganic layer more than 0.00001 inches (0.054 micrometers) thick. Roller transport cleaning film which has at least one of its surfaces modified by the application of 0.5 micrometers of SBR latex has also been ruled as not within the scope of the order. PET film is currently classifiable under Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) subheading 3920.62.00.00. The HTS subheading is provided for convenience and for Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive. The review covers three Japanese manufacturers/exporters of this merchandise to the United States, Toray, Teijin, and Diafoil, and the period November 30, 1990, through May 31, 1992. Such or Similar Comparisons As stated in the less-than-fair-value (LTFV) investigation, we have determined that the subject merchandise constitutes a single class or kind of merchandise. Each company had sufficient home market sales of PET film to unrelated customers to serve as a basis for calculating foreign market value (FMV).
