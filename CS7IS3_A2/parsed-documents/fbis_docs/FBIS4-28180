FBIS4-28180 "dreas110_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-110 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 North Korea `Special' Inspection Said `Out of Question' `Special' Inspection Said `Out of Question' SK0706152494 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1518 GMT 7 Jun 94 SK0706152494 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["We Will Determinedly Counter U.S. `Special Inspection' and `Sanctions', DPRK FM Spokesman" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the recent statement of the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State, Gallucci, alleging that the DPRK has unilaterally forced core refueling, deliberately destroying the possibility of later measurement of fuel rods. He said: His statement is inconsistent with the fact. There has been a series of contacts between us and the United States over the question of core refueling operation. At the contact on May 28, we transferred to the U.S. side a document explaining our method of preserving the technical possibility of later measurement of fuel rods. Expressing interest in our method, the U.S. side promised us to give an answer after sincerely studying it by mobilizing its home nuclear experts. It even said that the third-stage talks would be possible, if the technical possibility were preserved, whether the pace of core refueling operation was fast, or not. We have awaited an affirmative answer from the United States, encouraged by such attitude of it. And we had the willingness to thrash out a compromise by coordinating the opinion that might be raised by them in the answer. The U.S. side, however, far from giving an answer to us, unilaterally declared that the technical possibility for the measurement of fuel rods had been destroyed, timing to coincide with the submission of an unreasonable report by the secretariat of the International Atomic Energy Agency to the United Nations Security Council. We are simply surprised by this. After all, we have had no consultation with the United States on the question of the method of preserving the possibility for the measurement of fuel rods and have lost the last chance of meeting it halfway. As can be seen in the above, it is not the DPRK but the United States that refused a compromise over the measurement of fuel rods and broke the foundation of the third-stage talks. The United States is now coming out with the ill-boding assertion that since the possibility of the measurement of fuel rods was gone, "a special inspection" of the two military sites should be made. Keeping pace with it, the agency is bringing forth the issue of "a special inspection" again. So, it is obvious that the United States, ignoring our method, unilaterally declared that the possibility of the measurement of fuel rods was gone, motivated by the intention to invent a pretext of "a special inspection." The present situation reminds us of march last year when we declared the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, rejecting "a special inspection." The demand for "a special inspection" is a gross infringement upon our sovereignty and a graphic expression of the policy for stifling the DPRK. The inspection of our military sites is out of question. Our position for resolving the issue through dialogue and negotiation remains unchanged. But we will resolutely counter without the slightest compromise any attempt to encroach upon our sovereignty, crying for "a special inspection" and "sanctions." This is the unswerving will of all our people and Army.
