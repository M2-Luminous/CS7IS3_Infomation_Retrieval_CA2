This means the surcharge on electricity bills to subsidize the German coal industry will increase in 1995 from 7.5 to 8.5 percent. The subsidy is to be introduced in eastern Germany in 1996 at a rate of around 4.25 percent. The new arrangement is necessary because the Century Agreement, which governs the use of German coal for electricity supplies, runs out at the end of next year. [passage omitted]
