The fearsome conqueror of the East, whose empire stretched from Delhi to Damascus, henceforth symbolizes the might of the state and the unity of the Uzbek nation. Over here he is now like Prince Vladimir for Russians or Bismarck for Germans. Uzbekistan's best minds have been thrown into the creation of a new ideology. The powerful wave of "perestroyka" nationalism, which smashed to pieces the dogmas of Marxism-Leninism, has receded. But what will take its place? All the signs suggest that the resulting vacuum will be filled by Islam. A Western diplomat, arriving in Tashkent, was pleasantly surprised that Uzbeks remain...Uzbeks. He was not exactly discovering America. The people have not lost their national psychology. An Uzbek, just as he was hundreds of years ago, is loyal to his family and the norms of the Shari'ah; respectful of authority -- which, as a rule, he personifies; tolerant in interethnic relations, practical, and sociable. Not to mention the fact that he has kept his own cuisine, songs, dances, and customs.... It is from this well that the authors of the new ideology draw their ideas. The aim is to unite the people around the leader, lead them through the wilderness, and give them hope. And whereas formerly this was the unattainable peak of communism, nowadays the country's streets and squares are adorned with another inspiring formula: "Uzbekistan -- A State With A Great Future!" The author, of course, is Islam Karimov, who, unlike certain other CIS leaders, perfectly understands that, however bad Soviet ideology was, it make it possible to unite the nation to work for the good of the republic. He also perfectly understands that a nation cannot exist in an ideological vacuum. The supporting structure of the emerging ideology is patriotism. For instance, the Basmaks [anti-Soviet Uzbek nationalist movement in early twenties] are now esteemed as "champions of the faith and freedom." Like others who fell in the struggle against the "Red Empire," they will have a monument raised in their honor in Kokand. Writers and poets accused of nationalism and repressed under Stalin are being rehabilitated -- people like Usman Nasyr, for whom one of Tashkent's central streets has been named. One of the purposes of the new ideology is to overcome regionalism, the age-old separation of Uzbeks into Fergana, Khorezm, Bukhara, and Tashkent Uzbeks, which can still be seen today in the structure of the ruling elite. Disconnection and isolation have led to this people being virtually "absent" from world civilization for three centuries. There are people and political forces who are trying to build a new social consciousness on "pushing away" from Russia and the Soviet Union, whom they represent as colonizers. Their sins are endless: russification, the forced imposition of socialism, the exportation of national treasures for a pittance. The main target of the "reforging" is, of course, the younger generation. It is easier for young people to rid themselves of Soviet stereotypes and take on board new ideas. Hence, the entire education system is being hurriedly restructured. In just a few years Uzbekistan is to change its alphabet from the Cyrillic to the Latin, which will undoubtedly "cut off" the younger generation from the huge bulk of Soviet and Russian literature. Meanwhile, Tashkent has sharply reduced "Ostankino" and almost completely "cut out" RTV. The old, for whom it is too late to change their views, have not been forgotten either. In Uzbekistan, 1 May -- Victory Day -- and 8 March have been left untouched. Monuments to Pushkin and Gorkiy have not disappeared, and Fergana's central street bears the name of Dmitriy Skobelev, the czarist general who built the city. The ruling People's Democratic Party with its leader Islam Karimov aspires most of all to be the architect of the new ideology. The president never tires of repeating that the people are not ready for democracy of the Western type, and will not accept it entirely. And the spiritual face of Uzbekistan is probably being molded as a synthesis of the Turkestan renaissance, renascent Islam, and modern civilization.
