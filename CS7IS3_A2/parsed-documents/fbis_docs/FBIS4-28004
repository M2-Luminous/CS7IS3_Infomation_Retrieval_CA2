Opinion of various circles in Phnom Penh is wondering whether in doing so the United States is pouring water to extinguish the flames of war, or is it adding fuel to them? In so doing, the United States is certainly joining the communist Vietnamese in their aggression against Cambodia. The United States should know that giving money and supplying arms and materiel to the two-headed government can only benefit the communist Vietnamese. If the United States gives the two-headed government political and diplomatic assistance, the only one who will benefit from that will be none other than the communist Vietnamese. If the United States helps the two-headed government politically and diplomatically, only the communist Vietnamese will gain in their attempt to swallow Cambodia. That could be seen as a serious act of murder against Cambodia because the Western alliance would be helping the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia. The United States should realize that this alliance, which is helping the communist Vietnamese to annex Cambodia, is running counter to the general trend. On the one hand, it could create more acute, insoluble differences with the Cambodian nation and people. It is incapable of doing away with the Cambodian nation and people because the United States would be creating conflict on top of conflict, thus driving the Cambodian nation and people to rise up simultaneously and fight back. At the same time, it could create differences with neighboring countries. If Cambodia became part of Vietnam, it would automatically be part of the Indochinese federation of the communist Vietnamese. As such, how dangerous a threat would that be to the ASEAN borders? You do not have to look far. Just a few days after it had come to power, the two-headed government began to insolently lambaste other countries, verbally attacking its own neighbors. ASEAN in general wants to see Cambodia achieve reconciliation and peace and is opposed to any move that would give military aid for continuing to ignite the war because ASEAN realizes that should Vietnam succceed in swallowing up Cambodia, ASEAN would share its border directly with the communist Vietnamese, and there would be all kinds of problems to ASEAN's security. As far as United States is concerned, what could it gain from such a situation? As for the differences within the nation and people, they are permanent. These include differences arising from the problems of land owenership, taxation, robberies, assassinations, and all kinds of power abuses, such as forcible recruitment and so on. These are utmost and permanently painful differences. No matter how much money the United States and the alliance is willing to give the two-headed government -- be it $100 million a month or $1,200 million a year or $2,400 million every two years -- these differences would never be solved. No wizard could ever solve them. Do not look at them as being differences with the 10,000-20,000 or 100,000 Khmer Rouge. Instead, look at them as differences between war and peace, as political, economic, and social differences created and continually inflamed by the communist Vietnamese, the alliance, and their puppets. How can these differences be resolved? If one tries to solve them through war, one only multiplies them. If one tries to resolve them through national reconciliation, these differences might gradually dissipate, thus inviting peace and happiness back to the country and the national community. The United States should not look at the Khmer Rouge as just a bunch of induviduals. It should look at them as the offspring, the flesh and blood of the entire Cambodian nation and people and especially of the nearly 7 million peasants. Attacking the Khmer Rouge is tantamount to attacking the entire peasantry, the entire Cambodian nation and people. The United States should reconsider whether it is better for Cambodia, the countries in the region, and the United States itself if it chooses the means of using water to extinguish the flames of war. This is a question that requires very close consideration. There should not be an error of judgment as the ones made when the United States decided to start the Vietnam war in 1960 and stage the coup d'etat in Cambodia in 1970 and when the communist Vietnamese decided to invade Cambodia in 1978-79.
