The Frecoms appeared for the first time on 31 March, as the local EL ORBE newspaper published a report on a meeting between the newspaper and Subcommander Pedro, a meeting during which he announced the emergence of this armed group, which is willing to take up arms, as the EZLN did, should the government "fail to meet people's demands." During the meeting, Subcommander Pedro pointed out his organization is not connected with the EZLN and other groups that operate in the Central American isthmus. According to the report published by EL ORBE, the Frecoms has active members in Chiapas, Tabasco, Campeche, and Oaxaca States. Subcommander Pedro also said his organization wants a change toward democracy. Today in EL ORBE, this alleged armed group published an open letter requesting a meeting with Governor Lopez to participate in the peace negotiations. Archbishop Arizmendi Esquivel reported that, according to information provided by the 42 priests who make up this dioceses and who visit the communities of La Costa, Soconusco, Frontera, and Sierra, "this armed group does not exist." He added that the priests are in constant contact with the residents of this region as well as with the catechists, and "no movements by armed people or groups that are part of a front similar to the EZLN have been detected, unless it is so secret, no one knows about it so far." The Tapachula bishop, however, did not rule out that some people are trying to manipulate the population, trying to stage an uprising to meet personal demands, or that someone simply wants to make "more noise." This is why he urged the population not to be concerned by broadcast information that goes beyond what prudence dictates and why he asked the media to be careful in the handling of this type of news, which could trigger uncertainty among the population. The priest underscored that fighting for the rights of individuals and groups is beneficial, but he asked people not to take up arms and make threats, which leads only to violence and confrontation.
