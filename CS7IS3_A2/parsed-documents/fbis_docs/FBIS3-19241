Mr. Narasimha Rao declared that India will continue with its economic reform programs while ensuring that the government does not lose touch with the realities and exigencies of development for the vast number of underprivileged. Mr. Rao was replying to the toast proposed by the British prime minister, Mr. John Major, who hosted a lunch in Mr. Rao's honor at 10 Downing Street in London. He said a democratic and secular India pursuing economic liberalization is keen on tapping the vast potential in Indo-British relationship. He observed that during the last two years, Indo-British ties had made remarkable progress. The progress has been visible since Mr. Major visited New Delhi in January last year. The Indo-British Partnership Initiative, IBPI, was today extended by another year. The IBPI was set up in January 1993 for a period of one year to increase awareness of trade and investment opportunities between the two countries. The recommendations of the two co-chairmen of IBPI were presented to Mr. Narasimha Rao and Mr. John Major today. The report recommends for greater emphasis on the involvement of small- and medium-size companies. It has identified different sectors for business opportunities. These sectors include agro food processing, manufacturing technology, telecommunications and (?telemetry), infrastructure and environment, oil and gas, and industrial components. The report among other things identified major issues for the governments. Some of these are reduction in tariff, import duty, single window clearance system, flexibility in labor laws, and comprehensive infrastructure development. Our correspondent Alok Deshwal reports from London that New Delhi is the largest recipient of British overseas assistance for 1993-94. The United Kingdom has pledged 239 million pounds to India during this period. Later, in his meeting with the secretary of state for defense, Mr. Rifkind, the prime minister discussed various ways and means of increasing defense cooperation between the two countries. Earlier, in the morning, Mr. Narasimha Rao had a breakfast meeting with the lord mayor of London. The prime minister called upon the British investors to show quick decisions about making investments in India. Britain has announced a 10 million pounds assistance for the World Bank-aided rehabilitation project in the Maharashtra earthquake-hit areas. During her half-an-hour meeting with the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, in London this morning, the minister for overseas development assistance, Baroness (Linda Chalker), said this will be in addition to 3 million pounds aid Britain has already given. Earlier, the prime minister, Mr. Narasimha Rao, was formally received by the British prime minister, Mr. John Major; and the foreign secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd, at the Foreign Office in London this morning. He also inspected a special guard of honor.
