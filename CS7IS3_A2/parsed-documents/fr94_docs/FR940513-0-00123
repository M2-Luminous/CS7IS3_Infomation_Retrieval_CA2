FR940513-0-00123 FR940513-0-00031 Paperwork Reduction Act This rule does not contain a collection of information requirement for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. Environmental Impact FRA has evaluated these regulations in accordance with its procedures for ensuring full consideration of the environmental impact of FRA actions, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), other environmental statutes, Executive Orders, and DOT Order 5610.1c. It has been determined that this rule will not have any effect on the quality of the environment. Federalism Implications This rule will not have a substantial effect on the states, on the relationship between the national government and the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, preparation of a Federalism Assessment is not warranted. Under section 205 of the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970 (45 U.S.C. 434), issuance of this regulation preempts any State law, rule, regulation, order, or standard covering the same subject matter, except for a provision directed at a local safety hazard if that provision is consistent with this rule and does not impose an undue burden on interstate commerce. List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 229 Railroad safety. Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, FRA amends part 229, title 49, Code of Federal Regulations to read as follows: PART 229_RAILROAD LOCOMOTIVE SAFETY STANDARDS 1. The authority citation for part 229 is revised to read as follows: Authority: 45 U.S.C. 22&hyph;34; 45 U.S.C. 431, 438; 49 App. U.S.C. 1655(e); Pub. L. 100&hyph;342; Pub. L. 102&hyph;365; Pub. L. 102&hyph;533; 49 CFR 1.49 (c), (g) and (m). 2. Section 229.133 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows: ยง229.133 Interim Locomotive Conspicuity Measures_Auxiliary External Lights * * * * * (b) Each qualifying arrangement of auxiliary external lights shall conform to one of the following descriptions: (1) Ditch lights. (i) Ditch lights shall consist of two white lights, each producing a steady beam of at least 200,000 candela, placed at the front of the locomotive, at least 36 inches above the top of the rail. (ii) Ditch lights shall be spaced at least 36 inches apart if the vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the ditch lights is 60 inches or more. (iii) Ditch lights shall be spaced at least 60 inches apart if the vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the ditch lights is less than 60 inches. (iv) Ditch lights shall be focused horizontally within 45 degrees of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive. (2) Strobe lights. (i) Strobe lights shall consist of two white stroboscopic lights, each with ``effective intensity,'' as defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society's Guide for Calculating the Effective Intensity of Flashing Signal Lights (November 1964), of at least 500 candela. (ii) The flash rate of strobe lights shall be at least 40 flashes per minute and at most 180 flashes per minute. (iii) Strobe lights shall be placed at the front of the locomotive, at least 48 inches apart, and at most 36 inches above the top of the rail. (3) Crossing lights. (i) Crossing lights shall consist of two white lights, placed at the front of the locomotive, at least 36 inches above the top of the rail. (ii) Crossing lights shall be spaced at least 36 inches apart if the vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the ditch lights is 60 inches or more. (iii) Crossing lights shall be spaced at least 60 inches apart if the vertical distance from the headlight to the horizontal axis of the ditch lights is less than 60 inches. (iv) Each crossing light shall produce at least 200,000 candela, either steadily burning or alternately flashing. (v) The flash rate of crossing lights shall be at least 40 flashes per minute and at most 180 flashes per minute. (vi) Crossing lights shall be focused horizontally within 15 degrees of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive. (4) Oscillating light. (i) An oscillating light shall consist of: (A) one steadily burning white light producing at least 200,000 candela in a moving beam that depicts a circle or a horizontal figure ``8'' to the front, about the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive; or (B) two or more white lights producing at least 200,000 candela each, at one location on the front of the locomotive, that flash alternately with beams within five degrees horizontally to either side of the longitudinal centerline of the locomotive. (ii) An oscillating light may incorporate a device that automatically extinguishes the white light if display of a light of another color is required to protect the safety of railroad operations. * * * * * Issued in Washington, DC, on May 9, 1994.
