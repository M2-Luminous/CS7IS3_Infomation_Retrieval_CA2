FR940412-2-00159 FR940412-2-00113 [Release No. 34&hyph;33856; File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;05] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Participants Trust Company; Order Approving and Filing and Order Granting Accelerated Approval to Amendment to Proposed Rule Change Relating to Restrictions in the Intraday Payment of Principal and Interest April 4, 1994. On November 12, 1993, the Participants Trust Company (``PTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;PTC&hyph;93&hyph;05) pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 amending PTC's rules regarding intraday payments of principal and interest (``P&I''). Notice of the proposal appeared in the Federal Register on January 20, 1994. 2 On February 14, 1994, PTC filed Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, 3 requesting permanent approval of its pilot program of intraday payment of collected and available P&I. 4 No comments were received on the proposed rule change set forth in the notice. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33462 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3146. 3 Letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, PTC, to Francois Mazur, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (February 14, 1994). 4 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33132 (November 2, 1993), 58 FR 59501. I. Description The proposal would establish, on a permanent basis, PTC's authority to offer participants the opportunity to receive, on an intraday basis, payment of principal and interest PTC has received on their behalf. PTC first offered this service on a pilot basis in November 1993. 5 In addition to making this service permanent, the proposal would codify the requirement that intraday distribution of P&I shall be made only from P&I payments collected and in immediately available funds at such time, without recourse to borrowed funds or to alternate sources of funds. 5 Id. Under this service, participants are able to receive 50% of the P&I payments made with respect to GNMA I securities by means of an intraday Fedwire transfer of immediately available funds at approximately 12 noon on the distribution date, with the balance distributed by means of a credit to such participants at end-of-day. 6 Before November 1993, PTC's rules and procedures provided that PTC disburse P&I on securities deposited at PTC by means of a credit to a participant's applicable account cash balance. As a result, a participant would receive available funds in the amount of the P&I, net of any account debits and/or credits, at the end of the day as part of the settlement payment process. 6 Id. These percentages, and the ability of participants to select the method of payment, may change upon future Commission approval, taking into account P&I collection and disbursement experience, the impact on PTC's settlement cycle of intraday disbursement of P&I by Fedwire transfer, and participant response to the pilot program. On November 16, 1993, PTC implemented its early P&I pilot program. A total of 44 participants chose to receive the early cash disbursement of 50% of their P&I allotment, while 10 chose to receive their total allotment at net settlement. Letter from John J. Sceppa, President and Chief Executive Officer, PTC, to Judith Poppalardo, Assistant Director, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (November 23, 1993). Each month since then, PTC has affected a successful intraday distributions of P&I. Letter from Leopold S. Rassnick, Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, PTC, to Francois Mazur, Staff Attorney, Division of Market Regulation, Commission (March 17, 1994). II. Discussion The Commission believes that PTC's proposed rule change is consistent with section 17A of the Act and, specifically, with sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F). 7 Those sections require that the rules of a clearing agency be designed to facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to protect investors and the public interest. 7 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(A) & (F). The Commission believes that PTC's proposal will allow participants to get P&I funds faster consistent with systemic concerns. Limiting intra-day payments to immediately available funds held by PTC will ensure that PTC's other funds are available if required to achieve end-of-day settlement. 8 8 Such funds include, but are not limited to, PTC's own funds, funds obtained from PTC's uncommitted P&I line of credit, as well as other borrowings which may be used to fund P&I distribution when affected as part of the end-of-day settlement. Participants are limited to receiving up to 50% of their P&I allotment disbursement early. Any increase in percentage would require that PTC file a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Act.
