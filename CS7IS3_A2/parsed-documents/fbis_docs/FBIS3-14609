Vivekanand, JORDAN TIMES staff reporter] [Text] Amman--A German vessel was turned away early Monday [28 March] from the Gulf of Aqaba by the enforcers of the international sanctions against Iraq despite an agreement under which cargo aboard the ship was supposed to have been inspected at al-'Aqabah port, informed sources said. They said the 13,000-tonne Skyman was denied entry after inspectors aboard the American-led warships patrolling the Red Sea insisted on their own interpretation of an agreement reached with Jordan, the sources said. Under the accord, the first of its kind since the sanctions against Iraq went into force in August 1990, an inspector from one of the U.S. warships was to aboard the Skyman at the Tiran Straits in the mouth of the Gulf of Aqaba and come to the port aboard the vessel to supervise the inspection of the cargo unloaded at the port, the sources said. "But instead of sending an inspector aboard the vessel, the Americans insisted that the agreement was that a warship will accompany the Skyman to al-'Aqabah," said one of the sources. "The Jordanian government rejected the suggestion and hence the ship was turned away," added the source, who, like others who confirmed the incident, spoke on condition of anonymity. According to another source, "Jordan rejected the American suggestion since (the Kingdom) considered the entry of a ship escorted by a warship into Jordanian waters as an infringement of its sovereignty." Furthermore, said the source, the American insistence on sending a frigate to accompany the Skyman despite Jordan's record of abiding by the sanctions against Iraq was also seen as raising questions on the Kingdom's credibility and sincerity. His Majesty King Husayn has repeatedly said that Jordan would not allow anyone to question its credibility and sincerity. When it was known two days ago that the cargo aboard the Skyman -- 3,000 tonnes of general cargo including steel rods and animal feed -- was to be inspected on land at al-'Aqabah port instead of the Tiran Straits, hopes were raised that it could be the forerunner of an arrangement to move all cargo inspections to port. Under the proposed arrangement, a neutral international agency would inspect all incoming and outgoing cargo for violations of the sanctions against Iraq. The Skyman was first turned away last Wednesday after four inspections since March 19 failed to satisfy the "cargo accessibility" demands of the inspectors. Following the denial of entry, for the ship proceeded towards the Gulf Port of Dubai to unload cargo destined there before possibly returning to al-'Aqabah or offloading the Jordan-bound cargo elsewhere the shipowners or consigners--as the case may be subject to the terms and conditions of the bill of lading--to tranship the goods to al-'Aqabah. [sentence as published] Contacts launched by the Jordanian government led to the agreement for an on-land inspection of the cargo and the Skyman was recalled to the Red Sea, only to be turned away again as happened on Monday. The Skyman was the seventh ship to be intercepted and subjected to costly delays this year compared with 20 vessels during last year. U.S. Navy spokesman deny that there is an escalation of interceptions and tightening of inspection procedures despite the high number of ships delayed or forced to offload cargo elsewhere. Jordan has lodged numerous protests to the U.N. Security Council, which imposed and authorised the enforcement of the sanctions, and the U.S., which is leading the monitoring of the sanctions. The protests highlighted that the actual victim of the overzealous enforcement of the sanctions was Jordan and that the volume of Iraq-bound cargo passing through al-'Aqabah had declined to less than 20 per cent of the pre-Gulf crisis level. Shipping agents say that Iraq-bound goods passing through Turkey and Iran are six times that coming to al-'Aqabah and point out that Turkish bound and Iran-bound vessels are not subjected to any inspections.
