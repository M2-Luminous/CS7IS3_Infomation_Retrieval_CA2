After recalling the events four years ago when our people began to free themselves from the dictatorship and communism, as well as the difficult work, so that the hope that was born from the blood shed in December 1989 may materialize, and after emphasizing that, due to the support by friends abroad, Romania was admitted to the big European family and that each Romanian citizen will thus be able to appeal to the Council of Europe every time the institutions in Romania violate the regulations regarding human rights, that the United States has granted us most-favored-nation status -- the advantageous customs regime granted to friendly countries -- former King Mihai expresses his gladness that, through his public interventions and personal contacts, he was able to contribute to the recognition of the place due to Romania within the community of nations. The message then emphasizes, quote: Despite these efforts made everywhere in order to support you in your struggle for dignity, freedom, and prosperity, our country continues to flounder in complete misery, unquote. Noting that everywhere there is goodwill, creative energy, considerable riches and capabilities, former King Mihai expresses the desire that all these things be freed and united to serve the country for the benefit of all. He stresses that unity cannot be achieved without national reconciliation. From the bottom of my heart, through my prayers, and through my wishes, which I extend to you today, the message continues, I want to express the desire and will to be among you and with you. Let us contribute to conciliation and unity, and let us help all Romanians within the country and outside it. With belief and confidence in the future, the message ends with the following wishes: May Romania be reborn for the benefit of all Romanians. So may the Lord help us.
