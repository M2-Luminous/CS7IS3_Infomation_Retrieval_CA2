The province produced 45 million tons of coal last year, one third of the output was sold to other southern provinces. During a recent tour of Guizhou, Minister of the Coal Industry Wang Shenhao said coal is important for southern China, which is witnessing a booming economy but suffers from an acute shortage of raw materials and energy. According to the official sources, China produced 1.14 billion tons of coal last year. The majority were produced in northern China. The southern provinces, which turned out only 300 million tons of coal last year, have to transport coal from the north or to import it, which worsens the transportation shortage. Guizhou plans to build a coking plant with a capacity of 400,000 tons, a plant with a capacity 80,000 tons of methyl alcohol and a power station with an installed capacity of 800,000 kw to one million kw. In addition, a coal mine with a capacity of producing four million tons of coal a year will be developed. Meanwhile, four railway lines extending from Guiyang, the capital, to Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangxi and Hunan provinces have been electrified or renovated, and a railroad for transporting coal from Guizhou to Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is under construction.
