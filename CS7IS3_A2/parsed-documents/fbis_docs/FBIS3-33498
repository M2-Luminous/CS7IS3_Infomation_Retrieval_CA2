Speaking to various female audiences ranging from professionals to factory workers, Samper said he would adopt a policy of "positive discrimination" in favor of women whereby a woman would be given preference over a man in situations where equally qualified male and female candidates are being considered for a job or promotion. Samper's seven-point program to benefit women would include: Formulation of a National Development Plan to promote greater opportunities and equality for women; measures to reduce unemployment among women, especially those between 25-35 years of age; a promise that, by the end of his term, women would occupy half of the managerial and advisory positions in his government; flexibility in work schedules to accommodate the needs of working mothers; better training for child-care providers to improve their wage status; more severe punishment for violence against women; and subsidies to help female heads of households. During one address to a group of factory workers, most of whom were single mothers, Samper also said his administration would provide 500,000 subsidized housing units and implement a program of microenterprises for female heads of households.
