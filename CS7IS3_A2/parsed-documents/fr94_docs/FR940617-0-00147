FR940617-0-00147 FR940617-0-00026 Some comments suggested that the proposed rule would cause a significant increase in fuel consumption. EPA maintains that the impact of this rule on fleet average fuel consumption will be minimal. EPA's experience with on-highway engines is that fuel consumption decreases when the various technologies to control emissions are added. From 1988 to 1991, fuel consumption decreased one percent, while NO X and smoke decreased about 40 percent for the average on-highway engine. Specific power also increased four percent. EPA's on-highway findings are consistent with an analysis presented by Caterpillar at the American Petroleum Institute Off-Highway Forum in September, 1993 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (see the RSD for details of this analysis). EPA's estimate of hardware costs accounts for those additional costs needed to control fuel consumption beyond what is necessary to reduce NO X emission levels to meet the standard. These methods to both reduce NO X emissions and maintain current fuel consumption and performance have been used for a number of years in the on-highway fleet. Since fuel economy and power are important criteria for the consumers of these engines, most manufacturers commented that they are going to add hardware to their engines in an effort to maintain current levels of performance. Some manufacturers commented that while they would do their best to fully maintain the baseline fuel economy levels, selected engine models would incur a small fuel economy penalty despite their efforts. While a small number of engine families may not be capable, for either technical or cost reasons, to fully retain current fuel consumption and power levels, EPA's past experience with the on-highway program has shown that most engine models will be able to attain the emission standards without compromising fuel consumption or power. One manufacturer stated that it expected fuel efficiency to increase over time as manufacturers optimize their engine designs. EPA has strong evidence from its historical database suggesting that is the case.
