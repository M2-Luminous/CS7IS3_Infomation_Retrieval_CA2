Tizi Ouzou -- Ouacif has not escaped this terrible affliction. In the last 10 days, several cases have been diagnosed in the remote region of Tizi Ouzou. As of last Wednesday, the toll was one person dead and 11 hospitalized. The sudden resurgence of this disease, which everyone thought was eradicated forever, is due mainly to the inadequate coverage of the vaccination program in recent years, according to what we were told by various physicians. Mr. Semmoud, a physician and Ouacif's top health official, said the majority of individuals diagnosed with the disease fall in the 12-to-17-year-old age bracket, most of them in very poor condition, already sick or never vaccinated. To cope with any further escalation of the problem, a crisis cell was created to maintain a 24-hour watch on the situation. In that context, and because it was in Ouacif that diphtheria cases were first identified, personnel at the CEMs [Colleges of Intermediate Studies] and high schools of downtown Ouacif were vaccinated. Also, in each case diagnosed, everyone living in the household and immediate vicinity were examined. For the moment, the situation is far from reaching alarming proportions. All the necessary equipment and personnel have been deployed to the scene, a fact that we were able to verify during our tour of Ouacif high school, where we noted a massive official presence. From the prevention standpoint, it is vital to understand that diphtheria is an infectious disease, transmitted orally, whose symptoms are inflammation and spasmodic constriction of the throat and high fever. Thus, citizens should consult a physician immediately at the onset of these symptoms. Finally, it should be noted that this epidemic has also affected other parts of Tizi Ouzou, as well as several other wilayas.
