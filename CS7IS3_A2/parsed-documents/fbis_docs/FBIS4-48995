Hong Kong people should not have any concern over the troops stationed in Hong Kong. Zhang Junsheng said: "The PLA is the people's own army in our country and an important force for defending our nation. Thanks to a strong PLA, our country can be independent and enjoy a stable environment for economic construction. Therefore, we should more readily accept our PLA." A reporter mentioned that some PLA men had beaten civilians, and Zhang replied: "It is possible that one or two people in the armed forces violate discipline, and such things may happen in any country in the world. This afternoon, the leaders of the military unit also said that if such things happen, they will handle them seriously. I think that we should still set our eyes on the mainstream of the Army." Zhu Yucheng said: "The troops to be stationed in Hong Kong in the future certainly should know more about Hong Kong, and the best troops should be selected for this mission. I hope that more activities like this will be organized. Hong Kong people should not be concerned over the PLA because they are the people's own troops and their quality and discipline are absolutely perfect."
