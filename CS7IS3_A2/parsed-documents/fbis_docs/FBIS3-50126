Coposu based his assertion on the fact that the participation of the PUNR in the new government will ensure the country neither stability at home nor credibility abroad. The PNTCD chairman also stressed the fact that, judging from the information he holds, the West considers the PUNR to be an expression of extremism that exceeds even that of the Greater Romania Party [PRM]. In the same context, Coposu assessed that the new government formula will lead to restoration and the blocking of reform. PNTCD Spokesman Radu Vasile assessed that a situation will be created that everyone thought had been brought to an end in 1989. Talking about the rejection of the opposition's offer to assume the responsibility of governing, the PNTCD leaders considered it natural that the Socialist Party of Labor [PSM] and the PRM will also be included in the executive, as those parties support the current government, our correspondent Elena Perdichi reports.
