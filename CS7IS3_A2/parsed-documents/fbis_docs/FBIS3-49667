During his talks with the president of the Czech Republic, Walesa noted that what counted to him and to Poland, above all else, were facts rather than declarations. The most important issue facing us now is to translate declarations into facts. Declarations by themselves are not enough; they are often reminiscent of "wearing a necktie in a coffin", the president of the Polish Republic said. It was agreed during the talks that NATO could have done more for our countries than it has. Speaking about both countries' efforts to enter NATO, President Havel added that he has been doing through diplomatic means the exact same things President Walesa has been doing at full volume. It was also agreed during the talks that the latest Russian actions had the characteristics of blackmail against Europe and the world. Speaking about the "Partnership for Peace", the president of the Polish Republic remarked that it was a road to NATO that would, however, need to materialize very quickly. We should already be working on "clarifying" our relations with NATO. We can also count on each another in the event of external danger, Walesa said, summing up the talks. The talks between Walesa and U.S. President Bill Clinton, which took place in a very good and relaxed atmosphere, mainly concerned issues connected with security, NATO, and the economy, the BPP statement reports. President Clinton said that security issues also depend on economic issues. America is opening up to Poland, he added. Some had interpreted the "Partnership for Peace" as a compromise between doing nothing and NATO membership. For me, this plan is a way of reaching the North Atlantic pact. We need time for this to happen, however. Poland's security is in the interests of the United States, President Clinton noted. He also emphasized that he did not want to create new divisions. Walesa emphasized the role of the United States as a superpower responsible for what is happening in the world. Speaking about declarations, he drew attention to our country's negative historical experiences. He recalled, among other things, President Yeltsin's declaration made during his official visit to Poland last year. It has become no more than a paper declaration, the Polish president added. "We are not anti-Russian. It is not Poland, it is Europe that should be afraid of Russia." We merely want Europe to integrate with our area as quickly as possible, Walesa concluded. Walesa invited the president of the United States to pay a visit to our country in May this year. Polish Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak, who took part in the meeting, raised economic problems first and foremost, drawing attention to the need for a "partnership for development", the BPP told PAP. "On the path toward making the Partnership for Peace a reality, we need a partnership for development." The BPP statement reports that this was one of the main arguments in Prime Minister Pawlak's address during the Prague talks between the Polish delegation led by President Lech Walesa and President Clinton. The prime minister noted that he actually interprets the term of "Partnership for Development" as a stimulation of economic development with the United States and Western Europe. He stressed that there are still too many barriers in this respect. "Now that the Uruguay round of GATT talks has been closed, we now have to concentrate on eliminating many restrictions that remain outside the tariff. Their place must be taken by offers of mutually complimentary projects", the prime minister said. He spoke with approval about the statement by President Clinton, who spoke in Brussels about a need for greater openness by the West toward economic cooperation with Central and Eastern Europe. Pawlak stated that economic cooperation constitutes a condition for genuine integration of Europe and for its security. During the meeting, a full unanimity with President Clinton with regard to views on this subject was noted. The U.S. President recalled his speeches calling upon the leaders of Western European countries to eliminate barriers in trade and appeals to businessmen to invest in Central and Eastern European countries. Economic matters were also a subject at Prime Minister Pawlak's meeting with Czech Republic Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The Polish prime minister stated that achieving NATO membership must be linked with economic development, and cooperation between the two countries has a significant role to play. Pawlak declared readiness to intensify concrete working contacts that would produce, for instance, the abolition of barriers in trade exchange, would ensure the fluidity of mutual trade clearing, or would bring about the intensification of cross-border cooperation, the BPP reported. "It is not guarantees that create facts but facts that make guarantees possible" was the leitmotif of all of President Walesa's meetings in Prague today. The BPP reported that the issue of the future of the Visegrad Group countries in the system of European security was raised. In the afternoon, Walesa met Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and Slovak President Michal Kovac [words indistinct]. The main subject of both meetings was cooperation, both bilateral and regional, between our countries, and the future of all countries of the group in NATO structures. According to President Goncz, Hungary, which feels "war breathing down its neck" in view of the proximity of the Balkan conflict, is anxious for quick ties with NATO, although it is aware that the speed of our march toward the pact depends on the development of the situation in Russia. President Walesa again stressed that the most important thing is an overall vision of the future, while individual interests are less important, the BPP statement says. Appraising cooperation between Poland and Hungary, President Goncz admitted that it is inadequate today. There is a chance to stimulate cooperation, especially within the Carpathian region. Primarily this concerns economic, including trade, cooperation. "The free-trade skeleton should be fleshed out somewhat," President Goncz said. It was established that Polish-Hungarian talks will be continued during an official visit to Poland by the president of the Hungarian Republic, who is going to be a guest of the president of the Polish Republic. Poland is also expecting a visit by Slovak President Kovac, who during today's Prague meeting with President Walesa thought cooperation in the Visegrad Group needs new stimuli and a new driving force, although there is no need to build institutions. With regard to our relations with NATO, he noted there will still be a need for talks and contacts between the ministers of defense, foreign affairs, and the economic departments of the Group's states. They will map out the next stages of our activities on this issue. President Kovac sought reasons for the weak bilateral cooperation between Poland and Slovakia. First and foremost, he attributed it to the short period of existence of an independent Slovakia and in the stereotypes from the previous era of thinking only about yourself. We are linked by many things, however. "An important element linking our countries is Catholicism," said President Kovac. Today there is a chance for our cooperation to become authentic, rather than being conferred by Moscow. Both regional and bilateral cooperation is necessary. This was also mentioned by President Walesa, who said that NATO will come to us itself if we show that we are strong through the strength of our economy, the strength of our stability." The presidents' meeting in Prague ended with a ceremonial dinner given by President Havel, attended by the heads of state of the Visegrad Group states, writes the BPP.
