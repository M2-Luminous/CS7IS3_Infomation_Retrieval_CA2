Commenting on recent remarks by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, who has showed a flexible stance toward major revisions of the political reform bills, Ichikawa said: "Different approaches could be possible if the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] is ready to accept our concessions without boycotting Diet deliberations. Under the present circumstance, it is difficult for coalition parties to allow further concessions on the main points of the bills." It is believed that Ichikawa's remarks were made in view of opinions among Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] members. The quota for single-seat constituencies was already increased from 250 to 274 when the bills passed the lower house, and the SDPJ would certainly oppose a further increase. As an example of concessions, Hata proposed dividing a nationwide constituency for the proportional representative election into several regional blocs; however, Ichikawa noted: "Not only the LDP, but also each party in the coalition would have various opinions on the design of the regional constituency blocs. If we set our hands on this issue, it would take at least 40 days to reach an accord. I do not think it is a realistic idea."
