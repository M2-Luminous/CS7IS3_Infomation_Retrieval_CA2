No formal explanation has been given. Since the two papers are printed in Tashkent, the decision has affected subscribers not only in Uzbekistan but also Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, and parts of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. Local observers say RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA may have been punished because of its carrying of an article about LDP [Liberal Democratic Party] leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy in its December 24 issue.
