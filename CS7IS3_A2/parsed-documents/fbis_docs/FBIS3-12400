[passage omitted] Naturally, this has left bad and negative effects on the peace process as a whole, because it proves that the Israelis do not want peace. They are now retracting everything they have signed. I would like to recall that Rabin said that there were no sacred schedules. Now, there are no sacred clauses, and tomorrow he will say there are no sacred agreements. This indicates that they are retracting what has been agreed on and what we signed in Washington last year. [passage omitted] [Correspondent] Your Excellency, you presided over an emergency meeting of the PLO's Executive Committee yesterday to look into Washington's invitation. ['Arafat] A meeting of the Palestinian leadership. [Correspondent] Of course, the Palestinian leadership to look into Washington's invitation and the measures which the Israeli authorities have decided to take in the aftermath of the massacre of Ibrahim's mosque. What was the final decision about these two issues? ['Arafat] I am quickly going back after my meeting with the president [Zeroual] to continue that meeting. The meeting has not ended yet. The meeting began yesterday and it will be continued today. [Correspondent] Does this mean that you are waiting for the Security's Council's final resolution? ['Arafat] One of the things we are looking forward to is a clear resolution by the Security Council condemning the crime and setting up an investigating committee. More important than that is international protection for our people. This was stated in the agreement which said "temporary international presence" [last three words spoken in English] which means temporary international presence, and we insist that that presence should take place as soon as possible so that we may rest assured that our people can be protected from those conspiracies, massacres, and trials. [Correspondent] Your Excellency the president, what do you say to the Israeli announcement on the imminent release of about 1,000 Palestinians, and the issue of disarming the Jewish settlers? ['Arafat] At the beginning they said "some". [Correspondent] Eight hundred or 1,000? ['Arafat] No, no, no. I am talking about the armed settlers. He said he would disarm some Israeli settlers; some, some, some, i.e. a few. Have you paid attention? We say the settlers should be disarmed of all weapons, because carrying weapons should not be allowed; second, I agreed with Peres in the Cairo meeting on this number and more. Therefore, he brought nothing new. [Correspondent] Your Excellency the President, following the Ibrahim mosque massacre, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon suspended their consultations in the peace talks. What is the Palestinian stance in the light of the recent developments on the Palestinian, Arab, and international arenas? ['Arafat] I have recalled all our negotiators not only from Washington. I have invited our negotiators to yesterday's and today's meetings, why? To discuss with the brother members and heads of the delegations in Taba, Cairo, Paris, and Washington. We enormously thank Algeria, the president, government, leadership, and people for the fraternal, continued, and constant stances which it adopts with the Palestinian fighters at the different levels.
