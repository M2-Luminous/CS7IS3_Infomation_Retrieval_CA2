The warmongers also said they would conduct a large-scale war exercise--a combination of Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises--in August, if the Team Spirit joint military exercise is suspended. The puppet clique's remarks--which deteriorate North-South relations and aggravate tensions on the Korean peninsula--is a clear expression of their criminal attempt to stimulate the atmosphere of war instead of peace and to continue to embark upon the road of confrontation and war instead of conciliation and unity. As is known, during the DPRK-U.S. contacts at the end of last year, the U.S. side officially expressed its willingness to suspend the Team Spirit joint military exercise in an effort to eliminate a nuclear threat to us. Therefore, we decided to allow the necessary inspections to guarantee the continuity of the basic safeguards [sunsu tambo]. As a result, we brought about a breakthrough for the progress of the talks. At a time when there are positive prospects for the settlement of the nuclear issue, the South Korean puppets are viciously maneuvering to conduct a new joint military exercise by babbling about other kinds of military exercises. This is a shameless plot to apply, by any means, the brakes on the progress in the DPRK-U.S. talks and to create a new grave obstacle to the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. This shows that the puppets actually do not want the fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula even if they talk about denuclerization and preconditions, and that they only pursue division and confrontation. With the beginning of the new year, the South Korean puppets are showing their intention to pursue arms confrontation, while talking about the assumption of the combatant posture and the immediate countermeasure posture. Also, the fact that they are going to conduct a large-scale war exercise this time clearly shows such intention. If another large-scale joint military exercise is conducted again in South Korea instead of the Team Spirit joint military exercise, this means, indeed, that they would continue to conduct the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Even if the large-scale joint military exercise had another name, it would be, in essence, similar to the Team Spirit joint military exercise. Therefore, if they continue the joint military exercise like the Team Spirit exercise, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula will neither be resolved nor the relaxation of tension and peace be achieved. Also, they will create more dangerous war situations on the Korean peninsula. We are ready for either dialogue or war. If the puppet clique provokes a reckless war, we will resolutely counter fire with fire [purun pullo tasurilkkosimnida]. The South Korean puppets must be clearly aware that aggravating tensions on the Korean peninsula, turning them into an acute situation of confrontation, will only bring destruction to them. They must not act recklessly.
