They allegedly agreed with them a plan of action during the period preceding the parliamentary elections in Macedonia. It was claimed that three groups were set up, to deal with ideological, propaganda, and military matters, in which the Rakovski Officers Legion was also reportedly involved. The plans of the "conspiracy" included setting up a radio transmitter in the vicinity of the Macedonian border. On the other side of the border, within Macedonia itself, the "groups" were supposedly intending to work to overcome the differences between parties whose stances were close to one another.
