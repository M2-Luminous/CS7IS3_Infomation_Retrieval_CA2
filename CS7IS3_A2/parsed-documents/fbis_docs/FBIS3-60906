The explosion, condemned by politicians, came as Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, in an interview conducted before the Christmas break, appealed to the IRA to stop prevaricating over the British-Irish joint declaration -- and to lay down their arms forever. Mr Hurd warned that if the Provisionals refused to accept the Downing Street Declaration, then security measures would be stepped up against them. You can expect no let-up and no quarter on that front," he told them bluntly during the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. The blast, within the compound of the police station in the remote Co Tyrone village of Fintona, injured a man and a women and caused widespread damage to the base and surrounding homes. It came in clear defiance of appeals by the Queen, politicians and churchmen for the violence to end, and it destroyed the hopes of war-weary Ulster people that the "ceasefire" would continue as a truce while the IRA considered its response to the declaration. But hopes were not completely dashed either in London or Dublin where it was always realised that the IRA high command had a tough job on its hands to convince followers of the need to end the violence. Nevertheless, there is growing irritation in both governments that the Provisionals have given not the slightest indication yet that they will cooperate and enable Sinn Fein eventually to take part in talks about the future of the Province.
