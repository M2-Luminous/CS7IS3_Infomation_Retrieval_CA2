He is determined to continue them," Interfax was told Thursday by the chairman of the Central Bank Viktor Geraschenko. Regarding statements by former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, Geraschenko said that they seem to be like a "quarrel in a communal kitchen." "I have never had to live in a communal kitchen," he went on, "except for when I was evacuated from Kazan, and I am accustomed to correlating my actions with those of people who live and work beside me." "Even different approaches to the reform must not reduce to kitchen squabbles," said Geraschenko. "My attitude to Boris Fedorov has always been normal and I believe his rhetorical attacks against myself and Aleksandr Zaveryukha are down to his age and character and I will not be losing sleep over them." "Fedorov is not that fine an expert in finances, and his resignation will not be dramatic for Russia," believes Geraschenko. "There have never been indispensable workers and there will not be any in the future," he said. He confirmed that fact that the reforms were reoriented to meet social needs and flatly denied Fedorov's statements that agriculture was a "black hole" through which the agroindustrial complex was still seeking credits. Geraschenko believes that it is unwise to rely on food imports. Any country sustains its agricultural production, even if it is less expensive to buy food abroad, he believes. "It is necessary to import food and at the same time increase agricultural production in Russia," said the chairman of the Central Bank of Russia.
