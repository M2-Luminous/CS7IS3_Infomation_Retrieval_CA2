Dlouhy said he and Wieshau were discussing what was already a second draft of an agreement, and that from here on a group of Czech and Bavarian experts would work on the problem. Wieshau said Bavaria fully supported the pipeline project, but that the Czechs were the party with the primary interest in it. Those who own the land over which the pipeline will run want to know who will insure them against terrorist attacks, natural disasters, or other "acts of God," and it cannot be Bavaria, he said. He said a law on pipeline-landowner land rights had been worked out in the Bavarian Parliament, but that it needed to be passed by the October elections or "we will have to start from square one." Construction of the pipeline from the Bavarian town of Ingolstadt to Nelahozeves u Kralup in central Bohemia began in the Czech Republic in September. Construction of the pipeline in Germany is expected to begin this spring. The entire project should be completed in 1995, but Wieshau said this depends on what happens in the parliament.
