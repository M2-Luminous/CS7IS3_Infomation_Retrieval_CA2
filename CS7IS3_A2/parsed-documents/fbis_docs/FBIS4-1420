Gary Alfonso is standing by. [Alfonso] Good evening. We have just returned from a news conference with the chief minister of KwaZulu and also the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] leader Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi, and unfortunately our previous program cut out halfway due to a failure of power here, and we hope you can see it at the moment. So this is the news conference, as it happened a short while ago. It seems there's a crisis looming, the IFP could pull out of the elections. That's the scenario. Dr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi said, when he said that the elections are not free and fair in this area, and unless something happens, that could change. We bring you that news conference as it happened. [Begin recording] [Buthelezi] I think the crisis revolves around the IFP stickers, because that has been the case since yesterday that many elderly people who queued up in various places could not -- I was in Umlazi this morning and also here in Ulundi and other places, they are confused as most of our people, more than 60 percent I would say are either illiterate or semi-literate. They were told that those who support my party must go for the bottom, must go for the last party. But now we discovered that even in Cape Town people were supplied with papers which didn't have the IFP sticker. So there was a lot of anger among those people in Cape Town who would have liked to vote for the IFP. But now Dr. Mzimela, who is in Johannesburg permanently in order to be available to the IEC [Independent Electoral Commission], has just reported to the head of my department that a suggestion has been made. It appears as if the IFP stickers are really running short, if they are not exhausted -- supplies already exhausted. Now that prevents a very serious crisis as far as I'm concerned because it seems that a suggestion which in fact we rejected on the 19th when we signed the agreement with the state president and Mr. Mandela on the basis of which we are participating in the elections, when someone suggested that people could just write IFP at the bottom. That was out of the question, first of all because most of our people are illiterate, and secondly, we believe that it interferes also with the secrecy of the ballot. So, I have been informed by our information office in Durban that in fact such papers, you know, have been completely exhausted now. The supplies are exhausted, and if that be the case then we are heading for a very serious problem because I have already sent a fax letter to Judge Kriegler, as the chairman of the IEC. In this letter, I am asking him in fact whether we are really trying to foist that option of writing IFP at the bottom of the paper, when it was rejected, when it was rejected before we signed the agreement on the base of which we are participating in the elections, because quite clearly I think that I will have to ask for a very special meeting of the Central Committee to rule out whether, in fact, we can be part of that which is now...[pauses] if that is true, if we are going to be part of that, that it's going to be an operation now outside of the four corners of the agreement that was made on the 19th in Pretoria. So I felt that this matter was serious because all of you here are aware that these stickers, from the very word go, yesterday, in many parts they were not even available. But to actually hear now that the supplies have been exhausted completely -- they represent us with a serious ... a serious ... a serious crisis, I think, because there is no way ... there is no way in which we will accept -- I don't know of course what the Central Committee will say if I put it to them, but as far as I'm concerned we made it clear on the 19th that, that was unacceptable, and there is no way in which we can accept that today, because quite clearly we would be losers. And Judge Kriegler of course was here, on television just now, after I had invited you already to come here, and he was saying some things about those papers that do not have this or those papers where people write IFP could be counted separately and they could decide how ... [pauses] what their value is and so on. I mean, there is a lot of confusion. Ladies and Gentlemen, don't say later that Buthelezi is now saying that I told you so. But really, all the difficulties that have been reported by some of you in the media that I'm being difficult, I'm being obdurate, I'm being stubborn, I'm being obstructive arose because I said purely on the basis of logistics, I could not see that in fact the 27th was an appropriate date because quite frankly, having grown among our people, the black people here, and knowing actually that the voter education hadn't gone far enough itself, I was very skeptical that one could have an election that has any chances of being declared free and fair. But nevertheless, in spite of the fact that we had only about seven days to campaign, in the interest of the country, once the king's matter and the issue of the KwaZulu kingdom was sorted then I thought that it would then confirm that we're all the names that we've been called, if we said that in spite of the fact that that has been sorted out, even a special session of parliament has been called, but nevertheless we still would not want to participate. [end recording] [Alfonso] That's the news conference as it happened here a few moments ago here in the KwaZulu Legislative Assembly just about half a kilometer from here, and maybe it's a bit strong to say that the IFP is threatening to pull out of the election if one looks at it in a summary sort of way, but it appears more that this is a warning from the IFP leader that if the situation here on the ground in KwaZulu/Natal where ballot boxes and ballot booths and polling stations are sadly lacking in many rural areas, if that's not sorted out, then maybe some meeting will have to be called with other political leaders to address how free and fair this election was. That's what I as a reporter read into it.
