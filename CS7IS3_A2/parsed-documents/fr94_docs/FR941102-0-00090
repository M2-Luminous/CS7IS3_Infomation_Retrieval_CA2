FR941102-0-00090 FR941102-0-00026 The Commission received 53 comment letters concerning the proposals. Of those commenters, 31 supported the disclosure approach and 17 opposed it. 3 Many of the commenters supporting the approach offered suggestions to improve the effectiveness of disclosure. 3 The Commission's staff has prepared a summary of the comments, a copy of which has been placed in the official file. The Division of Market Regulation (``Division'') also solicited comment on payment for order flow in its study of the equity markets. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 30920 (July 14, 1992), 57 FR 32587 (July 22, 1992) (``Market 2000 Concept Release''). See also Division of Market Regulation, Securities and Exchange Commission, Market 2000: An Examination of Current Equity Market Developments (Jan. 1994) (`` Market 2000 ''). Many of the same parties commenting on this proposal commented on Market 2000 . Id., Appendix IV at 41&hyph;48. The Commission is adopting the proposed disclosure approach as discussed below. The Commission believes this approach will further the investor protection goals of the Act, and is consistent with the general philosophy underlying disclosure that ``sunlight is the best disinfectant.'' 4 The Commission, in response to commenters' suggestions, has modified the proposed Rule and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10, as described below. 4 L. Brandeis, Other People's Money and How the Bankers Use It, 92 (Frederick A. Stokes Co. ed. 1932). The Commission is modifying Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 and amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 as proposed, to include Nasdaq Small-Cap and Over-The-Counter (``OTC'') Bulletin Board securities. The Commission also is modifying the proposed amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 to limit the disclosure of payment for order flow on customer confirmations to a statement that the broker or dealer receives payment for order flow. In addition, the Commission is revising proposed Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 regarding customer account statements by requiring disclosure of the broker-dealer's policies for determining where to route customer orders that are the subject of payment for order flow absent specific instructions from customers, including a description of the extent to which orders can be executed at prices superior to the national best bid or best offer (``NBBO''). In a parallel action, the Commission is proposing for comment amendments to Rule 10b&hyph;10 and Rule 11Ac1&hyph;3 that would extend those Rules to the options market. 5 In addition, the Commission is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose in writing, on confirmations, upon opening new accounts and on annual disclosure statements, ranges of payment for order flow received on a per share basis; and include, in new account documentation and on annual disclosure statements, an estimate of the aggregate amount of payment for order flow received on an annual basis. 6 The Commission also is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose whether they execute orders as principal (``internalize'') or route orders to an affiliated broker-dealer or exchange specialist for execution and, a requirement that broker-dealers quantify and disclose information about internalized/affiliate practices. 7 The Commission further is proposing for comment a requirement that broker-dealers disclose their order routing practices regardless of whether the broker-dealer received payment for order flow or engaged in internalized/affiliate practices. The Companion Release also solicits comment on expanding the definition of payment for order flow. 8 5 See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34903 (October 27, 1994) (``Companion Release''`). 6 Id. 7 Id. 8 Id.
