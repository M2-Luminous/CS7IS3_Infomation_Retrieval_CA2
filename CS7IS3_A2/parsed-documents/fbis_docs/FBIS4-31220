Armed provocations by Croats are most frequently reported in the valley of the river Sava in north-eastern Bosnia, said the sources. The Serb side does not react to provocations but when the other side launches offensive actions it uses its legitimate right to self-defence, they said. Bosnian Serb forces effictively repulsed several Moslem artillery and infantry attacks in the region of Teslic in the north-eastern part of Bosnia and one on Mount Ozren. They also prevented infiltration of a Moslem terrorist group. Serb parts of Sarajevo, especially Ilijas, again came under fire from Moslem positions in Sarajevo, said the sources. The ceasefire agreement for the Sarajevo region is also being violated by continuous sniper and small arms fire from the Moslem part of Sarajevo on the Serb suburb of Nedzarici and from the central party of the city on Ozren Street, said the Serb army sources. Moslem snipers in Sarajevo on Friday severely wounded a Russian and a French member of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) but UNPROFOR has so far not reacted to the incident.
