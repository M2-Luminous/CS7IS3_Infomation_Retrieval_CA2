ACTION: Notice of Privately Offered Allowances for the 1994 EPA SO 2 Allowance Auctions; the 1994 Direct Sale; and the Opening of the Allowance Tracking System Docket. SUMMARY: Pursuant to title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO 2 control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO 2 , which are distributed in limited quantities for existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually all utility units to cover their SO 2 emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden. EPA is directed under section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances (2.8%) withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate and support such a market in allowances and to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for which no allowances are allocated. In the Fall of 1992, EPA delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions and sales to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The auctions and sales will be conducted under the regulations governing the auctions and sales which were promulgated on December 17, 1991 (40 CFR part 73, subpart E). Today, the Acid Rain Division is giving notice of (1) the total amount of allowances that will be auctioned in the second annual SO 2 allowance auctions, which are scheduled for March 28, 1994; (2) the start date of the 1994 Direct Sale; and (3) the opening of a docket to communicate information held in EPA's Allowance Tracking System. Notice of the date of the second annual SO 2 allowance auctions was previously given in the February 2, 1994 Federal Register , cite 59 FR 4919. Auctions. Anyone can participate in the EPA auctions, and bidders are not restricted as to the quantity or price of their bid. Allowances sold at the auctions will be sold to the highest bidder until no allowances remain. The 1994 auctions will consist of one ``spot'' auction and two ``advance'' auctions. Allowances sold in the spot auction are usable for compliance beginning in 1995. Allowances sold in the 6-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2000; allowances sold in the 7-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2001. The 6-year advance auction will sell the unsold allowances from the 1993 Direct Sale. The Act directs EPA to sell in the 1994 auctions any spot or advance allowances that are offered by any Phase I or Phase II utility. However, offered will be sold after the allowances that were withheld from the utilities, so offered allowances will consequently be sold at a lower price than the withheld allowances. Owners of offered allowances may set a minimum price for their allowances. The number of withheld allowances and offered allowances that are being sold in the 1994 auctions are listed in the table below. Bid Forms for the 1994 auctions must be received by the CBOT by the close of business on March 22, 1994.
