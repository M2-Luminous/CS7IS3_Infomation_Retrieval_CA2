Chernomyrdin's expected speech in the Federation Council did not take place 3 February. The prime minister's refusal to come and give information about government policy was regarded by the senators not only as a lack of respect for the upper house of parliament but also as a political gesture. It was maybe the first time the deputies had used such harsh terms in demanding that V. Shumeyko explain why the meeting was shelved. In response the speaker cited the most diverse arguments. Specifically, that without a discussion of this question at a special government session Chernomyrdin's speech would be of an unofficial nature and would reflect his personal viewpoint. That a session of the Cabinet of Ministers Presidium had begun on the morning of 3 February. In addition, it was learned that the premier is flying to Minsk in the evening while O. Soskovets, his first deputy, is in Georgia. And that Economy Minister A. Shokhin will speak in the Federation Council. Shumeyko reminded all his colleagues that it is his job as speaker to conduct sessions and keep order, not to deliver the premier there. But Shumeyko's arguments merely added fuel to the fire: Even sterner words followed from the microphones -- about the Federation Council's role and place in Russia's political life. For example, a deputy from Udmurtia said that he is not greatly concerned by what is happening in Belarus -- right now there is a crisis situation in his own Udmurtia and in Russia as a whole: "We want to know our government's actions in the next few days." After a heated debate the senators again instructed the speaker to hold talks with the premier and to inform him during the recess of the house's insistent wish to see him on the Federation Council platform on 3 February.
