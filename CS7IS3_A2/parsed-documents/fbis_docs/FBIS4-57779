[Contreras] This weekend? [Zanabria] In the last 94 hours ...[corrects] in the last 72 hours the amount of rainfall in Santiago de Cuba Province has been tremendous. [Contreras] Approximately how many millimeters? [Zanabria] Tercer Frente is the municipality where the most rainfall, over 300 mm, has been recorded in the last few hours. [Contreras] Excuse me, how much did you say? [Zanabria] Over 300 mm of rainfall in less than 24 hours. [Contreras] Over 300 mm of rainfall. This is the rainfall recorded in many provinces during one entire year. [Zanabria] For this municipality it is the average amount of rainfall for one year. [Contreras] As I said, that would be the amount of rainfall expected in one year, and it fell within a 24-hour period. [Zanabria] Exactly, and the same thing happened in Songo-La Maya where rainfall has been intense. In Santiago de Cuba 116 mm of rainfall fell in the last few hours. [Contreras] I imagine that the floodgates of most dams are open. [Zanabria] Yes. There are over 3,000 houses damaged, with over 1,000 of these in Santiago de Cuba Municipality, 80 of which were totally destroyed. In the municipality of Guama, unfortunately, there has been a fatality: Juan Gonzalez Jinarte, who was drunk and drowned while trying to cross a local river with his mules. [Contreras] This was the only fatality? [Zanabria] No, this was the second fatality. The first fatality occurred in Segundo Frente Municipality. [Contreras] Given the magnitude of the rainfall, there have been very few vicitms. [Zanabria] There were also fires this weekend in the Hermanos Diaz refinery and the Retome medical equipment factory. There have been many landslides, and floods in low-lying areas. I am preparing a complete report for Doing Radio listeners, and then I will go out with the mobile unit and visit some of the places affected, for instance, the Rente Electric Plant which is off-line from the national electrical system. This is of great importance. Last night [22 May] there were long power outages in Santiago de Cuba, and in the midst of this rain, so you can imagine the situation here. [Contreras] We await further information. I believe the news that you have given us up to now is outright poignant. There is another fatality in Santiago, and we can imagine that last night must have been very tense, considering everything that is happening. [Zanabria] Last night, I spoke with the pilot of the (Aero-Caribbean) flight that arrived in Santiago de Cuba. I went to pick up Diosdado Maso and accompany Carmen Oria to the airport, as she was returning to Havana. The pilot informed me that he does not know how he managed to land at the Holguin airport, where the plane made a stopover, because the rainfall made it almost impossible to see the runway lights. That is the situation here; and as I said earlier, I am about to visit some of the most hard-hit areas to obtain information for my next report. We will remain in contact the rest of the day. [Contreras] Thank you very much Zanabria, and we await further information.
