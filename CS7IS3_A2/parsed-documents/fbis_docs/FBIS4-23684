"If Frodebu (which is mainly Hutu) names a head of state on 1 July as has recently been announced by Jean-Marie Ngendahayo, Burundian foreign affairs minister, without the approval of all political forces in the country, the coalition of opposition parties will not hesitate to do likewise. If they form a government, we will form ours," the opposition parties said Sunday [12 June]. The announcement was made on Sunday in Bujumbura at the end of a big rally originally called to raise funds for the displaced persons in the war, by a member of parliament, Francois Ngeze (Hutu) of the Union for National Progress (Uprona) whose membership is mainly Tutsi. [Words indistinct] Ngeze headed a self-proclaimed council of public salvation after the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye last October. Ngeze said that the naming of a new president has to be done after 12 prerequisites have been met. These included the drawing of a timetable for the disarmament of civilians. He also called for the suspension of territorial and local administration officials involved in the October 1993 genocide and the distribution of weapons to the population, the recalling of ambassadors "who behave like spokespersons for Frodebu and not for the Burundian nation". The opposition is also calling for the dismantling of the Presidential Guard, which has been created along the Rwandan model and an end to the forceful return of displaced persons to their homes before the minimum security and housing conditions were met. Responding to the opposition pre-conditions, the Frodebu government has insisted that a president nominated from the majority party has to be installed first before anything else is considered.
