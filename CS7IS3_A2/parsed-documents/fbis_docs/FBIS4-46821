Everything here is acquiring the dimensions of a capital. This applies to the motor vehicle plant and to the submarine engineering facilities. As for television broadcasting, Nizhniy Novgorod has more broadcasting companies than most cities. There are several reasons for this unique situation, and it is significant that the broadcasting industry in Nizhniy Novgorod is a paradigm of the one in Moscow. Reason One: How One State TV Broadcasting Company Turned into Two The story of this division began, as most stories do, with a confrontation. The creative team in the oblast studio split into two camps. One group called themselves patriots and refused to "sell out," while the members of the other group were more likely to act on purely materialistic interests. When Mikhail Poltoranin from Moscow decided a year and a half ago to open local branches of the Federal Television Broadcasting Company, this provided a way of resolving the conflict. Today it is clear that it may not have been the best way. Imitating a single-cell amoeba, the labor collective split into two halves: an oblast team and a federal team. Each received its own chunk of air time. They divided the days up evenly, so that no one would be slighted. This created an unusual, overlapping program schedule: The new oblast studio took Monday, Thursday, and Friday, leaving the other four days at the disposal of the new federal company. Many believed that this paradoxical division was possible only because there was always enough "watchable" TV here. The film editing division alone, which made excellent documentaries, was good enough for several oblast studios. Director Olga Noskova of the Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast Studio is certain that the uniqueness of the situation was due to one unusual feature: The television broadcasting center in Nizhniy Novgorod is a leased enterprise and was not dependent on any existing company. "The director of our television center could be called a legend in his own time.... He was the one who displayed impressive persistence and consistency in solving the problem. If he had not done this, we would have had the same situation as in other regions. We would have been the poor relatives of non-government companies. The television broadcasting center is a monopolist, but it does not concern itself with industry politics. It serves everyone--as long as they all pay their bills," Noskova explained. Now the two competing companies have been joined by a third force, a quite independent and strong force. The leased TV broadcasting center dared to treat all of its clients equally, and some of them categorically objected to this. The management of the federal company is convinced that the issue of property has to be settled. "Look how they managed to get the technical equipment away from us!" This is what makes the chairman of the federal "Nizhniy Novgorod Broadcasting Company" furious. Of course, the people in his studio want the issue to be resolved in only one way: They want title to the broadcasting center and are implying that no one else is entitled to use the equipment and the premises. Incidentally, there is more than enough unequivocal animosity in the relations between the two broadcasting companies. Olga Noskova, director of the oblast TV studio, has another opinion: "The problem of the federal company has to be solved by eliminating it. I could talk to them about unification, but only in one sense: Guys, give us your air time and we will find something to fill it with." The resulting situation is fascinating in several respects. The groundlessness of the federal company's insistent refusal to "sell out" was confirmed by subsequent events: They are now hunting for advertisers just as eagerly as the oblast studio and are starting to show the same "disgraceful box-office hits and other bourgeois trash" as the other studio. Their competitors in the oblast studio, however, have already had time to learn the ways of commerce, and advertisers are more likely to do business with them. In general, it is a peculiar situation. A single channel shows the programs of one company for three days a week and the programs of another company the rest of the time. Both want to destroy the competition and are basing their long-range plans on precisely this outcome, which would be beneficial for only one side. Everyone realizes that it is ridiculous to divide up the program schedule in this way. The viewers do not want to have to remember the specific days of the week that belong to each company, and they do not remember: They call the oblast company to complain about the mistakes of the federal company, and vice versa. This is not surprising: The programs of the competing former colleagues are so similar.... And this is also understandable: After all, they all worked together for such a long time to establish the television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod. This overlapping schedule is not particularly agreeable to the administrators or the journalists. The journalists know that something momentous might happen in Nizhniy Novgorod that day, but their company will not have any air time until the next day. The news services of the competing companies are naturally independent of one another--and, it seems, independent of the viewers, who might have to watch virtually identical reports two days in a row, because all of the reporters cover the same beat. In any country with a technical rating system, the question of viewer preference is never left unanswered. We, on the other hand, have only the pathetic results of sociological surveys, and they can only be used to inform a competitor as loudly as possible: "Nobody watches your programs anyway!" Their relative merits will become apparent with the passage of time. Reason Two: It Takes a Pioneer The first non-governmental broadcasting company in Nizhniy Novgorod, the "N-N Network," does not have to wonder if anyone watches its programs. The company does not have a channel of its own yet. It leases air time on Sundays from the federal studio and for two hours in the morning on weekdays from the "Rossiya" Network. The network's colleagues have different opinions of it. They all acknowledge its boldness. It dares to do all kinds of things with no regard whatsoever for politics. Company President Mikhail Lerman had this to say about the absence of political programming on his schedule: "As soon as political programs get popular, we will make political programs." This lack of concern about politics might be the reason that all of the sociological polls indicate that a high percentage of the people in Nizhniy Novgorod are watching the "N-N Network" on Sundays. It would be odd if they were not watching it. There is no commentary at all, and there are many Western movies, mini-series, and entertainment programs, half of which the company produces itself. In general, the "N-N" team has several interesting principles of operation, and they always act on them. At some point the people at the "N-N Network" realized that they had to have something of their own. They have their own editing room and their own equipment. When company President Mikhail Lerman was asked what kind of equipment they had, his answer was quite simple: "Anything that is not essential is not necessary. That is another of our principles of operation. We do not buy ultra-modern equipment, because neither today's businessman nor the present viewing audience is demanding ultra-high quality." The company's policies are distinguished by pragmatism and expediency. These qualities are in short supply today. The "N-N Network" was the first in Nizhniy Novgorod to begin buying licensed products. It has accumulated an impressive library of films, and as soon as the other companies in the city begin showing licensed programs, it will broadcast only the films it acquired legally. The company administrators feel that the "N-N Network" should not have to pay for something that the others get virtually for free. This situation requires an explanation. Local TV studios in virtually every part of Russia are broadcasting nothing but stolen films. No one is paying royalties to anyone. There are two reasons for this. Most of the firms in our country that are claiming the rights to bourgeois films do not really own the rights. Since there are no legitimate representatives, it appears that there is no one to pay. Furthermore, our companies still cannot afford to pay the fees that are accepted in the rest of the world. They are too poor. It would be difficult, however, to call the "N-N Network" poor. Everything there looks wonderful to an outsider. This company acquired the regional rights to CNN and MTV telecasts by paying for them. They feel it is always better to pay their way, and this is another of the company's principles of operation. It has accomplished a great deal on the local TV scene since 1985: It was the first to interrupt programs to show commercials, the first to hold advertising fairs, the first to organize "Night Flight"--special programming for night owls, and the first to film commercials for local advertisers. The "N-N Network" staffers were the only ones smart enough to get on-the-job training at CNN, which even showed the story of an "N-N Network" trainee on its international news channel. Reason Three: Where the "Volga" Flows The "Volga" channel is not even a year old. It had the simplest beginnings imaginable. A few people decided to start a book-publishing business a few years ago. It was a success. Then they started publishing their own newspapers. They ended up with "Kuryer," a whole publishing house. A little later they got a broadcasting license and "Rendezvous Radio" came into being. With this experience in taking on so many projects successfully, some of them decided to go into television. They used the same method as before: They got a broadcasting license, their own transmitter, and their own equipment--not the best, but good enough for a start. Six private individuals and one firm acted as the co-founders. It was a success. The story of this company's quick rise is surprisingly simple and essentially ordinary. The principle of "doing something different from everything else on TV in Nizhniy Novgorod" worked perfectly. That is why the image of the "Volga" channel is more youthful and audacious than mature and wise. Young people were hired to make all of the programs--kids from 16 to 22. They did some incredible things on the air in the beginning, but we have a tolerant viewing audience. Everyone knew that these young people had to learn their job and that they could only learn by trial and error. It goes without saying that each day they tried more and erred less. The boys and girls who were literally taken off the street immediately started making their own programs about the most diverse and extremely serious topics. Now anyone who has been working there for more than half a year is already an "old-timer." During the first six months the company moved away from the usual kind of programming and began to produce its own shows. Two children's series could be regarded as a genuine accomplishment. Once some young staffers filmed a whole children's play with just one home video camera. There were many things about the program that could have offended the eye of a professional, but this was a show for children, and it was a very good one. Another of "Volga's" indisputable achievements is its own sports programming. I do not know of any oblast studios that show the soccer matches of local teams.... The "Volga" staffers have even made their own tourist magazine show, with the same young staffers making films in Gorkiy Oblast. There is also some political commentary, but the company administrators learned long ago that political programs do not bring in enough advertising revenue. Advertisers are more eager to show their commercials during horror movies and erotic films.... The number of members of the "Volga" creative team can be counted on one's fingers. Each one is a jack-of-all-trades. Each can film a show, edit it, and broadcast it. Maybe everything has gone so well because these young "TV experts" (what else can we call them?) have never experienced abject failure. They fearlessly take on anything new. They have nothing to fear but their own commercial failure. Remember the old adage about the destructive power of the predictable? The youngest people in the television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod know better than their senior colleagues how this principle works. They have all of the necessary knowledge and ability. These children have a great future ahead of them. These boys and girls have already learned to do their job and to take responsibility for what they do. This is valued in any social structure and in any profession. ...Everyone knows that the Volga flows into the Caspian Sea. No one knows where this "Volga" will be in a few years. Reason Four: The Zverev Brand of TV There are many women on television. There are few successful women on television. Nina Zvereva, the Rossiya Network's personal correspondent in the Nizhniy Novgorod region, is unique in this respect and in many others. Her reports from Nizhniy Novgorod are always distinguishable from the work of other journalists. Nina Zvereva has perfected her own special brand of TV coverage. They like her in Nizhniy Novgorod. She is well-known in Moscow. Nina Zvereva manages to combine the best features of provincialism with the sophistication of the capital. Zvereva herself feels that she was just lucky in guessing what the viewer in Nizhniy Novgorod wanted from her. "People do not care what I am talking about. All they want is for me to assure them that everything is fine, that life goes on. I even feel something like a minister...," Nina explained. Her news bureau was the Rossiya Network's first independent agency. She managed to put together a set of good professional equipment. When company Chairman Oleg Poptsov, who had to approve her requisitions, asked Broadcasting Director Anatoliy Lysenko with amazement why all of the equipment was going to Nizhniy Novgorod, Anatoliy Grigoryevich had a simple response: "Because Nina Zvereva lives in Nizhniy Novgorod...." At the start of her TV career, Zvereva had to wear two hats: In Moscow she was a provincial, and in Nizhniy Novgorod she was a representative of the capital's values. "Then I realized that my image, my appeal, my individuality stemmed from my provincial nature. I knew that a Muscovite could not succeed here anyway. After all, they do not know anything." Nina, now confident of her own strengths, recalled her early days in the business. At one time she worked for the children's programming department of the Central Television Network, taking her best Nizhniy Novgorod programs to Moscow, but she found that they were not appreciated in the capital. There have been many changes since then. Now Zvereva is a chief executive. She always knows what to send to Moscow and what to show on her only program on oblast TV--"Video Library." Relying on her own judgments, Nina Zvereva is almost never mistaken--about people or about situations. First-rate cameraman Mikhail Sladkov works with her. She has been able to find the most committed people for her news bureau, perhaps because she is also wholly committed to her job. She has trouble taking it easy on the weekend and has to conceal her eagerness to get back to work from her husband. It was the same sense of commitment that made Zvereva open her school of television arts. At first Nina thought this was a good way of starting a business of her own and making money. As soon as the students arrived, however, she was hesitant: It would have been like taking money from her own children. The school already has several graduates. Each puts an additional workload on Zvereva's news bureau, because all of her students later come back to the bureau for advice on their own reports. At this time Zvereva and Sladkov are teaching beginners in television: Rayon TV studios are being opened in Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast and they need personnel. What Nina Zvereva would like to do is to teach correspondents for the Rossiya Television Network in Nizhniy Novgorod. After all, it would be impossible to teach people in Moscow to work in the provinces. She wants the school to have its own good professional equipment and a nice building in the middle of the city. I am quite certain that she will have all of this someday. Nina Zvereva knows how to get what she needs. Reason Five: How the Governor Governs There is another possible explanation for the uniqueness of the television industry in Nizhniy Novgorod: Officials here are distinguished by a particularly democratic style of administration and do not exasperate broadcasters with stupid regulations or try to keep journalists on a leash. Boris Nemtsov, the Nizhniy Novgorod governor who is well-known all over Russia, has his own ideas about the development of television broadcasting in the region and, consequently, his own preferences. After all, the governor is also a member of the viewing audience. "No one has to give me any reports on TV broadcasting--no oral or written reports. I have always supported independent television. Furthermore, I have no wish to issue orders to the TV stations. "My colleagues frequently reproach me for giving interviews to journalists who always criticize me, but there are no journalists with exclusive status in my office. A reporter from any station can come to me and ask me any questions at all, even the most unpleasant ones." "How do you envision TV broadcasting in Nizhniy Novgorod in the future?" "In general, our case is unprecedented in provincial Russia. They say that no other place has so many different broadcasting companies. Now they are starting to compete with one another. Obviously, someone is bound to defeat someone else. My job is to prevent monopolization without interfering. If someone on the highest level decides to herd everyone back into a common stable again and to appoint a general administrator, I will object, but if one company defeats another in competition, I will tell the loser that he must not have been doing his job well.... "It seems to me that the companies with the greatest prospects are not the ones in Nizhniy Novgorod, but the ones in the cities and rural communities of the oblast that we are just opening now. I am certain that the emergence of these broadcasting companies is a step toward the civic society. It means that people are acknowledging their common features to some extent and are realizing that they have common problems. I hope we will have our own broadcasting companies in all of the rayons before I have to leave office." In Lieu of a Sixth Reason: You Have To Know What Life Is Like in Nizhniy Novgorod The situation in Nizhniy Novgorod is unique in other respects as well. For some reason, people of different specialties regard this Russian city as the test site for their social and economic experiments. This was the site of the first organized privatization program and the first auction in Russia for the sale of land to the peasants. Imagine that!... Now trainees in the TV industry can come here for experience, and I will not be surprised if some of them decide to stay at one of these four extremely promising TV broadcasting companies.
