Otherwise the spring elections may result in the revival of camouflaged Soviets, says Gaydar's statement. In the opinion of Gaydar, it is necessary to elaborate a joint strategy for the election campaign in the next two or three weeks. It would be good to agree on the following principle: one candidate of all democratic and reform forces to one mandate, he said. Gaydar also suggested an agreement on quotas for each regional reform organization as pre-election tactics. The quotas can be based on the electors' support to democratic electoral coalitions in regions. The principle can be made all-Russian and then specified at joint consultations. Gaydar is ready to insist on quotas in favor of new progressive trade unions, business and workers' organizations and independent professional candidates.
