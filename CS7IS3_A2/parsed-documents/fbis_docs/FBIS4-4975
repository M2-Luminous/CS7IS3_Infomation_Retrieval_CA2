Its deputy premier, Prince Norodom Sirivut, said his country respects the able and high leadership of Prime Minister Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir Mohamed in dealing with neighbors. He said this at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur at the end of his four-day official visit to Malaysia. In this respect, he said Cambodia would not jeopardize its relations with Thailand and Vietnam in efforts to resolve frontier problems with the two neighbors. He said Cambodia would refer the problems to the ASEAN foreign ministers meeting in Bangkok in July. Cambodia has been invited to the meeting as a guest. But he pointed out that Thailand should first stop harboring the remnants of the Pol Pot guerrillas along the common border. He also said Malaysian experience in the rubber and oil and palm oil industries had always impressed Cambodia and his country was eager to learn from Malaysia its experience in rural development.
