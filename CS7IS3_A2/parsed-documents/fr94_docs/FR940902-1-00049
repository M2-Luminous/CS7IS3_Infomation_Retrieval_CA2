ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: This proposed rule establishes regulations for seasons, harvest limits, methods, and means related to taking of wildlife for subsistence uses during the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. This rulemaking is necessary because subpart D regulations require annual public review. When final, this rule making will replace hunting and trapping regulations in ``Subsistence Management Regulations for Public Lands in Alaska, Subpart D_1994&hyph;1995 Subsistence Taking of Fish and Wildlife Regulations,'' which expire on June 30, 1995. DATES: Written public comments and proposals to change this proposed rule will be accepted through November 11, 1994. Federal Subsistence Regional Advisory Councils (Regional Councils) will hold public meetings on this proposed rulemaking from October 3&hyph;November 4, 1994, at the following locations in Alaska: Anchorage, Barrow, Bethel, Fairbanks, Galena, Kodiak, Kotzebue, Naknek, Nome, and Sitka. Written proposals to change subpart D regulations will be compiled and distributed for additional public review during the second week of November 1994. A second 30-day public comment period will follow distribution of the compiled proposal packet. Written public comments on distributed proposals will be accepted during the second public comment period. Comments on proposals to change subpart D regulations may be presented to the Regional Councils at their meetings. The Federal Subsistence Board (Board) will deliberate and take final action on proposals received that request changes to this proposed rule at a public meeting to be held in Anchorage during April 1995. ADDRESSES: Written comments and proposals for changes to these proposed regulations may be sent to the Chair, Federal Subsistence Board, c/o U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1011 E.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Proposed Changes From 1994&hyph;1995 Seasons and Bag Limit Regulations Subpart D regulations are subject to an annual cycle and require development of an entire new rule each year. Consequently, this proposed rule reflects regulation changes for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year that are approved by the Board. Regulations contained in this proposed rule will take effect on July 1, 1995, unless elements are changed by subsequent Board action following the public review process outlined herein. The text of the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D final rule served as the foundation for the 1995&hyph;1996 subpart D proposed rule. Minor editorial changes to the 1994&hyph;1995 final rule have been made to clarify and enhance Federal subsistence management program regulations for the 1995&hyph;1996 regulatory year. The other proposed regulatory changes include: •Reopening the season for mountain goats in the Frosty Bay area now that logging is completed. •Shortening the lynx trapping season in a number of Units to protect the population in a low-cycle period. •Revising the moose season in Unit 18 based on a Request for Reconsideration received following the publication of the 1994&hyph;1995 subpart D regulations. •Closing the season for sheep in Units 23 and 26(A) west of Howard Pass and the Redstone and Cutler Rivers to protect a low sheep population experiencing poor lamb recruitment. Subpart D regulations were originally established from a framework of State of Alaska fish and game regulations. Subsistence Taking of Fish and Shellfish Regulations This proposed rule contains no subsistence fishing or shellfish taking provisions.
