The problem of the return of refugees, in his view, must wait for the materialization of a peace agreement. Akashi stressed that the challenges facing UNPROFOR in Croatia were greater than those in Cambodia where he had worked with a UN peace mission. For, he said, the protection force in Croatia us working both on achieving and keeping peace. UNPROFOR can do more than it has done so far, Akashi said and added that Chapter Six of the UN Charter, under which his mandate in Croatia has taken place, provides sufficient potential, which have not been harnessed yet. In this context, Akashi expects firm cooperation with the Croatian authorities and hopes that some past problems in their relations will be ironed out. Today, as he announced, Akashi will talk to Ambassador Gerd Ahrens, a mediator between the Croatian authorities and UN Protected Areas. The implementation in practice of the economic and communications reintegration of these areas in Croatia as a whole will be the main topic of their talks.
