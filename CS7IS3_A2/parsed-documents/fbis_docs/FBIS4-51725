FBIS4-51725 "dreas085_c_94003" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 2 May 1994 North Korea Nepalese Paper: Nuclear Issue `U.S. Scenario' Nepalese Paper: Nuclear Issue `U.S. Scenario' SK0305064194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean ` 0810 GMT 2 May 94 SK0305064194 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean ` 0810 GMT 2 May 94 Korean BFN [Unattributed talk: "Unwarranted Pressure Commotion by Brazen-Faced Ones"] [Text] In its commentary entitled "The Korean Nuclear Issue Which Is a U.S. Scenario," the Nepalese newspaper (CHOL POL) dated 4 April wrote as follows: The situation on the Korean peninsula has become more tense and led to the brink of war due to the nuclear issue. This is totally because of the unfriendly [piuhojok] and unfair [pulgongjonghan] attitude of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] under the patronage of the United States. In fact, this is nothing but a scenario. The DPRK allowed IAEA inspections for the continuity of safeguards and met all conditions for the inspections as agreed upon with the agency. However, the IAEA Secretariat overlooked this fact and concocted a new scenario according to the instruction of the United States. Now, why is it that the IAEA follows the United States? It is because this organization was built by the United States and is under its patronage. Failing to control the nuclear activities and nuclear weapons of the United States, the largest nuclear possessor state in the world, the IAEA has instead protected them. The United States insists on the suspicion that North Korea is developing nuclear weapons. This is aimed at unconditionally applying pressure on this country, looking down on and regarding it as a small country. The United States is employing military pressure and threat. As the Nepalese paper's commentary correctly indicates, in reality, the United States and the IAEA have been tenaciously waging an unwarranted pressure commotion against us by continuously coming up with the issue of implementing the safeguards agreement. This can be seen in the so-called statement issued recently by the president of the UN Security Council which called for the overall implementation of the safeguards agreement. Talk on implementation of the safeguards agreement is nothing but a far-fetched assertion lacking justification, because our country is, above all, in a unique situation of having temporarily suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. Our country's unique position was caused by the unwarranted acts of the United States and the IAEA. This is a fact officially recognized by the world. As is known, on 12 March of last year, we issued a statement to withdraw from the NPT in order to defend the socialist fatherland and the supreme interest of the nation. This was our Republic's extremely just, self-defending step against the U.S. nuclear threat and the IAEA's partiality. However, later, as the United States responded to the proposal for DPRK-U.S. talks, we unilaterally suspended the effectuation of the withdrawal from the NPT temporarily under the condition that DPRK-U.S. negotiations for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue continue on an equal and fair basis. This, however, does not mean a return to the treaty. Therefore, we are not obligated to implementing the safeguards agreement pursuant to the legal requirement for the treaty as treaty signatory countries are. This is particularly so considering the fact that, from a legal standpoint, the effect of the safeguards accord is in a virtual state of suspension. Proceeding from our country's unique position, we have heretofore only received inspections to assure the mere continuity of safeguards, and not the regular and irregular inspections [chonggyu and pijonggyu sachal] pursuant to the safeguards accord which were frozen. As to our unique position, the United States and the IAEA Secretariat, as well, could not but recognize it. Nevertheless, the United States and the IAEA have been unreasonablly calling for the overall implementation of the safeguards agreement. This vividly shows that they are attempting to use the safeguards accord as leverage for the realization of their insidious political purposes of refusing our unique position and crushing our Republic. We can never completely implement the safeguards accord unless the United States and the IAEA assure in their actions that they will not crush our Republic. As the world is well aware, our signature of the safeguards accord with the IAEA was based on the premise that the depository states should neither deploy their nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula nor pose any nuclear threat against us. Nevertheless, such a premise of ours has not been addressed at all. Rather, the United States, which is one of the depository states, is further posing a nuclear threat against us by openly making public that it will resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a test nuclear war against us, in November and by concentrating new type nuclear weapons, including Patriot missiles--which are mass destruction weapons--and other aggression armed forces on and around the Korean peninsula. Our allowance of the inspection for the sheer assurance of continuity of safeguards corresponding to our unique position even under such a touch-and-go, dangerous situation is precisely our justified step. Inspections to assure the continuity of safeguards is enough to clearly prove that our nuclear materials have not been utilized for nonpeaceful purposes. We will never allow inspection activities which are equivalent to regular and irregular inspections unless the United States suspends its policy of obliterating the DPRK and its nuclear threat commotions and unless the IAEA Secretariat eliminates its partiality. If the United States and the IAEA Secretariat respect our unique position, the nuclear issue will be smoothly resolved. We do not mean we will maintain our unique position forever. How long it can continue depends on the acts of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat. The day when our unique position comes to an end will be the day when DPRK-U.S. talks are held and the immediate steps of simultaneous action for a complete solution to the nuclear issue under the principle of a package deal solution are put into practice. In this case, conditions for the complete implementation of the safeguards accord can be provided. In the final part of its commentary, the Nepalese newspaper wrote: Western countries are now exerting all possible diplomatic efforts to isolate the DPRK, a small country. However, no matter how hard the West world may clamor, DPRK socialism will be ever victorious as no force in the world can crush [apsal] Korea. Western countries should realize this. Pressure is not a way to solve the problem. Trying to solve the nuclear issue through peaceful means such as dialogue and negotiations is precisely our consistent position. Developments in the situation [satae palchon] depend entirely on the attitude of the United States and the IAEA Secretariat.
