An ITAR-TASS correspondent was told over the phone today by sources in well- informed government circles in the Republic that the special commission has established that the plane was on a scheduled flight for the joint peace-keeping forces and was carrying humanitarian aid. The same source said the commission established that, contrary to the reports coming in, the plane was not seized and there were no armed people from the Tajik opposition at the airport. The same source said that, because of Khorog's location and the situation in the region, all planes coming into the airport are regarded from the standpoint of security. As for the AN-26 plane which was apparently seized, it left Khorog at 1627 and no problems were registered. Two other planes in addition to the AN-26 landed at Khorog airport from Dushanbe on that day. Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov told an ITAR-TASS correspondent in a telephone interview that an official statement would be made tomorrow about the results of the investigation into this episode.
