But he did not deny that an indication to that effect might have been given to Mr Martin McGuinness of Sinn Fein at an unauthorised meeting. The government has acknowledged that two unauthorised meetings did take place. Sir Patrick's comments came before a BBC TV programme last night which claimed a government representative had told Mr McGuinness at a meeting three days after last year's Warrington bombing that Britain's long-term intention was to pull out. Speaking in Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick said: "Nobody has ever been authorised to say on behalf of the British government that the British government intends to withdraw from Northern Ireland." A previously released Sinn Fein account of the meeting -- said to have taken place on March 23 last year -- made no reference to a signal from the British representative that Britain might withdraw. Sinn Fein's account does refer to remarks by the representative to the effect that "the final solution is union." The representative said that Sir Patrick wanted Sinn Fein to play a part in achieving a settlement for the province "not because he likes Sinn Fein but because it cannot work without them." "Any settlement not involving all of the people North and South won't work," Sinn Fein's note added.
