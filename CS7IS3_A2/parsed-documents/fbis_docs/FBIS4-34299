The Fourth Constitutional Chamber's decision, which was disclosed today, confirmed that Matos Araluce has been a Costa Rican citizen since 24 March, according to a National Immigration Council agreement. The extradition request, the higher court emphasized, was made after Costa Rican citizenship was granted to Matos Araluce, who is currently entitled to the protection of Costa Rican laws. The higher court indicated in its decision that the Constitution stipulates that no Costa Rican citizen, either by birth or naturalization, can be deported or extradited from the country. The decision also required the state to compensate Matos Araluce for damages. In the extradition request, submitted by the U.S. Embassy in San Jose, Matos Araluce is accused of repeated fraud in Florida.
