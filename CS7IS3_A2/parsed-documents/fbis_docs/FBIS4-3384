He will attend meetings of the Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) - China's "second stove" - but will avoid any contact with Patten and other senior Hong Kong government officials. There was "absolutely no way" that Lu would meet the Governor next month "no matter how many times he has been invited by Patten", a senior Chinese official said yesterday. Mike Hanson, the Government's spokesman, said Patten had recently written to Lu to again invite him to Hong Kong but had not received a reply. "We want to go on talking on a whole range of issues. We are happy to do so. "Lu is directly involved in all these issues and dialogue must be useful for the long term well-being of Hong Kong," Hanson said. "The Governor has made it clear many, many times that he would be delighted to welcome Lu Ping to Hong Kong." Lu was last in Hong Kong to bid farewell to the previous governor, Lord Wilson. His decision to stay away is seen as a response to the controversial political reform plans Patten published in October, 1992. The Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the new airport stipulates that Lu and Patten should "hold regular meetings" to discuss Hong Kong affairs. Lu will attend the PWC's government and administration and economic sub-committee meetings from May 2-5. A Chinese official based in Hong Kong said there were political considerations behind the decision to hold PWC meetings in the territory. "It shows that the Chinese government is determined to facilitate the work of the PWC and to make it public that the so- called second stove, or shadow government, is working effectively," he said. Lu will be accompanied by his two deputies, Wang Fengchao and Chen Ziying. Lu is expected to remain in Hong Kong for another few days, a Chinese official said, to "gather first-hand information about Hong Kong's sentiments" towards the PWC's work.
