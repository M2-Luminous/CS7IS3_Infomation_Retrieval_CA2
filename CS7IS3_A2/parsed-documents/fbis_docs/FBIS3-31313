I do not wish to comment on the passages in which ideas from the recent speech made by President Snegur are repeated, because the viewpoints of the Bucharest authorities about that speech have already been presented. As regards the need to consult all Romanians in case the issue of reunification of the two Romanian states becomes topical, to which Mr. Sangheli is referring, we believe that our position has not been correctly understood. If, at one point, this issue might come up, I believe that apart from the act of consulting the Romanians from the Republic of Moldova, it is absolutely necessary to consult the Romanians in Romania, that is, to find out the opinion of all Romanians. We do not see anything offensive in these affirmations, but only an act of expressing certain obvious democratic and political facts, said Mr. Mircea Geoana to our radio station.
