Hosokawa argued for the 7 percent rate at a meeting with Japanese reporters at his official residence. Hosokawa said the 7 percent rate for the indirect tax is necessary to finance tax cuts of 6 trillion yen the government was planning to implement as part of a new comprehensive pump-priming package. He said the revenue-boosting measure is indispensable to enable his administration to compile the fiscal 1994 state budget. "I want coalition party leaders to come up with the right answer as quickly as possible so the government can compile the state budget according to its originally scheduled timing," he said. The premier's statement came a few hours after the leaders of the coalition announced they had renounced his plan to introduce the new 7 percent tax and implement a tax cut of 6 trillion yen. The coalition leaders decided to give up the tax program to avert a political crisis which was threatening to scuttle the seven-party coalition government. The Social Democratic Party, the biggest in the alliance, threatened to quit the coalition unless it abandoned the plan which the party said would amount to a de facto doubling of the current 3 percent consumption tax. Earlier on Friday, Hosokawa apologized for failing to ensure "sufficient contact among the government and ruling coalition parties" before announcing a package of tax cuts and increases, coalition officials said. Hosokawa offered the apology at a meeting of cabinet ministers following the day's regular cabinet session, the officials said. In a meeting with Hiroyuki Sonoda, a senior official of the alliance between the Japan New Party (JNP) and Sakigake (Harbinger), Hosokawa expressed the hope that the coalition parties will discuss the tax reform plan, the officials said. Hosokawa heads the JNP, while Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura leads Sakigake. Both parties are in the ruling coalition.
