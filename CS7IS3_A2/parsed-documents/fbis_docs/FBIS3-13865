He said that reaching a settlement of the Middle East crisis does not mean giving Israel economic advantages. In a study on this issue, the Arab League said that reaching a just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East implies ordinary commercial relations with Israel but does not necessarily mean linking the Arab states with Israel by a free trade zone. Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid said that the ability of the Arab states to deal with the Middle East market basically depends on ensuring their unity and preserving their identity. He described Israel as a small area in the world with limited resources amid a large Arab world with big resources. He noted that the establishment of a Middle East market should not scare the Arab states because it is basically contingent on Arab approval. Reaching a settlement of the Middle East crisis does not mean granting Israel economic advantages. 'Abd-al-Majid stressed the need for the Arab states to coordinate their stands on this market and to prepare a unified strategy that adopts the [word indistinct] Arab interests. He noted that the Middle East Market may include other countries in the region, such as Cyprus, Turkey, and Iran. A study of the Middle East market prepared by the economic department in the Arab League emphasized the need to look for new methods to back the Arab economy by developing an agreement on facilitating and developing trade exchanges and establishing an Arab free trade zone. The study attributes the weakness of the Arab economy to the weakness of its production bases, the low technological level, and the competition among Arab economies in producing similar products, in addition to the low level of Arab investments in Arab countries. The Arab League sent this study to Arab finance and economy ministers late last month in preparation for presenting it to the next session of the Arab League's foreign ministers' council in late March. The study defined the factors of [Israel's] economic strength due to its high level of technological development in the field of manufacturing industries and in the agricultural sector, the private sector's responsibility for running the Israeli economy, adopting export-oriented policy, the increase in the accumulation of capital, and the high production level of the Israeli worker. The study sheds light on the weak points of the Israeli economy, especially its dependence on external assistance, lack of raw materials, and the reduction of the future development growth. [Words indistinct] UN Secretary General Dr. Butrus-Ghali the developments of conditions in the occupied territory following the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, the situation in Bosnia and the Gulf, and the UN stand, and Israel's refusal to be committed to any international resolution on occupied territory during their attendance of the international law symposium to be held in Qatar 21-23 March. A responsible Arab League source said that Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid will discuss with Butrus-Ghali the developments in the Arab-Israeli peace talks and the Israeli obstacles, beginning with Israel's noncompliance with the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles and ending with the Hebron massacre. The source added that the repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the displacement of thousands of Lebanese families will also be discussed. The source said that [words indistinct] issues discussed on the Arab League council on 26 March.
