Subpart E_Interpretations §228.100 Applicability of the Community Reinvestment Act to certain special purpose banks. In response to its July 1978 proposed regulation, 12 CFR Part 228, to implement the CRA, the Board received several inquiries from institutions that, although they are chartered as banks, do not perform commercial or retail banking services. These institutions serve solely as correspondent banks, or as trust companies, or as clearing agents, and they do not extend credit to the public for their own account. The Board concludes that the CRA is not intended to cover these institutions. It is the purpose of the CRA to require the Board to encourage banks to meet the credit needs of their local communities. To this end, the Board must assess banks' records of performance and take those records into account in acting on certain applications affecting the banks. The Board believes that these provisions were intended to cover all banks that are in the business of extending credit to the public, including both wholesale and retail banks. The lending activities of these banks affect the economic health of the communities in which they are chartered. However, the Board believes it would be pointless to encourage or to assess the credit-granting record of institutions that are not organized to grant credit to the public in the ordinary course of business, other than as an incident to their specialized operations. Accordingly, the term State member bank as used in this part does not include banks that engage solely in correspondent banking business, trust company business, or acting as a clearing agent.
