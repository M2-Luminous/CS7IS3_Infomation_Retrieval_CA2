Then he delivered a short speech that focused on the chief objectives of the new Slovak Government: [Begin Moravcik recording] Everyone who was born in Slovakia, everyone who lives here and considers Slovakia his or her homeland, is, for us, a loyal citizen of this state. The government will protect his or her freedom and democratic rights, including the right to criticize the government. I would like to emphasize, in this respect, that it is against our national interests if people are divided because of their nationality, ethnic group, or any other allegiance. We consider it necessary to create space for the initiative of individual citizens, particularly in the economy. The advancement of business is a prerequisite and a guarantee for prosperity of democratic society. To create space for individual initiative means, above all, to continue economic transformations more effectively. The state still owns too many enterprises. Privatization is part of solving economic problems in society. When privatization gets out of hand and all ethical values are negated, the result is wild privatization, a wolfish struggle instead of an organized procedure. This, undoubtedly, deepens the crisis of ethical values in society. If the government is to support business, the state's financial system must be completed. Among other things, this means abandoning putting excessive emphasis on the fiscal angle and creating space for individual initiative. Social security is an area with acute problems. There is a need to emphasize greater individual responsibility for social security of individuals. When this individual responsibility fails, state support takes over. In this system, too, it is necessary to reserve a greater space for the involvement of specialist nonstate institutions, endowments, and charitable institutions. The development of the nonprofit sector reinforces civic solidarity, which should be important to us. More significant progress in creating a new image of Slovakia, along the lines I have mentioned, cannot be implemented without the advancement of science and education. Education is an important value and a guarantee for future prosperity. We are losing speed in this area. We cannot go on delaying finding solutions to the problems in this area. I would also like to speak briefly about the foreign political aspects of the government's policy. I would like to say clearly that Slovakia's foreign political strategy is not changing from the concept endorsed by the Slovak parliament. I will promote those elements that lead to deepening cooperation with and integration into European economic, political, and security systems and groups. In the same way, we shall accentuate our interest in good-neighborly relations with the neighbors of Slovakia. What we need for this policy to succeed is to make our internal policy credible. Not everything I have mentioned can be secured and fulfilled in the time available to this government. This government is to get Slovakia to early parliamentary elections. We are prepared to make full use of the time to create foundations for development in the directions I have outlined.
