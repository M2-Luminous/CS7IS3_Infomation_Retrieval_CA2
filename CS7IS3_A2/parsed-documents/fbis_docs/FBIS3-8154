The head of the Romanian state then made the following speech: [Begin Iliescu recording] Mr. Prime Minister, Ministers: We have carried out a natural constitutional act in our political life upon proposals advanced by the prime minister, by taking into account reasons connected with the actions and efficiency of the government's activity and on the basis of consultations with the political formation that is supporting the government. Thus we have carried out this reshuffle. The new element that appears in the structure of our government is in line with a more general practice in other European countries, namely, a civilian is appointed to the helm of the Ministry of National Defense. This is our debut in this practice, although we have had a civilian minister at the head of the Ministry of Interior in the period following the December 1989 revolution. I believe that the proposals and thus the changes that followed will bring about the necessary moving spirit to improve activity. I would also like to thank the ministers who have carried out their activities and their duties so far for their work. Each of them individually will receive a new assignment. Mr. Spiroiu will represent us at Brussels and will continue implementing the measures required by the Partnership for Peace. Mr. Danescu, in his capacity of a professional, will remain the major assistant at the Ministry of Interior in work aimed at modernizing this ministry. Paul Teodoru will assist the new minister in fulfilling his duties for a while, although the transfer is not so complicated considering that Mr. Novac has worked in the leadership of the ministry and will receive assignments from the government. As far as Mr. Ninosu is concerned, as lomg as he is healthy he will receive new assignments. I would like to ask the new ministers to approach with utmost seriousness the problems that the government and the respective ministries are currently facing and to take over the duties incumbent on them in the shortest time possible. We should establish a united and cohesive team in the government to continue the complex and difficult program for this year's activity. This is an essential year for the reform as a whole and for the economic reform as a central goal of the government. Actions that started last year will be finalized and those actions will have to lead to a certain curbing of inflation, the stabilization of the national currency, and a certain stabilization of economic life in general. There are also a number of actions necessary to improve activity in all the other areas, the affected ministries, and the important sectors, where the processes of consolidating state institutions will make new steps forward. I would like to wish for success in the mission for the new ministers and the government as a whole. [end recording] [Announcer] Senate President Oliviu Gherman, Prime Minister Nicolae Vacaroiu, and Viorel Hrebenciuc, general secretary of the government, attended the ceremony. Prime Minister Vacaroiu introduced the new holders of the four ministerial portfolios.
