Both ministers agreed to hold joint military exercises in Autumn, this year. They did not talk about the date by which Poland will become NATO member but confirmed the opinion that Partnership for Peace is the first step in this direction. Kolodziejczyk and Ruehe also summed up cooperation between the Polish Armed Forces and the Bundeswehr. This cooperation will include contacts of Polish and German Navy on the Baltic Sea, exchange of commanding experience, the training of Polish soldiers in the Bundeswehr training centres, and the exchange of officers and lecturers from military academies. In Kolodziejczyk's opinion, Poland ranks first among former Communist countries in military cooperation with Germany. He said that Germany wants to provide Poland with organizational and technical assistance on Poland's "way to European security structures." The German side supports the idea of joint military training, especially at the lowest level of a company. The minister announced that bilateral contacts will intensify after 31 August when the Russian Army leaves Germany.
