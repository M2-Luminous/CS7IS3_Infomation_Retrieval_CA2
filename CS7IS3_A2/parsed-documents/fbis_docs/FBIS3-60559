Source information is given in parentheses after each item. Burkina Faso At a national blood transfusion seminar which ended yesterday in Ouagadougou, Jean Gabriel Ouango, the permanent secretary of the National AIDS Control Committee, discussed the current national AIDS situation. Ouango stated that between 7 and 8 percent of the population is seropositive, representing about 450,000 persons. He said that in Ouagadougou alone there are about 5,000 persons testing seropositive, and added that very soon an anonymous AIDS screening center would become operational.

He said that disease tracking efforts would be intensified to minimize the number of cases. (Accra Ghana Broadcasting Corporation Radio Network in English 0600 GMT 25 Nov 93) Nigeria The UNICEF representative in Nigeria, Mr. (Kulio Waki), declared that Nigerian salt is sufficiently iodized. He made this remark in Abuja at the opening session of a two-day workshop on the eradication of iodine deficiency disorder. However, Mr. (Waki) said that Oyo, Ondo, Edo, Enugu, Benue, Cross River, and Plateau states were still risking iodine deficiency. He urged health workers and coordinators in the program in those states to carry out the distribution of iodine capsules effectively, so as to eliminate the dangers the disease poses to the population. The Abuja workshop is aimed at eradicating mental and physical deformities, as well as disabilities that affect human beings due to a lack of iodine in their bodies. (Lagos Radio Nigeria Network in English 1500 GMT 18 Nov 93) Rwanda Jean-Baptiste Nubahumpatse reports that Burundian refugees in southern Rwanda and Bugesera still face untold suffering. Dysentery rages, while food and the infrastructures needed to meet their basic wants are lacking. Here is his report: [Nubahumpatse] About 20 people die every day in the Burundian refugee camps. That is at least what transpires from testimonies from charitable relief organizations operating in the region such as the Belgian Red Cross and French Medecins Sans Frontieres who particularly deal with health problems. The Burundian refugees are thus hard hit by dysentery, diarrhea, measles, and other diseases. The grave overpopulation in the camps, which has caused unbearable congestion, remains the greatest handicap to the smooth running of relief operations. The UNHCR, in cooperation with the Ministry of Works and Social Affairs as well as local authorities, are currently at work to try and solve the problem. In addition, particularly due to this overpopulation in the camps, Burundian refugees rightly or wrongly complain of a lack of adequate food rations. That is the reason why some of them take risks by venturing across the border to Burundi to try and get extra food. They are welcomed by deadly bullets fired by permanently vigilant Burundian soldiers, irrefutable proof of the continuing killings deep inside Burundi. (Kigali Radiodiffusion Nationale de la Republique Rwandaise in French 0430 GMT 19 Nov 93) Uganda There has been an outbreak of dysentery in Kisoro District in which 12 people are recorded dead. Seven out of the 12 dead died at Mutolere and Kisoro Hospitals while five died at their homes. The scourge started in (Murora) sub-county and later spread to some other parts and has now covered almost half the district, the most hit areas being those along the Uganda-Rwanda border. Other affected areas include (Ruaramba), (Chihe), (Gisorora) and Muganza, being parishes which harbor the influx of refugees fleeing the war. (Kampala Radio Uganda Network in English 0400 GMT 24 Nov 93) Zaire There has been an outbreak of dysentery at Lodja lately, spreading to Lomela and other areas. About 80 deaths have been reported. The worst-hit areas include Djinga and Gombela. The government has appealed for urgent assistance from international aid agencies (Kinshasa Tele-Zaire Television Network in French 1900 GMT 23 Nov 93)
