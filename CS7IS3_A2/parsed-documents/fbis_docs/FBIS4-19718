Despite the fact that the four EU applicant nations yesterday exerted massive political pressure to get the European Parliament to say "yes" to the results of the membership negotiations, there are still some doubts about whether it is possible to scrape together the necessary majority of 260 of the total of 518 popularly elected members of parliament to reach the necessary decision on 4 May. Signals from the various party groupings indicate that a further 30 to 40 votes are still needed. Well aware of the growing skepticism in Strasbourg; a skepticism which is not due to any reluctance to enlarge the EU, but because the Parliament wants to take the opportunity to demand more power for itself, the European Parliament's deputies yesterday received a visit from what is undoubtedly the most heavyweight lobbying group which has ever tried to influence them [sentence as published]. In turn Prime Ministers Gro Harlem Brundtland and Carl Bildt, Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek, and Finnish Trade Minister Pertti Salolainen made it crystal clear what negative consequences any delay by the Palriament will have for public opinion in the four applicant countries, the EU countries, and for European policy in general. Former Conservative Party leader Kaci Kullmann Five was also in Strasbourg to influence the conservative party group. Salolainen took the toughest approach. He claimed that a postponement of enlargement would have a catastrophic effect on the Finnish people. "If you do not deal with the matter now, a completely impossible situation will arise. You would be assuming an enormous political responsibility if you said `no,'" the Finnish minister said. The Austrian vice chancellor was in complete agreement, and warned against doing anything which could threaten the current positive attitude to the EU in his home country. "What sort of message do you think will be sent to the Swedish people if you say `no' now?" Carl Bildt asked. Gro Harlem Brundtland, who is battling against a body of public opinion at home which takes the most negative view of the EU, wisely refrained from indicating what view will be taken of a delay. But she made it clear that a "no" in Strasbourg will have a very negative effect in the applicant countries and in Europe. The European Parliament's skepticism about admitting new members without concomitant institutional reforms has been reinforced since the EU countries adopted a compromise on voting rules in the Council of Ministers just before Easter. Many people in Strasbourg take the view that the compromise makes it even more difficult than it was to reach majority decisions in the EU. There is also tangible irritation that the Parliament is only being given a couple of weeks in which to discuss the final results of the membership negotiations. "What is so wrong with a postponement of six months?" British socialist Gary Titley asked. His French fellow party member, Gerhard Fuchs, hoped that the Parliament will go on saying "no" to the applicants until the Council withdraws the Ioannina compromise on voting rules. Holland's Jean Penders, a conservative, said that the Parliament's credibility is at stake. This is why the question of new members must be deferred, he said. "Why do you want to join a Union which is so powerless?" an indignant Belgian socialist, Fernand Herman, asked. The majority of those who spoke were negative. Danish conservative politician Marie Jepsen was one of the few exceptions. "We should say not only `yes,' but `yes, please,' to the applicant countries," she said. Harlem Brundtland, Bildt, and the other two lobbyists made efforts to convince the Parliament that they -- as soon as their countries have joined the EU -- will work actively to strengthen the role of the Parliament and the EU's ability to reach decisions. But they clearly distanced themselves from the fact that their applications are now being used as a way of applying pressure to try to force through more power for the Parliament. Nor did they have any time for the view voiced that a delay would only be for six months.
