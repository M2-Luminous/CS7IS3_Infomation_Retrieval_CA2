All decisions on further privatization must be made by joint effort, Lifshits said. He predicted that Moscow and the provinces would debate the right to sell formerly state-owned property and said there would be problems with the division of revenues and different views of who was to control the stocks which had fallen into the government's lap. The Russian legislature was to decide whether the Russian government or the State Property Committee would be entitled to sell the country's major industrial enterprises. In Lifshits' view, it would be very difficult to pass appropriate legislation, "more difficult, in fact, than have a national budget approved by the Federal Assembly". But, he said, Federal legislation must underlie moves for more privatization, or else there would be a collision of different views. Lifshits hoped, however, that different approaches would be discussed "in a civilized manner" without hindering work for civic accord.
