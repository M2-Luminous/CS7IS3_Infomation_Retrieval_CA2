Guardia said during a news conference that the conflict arose when United Airlines began offering a special promotion which was valid until 30 June. According to the advertisement, travelers would get a free ticket if they purchased their ticket through American Express. Guardia clarified that this promotion violates the stability of airfares. After the airline failed to cancel the promotion following numerous complaints, it was decided on 29 March to impose a $2,000 fine. According to Guardia, the U.S. company failed to make a down payment on the $2,000 fine, so its operating permit was suspended on 15 April. Since that time, a United Airlines plane has been parked at Tocumen International Airport unable to take off. Travel agencies told ACAN that United Airlines canceled the travel promotion on 18 April, but the company has not made an official announcement on the matter.
