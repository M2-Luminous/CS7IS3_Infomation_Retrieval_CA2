Because of the nature of its activity, the department maintains close ties with industry, and 14 of its 59 members work in industry. The main results of the department's activities related to the aforementioned research areas during the past 2-3 years may be summarized as follows. The department's main achievement in the area of power generation systems research has been the development of a theory and methods of researching and controlling large power generation systems. Members of the department also collaborated with the Russian Federation Institute of Power Engineering Research, Siberian Power Engineering Institute, and other institutions to develop an energy policy for Russia under the new economic conditions. The draft policy emphasizes energy conservation and development of a Russian Federation Unified Electric Power System that would include provisions for interaction with the power grids of its neighboring states. The primary focus in the area of thermal physics has been on studying the thermophysical and electrophysical properties of materials over a wide range of state parameters, including subjecting those materials to different types of intensive energy fluxes. Strong shock waves have been used to compress and irreversibly heat materials and then study them at record high pressures (tens to hundreds of millions of atmospheres) and temperatures (10[.sup]4[/]-10[.sup]6[/] K). A method of ``adiabatic expansion of shock-compressed metals'' was developed and used for the first time in world practice. Among the department's accomplishments in the area of electrophysics are studies of electromagnetic and electrical fields, electric discharges in various media, phenomena occurring in the fine structures of solids and at the interfaces of different structures, and the interaction of electromagnetic and electric fields with the biosphere and infrastructure. The department has also been actively involved in creating progressive processes of producing electric power, making complete use of fossil fuel, conserving energy, and reducing power generation facilities' harmful effects on the environment. The department is also collaborating with the Joint Institute of High Temperatures to develop new-generation steam generators that would put an end to Russia's lag in the area of gas turbine engineering. The possibilities of using aviation gas turbine engines for power generation purposes are also being explored. The department's associates have made great strides in the area of improving the safety of nuclear power generation by switching from criterial dependences to physical modeling of the key processes occurring during serious accidents at nuclear power plants. The scientific foundations and software for more exact probability analysis of the safety of existing and planned nuclear power plants have been developed along with an expert system on the radiation consequences of the Chernobyl accident. The recent problems of financing and organizing scientific research have had a negative impact on the status of the experimental base of the department's institutes, as have increasing costs for such thinks as maintaining and repairing buildings and computer equipment and maintenance. The ranks of active and future scientists are decreasing, scientific schools that have taken decades to create are under threat of collapse, and the influx of youth into science has decreased sharply. The department is working with the Russian Federation Ministry of Fuel and Energy to resolve a number of problems related to developing a state fuel and energy program, is participating actively in studies regarding a state scientific-technical program entitled ``Ecologically Pure Power Generation,'' and is involved in efforts to integrate the efforts of sectorial and academic science for the purpose of resolving the scientific-technical problems of power generation. Special attention is being given to cooperation between the academy and higher education institutions. Inadequate funding is having an adverse effect on the department's ability to pay its personnel adequately, and the increasing costs of all types of communication is making it difficult for the department to maintain its ties with regional scientific centers and industrial regions.
