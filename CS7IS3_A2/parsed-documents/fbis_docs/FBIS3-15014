Batoni [Georgian polite form of address for males] Givi Lominadze started to enumerate them but then stopped. Kanbatoni [Georgian polite form of address of females] Manana mentioned the second clause. Please, listen carefully to my reiteration. I will remind you once again. Clause three: territorial integrity and the refusal to act in order to divide other country's territory is of vital importance. Refusal to use force against a member-state's political independence. Resolving the argument by peaceful means so that international peace and justice are not endangered. One more important regulation -- the supremacy of international law in inter-state relations, non-interference in each other's internal and foreign affairs. I would like to stress this phrase, as it was mentioned here that the CIS gives Russia free rein to interfere in the affairs of others. What may happen in actual fact is another matter, and maybe we have grounds for suspicion, but I am merely telling you what regulations and realities we are about to join and what we recognize and what we decline. Guaranteeing human rights and basic freedoms in every aspect irrespective of race, ethnic origin, language, religion, and so on. This phrase may give rise to a certain doubt but it is the standard recognized by the whole world. [passage omitted] The possibility of breaching the agreement which we are joining is another issue and in principle, probably, it is difficult to rule it out, but it is better if we joined this agreement, this document together with other countries with which we have many things in common, rather than stay out of it. [passage omitted] Let me remind you of something. Of course, it is not a normal situation -- and I am speaking quite sincerely -- when a head of state takes such a decision without asking Parliament and the people. Some may say that I acted irresponsibly, while others may say that I usurped my authority. I would like to remind you in a couple of words when and why I took that decision. And I would appreciate your understanding. [passage omitted] After the disaster and tragedy unfolded in Abkhazia and we lost Abkhazia and -- please, pay special attention to this and your understanding will be appreciated -- after Kobalia's units came to the approaches of Kutaisi and Tskhaltubo was almost captured and after civil war became inevitable, a civil war had already begun in Georgia. Let me remind you that I believed that we were almost doomed to a large-scale bloodbath. [passage omitted] It was during those tragic days that I visited Moscow and asked them to protect the railways and our ports. You remember very well the days when they seized and sacked Poti and Samtredia. All links to Tbilisi and elsewhere were cut off. And the stock of flour and bread in Tbilisi was only enough for three or four days. It is hard to imagine a more difficult situation. Therefore, at my request, the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan were invited to Moscow, together with me. The four [including Yeltsin] met there and came to the conclusion that a great tragedy might happen not only to Georgia but also the Transcaucasus. An agreement in principle was reached to protect the arteries somehow. It was agreed that we would decide the rest ourselves. It was indeed so dramatic and tragic personally for me and probably many of you as well in those days that I must have spoken 10 times with the Black Sea Admiral Baltin. I told him that if he thought my presence necessary I would fly to Sevastopol and meet the personnel. I told him that he had to help the [Georgian] authorities to regain Poti somehow, otherwise hunger and disaster would be inevitable or, alternatively, we had another option of giving up as the dialogue was impossible both with Gamsakhurdia supporters and the leader of the movement. I do not want to mar his name now. We were left with no other option and then I profusely thanked the man [Baltin] who took responsibility on his shoulders and sent several warships to Poti. It was then that the capital and the country were practically saved, if it can be called saving. Georgia has not yet been saved but the prerequisites for it to have been created. In those days and under such conditions and taking into consideration all that had preceded it, I made this decision [to join the CIS]. Please, do not forget either that [changes thought]... there are witnesses, Baluashvili, deputy prosecutor general, must be present here. Witnesses have been interrogated. Chechen, Cossack, Abkhaz and mercenaries of other nationalities armed to the teeth entered Zugdidi. I personally visited those houses in Senaki and Khobi where they would spend the night, where people got shot. Let us go and ask the native population of that region. These are facts, it is a reality. Therefore, I may be tried, it may happen. I may be sentenced to death through shooting or hanging, but when one is sure that there is no other solution and that this solution may save the people and the country, then I think that one must not shirk the responsibility and I did not do so. You are free to condemn my behavior. Then I made a decision that Georgia had to join the CIS. [passage omitted] Valeriy Kvaratskhelia voiced an interesting point. He said one sentence to which we did not pay appropriate attention. He asked if entry into the CIS means a certain limiting of those forces in Russia about which Yeltsin spoke in Tbilisi. Will it mean that they will be limited? Yeltsin said that there were forces in Russia, starting from Alaska and as far as the Ukraine, if I remember correctly, who are considering and dreaming of reinstating the empire. [passage omitted] If certain forces in Russia come to power, they must know that there is another force, that there is the CIS. Russia then will have to leave the CIS. I repeat, it is not a guarantor but one of the factors. He [Yeltsin] uttered several significant phrases which have to be reckoned with as well. We have mentioned one of these issues several times before. He put it like this: Russia remains responsible for the disruption of talks on the Abkhaz issue. It was a difficult thing to bring oneself to saying this, it was not easy. In principle, I agree with Tedo Paatashvili who said that whoever may be the leader of Russia, Georgia must try to maintain normal relations with Russia. It is a reality. History and God require so. Many things have to be taken into consideration in relations with a great country. [passage omitted] What affect will it have on the visit to the United States if parliament ratifies this document today? I am grateful to those deputies who expressed their alarm that it may hinder us in achieving a certain success. I have a slightly different principle. I have always had different principles. We must pursue honest politics. I am not going to use the ratification of this document as, so to say, a trump card in a dialogue with the U.S. administration. We have different kind of relations with the United States. A lot has been said here that there are no activists in the West who view Georgia's joining the CIS as a positive event. It is not true. It is a well-known fact in the United States of America and other western countries that Georgia had no other option. What path could we follow? We must use this factor, we have a possibility for it, use the CIS and simultaneously cooperate with everybody. We have relevant guarantees that nobody is going to limit us in doing so, and nobody could. [passage omitted] I would like to clarify something. Why did we not send two divisions to Sukhumi? It is a question of principle. We had the possibility to do so then. Not only because Gia [Karkarashvili] and Irakli [Batiashvili] said they would resign. No. I still believed; to be more accurate, I did not believe that we would betray each other in the battle for Sukhumi. I did not believe it. There were 8,000 men at the approaches to Sukhumi with equipment and every means. Some 4,000 more men were approaching from Ochamchire and were nearly at the approaches to Gulripshi rayon. Disaster happened. We betrayed each other and in principle, I could not imagine that betrayal of such degree and on such scale would be possible, but I do not want you to imagine that I am alleviating another country's blame for this. I believed and trusted that all of us were united then, both the former president's supporters, Kobalia, and others. I believed it and could not imagine that we could betray each other so. Therefore, I am stressing this fact for the sake of establishing the truth. The rest must be thought out well. As Zurab Zhvania has said, what will happen if we do not join the CIS? It will be a long discussion. Let us look thoroughly at our present conditions and our future conditions. Therefore, the people, the nation, the country, and the state which are under these circumstances do not have the right to refuse even the slightest chance which is being given to us by nature and God in order to save ourselves. Please, listen with understanding to those arguments which I mentioned in my brief letter given to you and my speech. Thank you.
