In an interview for MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, Eduard Rossel, the failed governor of the Urals Republic, waved his hand enthusiastically: "Crimea is a Russian land, and I favor its being reclaimed by Russia as soon as possible." When asked by MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS how much time the construction of a dam or a bridge across the Kerch strait will take, Mr. Rossel, of German origin, revealed that he knew firms that could cope with such an order fairly quickly. The bridge that would connect the Russian Federation with Crimea could be built vertically and lowered later when the situation allows. The cautious Nikolay Gonchar, guarding his reputation as a centrist, said that Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov is a good and calm person, but that Moscow and Kiev should touch upon the Crimean issue very carefully so as not to carry matters to the brink of war. Mr. Gonchar called on both the president and the Federation Council to agree on a common stand on the Crimean issue so as not to transplant local passions to Moscow. Formerly, the stances of the president and the Russian Supreme Soviet regarding Crimea were diametrically opposed, a fact that was skillfully exploited by Crimean extremists.
