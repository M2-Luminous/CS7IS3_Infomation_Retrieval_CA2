The announcement said Moslem troops intensified mortar fire in the region of the central Bosnian town of Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf). It added that Moslems continued using infantry arms, anti-aircraft guns and rifle-launched rockets in their fierce attacks on Serb positions on the western Bosnian battlefronts of Bihac and Novi Grad (formerly Bosanski Novi). In the Moslem attacks on Bihac, one Serb defender was killed and the Serb side was forced to fire back, but it did not respond to the attacks on Novi Grad where there were no casualties, the announcement said. It added that on Monday, after 13 days of fighting, the army of Bosnian Serbs stopped an offensive launched by Moslems on March 16 and aimed at capturing the central Bosnian heights of Kupres. Bosnian Serb troops pushed the Moslems back towards the nearby town of Bugojno up north. The Moslem attack on the Kupres heights, as the Bosnian Serb military sources said, was planned as part of the offensive launched to seize the town of Srbobran and later the town of Jajce. The sources cautioned against fresh fierce attacks by Moslem forces which were redeploying themselves towards Srbobran and Kupres, moving in there their men and materiel from Travnik and Gornji Vakuf, the central Bosnian towns where they had fought Bosnian Croats. The sources said the army of Bosnian Croats overnight fiercely attacked the positions of Serb defenders in the northern Bosnian stretch of the Sava valley, especially those outside the Serb villages of Jenjic and Lepnica, but there were no casualties and the defenders had not responded.
