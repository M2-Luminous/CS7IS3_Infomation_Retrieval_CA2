FR940406-2-00147 FR940406-2-00090 One commenter suggested that intermediaries be required to state in their proposals how they will deal with the problem of monitoring unincorporated entities to ensure that they act with proper fiscal standards. The same commenter agreed with the Department's preference for an intermediary handling both Resident Capacity and Predevelopment grants. As part of its overall evaluation of each intermediary's application, the Department will evaluate proposals to deal with the problem of monitoring fiscal standards. One commenter requested that Community Action Agencies, which have been the leader in services to the low-income community in all areas for more than 25 years, be eligible intermediaries. The Department is adhering to the statutory definition of intermediary, but to the extent such an agency has the capacity to become an eligible applicant under the guidelines, a Community Action Agency could apply. Several commenters suggested that intermediaries receive preference if they have a structured plan that maximizes resident participation in administrative policy issues. Another commenter requested that HUD require intermediaries to work with a tenant-based coalition, and if an intermediary cannot develop this support, HUD should administer the grants. The Department will not include this requirement because it would be too burdensome, particularly for national intermediaries. However, four commenters suggested giving preference to intermediaries with demonstrated resident/nonprofit accountability. The Department will give preference for such a demonstrated track record. One commenter recommended deleting language that requires intermediaries to have a record of service in ``multiple communities'' because the language is vague and confusing. The requirement is statutory and therefore the language remains unchanged. The Department does not agree that it is confusing. The Department considers ``a record of service␣*␣*␣* in multiple communities'' to mean the intermediary has worked with various types of organizations within varied communities. Preferably these communities would include a cross-section of the geographic area for which the intermediary is applying to administer grants. The definition would exclude an intermediary that has worked solely in one community or neighborhood. 3. Intermediary Tasks Seven commenters requested more detail in the NOFA of the Department's expectations to guide intermediaries, particularly in their monitoring activities, with standards and timeframes. Several sought clarification of the legal responsibilities of the intermediaries, others felt intermediary activities should be expanded and negotiated with HUD to include underwriting, monitoring, servicing, site visits, and technical assistance provision. One commenter sought clarification of whether an intermediary will act as a delegated processor with final grant authority, or whether it will function under some other model. One commenter disagreed with negotiating the level of activities, arguing that HUD should require specific tasks of all intermediaries to get all essential tasks covered. The Department has seriously considered this issue and has provided a greater level of detail of its expectations of the intermediaries. The Department will not allow a variety of participation levels by intermediaries. However, if an intermediary seeks to perform a higher level of activities, such as technical assistance, it may apply to perform these activities under a separate HUD NOFA that will implement section 254 of LIHPRHA as added by section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. That NOFA is expected to be published soon. One commenter stated that intermediaries, in general, should not have say over who is selected as a priority purchaser, which consultants are hired, what are the contract terms, etc. While the Department's regulations regarding priority purchasers are separate from this NOFA, the intermediaries will have review authority over consultants hired and terms of contracts under the technical assistance grants. One commenter suggested that some technical assistance grantees may want closer oversight and assistance, and intermediaries should be required to provide to those grantees what is agreed upon in the grant. As discussed above, and in order to provide consistency nationwide, the grantees cannot request a higher level of service from the intermediaries. 4. Accountability Three commenters suggested that resident groups should be able to formally monitor intermediaries prior to their receipt of further funding, and to include standards that encourage intermediaries to have accountability to residents and nonprofits without micromanagement by the intermediary. One of these commenters suggested that intermediaries should show evidence of a commitment to tenant organizing; another suggested a stronger conflict of interest proviso and performance benchmarks for the intermediary. However, a fourth commenter believed oversight of intermediaries should not be by tenant groups or other prospective grantees; rather, HUD should provide this oversight. This commenter recommended a selection of intermediaries when the track record indicates absence of abuse. As part of its monitoring of intermediaries, the Department will accept comments from outside parties on intermediary performance after intermediary grants are in place and active. However, the Department does not find it appropriate to include, nor does it desire to delay intermediary funding by including, resident groups directly in the monitoring process. 5. Other Comments One commenter recommended that the benchmarks for Technical Assistance Grantees be made by the Department, rather than left up to the intermediary. The statute requires that HUD work with intermediaries to come up with the performance benchmarks for the Predevelopment Grant phases. The Department intends these benchmarks to be consistent across the country. One commenter requested clarification that intermediaries, at their own risk, may incur costs from the date they are selected, as opposed to the date of contract execution. The Department agrees with this request; however, no actual fees will be paid prior to the date of contract execution and the intermediary may not begin funding technical assistance grantees prior to such execution.
