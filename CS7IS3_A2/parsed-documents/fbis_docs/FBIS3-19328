In the Landtag elections in Lower Saxony on Sunday [13 March], the SPD and the Greens obtained an absolute majority of seats. The Greens, who had been in government with the SPD until now, were also able to improve their results significantly. By contrast, the CDU suffered heavy losses and had to make do with the worst results in 35 years. The FDP will no longer not be represented in the Landtag. The protest parties received well below 5 percent. The Mannheim-based "Research Group Elections" arrived at the following conclusions: "Few voters (22 percent) in Lower Saxony expected an absolute majority for the SPD, and only 37 percent wanted the SPD to achieve an absolute majority. Even among SPD supporters, over a third did not want the party to have an absolute majority. Nevertheless, the Lower Saxony results represent an end to the trend away from the popular parties, which was in evidence since the last elections. The SPD and the CDU were able to win the backing of 80 percent of the electorate. That is somewhat less than four years ago, but significantly more than in the elections in Hamburg in September of last year, when the SPD and CDU jointly were only able to obtain 65 percent. Despite hurricane-like weather conditions, the turnout was still high at 73.8 percent. ``The Lower Saxony elections drew attention to the current political situation at the federal level. The CDU and the FDP felt that above all. The CDU, which on scale of between - 5 and + 5 still achieved an average level of + 1.3 in Lower Saxony four years ago, now only obtained + 0.3, and the FDP, which scored + 0.7 percent four years ago, now only achieved - 0.3. However, the SPD's image also registered a drop from + 1.7 at the last elections to + 1.4 in these elections. Only the Greens registered an improvement, from - 0.6 to - 0.1 now. ``In view of the position at the outset, the room for political maneuver at the land level was limited for Lower Saxony's parties. Both the SPD and the CDU were able to profit from the relatively high standing of their leading politicians. Thus, Minister-President Schroeder scored an average of + 1.4 on a scale of between - 5 and + 5 among all the citizens of Lower Saxony and + 2.8 among SPD supporters, faring only marginally better than his challenger Christian Wulff, who obtained + 1.2 among all those polled and + 2.7 among all CDU voters. However, asked to make a direct comparison, 47 percent of all the citizens of Lower Saxony would want to see Schroeder as minister-president, and only 33 percent opted for Wulff. ``What was also decisive for the SPD result was that the party succeed in gaining the support of the bulk of its 1990 voters: As many as 77 percent of SPD voters this time had also voted for the party the last time, 8 percent came over directly from the CDU, and almost every tenth one came from the group of those who were not eligible to vote last time or did not vote. Among its classic regular voters, that is, unionized workers, it could almost gather two-thirds of all votes. ``Despite its losses, the CDU was also successful in its traditional areas: In its strongholds, it suffered below average losses in view of its strong position at the outset. Among the Catholics in the countryside, it obtained 55 percent. In the countryside as a whole, it achieved 47 percent, and 48 percent among the over-sixties, one of its strongest sources of support. The losses among all social structure subgroups were roughly similar. ``The federal political climate was not the only factor determining the failure of the FDP. The work of the FDP as an opposition force in the Lower Saxony Landtag was also assessed negatively. The FDP's attitude toward the coalition question also had an effect. Before the elections, FDP voters wanted a clear answer to the question of with whom would the FDP want to govern after the elections. Neither in Lower Saxony nor at the federal level do FDP's regular voters suffice for the party to cross the 5-percent threshold.'' Clear Gains for the Greens ``The Greens were the only party that made clear gains and obtained its best result in these Lower Saxony Landtag elections, also faring well among voters in the 18-25 age group (17 percent) on this occasion at the expense of the SPD, but achieving lower results among the 25-34 age group (13 percent). By contrast, the SPD was able to maintain its 1990 result among the latter group. The Greens were able to obtain their best result among young women below the age of 24, gaining 19 percent of the vote. ``The fact that the Republikaner results were well below the 5-percent mark was due to the loss in importance of their key issue, the asylum and foreigners question, which is only ranked among problems of major importance for the land by 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lower Saxony and, on the other hand, to increased competence of the popular parties on important political questions. The agreement that was reached on nursing attendance insurance was undoubtedly a signal in this respect. ``On the question of solving the most important issues in the land, a land government led by the SPD undoubtedly has an advantage over one led by the CDU. In the case of unemployment, which is considered the most important issue in the land by 68 percent of the inhabitants of Lower Saxony, 28 percent believe that an SPD government would be better at solving the problem and only 14 percent would be more inclined to have confidence in a CDU government, but 30 percent of the citizens in Lower Saxony consider both parties to be equally capable of solving the problem, whereas only 22 percent think that neither party can solve the problem. On the issue of the economy too, there is more confidence in the SPD in Lower Saxony (27 percent) than in the CDU (21 percent), although in this case too, most (28 believe) that both an SPD-led and CDU-led government could solve economic problems and only 17 percent think that neither party is capable of doing so. Overall, there is significantly more confidence in the ability of the two largest parties to solve problems than a few months ago.''
