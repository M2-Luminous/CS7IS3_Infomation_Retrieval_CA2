According to Miller, the aim of Solidarity is not to hold negotiations on their demands, for which the best place would be a the tripartite commission, but to bring about negotiations solely between the government and Solidarity. The demonstration in Warsaw on 27 May was held in order to achieve this, among other things. "The government will not conduct any bilateral talks with trade unions. First, there exists a third party, namely employers. Second, the government cannot conduct separate negotiations on similar demands with a different trade union confederation on each occasion. Taking into account the number of trade union confederations, the government would do nothing but negotiate and would not have time to implement anything," the labor minister said.
