It is more difficult to assess the president's recent vigorous moves. Is he regaining his good form, or is he becoming nervous? [Lamentowicz] These moves were ineffective from the viewpoint of his objectives, and they also demonstrated that he could be a possible factor in Poland's destabilization. The president is throwing a monkey wrench into the works of a moving vehicle. He is trying to interfere with the progress of forces he can no longer control. And so he is losing. Those among the public who understand what is going on see his behavior as desperate attempts to halt processes that are unfavorable from the viewpoint of Walesa's personal goals: another term in office as president. He makes these attempts using increasingly dramatic methods and resorting to very poor style. His image is increasingly that of an ineffectual and tragicomic politician because he cannot understand that he is losing and behaves as if he were winning. [Gielzynski] But, recently, he seems to have regained a part of his old support force--that is, Solidarity. [Lamentowicz] I do not think so. Walesa has distanced himself from most of the political groups hailing originally from Solidarity, and they are no longer able to vote for him. To begin with, he antagonized the center groups and the Democratic Union, and then he declared war on the right wing's "useless duds." In turn, the Union of Labor has never felt inclined to cultivate close relations with him. Ours is the only political group that has never sent him birthday wishes in any form. We decided that the president's birthday is his private affair and pointed out that he does not send us birthday greetings, either. Moreover, ours is the only group that did not take part in the ceremonial signing of the concordat agreement. [Gielzynski] Even so, Walesa still has some fragments of political support from such groups as the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms. [Lamentowicz] Yes, he has such fragmentary support, but his advisers are weakening as a group. He constructed a most peculiar system of councils, a whole network of them, whose advice he has always ignored and ignores even now. They are made up of several hundred people, mostly eminent and respected figures, who have allowed themselves to be drawn into something that is a complete fabrication. It is most embarrassing to have to tell those people that they are involved in a fictitious undertaking, but, if they had any self-esteem, they would withdraw from it themselves. As it is, they willingly accept the status of "ignored advisers." Other people are quite scandalized about this state of affairs. I believe that someone who first appoints them to advisory positions and then treats them so perfunctorily does not deserve any trust himself. The creation of that fictitious advisory system is one of Walesa's fundamental mistakes. [Gielzynski] But there is also a narrow circle of Walesa's true advisers. [Lamentowicz] Nevertheless, I am inclined to think that it has a rather poor reputation--deservedly poor. Walesa's real advisers, with whom he works closely, are people who are decidedly uninteresting and without any good ideas. [Gielzynski] So, do the fictitious advisers have good ideas then? [Lamentowicz] Perhaps if Walesa had listened to their counsel more often, he would have avoided making many mistakes. What they suggested to him was often completely different from what he actually did. Moreover, Walesa's further mistake is that he introduced a method of ruling through his "personal court." In any democracy, particularly one that has only just been formed and is still very young, when people are highly sensitive to the need to respect its principles, the development of a "courtly rule" mechanism, with an emperorlike figure at its center, is completely disgraceful. It is tantamount to sneering at people's good judgment and common sense. What Walesa has done with the Belweder Palace is a sin against tradition and against democracy. Even Pilsudski did not drag the Belweder, as a national institution, so low that it was derided as a place of ridicule. Pilsudski may have been criticized for many valid reasons, but he did retain the dignity of his office. No one could ever have thought of him as a political clown. [Gielzynski] Do you not think that now Walesa has even lost his ability to apply his "shorthand" style in speech and his colorful way of expressing his thoughts in brilliantly pithy phrases such as "I am for it, and even against it," an ability that is, after all, the quintessence of diplomacy? [Lamentowicz] The president still has such stylistic leanings because he is incapable of speaking in precise terms. However, that is not his gravest offense. In 1980, he also spoke in his characteristic style, but he was serious then. [Gielzynski] Then he had both his charisma and his intuition.... [Lamentowicz] Exactly--and also people who worked with him and were not ignored or ridiculed by him for protecting and defending him as their leader. Walesa appears to be incapable of appreciating the truth that politics is a team game that must be played in tandem with groups of people representing larger sections of the public who choose to hold the same kind of views. He seemingly no longer understands that politics is made together with people, not above their heads. Instead, he is still given to thinking up fanciful concepts such as giving each citizen 100 or 300 million zlotys, "sending certain people home in their socks," "devising a master plan," and so on. In Walesa's mind, such concepts seem to replace the need to do some solid thinking in terms of programs. Today, even the least critical observers can see for themselves that these are just empty phrases, that there is nothing behind them but an ambition to hang on to his position at the Belweder or the Namiestnikowski [Regent's] Palace. The latter name seems symbolic indeed because Walesa is given to parading in office rather than discharging a public office. However, this is not going to last for very long now.
