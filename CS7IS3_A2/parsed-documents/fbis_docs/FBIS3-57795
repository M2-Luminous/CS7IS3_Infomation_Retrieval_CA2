Explaining, on the first subject, that the government's "firm intention" is to "avoid any increase in the general social contribution," Mr. Sarkozy said: "Hospitals take up 49 percent of health insurance spending and have too many underused beds. We will have to act accordingly." The budget minister also discussed "social VAT" both as a possible solution to the problem of funding social security and as an incentive to job creation. Expressing the view that it "could be an interesting solution," he nonetheless added: "VAT is a tax on the consumer. We must be careful not to slow down the beginning of a return to growth!" Finally, he asked "how can we be sure that in exchange for this huge reduction in contributions the majority of enterprises will start hiring."
