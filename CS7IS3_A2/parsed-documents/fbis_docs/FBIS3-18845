He does not like to reduce ideas to a single sentence, to express himself in slogans, or to trim his assessments back with a hatchet. He prefers situations in which he can develop his arguments and explain his thinking clearly. This, partly because economics, and especially tax matters, do not lend themselves well to slogans or, rather, the slogans that raise people's feelings in these fields conflict with the figures. So Spaventa tries to avoid them, even during an election campaign and even on television. What he does like, however, is debate -- so much so that he decided to stand for election in Rome's constituency number one, precisely in order to challenge [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi's claim to a seat in the lower house. And the first thing that Spaventa did on "Milano, Italia" yesterday was to set his own position on taxation against that of Forza Italia or, rather, to demonstrate the impracticability of the "Martino theory" -- a reference to the person behind Berlusconi's economic program -- which aims to introduce a single 30 percent income tax rate. "At present tax rates of up to 30 percent of taxable income apply to 95 percent of taxpayers," Spaventa said, "while higher rates apply to only the remaining 5 percent. If the aim were, by means of a number of allowances, to maintain the present tax burden on those paying less than 30 percent, while at the same time reducing the higher rates, there would be an immediate loss of revenue of 3.5-4 trillion lire. This presents two alternatives: Either we forego this large slice of revenue, which the state coffers cannot allow, or this burden is placed on the medium taxpayers, those declaring incomes of 40-80 million lire, penalizing them still further." Having finished with figures, Spaventa went on to tackle the issue of fair taxation: "Ronald Reagan included in his program the introduction of a single rate of income tax, but then the problem of ensuring neutrality for federal funds and for taxpayers by means of allowances in such a reform became a nightmare for him. He never found the solution, and indeed a single tax rate was never introduced in the United States." "The problem," Spaventa added, "is that in order to avert enormous waste, the system of allowances must be extremely detailed, in which case the regulations would fill a whole book." Having dismantled his adversary's proposals, Berlusconi's progressive rival went on to present his own proposal, which has three points: "What can be done is to reduce the number of tax rates, to lower the higher ones and to raise the lower ones, and to operate a simple system of deductions for personal income tax. In the case of legal entities, my proposal is to reduce the tax rate, which is officially very high, and to revise the entire taxation system, which at present favors indebtedness rather than the increase of risk capital. Last, there is investment income, and in this regard I very much like the proposal made by Finance Minister Gallo." Franco Gallo's proposal which was not pursued because of the early election, envisages the incorporation of taxation on all financial income (interest received, yield from bonds and government stock, dividends, and so forth) so as to make the tax aspect neutral in the choice of how savings will be employed. Tax would in any case be deducted by intermediaries at source.
