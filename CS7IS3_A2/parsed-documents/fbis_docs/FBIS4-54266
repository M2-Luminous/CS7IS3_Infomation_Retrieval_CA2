According to an agreement signed on 29 April 1994, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy has granted the company the right to run the factory for a period of 20 years. Concerning the income earned by the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry, the paper quotes Kev Vutthin, deputy director of the ministry's Planning, Accounting, and Finance Department, as saying that during the first four months of the year -- from early January to late April -- the ministry collected earnings of $8.5 million and over 431 million riels for the state coffers. The deputy director has further said that the revenue is from the sale of postal stamps and fees charged for local and overseas telephone calls. Finally, commenting on the issue of renting state-owned factories to private companies, the paper says the problem is now becoming increasingly complicated. It quotes a report as pointing out that at present, 15 companies still owe a total amount of $185,000, the rental in the first quarter of the year, to the State. So far, 40 local and overseas firms have hired factories from the State, but only 10 of them are operative.
