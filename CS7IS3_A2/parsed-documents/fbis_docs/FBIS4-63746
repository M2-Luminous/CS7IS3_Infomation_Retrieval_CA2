He said Yeltsin's decree was prepared along with a government resolution to halve export duties from 30 to 15 ecus (or 5 to 2.5 dollars per barrel) per one tonne of crude. Duties on oil products must also be halved, Putilov said. "If implemented, the resolution will help producers secure a more acceptable level of export prices and increase their foreign exchange revenues," he stressed. Oil and gas experts say that the producers are keen to increase their share of oil exports to countries other than the republics of the former Soviet Union. Russia sells crude oil to other CIS states at a price of 65-70 dollars a tonne compared with the world's price of 110 dollars. Rosneft experts believe that some of the losses that the producers will have to sustain from taxes on the exports of 25 million tonnes of crude on government orders can be offset by benefits arising from fixed duties and higher exports to the West.
