[Bordon] Hold on a moment. While the situation appeared tense for a couple of days, I would wait before assuming that we have found a solution. The Greens' assembly appeared to me to be very good and Fabio Mussi's speech also seemed very good. However, I do not think that all the problems have been resolved and we cannot take our merger for granted on Tuesday [8 February] at the plenary session of the progressive table. [Bordon stops] Willer Bordon wants to get a few final details straightened out. The Democratic Alliance's national coordinator had only just come out of the cooperative climate of the convention in Riccione and declared that he was "satisfied" but made it clear that: "Nonetheless, for us there remain two vital issues cannot be conceded and to which definitive answers have yet to be found. Firstly, at the elections we want to put forward the name of the prime minister or a list of candidates who could lead the future progressive government. The second point concerns the composition of the electoral lists. [Marozzi] Will you continue to support [Prime Minister] Ciampi's candidacy for prime minister? The Greens do not like him and neither does Communist Renewal. [Bordon] We have expressed our preference but we are not going to stick fanatically to just one person. A group of candidates could put themselves forward to be prime minister before the election. However, it is important that we explain to the voters on what points we oppose the moderates. We must make it clear before the electorate goes to the polls. For example, Francesco Rutelli came here today. It is true that he is the only Green mayor of a large city [Rome] but it is equally true that Communist Renewal is in the opposition in Rome. Things like this must not occur. [Marozzi] What do you not like about the composition of the electoral lists? Mussi seems to have shown prompt readiness. [Bordon] That is true, but now we must check what he has said. There is a risk now of a nasty party division. That is another gift that we cannot present to the moderates.
