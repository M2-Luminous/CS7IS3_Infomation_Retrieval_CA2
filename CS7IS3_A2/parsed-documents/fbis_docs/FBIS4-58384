The sources described these contacts as "important," especially in view of the "deadlock" in the dialogue efforts between Algerian authorities and the FIS leadership detained in Algeria, which began on the eve of Major General Liamine Zeroual's assumption of the presidency. The sources said that in their contacts with the FIS leader the French offered a plan to sponsor a dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian Government. However, the sources declined to reveal details of the plan. They pointed out that the Americans just stressed their neutrality and said they would not offer any aid to the present authorities in Algeria. The sources said that these contacts came up against the principle of referring to the leaders in Blida prison, as FIS leaders do not decide on any radical plan before referring it to FIS leaders Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj, who are detained in Blida military prison with two FIS shura council members. The FIS has in the past announced its acceptance of the principle of negotiating -- not holding a dialogue -- with the ruling authorities. It set conditions for that, most importantly releasing FIS leaders and the other detainees, closing the concentration camps [al-muhtashadat] in the desert, resuming the electoral process, revoking the decision to disband the FIS, and judging "those who caused the bloodshed and staged the January 1992 coup," which led to the cancellation of the elections and disbandment of the FIS, which had won the first round of elections. The sources, which asked to remain anonymous, said that the "judgment" question was at the top of the French and U.S. interlocutors' priorities. The sources added that the FIS continues to insist on this point. And that "the best it can offer is to turn a blind eye to their departure from Algeria before the FIS assumes power." The sources interpreted the raising by the French and Americans of the question of "judging the officials" as an attempt to explore the FIS' position vis-a-vis the possibility of its agreeing to participate in power with some of the regime's elements. But the FIS -- according to the same sources -- cannot "join hands with some elements whom it holds responsible for what has happened in Algeria over the past two years. However, it has no objection to dealing with the Army after removing the extremist elements from it under a national plan designed to restore stability and constitutional legitimacy to the country." In Algiers, AL-HAYAH has learned that President Liamine Zeroual has presided over a meeting of the supreme command of the Army's General Staff. It is the first meeting of such importance held three [as published] days before the 8 May marches being staged in support of the dialogue. No information has emerged about the topics discussed at the meeting. However, well-informed sources do not rule out that the meeting may have discussed the stage ahead with regard to the security, political, and economic aspects. They say it is likely to be "a meeting for assessing national dialogue" and discussing the changes expected in the coming weeks. Three [as published] days before the marches staged in support of the dialogue, incidents of violence and subversion have begun to emerge once again. More than 25 security and Army elements were assassinated in one day, the day before yesterday. These operations took place after a period of noticeable calm, as security forces had seized the initiative and showed they were in control of the security situation. Observers interpret the resumption of the "show actions" which occurred in the capital and other areas as "a message of warning to the regime and public opinion to the effect that those whose issue this is, are still on the field." Other sources say that these operations "are merely a reaction to the security forces' recent air bombardment of the Bouznika [as transliterated] area in Batna (east Algeria) and the killing of many members of the armed groups in Boumerdas (east of the capital)." But corroborated information conveyed to AL-HAYAH says that the "calm" that has dominated the recent period is nothing but "an undeclared agreement" on a truce between the regime and the armed groups to show "good intentions" vis-a-vis the dialogue and national reconciliation.
