Among other things, he dealt with Albanian-Greek relations. Also attending the meeting were DP General Secretary Tritan Shehu; Rexhep Uka, minister without portfolio for local government problems; Minister of Education Xhezair Teliti; Genc Ruli, deputy for the Gjirokaster constituency; and Sokrat Kalidhopuli, chairman of the district council. "We came to this open meeting," Mr. Selami said, "as representatives of the party in power -- the Democratic Party -- and of the local state organs, to listen to your concerns and exchange opinions on how to solve all the problems that are soluble. "The DP has been governing the country for the last two years. Over this period, there have been both achievements and shortcomings, but we have never concealed the latter. It has been a difficult period, but one that has also been full of many hopes. It has been and still is characterized by successes on the road toward democracy and a market economy, toward Europe and Western civilization. It is the beginning of a long haul toward our future, in which much remains to be done, because democracy is a thing that always strives for perfection. Aside from problems of the economic reform and its implementation, and problems regarding Gjirokaster itself, it would be of great interest to broach here the relations with our southern neighbor, Greece, to discuss the grave incident of April 10, and to have your opinions on these issues. This is another reason why we came to Gjirokaster. "We are living at a time of great change," Mr. Selami continued, "a time when the period of destruction and overcoming communism unfortunately, in our region, very soon gave way to a period of war fraught with extreme nationalism that today is reflected in its most acute form in the former Yugoslavia, and Bosnia in particular. This crisis, the greatest one since World War II -- not only on a regional scale, but also on a European one -- is also one of the world's greatest crises. In this respect, our policy has always been one of finding a peaceful solution and negotiation, ruling out any change of frontiers by force. However, at the same time it has been a policy of defending Albanian interests. In this regard, we think that these sorts of problems will remain in the region. Peaceful solutions, not only in Bosnia, but also other parts of Yugoslavia, look extremely remote. In Kosova and elsewhere, there are big problems. We are therefore of the opinion that a host of difficulties relating to the international situation are becoming added to the natural difficulties that our reform -- one of the deepest and most radical ones -- has brought in Albania...." Dealing with Albania's relations with our southern neighbor, which is also a member of the European Community, PD Chairman Eduard Selami stated: "We have been and continue to be in favor of good relations, but things have not gone as they should. Certain things have become tense and aggravated. As for the incident, you have already heard our stern condemnation and denunciation of the perpetrators. We have complained about this to the relevant international bodies, urging them to find the culprits and put the responsibility for what happened on those who really deserve it. In the context of our state-to-state dealings, this event has impaired our relationship, but there has been no lack of determination on our part, and it must be mentioned that Greece, too, has responded positively to our resolve. We therefore think that, through good will and dialogue, these issues can be resolved. However, it remains our precondition that the culprits must be identified. They must accept their responsibility, and Greece should also admit its responsibility here, because it is involved in an incident that requires a just solution. The matter has been put before all the international bodies and the various groups set up to investigate the case. They will clarify many things, but it is natural that Albania, as the injured party, has reacted strongly in its own right. Such incidents tend to strain the relations between our two countries. The incident we are speaking about is not an isolated one. There are certain circles in Greece that are interested in destabilizing relations with Albania. This can be seen in the inhumane Greek conduct towards the Albanian refugees as well as other provocations stemming from a certain concept -- the concept of Vorio-Epirus. "As the party in power, we always follow a straight line. We have respected and continue to respect the Greek minority because we appreciate its contribution; it sees its future in Albania and does not play any destabilizing role, but on the contrary makes its own contribution to democracy in Albania. As we continuously perfect democracy in Albania, the demands of the Greek minority will certainly increase. Our relations with the Greek minority, which in Gjirokaster have a long and positive tradition of humane cooperation, must not serve as the cause of a breakup in our relations with Greece. It is a pity that time and again there emerge extremist attitudes, irresponsible declarations, and certain stands that aggravate the situation. We, as the Democratic Party, have welcomed members of the Greek minority into our ranks, placing them in government posts, in parliamentary positions, in the education system, and so on. As far as we are concerned, the Greek minority is a factor of stability. We will continue marching along the same road of good understanding with Greece, because it is not only to the benefit of Albania and Greece, but also to that of our region as a whole. We really do want cooperation, but we also want mutual obligations to be honored. Our two neighboring countries, being the most ancient countries in the Balkans, must render their services to stability and peace. The PD is of the opinion that the time has already come for Greek-Albanian relations not to be dominated by ancient instincts and nationalistic spirits founded on extremist religious attitudes." The meeting was also addressed by Messrs. Shehu, Uka, Teliti, and Kalidhopulli, who answered questions put by the audience. After the meeting, Mr. Selami and other dignitaries went to pay condolences to the family of the martyr Fatmir Shehu, the army officer killed in the 10 April massacre.
