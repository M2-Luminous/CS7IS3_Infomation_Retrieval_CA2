During the seven Central European presidents' stroll through Litomysl this afternoon, activists from the Czech movement Rainbow (Duha) and the Austrian movement Global 2000 unfolded banners with anti-nuclear inscriptions. Klestil, who plans to discuss the nuclear energy issue with Havel, raised his thumb and smiled in support of the environmentalists' demands. In the letter the environmentalists propose that the Litomysl summit adopt a resolution on the danger of using nuclear energy in Central Europe. They call on the presidents to support cooperation in energy saving and in its effective use, and to press for the introduction of information exchange on nuclear facilities' operation. The environmentalists also recommend that the presidents discuss opportunities of influencing neighbor countries' nuclear projects which could be dangerous to their populations. They are also asked to initiate international conferences on effective energy uses. The letter does not directly mention the nuclear power plant which is now being built at Temelin, south Bohemia. Austrian environmentalists, supported by political parties, have been strongly protesting against its completion. The Soviet-type plant, to be equipped with Westinghouse safety technology, is located about 100 kilometers from the Austrian border.
