Shapovalenko, who stated that the voting results in eight districts could not be declared valid. The oblast electoral commission did not consider his arguments to be convincing and "confirmed" 36 members of the legislative assembly out of the 47 needed. (In 11 districts the elections were not valid because voters did not turn out.) There is a quorum of deputies, and on 12 April the first sitting of the oblast legislative assembly will take place, at which the standing orders for work will be considered and organizational questions will be decided. At the same time the oblast electoral commission sent the Russian president a letter giving an adverse assessment of his representative's actions, considering them to be discrediting the president himself. Who exactly will assemble in the hall on Cosmonauts' Day? People who have real power in their hands. The slogan of purely "party" candidates, who suggested to voters the notion that leaders of enterprises have no business being in the legislative assembly, did not work. A total of 19 people will represent the directors' corps in the assembly. Neither did the call of the head of the oblast administration to his colleagues at city and rayon level not to run for deputy work. Virtually to a man they launched themselves into the election campaign, as a result of which 11 of them achieved their objective. The remaining seats went to representatives of a new wave -- businessmen. They include, for example, V. Shcherbakov, director of "Yuzhnyy Ural," the oblast's biggest commercial bank. There will be representatives of the press in the deputies' corps -- two journalists were elected. Neither did the party principle work. Not a single "Russia's Choice" or "Democratic Russia" candidate got through. Communists and agrarians, who united in the bloc "Against Poverty, Unemployment, and Corruption," had to be content with two seats. But those elected included many who, although they do not formally belong to this bloc, sympathize with it, as they say. Those who did not heed the wish of the head of the oblast administration and who were elected to the assembly include Orenburg Mayor Gennadiy Donkovtsev, who, to give him his due, is in high standing with the city's inhabitants. "Paradoxical as it may seem, I am against the presence of administration heads in the assembly," he told journalists. "The Executive and Legislative Branches must be separated. Otherwise, we end up controlling ourselves. Why did I myself fight for a seat in the legislative assembly? Because I saw that there would be nobody to protect the interests of the city, which accounts for one-fourth of the oblast's population...." The city's mayor assured voters that as a deputy he would do everything to ensure that the city's economy is not so "turbulent." Well, we will wait and see.
