FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: By mail: Phillip O.

Office location and telephone number: Rm. 213, Crystal Mall #2, 1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202 (703) 305&hyph;7690. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A notification of intent to conduct small-scale field testing pursuant to the EPA's Statement of Policy entitled ``Microbial Products Subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act,'' published in the Federal Register of June 26, 1986 (51 FR 23313), has been received by Ciba-Geigy Corporation of Greensboro, North Carolina. The purpose of the proposed testing is to determine the biological activity of the Bacillus thuringiensis strains CGB203, CGB208, CGB209, and CGB210 against diamondback moth, fall armyworm, beet armyworm, and tomato fruitworm on cole crops and tomatoes over a 2&hyph;year period. These strains have had various Bacillus thuringiensis cry genes inserted into them via a B. thuringiensis - E. coli shuttle vector containing a B. thuringiensis origin of replication and ampicillin and erythromycin resistance markers. One of these strains also had a cry gene introduced via conjugal transfer between two strains of B. thuringiensis . The testing will take place in Florida on less than 1 acre per strain per year. Plants in the test sites will be plowed into the soil at the termination of the testing. Following review of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation application and any comments received in response to this Notice, EPA will decide whether or not an Experimental Use Permit is required. Dated: July 15, 1994. Lois Rossi, Acting Director, Registration Division, Office of Pesticide Programs. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;18228 Filed 7&hyph;26&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;F
