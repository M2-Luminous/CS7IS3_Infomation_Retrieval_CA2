FR940128-2-00180 FR940128-2-00117 The alternatives considered in the preparation of the EA were (1) the ``No Purchase'' alternative and (2) to continue as proposed. Choosing the ``No Purchase'' alternative would require the continued operation of the Detroit Job Corps Center under the present inadequate poor conditions. The potential for an enhanced facility and improved operational efficiency afforded by the proposed action indicates that the proposed purchase and improvement of the center is the preferred alternative. The proposed use has no significant impact on any natural systems or resources. The existing site and buildings at the proposed Job Corps Center location are not designated as ``historically significant'' and no areas of archaeological significance are present. The activities of the proposed Job Corps Center are not of a contaminant generating nature. The geologic, water, and climatic characteristics of the general vicinity of the site, coupled with the historically known land use, minimizes the site's potential to be contaminated from possible off-site sources and further minimizes the impact of contamination. The migration of any contamination that may have occurred through past activities at the site is likewise minimized, due to impervious soils and deeply located ground water. No significant levels of radon exist on the site. Water samples, taken from drinking fountains within the buildings on the site have been analyzed for lead content and were found to be well below EPA recommended limits. An asbestos assessment was performed on the existing facility with subsequent containment and removal of asbestos-containing materials. Some on-going repairs of past containment efforts are required. Analysis of composite paint chip samples made during the investigation for the EA indicated the presence of lead at levels that would require removal of the lead-based paint, if construction activities would disturb this material. This is common for structures constructed prior to 1980. Procedures for the containment and removal of lead, if deemed necessary, will be prepared by a qualified lead-abatement contractor and will be properly managed during any future construction activities. The abandoned on-site underground storage tank and underground tunnel on Parcel B may require additional investigation. These items are addressed in the EA. Existing environmental concerns (e.g., air quality issues resulting from the improperly controlled and monitored medical waste incinerator, lens-process waste effluent discharge into sanitary sewer by the optical laboratory, management of hazardous materials, etc.) created by the operations of the current facilities on parcel C, although not a significant impact on the proposed activities, would become moot through a change of operations and activities at the proposed Job Corps Center. Noise levels generated from air conditioning and other equipment at the existing facilities are consistent with City of Detroit regulations. Short-term impact from additional noise will occur during the construction activities; however, construction activities will be limited to the hours of 7 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. The use of sound control devices and muffled exhausts on all noise-generating construction equipment will be required. The use of appropriate techniques to minimize construction dust emissions will mitigate construction-related air pollution concerns. Any noise generated by the completed facility is expected to remain within allowable noise limits and will not adversely impact neighboring properties. The existing site and security lighting consists of facility-owned and maintained building-mounted, photocell-controlled, high-intensity discharge (HID) luminaries and utility company-owned and maintained pole-mounted, photocell-controlled HID luminaries located along the streets and in the parking areas. This proposed project will bring the exterior lighting conditions into compliance with City lighting ordinances. Water is available to the site through municipal lines. Storm water run-off and sanitary wastes are accommodated by discharge to municipal sewers. Based on the nature of the proposed construction activities at the site, storm water quality will not be degraded. Detroit has an abundance of water, electrical power, and natural gas to easily serve facilities of this size and substantially larger. Although the proposed project will cause an increase in traffic in the community, the increase in traffic value is not expected to adversely affect traffic flow on neighborhood streets. A neighborhood city hall and post office are located in close proximity to the site. Several emergency response companies service the area. Police and fire stations are closely located near the subject property. Several major and world known hospitals are within a five-mile radius of the subject site. Several bus routes offer readily available transportation to and through the subject area at a reasonable cost. Four of Detroit's six Interstate Highways are within a five-mile radius of the subject site and allow fast and easy access throughout the Detroit area. The surrounding community, with its markedly diverse ethnicity, offers adequate recreational, educational and cultural opportunities for the students. The implementation of the Job Corps on the proposed site will provide jobs for vicinity residents and could add stability to the area. Based on the information gathered during the preparation of the EA for the Department of Labor, Employment and Training Administration, the Office of Job Corps finds that the relocation of the Detroit Job Corps Center to the 1800 Tuxedo area location in Detroit, will not cause any significant impact on the environment and, therefore, recommends that the project continue as proposed. This proposed action is not considered to be highly controversial.

Dated at Washington, DC, this 24th day of January, 1994. Peter E. Rell, Director of Job Corps. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;1913 Filed 1&hyph;27&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4510&hyph;30&hyph;M
