FR941021-0-00165 FR941021-0-00022 93. If it becomes necessary to employ competitive bidding procedures to award Big LEO licenses, we will conduct a single simultaneous multiple round auction to award licenses in those 2.065 MHz bands for which two or more applications have been filed. 107 Each of the characteristics that lead to selection of this auction design are present here. We expect that there will be a high degree of interdependence in the values of Big LEO licenses. Licenses may be interdependent either because they are substitutes or because they are worth more as part of a package than individually. We would expect there to be some substitutability among these licenses. There may be important ways in which they might be complements as well. Though all will be nationwide licenses, a single entity will be able to aggregate up to four licenses. It is reasonable to assume that the value that a bidder places on one license will to at least some degree depend upon whether it will be able to acquire other licenses. We also expect that the value of Big LEO licenses will be high relative to the costs of conducting a simultaneous multiple round auction, in part because as the Commission gains experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions, the costs associated with implementing them may fall. 107 See para. 73, supra. 94. Procedural, Payment and Penalty Issues. Through our July 1994 auction of nationwide licenses to provide Personal Communications Services in the 900 MHz band (narrowband PCS), we have gained some experience with simultaneous multiple round auctions. It appears that the rules we adopted concerning the procedures to be used in conducting auctions, the schedule for payment for licenses, and the penalties to be paid for bid withdrawal, default or disqualification, have worked well. 108 In the event that it becomes necessary to employ competitive bidding in Big LEO licensing, we will conduct auctions as specified under those rules. If such an auction is required, we will issue a Public Notice explaining further the administrative details of the auction, but we generally expect the auction will be conducted similarly to the nationwide narrowband PCS auction. 108 See Sections 1.2104&hyph;1.2109 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.2104&hyph;1.2109. 95. In order to reduce the risk of defaults and to ensure that the Commission has a ready source of funds to satisfy any bid withdrawal or default penalties, we will impose a requirement that, to be qualified to participate in the Big LEO auction, applicants must submit an upfront payment to the Commission prior to the auction. 109 Consistent with our auction rules for Personal Communications Services, we have decided to set the upfront payment at approximately two cents per MHz of spectrum per person residing in the proposed service area ($0.02 per MHz-pop). 110 Because Big LEO systems must be able to provide service to all areas of the fifty states, $0.02 per MHz-pop would amount to approximately $10 million per 2.0625 MHz segment. 111 For simplicity, we will round this to the nearest million, and require an upfront payment of $10 million. 109 The upfront payment will be fully refunded to unsuccessful bidders who are not subject to bid withdrawal or default penalties. 110 See Implementation of Section 309(j), note 79, supra, at para. 169 and 47 CFR 1.2106. 111 I.e., .02 × 2.0625 × [U.S. pop.] 96. Resale, aggregation and disaggregation. Aside from imposing the 8.25 MHz cap on aggregation, we will not restrict auction winners from reselling 1.6 GHz band spectrum-rights. They would be free not only to resell 2.065 MHz segments but also to reassign any smaller portion of 1.6 GHz band spectrum. Affording such flexibility enhances beneficial incentives. 112 Although we do not think that such post-auction transactions would be likely to entail unjust enrichment, 113 applications for consent to assignment of Big LEO spectrum authorizations obtained by auction will be subject to the disclosure and close-scrutiny policies delineated in the Second Report and Order in the auction rulemaking. 114 112 Of course, parties to such transactions must comply with 47 U.S.C. 310(d) by filing applications for consent to assignment. 113 See Implementation of Section 309(j), note 79, supra, at paras. 211&hyph;12. 114 Id. at para. 214. 97. Assignment of 2.4 GHz band. As previously noted, all auction winners will be authorized to operate over the entire 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band, with the stipulation that operation in that band must be in the CDMA mode and must be used for downlink transmissions. B. Interservice Sharing 98. In the Notice, we recognized that Big LEO systems will be required to share the 1.6/2.4 GHz and adjacent frequency bands with a number of existing services. In the 1.6 GHz range, the 1610&hyph;1626.5 MHz band is allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation service (ARNS) on a co-primary basis, and a segment of the band, at 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz, is allocated to the radioastronomy service (RAS) on a co-primary basis. In the 2.4 GHz range, the 2483.5&hyph;2500 MHz band is allocated for co-primary use by the broadcast auxiliary service, by the terrestrial fixed-service and by industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) operations. Adjacent bands are allocated to the aeronautical radionavigation satellite service, the instructional television fixed service (ITFS) and the multi-channel multi-point distribution service (MMDS). 99. The Negotiated Rulemaking Committee was comprised of Big LEO applicants and representatives of most parties potentially affected by Big LEO services, and analyzed extensively interservice sharing at 1.6/2.4 GHz. We used the Committee's recommendations as the primary basis the proposals in our Notice. We sought comment on those proposals as well as those areas where a representative of an affected interest did not participate in the Committee, or where the Committee could not reach a consensus on an interservice sharing issue. 1. Radio Astronomy Service 100. As noted above, the 1610.6&hyph;1613.8 MHz frequency band is allocated to the RAS on a co-primary basis. 115 RAS operations involve the reception of radio waves of cosmic origin, 116 and are responsible for amassing a substantial portion of information about the universe that has been acquired in the last sixty years. Because the RAS involves only radio reception, it cannot interfere with other services operating in the same frequency band. However, it can receive harmful interference from other services. As a co-primary service, the RAS is entitled to protection from harmful interference. Ensuring this protection is complicated by the nature of cosmic radiation emissions, which are similar to random noise emissions and have extremely low power flux density levels at the Earth. Further, there is a potential for both in-band and out-of-band interference. 117 115 The 4990&hyph;5000 MHz band is also allocated to the RAS on a primary basis. Second harmonic spurious emissions from 2.4 GHz MSS operations could cause interference of RAS in that band. See paras. 120&hyph;121, infra. 116 See International Radio Regulations 55 and 14. 117 An out-of-band emission is radio frequency energy, located on a frequency or frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth, that result from the modulation process. This does not include spurious emissions, which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of information. See 47 CFR 2.1.
