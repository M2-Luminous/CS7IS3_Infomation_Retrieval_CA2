FR940722-2-00062 FR940722-2-00040 ASTHRA is an organization functioning under the umbrella of ASTHO and is composed of State health professionals involved in health risk assessment. ASTHRA promotes information exchange between State level scientists and other professionals who are responsible for environmental health risk assessments. States have varying capacity to meet the demand for either developmental or sophisticated risk assessment. Improved information exchange, technology transfer, and increased training opportunities will enhance the capacity of State health agencies to respond to the demand for environmental services, information, and risk assessment. Therefore, a structure to improve the partnership between ASTHO, ASTHRA, and ATSDR is essential. ASTHO has advised ATSDR that the ASTHRA membership is the target audience to reach in supporting the continued development of ASTHO's health risk assessment component. In 1993 through the cooperative agreement, ASTHO conducted six risk communication workshops. It is anticipated that ASTHRA will continue these activities.
