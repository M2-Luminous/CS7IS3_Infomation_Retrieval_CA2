There will be eight cantons in the Federation: (Hum)-Sana, Posavina, Tuzla-[word indistinct], Zenica-Doboj, Gorazde, (?Upper) Drina, Central Bosnian, and (?Central Herzegovina). After the agreement was reached, we asked Prime Minister Dr. Haris Silajdzic to tell the listeners and viewers of Radio and Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina all that has been agreed and to assess the importance of the agreement reached. [Silajdzic] The agreement reached is, so far, the most serious step toward reaching the final peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in preserving the integrity and sovereignty of the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The solutions endorsed are the most important concrete step in implementing the Washington agreement, the current Washington agreement and [word indistinct] the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. These solutons, that is, we [words indistinct] the question of establishing cantonal borders are maximally democratic, they enable a full national equality, economic appropriateness, a respect for [word indistinct], logical, and [words indistinct]. In a (?concrete way), these solutions should bring back confidence between the two peoples and ensure a new quality [word indistinct] in which [words indistinct] all those people will be eliminated who want (?dispute) and who do not wish the joint life of Bosniaks and Croats, as well as those who [words indistinct] Serbs and others who feel [words indistinct]. These solutions, in a way, go beyond the Costitution as they offer parity decision-making in two cantons, which is a higher level of democratic solution, something that proves there is a readiness to really build [words indistinct]. The Croatian and Bosniak peoples and all the people who feel Bosnia-Herzegovina is their own republic will certainly receive this agreement with relief and delight. It has been left to us to participate in the implementation of this agreement together. This is a difficult, very difficult, and very responsible task. I hope that we shall, all together, once again, prove that we can overcome this [word indistinct]. [Hodzic] Mr. Silajdzic, what has been agreed about the government [words indistinct]? [Silajdzic] It will be proposed to the Constitutional Assembly that the first (?president) of the Federation (?in the transient period) should be a candidate from the Croatian people and in the same period, the (?vice president) of the Federation is from the Bosniak people. Thus, when the six-month period expires, the duty of the president will be performed by a member of the Bosniak people and the duty of (?vice president) by a member of the Croatian people. The first president of the Federation after the transitory period will be elected from the ranks of the Bosniak people. At the government reshuffle, it will be ensured that the duty of the prime minister is taken by a member of the Bosniak people and the duty of deputy prime minister by a member of the Croatian people. The deputy prime minister will head the Ministry of (?Defense). Amendments to the Law on the Government of the Federation have been proposed, so that the Government of the Federation is composed of the prime minister, the deputy prime minister, 17 ministers, and four ministers without portfolio. Ministers from the Bosniak people will be heading the following (?ministries): the Ministry for Energy, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of [words indistinct], the Ministry of (?Zoning), the Ministry for Refugees, the Ministry of Police, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Culture. Ministers from the Croatian people will be heading the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Finances, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of [word indistinct], and the Ministry of [word indistinct]. Of four ministers without portfolio, one will be a member of the Croatian people. The territory of the Federation has been established on the basis of jointly adopted criteria. After four days of work, this agreement has been (?reached). [words indistinct] has also been [words indistinct] with special administration: the Central-Bosnian and (?Neretva) [words indistinct]. Thus, amendments to the Constitution of the Federation will be made in conformity with the [word indistinct], so that in conformity with the (?solution) about the Federation, these cantons ensure the (?independence) of the peoples in the Federation. [Hodzic] Prime minister, please tell us at the end what (?has been left) to do after this Vienna agreement, so that the (?Federation) [words indistinct]? [Silajdzic] We have already ageed to sign this agreement on Saturday [14 May], to [word indistinct] and [words indistinct]. [Hodzic] There is one more piece of information from Vienna: The agreed documents will be signed in Geneva on Saturday. This was Amir Hodzic reporting from Vienna for the Radio-Television of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
