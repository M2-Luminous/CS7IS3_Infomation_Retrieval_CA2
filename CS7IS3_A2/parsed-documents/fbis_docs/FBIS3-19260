Wei Jingsheng is only a "criminal who has been released on probation," the government spokesman said during a visit to China by the U.S. secretary of state. The disgust about such lies is part of the routine of foreign observers of China. On the other hand, arrests at night, threats, and long prison terms for some of them are "routine" for China's small group of dissidents, who are, however, becoming more active again. One became all the more conscious of that during Christopher's visit. Before, during, and after his visit there have been arrests, sentences, and torture in China. If human rights were a topic like any other, Beijing would have won on points with its rebuff of Washington. The U.S. Administration must accept the accusation of once again having weakened its pressure concerning human rights with "mixed signals": While Christopher is talking about human rights, a high-ranking U.S. military officer is in China to negotiate about "military cooperation." However, human rights are too serious an issue to leave them solely to the diplomats. Courageous Chinese, human rights organizations, "criminals released on probation," and others will have to continue their struggle for human rights also after the spectacle involving the extension of the most-favored-nation clause. This time, if at all, Beijing will be released only "on probation."
