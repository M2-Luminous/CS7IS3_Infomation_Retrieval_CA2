Both nicotine and cotinine are tobacco-specific. Cotinine in saliva, blood, and urine is the most widely accepted biomarker for integrated exposure to both active smoking and ETS by virtue of its longer half-life than nicotine in body fluids. The half-life of cotinine in nonsmokers is of the order of a day, making it a good indicator of integrated ETS exposure over the previous day or two [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Although intersubject variability exists for both nicotine absorption and cotinine metabolism [Exs. 4&hyph;156, 4&hyph;162], cotinine is a good indicator that ETS exposure has taken place [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. Further, studies show that cotinine levels correlate with levels of recent ETS exposure [Ex. 4&hyph;311]. In summary, nonsmokers' exposure to ETS has been characterized by a database of widely used atmospheric and biological markers which have been measured in a number of workplaces, such as offices, restaurants, commercial buildings, and on trains and in planes. OSHA believes that this database is sufficient to support the risk assessment which follows. ETS-nicotine exposures of the average worker appear to be of the order of 5 to 10 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), and for the most-exposed workers, 50 to 100 μg/m3). For ETS-RSP, exposures are about tenfold that of the nicotine levels. The concentrations of various ETS atmospheric markers to which nonsmokers are exposed in the workplace, such as nicotine, respirable suspended particulate matter (RSP) and carbon monoxide, are linearly correlated with the amount of tobacco burned. Studies of human activity patterns show that the workplace is the largest single contributor to ETS exposure. Air exchange rates in nonindustrial workplaces are not designed to control the risks of ETS exposure. (f) Inadequacy of General Dilution Ventilation to Address Environmental Tobacco Smoke Exposure Control. A primary function of heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is to circulate air throughout a building to achieve thermal and sensory comfort for the building occupants. The general ventilation function of the HVAC system is to dilute and remove occupant generated bioeffluents and other contaminants from the space. However, from the industrial hygiene perspective, general ventilation as delivered by a HVAC system, is not an acceptable engineering control measure for controlling occupational exposures to ETS.
