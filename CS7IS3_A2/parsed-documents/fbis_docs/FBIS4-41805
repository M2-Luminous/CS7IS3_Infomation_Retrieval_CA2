Yevgeniy Saburov outlined the current socioeconomic situation on the peninsula: plants sitting idle, most of the workers being paid meager wages, the average salary reaching no more than 200,000 karbovantsi. There are no efficient leverages for managing and regulating the economy -- the tax and statistics services did not receive financial aid from official Kiev; neither did the Republic's economy in general. The last hope is placed on the creation of a favorable climate for investments in the Crimea and firm guarantees for entrepreneurship in the sphere of financial and credit policies. "The fewer the reforms there are in Ukraine, the more separatist the sentiments there are in the Crimea," the deputy prime minister summed up. Saburov sees no obstacles for developing political relations with the official Kiev, and would like to see constructive and balanced approaches to resolving problems. "We have no fear of any possible confrontation," he declared. "There is nothing to fear when the people are on the brink of utmost destitution and half-starved subsistence." Asked by our correspondent about his attitude toward Kravchuk's statement that the foundation for the market economy has already been laid in Ukraine, Saburov snapped: "Maybe. But where? Show me the place. In the basement? Those who did not go down there will never learn about it." As for the statement by Ukrainian legislative speaker Oleksandr Moroz that if elected president, he would do his best to protect people from misimplemented market reforms, Saburov commented as follows: "That statement does not explain whom he had in mind. To protect against whom? Against the state policies that have nothing to do with market reforms or against state regulation of the market economy? The latter is promised in his election platform." Whatever the case, Saburov said, we are ready for cooperation. The fact that in spite of his busy schedule, Saburov devoted almost an hour and a half to talks with presidential candidate Volodymyr Lanovyy shows that the head of the Crimean Government has made his choice.
