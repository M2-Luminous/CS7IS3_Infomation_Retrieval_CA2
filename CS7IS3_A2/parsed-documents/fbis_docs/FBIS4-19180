Albanian President Sali Berisha's government today tried to worsen Greek-Albanian relations claiming that shots were fired between Greek and Albanian soldiers at the Episkopi guardpost near the Greek-Albanian border. Defense Ministry sources believe the minor incident is another Albanian provocation that aims to intensify tension in bilateral relations. Defense Ministry officials stressed that Greece is following the situation on the Greek-Albanian border coolly and carefully. The groups of the 8th Corps are highly vigilant, according to the measures that are in effect. Tirana yesterday announced the deportation of Greek Consul in Gjirokaster Khristos Iakovou, forcing the Greek Government to expel the Albanian Embassy's first secretary in Athens. A Foreign Ministry statement stresses that the Greek Government regrets these developments for which the Albanian side is entirely responsible, adding that Albania is trying to use the recent incident on its territory involving unidentified elements to create tension on an international level. A short time ago, the Albanian Foreign Ministry announced that it is recalling Albanian Ambassador in Athens Hysen Cabej for consultations. Lieutenant Colonel Kalantzandonakis, the Armed Forces General Staff press spokesman, today said there is a high level of vigilance on the Greek-Albanian border. He added that this is not because of the recent incidents but the problem of illegal immigrants. Asked to comment on the escalating tension in Greek-Albanian relations, government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said the Greek Government is following, coolly and carefully, the escalating tension in relations with Albania. Our country's firm policy is to improve Greek-Albanian relations, Albania's development, and its securing an economic, institutionalized, and cultural atmosphere. The spokesman said that in a letter from Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias to his Albanian counterpart, the Greek Government says it wants the tension to be reduced. Venizelos said there was no reply to the letter. Foreign Ministry Secretary General Khristos Zakharakis will send a letter to the United Nations replying to Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi's claims. Foreign Ministry Permanent Secretary Pavlos Apostolidhis summoned the ambassadors of the UN Security Council permanent members and briefed them. The heads of Greek Embassies abroad will brief the governments of the countries to which they are accredited. Referring to the latest incident on the Greek-Albanian border, Venizelos said the government only has press reports on it. He noted that the Greek Government has no evidence or information to support that a Greek group left Greek territory to cause incidents. The spokesman concluded by saying that for reasons of goodwill, the government suggested to the Albanian Government that the Greek and Albanian authorities cooperate.
