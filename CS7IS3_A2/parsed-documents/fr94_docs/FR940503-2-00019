FR940503-2-00019 FR940503-2-00016 For report-based options in live hogs, the underlying futures contract will be the second-nearest futures contract to delivery. For example, the underlying futures contract for a report-based option that is listed in March in connection with the release of the March Hogs and Pigs report would be the June futures contract month. Similarly, the underlying futures contracts for the other report-based options to be listed during the calendar year are: the August futures contract month for the option listed during June; the December futures contract month for the option listed in September; and the April futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially, and thereafter maintain, put and call live hogs report-based options with strike prices at one-cent intervals in a range of six-cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and at two-cent intervals in a range 10 cents above and below the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract. The underlying futures contract months for pork bellies report-based options are: the May futures contract month for the option listed in March; the August futures contract month for the option listed in June; the February futures contract month for the option listed in September; and the March futures contract month for the option listed in December. The CME shall list initially and maintain pork bellies report-based put and call options at eleven strike prices listed in two-cent intervals, including the strike price that is nearest the previous day's settlement price of the underlying futures contract, and the next five higher, and the next five lower strike prices. The proposed amendments will continue to specify the listing of the ``regular cycle'' of option contract months and the listing of strike prices for such months in the same manner as provided for in the contracts' existing terms. In support of the proposed amendments, the CME states the following: Options on futures allow hedgers to shield themselves from the adverse impact of a [``Hogs and Pigs''] report while retaining much of the ability to benefit from a favorable market response. However, for hedgers using options on the more distant contract months, the high cost of buying an option_due to the large time value component of the option premium_can outweigh the benefits of protection from an unfavorable market reaction. As a result, many potential hedgers are effectively priced out of the option market. Short-dated options would address this problem. Since these options would be traded for such a short time, the time value component of the option premium would be negligible, and therefore the total premium would be substantially less than for a traditional long-dated option, all other things being the same. This would make short-dated options an attractive risk-management tool for hedgers who require protection around the release of these critical reports, and particularly those whose usage of options is currently limited due to the cost of the premium. Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at the Office of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the above address. Copies of the amended terms and conditions can be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the same address or by telephone at (202) 254&hyph;6314. The materials submitted by the CME in support of the proposed amendments may be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR part 145 (1987)). Requests for copies of such materials should be made to the FOI, Privacy and Sunshine Act Compliance Staff of the Office of the Secretariat at the above address in accordance with CFR 145.7 and 145.8. Any person interested in submitting written data, views, or arguments on the proposed amendments should send such comments to Jean A. Webb, Secretary, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, at the above address by the specified date. Issued in Washington, DC on April 26, 1994.
