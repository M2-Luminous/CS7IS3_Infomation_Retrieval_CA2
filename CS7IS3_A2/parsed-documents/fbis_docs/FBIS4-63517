The meeting established Crimea's shadow parliament, the Civic Council of Crimea. The parliament is elected from 66 constituencies according to the majoritarian system: groups of citizens who support Ukraine's statehood and territorial integrity nominate candidates from parties of the same political stand. It is planned that the parliament will have 98 seats divided between parties. The following parties will nominate candidates to the parliament: the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian Republican Party, the Democratic Party of Ukraine, the Crimean branch of the People's Movement of Ukraine [Rukh], the All-Crimean Prosvita Society, the Society of Teachers and Educators, the Crimean branch of the Ukrainian National Assembly, the Ukrainian Civic Congress of Crimea, the Vasyl Stus Memorial Society, and the Organization of the Crimean-Tatar National Movement. The newly established parliament, the meeting said, is not pro-Ukrainian by nature. It is a multiethnic parliament that supports Ukrainian statehood. According to the approved program documents, the Civic Council of Crimea is a representative body of Crimean residents who regard themselves as citizens of Ukraine and do not recognize independent Crimean statehood. The participants of the meeting approved the principles according to which the shadow parliament is formed. The parliament aims to help the deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments work out legislation, conduct expert appraisal of Crimean laws, and their accordance with the Ukrainian constitution.
