So I am in contact with those Rwandan authorities who are trying to manage this tragic and critical situation into which we were plunged on 6 April. Obviously, the latest news is that fighting continues, notably in Kigali but also at the northern front -- the border with Uganda. The so-called Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], I must state, is supported by foreign powers, notably Uganda, which supplies it with equipment and which gives it logistical support. Apart from Uganda's involvement in the war, other powers also are involved in this war, and I am not scared of citing Belgium in this regard. We have all the evidence now to declare this without any conjecture, as Belgian soldiers shot down the Rwandan presidential plane on that fatal night of 6 April. Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission in Rwandan -- they belonged to the United Nations Assistance Mission to Rwanda [UNAMIR] -- three Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission shot down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. First they shot a missile that missed the target; the second missile slightly touched the aircraft; and the third, unfortunately, hit its target. The aircraft exploded, and this resulted in an incredible catastrophe that nobody could have imagined. Therefore, certain Belgians elements were involved. [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, this is a very serious accusation. What reasons could have prompted the Belgians to support the RPF? [Sengegera] The motives of the Belgians or, to be more precise, of certain Belgians? You will have to ask these people themselves. But the fact is that I am not leveling an accusation -- I am only making an observation. This is because it was Belgians -- three UNAMIR Belgian soldiers -- who shot down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. We do not know their motives or interests -- you would have to ask those persons themselves -- but we are now convinced that behind the war that the RPF is imposing on Rwanda to seize power by force, are certain Belgian circles that are involved for reasons unknown to us. We might also make a geostrategic analysis of the war, saying that Rwanda probably is not the only country that has been targeted. So, you might as well question the Belgians as to what the rebels' motives are. Everybody knows that the rebels are not interested in the democratization of Rwanda. They are interested in taking power by force. [Matulu] What prompts you to think that it is the Belgians and the Ugandans who are behind the rebels? [Sengegera] The case of Uganda has been proven, because the attack on Rwanda on 1 October 1990 was perpetrated by elements who illegally came from the Army of President Museveni. They attacked us with full logistical support from the Ugandan Army. Subsequent attacks were supported by Uganda, sometimes with the direct intervention of Ugandan soldiers, which seems to be the present case in this current phase of the war. Concerning the Belgians, we note the shift in their policy towards Rwanda, to the point of undertaking this shameful and ignominious plot against the heads of state -- against President Habyrarimana and his Burundian counterpart. There may be other interested parties in the plot who we have not discovered, but certain Belgians -- I repeat certain Belgians -- are involved in the current war imposed on Rwanda. I would also like to stress that in the current clashes in Kigali there have been found in certain localities the dead bodies of some white foreign nationals who were killed as they fought alongside the RPF. [Matulu] Yes, but tell me, why do you maintain that it is the Belgians who shot down the plane, especially three Belgian soldiers? And what evidence have you to substantiate this? [Sengegera] The evidence? First there is the place from which the missiles were shot. [Matulu] From where were the missiles shot? [Sengegera] They were shot from near the Kanombe Airport, from a place called Massaka, near Kanombe Airport. So, we spotted where the shots came from, and I can even confirm that the three were immediately arrested by UNAMIR police and collected by the Rwandan Army. Another fact: Security at Kanombe International Airport in Kigali was ensured by the Belgian contingent, in line with the UNAMIR peace mission. So, you see, at this level there was a lot of complicity. I am also telling you that at the landing strip the pilot of the presidential plane was told to fly around twice because -- I don't know -- the plot was probably still being prepared, but the pilot thought that this was for technical reasons, whereas it was for other sinister designs. [Matulu] Are the three Belgians soldiers who were arrested still alive? [Sengegera] They were immediately shot dead by the angry Rwandan soldiers. [Matulu] So, you are saying that they were among the 10 Belgian UN peacekeepers who were killed a few minutes after the assassination -- to repeat your own words -- of the two presidents. [Sengegera] Indeed, the three were among the dozen Belgian soldiers killed in Kigali during this outburst of violence. It seems, I repeat seems, that Belgium organized special funeral rights for three soldiers last week, and I think that it was these three soldiers who carried out the attack on Presidents Habyarimana and Ntaryamira. [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, according to reports, Belgium is said to have sold arms to the RPF. As the legal representative of the Rwandan Government, do you have this same information? [Sengegera] I have received the same information, but have not been able to verify it myself because really it is not this piece of information that interests me, as far as my work is concerned. However, it seems the RPF has bought huge quantities of military equipment from Belgium on credit. This might probably explain a certain attitude by Belgium, which considers that if the RPF does not come into power, we will be done for, if you excuse me the expression, so, we cannot be paid back. This may partially explain what has been done. But, as I said, there are probably other objectives that are not directed just at Rwanda, as far as the attitude and position of the Belgians are concerned. There is also another point that does not surprise us. You know, Belgium has just withdrawn its contingent from the UNAMIR mission, but the Belgians at first strongly insisted that they should be supported on the ground with armor, helicopters, and a huge deployment of forces. Kigali airport was in their hands and functioning. One wonders whether this evacuation plan by land toward Tanzania was not to serve as a support operation for the RPF. But obviously, the Rwandan Government, which was conscious of the danger, strongly opposed this. They left by air as it happened, because we thought the worst might happen. Perhaps the Belgians were even planning a scenario that is not [word indistinct] from the earlier one -- cut the (Rufumo) Bridge, which links us with Tanzania and which has since October 1990 virtually been the only land route for international trade exchanges for Rwanda and Zaire. [passage omitted] [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, we have this information -- which is not a rumor -- that the Belgians are sympathetic to the RPF and that this led the Belgians to facilitate the infiltration of RPF soldiers into Kigali, the Rwandan capital? Can you confirm this? [Sengegera] Yes I can confirm this. There are many Belgians who are married to Rwandans, and this may sometimes explain this sympathetic attitude on the part of the Belgians. Apart from this, I would like to recall that it was agreed under the Arusha Accord that the RPF was authorized to station a contingent of 600 soldiers in Kigali on the premises of the parliament in Kigali. These fighters were supposedly in Rwanda in line with the mission to protect and ensure the security of the RPF political leaders who were to participate in the transition, in both the new government and in parliament. But we realized that in fact this battalion was getting bigger and bigger due to infiltrations facilitated by the Belgian contingent of the UNAMIR. They sent convoys to their headquarters in the north of the country near the Ugandan border in Mulindi, supposedly to get wood supplies, but in fact they brought back artillery -- or rather soldiers -- who were infiltrated into Kigali. This occurred to the extent that certain sources reported that the RPF did not have 600 fighters in Kigali, but instead more like 3,000 soldiers. [passage omitted] [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, it seems that on the ground -- I do not know if you have some information on this -- the RPF has the upper hand? [Sengegera] That is just media publicity. I think that this is misinformation to try and demoralize people. This situation is different from the presentations in the Western media, notably with all the noise and manipulations orchestrated by certain Western journalists who favor the RPF. The situation is quite different on the ground. The RPF does not control.... [pauses] Sometimes, we were even told that the RPF had managed to bring down 20,000 soldiers to join their battalion in the capital. That is not true. The RPF only controls one strategic position in Kigali. We have dislodged them from all the major positions which they were able to occupy. Of course, the situation is constantly changing, but as we speak now the Rwandan Armed Forces control the situation both in Kigali and in the north of the country near the Ugandan border. [Matulu] Well, Mr. Ambassador, Tanzanian President Ali Hassan Mwinyi has just offered to mediate between the interim government and the RPF. How do you view prospects for this mediation? [Sengegera] The Rwandan authorities will accept any arrangements which might contribute to the restoration of peace in Rwanda. It is in this context that they are prepared to consider whether the proposal made by the Tanzanian leader will succeed. We can also think of other political and more consistent interventions, notably through the Economic Community of Great Lakes Countries. The doors are open, but I would like to point out that concerning efforts for a cease-fire, the RPF has adopted the strategy of bidding higher every day, even refusing cease-fire proposals made by UNAMIR. We, the Rwandan authorities, are open to dialogue which would lead to the return of peace in Rwanda and the restoration of a true climate of peace. So, the Tanzanian offer is welcome in that context without excluding other possible mediation offers, which could be made at other levels by the true friends of Rwanda. [Matulu, interrupting] Thank you. One last question, please. [Sengegera, interrupting] Concerning efforts to pacify the country, I would like to stress that one of the cardinal missions assigned to the interim government is to ensure -- after this unfortunate criminal plot which decapitated our country and the resulted in the tragic death of Prime Minister Uwilingiyimana -- a return to peace in Rwanda. A government has been formed and the president of the Republic assumed office in line with the June 1991 Rwandan Constitution, which legalized multiparty politics in our country. The interim government has six weeks to work for peace in Rwanda, but of course we cannot make the peace by ourselves. We will try to make peace with those who are at war with us, and who are fighting with the support of Uganda and other foreign powers.
