Angeloz added that the economic plan "has started breaking the pillars sustaining it." "When you start setting strict guidelines limiting productive activities or people's activities things start to break down. People start complaining and you start seeing the possibility of unrest in many towns and provinces," the governor said. Angeloz said he is not pointing his arrows directly at Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo. The governor believes Cavallo "cannot feel he owns the country. He cannot dictate rules for others simply to follow or be placed on lists under definitions only he makes." The governor said the main causes of discontent that might result in "social upheavals" are produced mainly by "the growing trade balance deficit, the transfer to the nation of bankrupted education centers and health systems, and the national government's indifference to producer needs." "People perceive that their personal situation is not improving, that the country is not growing, and notice that the social security system has very big holes," Angeloz insisted. Angeloz protested because the provinces now must administer their education and health systems "without resources," a situation that is aggravated "because now the provinces get 44 percent and the nation 56 percent of the 4 billion pesos of federal income sharing, a situation that is just the opposite of the situation we had before." Angeloz expressed doubts that former President Alfonsin had said that the Radical Party [Radical Civic Union, UCR] will lose the 1995 election, but just in case he made clear that he does not share that belief, stressing: "Those who leave the battlefield, those who do not fight, are leaving an empty space that others will occupy." "This will not happen to the UCR. We will fight in all areas to transform the party and create a government alternative," Angeloz promised. He made these remarks during the program "Two Voices" that is broadcast on cable television.
