They do not share the culture of dialogue and consensus. Others conceive of unity as a "straitjacket" to prevent renewal; they are mired in the past, having turned into pillars of salt. Neither concept is acceptable. Both seek the destruction of Sandinism and any other group, as is happening with the former UNO. This dichotomy must disappear and give way to a sincere, dialectic, and transparent relationship based on the founding element, on new and 100-percent democratic bylaws, and, above all, on observance of these bylaws. The founding element that unites us all is the historic legacy of Sandino, an element that belongs to all Nicaraguans, not just Sandinists. This historic Sandinist legacy leads us to the ongoing civic struggle for the "effective democracy with social justice" that Sandino dreamed of. The new program that the Special Congress will pass must interpret and update Sandino's dream. Today I will attempt to outline some basic ideas for the new democratic structure that could be embodied in the new bylaws if the Sandinist people and the Special Congress reach a consensus on them. The Current Congress, Out of Step The first issue that arises can be seen in the major question that Erick Aguirre posed in EL SEMANARIO: "A new Congress in an old bottle?" We all know that the current Congress is out of step and that some of its members are not involved in politics. Is this Congress capable of undertaking sweeping renewal? Wouldn't it be better if the Sandinist Assembly passed the new bylaws provisionally so that they could ultimately be passed, rejected, or amended by the Special Congress? If this were possible, all of its structures could be completely renovated, from top to bottom, in accordance with the provisional bylaws. If the feeling is that legally this cannot be done or that there is not enough time to do so, then the new national authorities that are chosen at the Special Congress should serve only during a transition period ending at the Regular Congress of 1995. I raise this possibility for debate at the Sandinist grass roots. Now then, what do I think are the basic ideas for achieving democratic renewal amid unity through the bylaws and through the election of national authorities? Suggestions 1. A transparent, fair electoral process in which all Sandinists take part and in which it is impossible to hand-pick representatives must be guaranteed. The elections must be public and held in jurisdictions of appropriate size: in small municipalities and in districts in large municipalities. District and municipal authorities, Departmental Congresses, and the National Congress must be chosen at this election. There ought to be overseers for the slates of candidates. Elections by "clubs" or "covens" must not be allowed. Small groups must not be able to usurp representation of the entire Sandinist people in a district or municipality. If we were able to hold the freest general elections in the history of our country and of all Latin America, the ones on 25 February 1990, why can't we hold such elections among ourselves? 2. In order to achieve a more balanced representation of differing views across the various segments of society, besides within territories, it would be politically prudent to elect the representatives to the Congress as follows: half directly in the districts and municipalities and the other half in Departmental Congresses. Rank and file leaders would tend to be chosen at the former, and national political, social, economic, and cultural leaders at the latter. The Congress would thus represent all segments and viewpoints of the Sandinist people. 3. Since the National Leadership has already played its historic role effectively, in keeping with a period of history other than the present and while exercising predominant influence, the bylaws must establish a new collective and democratic political leadership in the form of two complementary bodies. 3.1. The Sandinist Assembly, as the delegate body of the Congress and, therefore, as the highest authority while the Congress is in recess, would consist of 125 members, plus the departmental political secretaries, broken down as follows: 100 members directly elected as such by the Congress and the 25 members of the Sandinist National Council. The Sandinist Assembly would be chaired by its own, annually elected Board and would hold regular sessions every four months and special sessions when a third of its members so request or when an absolute majority of the members of the Sandinist National Council so resolve. 3.2. The Sandinist National Council would be the executive body and would consist of 25 members elected by the Congress. It would meet once a month in regular session and would be chaired by its Standing Committee, elected from among its members and made up of seven national secretaries with specific functions. It could hold regular sessions weekly and would submit monthly reports on its activities to the Sandinist National Council, which would in turn be answerable to the Sandinist Assembly. 4. It would be strongly advisable from a political standpoint to establish a proportional system for electing the two highest party authorities in the Congress. The various schools of thought within the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] would thus be functionally integrated. I can find no other system that insures true, not rhetorical unity based on genuine democratic renewal. Exclusionary, hegemonic systems that lead to party rifts must be avoided. On another occasion I will discuss the system for choosing the party's various candidates for the general elections.
