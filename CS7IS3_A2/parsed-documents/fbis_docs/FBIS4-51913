Chong announced his retirement from his group's management Tuesday morning at a press conference held shortly before his departure to Japan. But since he said he would stay on as Hyundai's honorary chairman and provide advice to the group if necessary, officials at Chongwadae [presidential office], the presidential mansion, and the DLP do not think Chong will actually withdraw from the group's management. A Chongwadae official, citing these reasons, called Chong's press conference "of no avail." In spite of Chong's proclaimed retirement, the strained relations between the government and Hyundai caused by his quest for the presidency and his allegedly illegal means of financing his election campaign are expected to continue, according to the officials. Since the presidential election in December 1992, Hyundai has received no financial support for facility investment from the Korea Development Bank and has not been allowed to open subsidiaries or to register in the over-the-counter market.
