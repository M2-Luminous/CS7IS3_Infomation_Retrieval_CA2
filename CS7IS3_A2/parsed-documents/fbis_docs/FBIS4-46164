The Krasnodar Kray militia has therefore been placed on full combat readiness, an ITAR-TASS correspondent learned from the kray interior affairs directorate. A telephone conference was held with chiefs from town and rayon militia departments, which also is heightening the readiness of personnel in case there were unexpected developments in the operational situation. Preparations were made for a helicopter carrying special purpose subunits to fly to Mineralnyye Vodiy, but its departure was postponed after special purpose troops from Moscow arrived there.
