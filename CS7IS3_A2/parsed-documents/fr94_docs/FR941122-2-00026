FR941122-2-00026 FR941122-2-00016 [Docket No. RP94&hyph;219&hyph;004] Columbia Gulf Transmission Co.; Withdrawal of Changes in FERC Gas Tariff November 16, 1994. Take notice that on November 10, 1994, Columbia Gulf Transmission Company (Columbia Gulf) tendered a filing requesting to withdraw certain tariff sheets. On October 31, 1994, Columbia Gulf tendered a revised filing in RP94&hyph;219&hyph;003, et al. which, among other things, motioned certain tariff sheets into effect that were originally filed on April 29, 1994 (motion rate filing). It has come to Columbia Gulf's attention that the motion rate filing moved into effect tariff sheets in certain X-Rate Schedules, contained in Volume No. 2 of Columbia Gulf's tariff, that it has filed to cancel due to abandonment authorized in other dockets. Some of the tariff sheets cancelling the relevant X-Rate Schedules have been accepted by the Commission and others are pending before the commission. In addition, the tariff sheet for Rate Schedule X&hyph;35 should not have been part of the April 29th filing since its cancellation was approved March 21, 1991, to be effective November 28, 1990. Therefore, Columbia Gulf requests to withdraw the Volume No. 2 tariff sheets listed below, which were motioned into effect in the October 31, 1994 filing: Fourth Revised Sheet No. 71 Second Revised Sheet No. 91 Second Revised Sheet No. 317 Second Revised Sheet No. 384 Second Revised Sheet No. 565 Second Revised Sheet No. 593 Second Revised Sheet No. 817 Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before November 23, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of Columbia Gulf's filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection. Linwood A. Watson, Jr., Acting Secretary.
