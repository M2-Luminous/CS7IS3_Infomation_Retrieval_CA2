He added, however, that this agreement must meet the 21 March deadline of the UN document. Kasoulidhis said it is important to defend Cypriot Hellenism's interests, adding that these are valued above all else. He called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas to accept the 21 March document if he wants an agreement. The government spokesman said the continuing delay in submitting the UN secretary general's report to the Security Council prompted the Greek Cypriot side to protest vigorously, but also gave it an opportunity to clarify its position. He said: It is important for the United Nations, the United States, Britain, and anyone else who is interested to know that we will not accept any changes to the 21 March UN document. Asked if the government considers the Vienna talks to be a deviation from the procedure, the spokesman said that if the outcome of the talks is the amending of the 21 March document then it certainly would be a deviation. He added, however, that if the outcome is that the Turkish Cypriot side is persuaded to accept the document as is, then it would not be a deviation. Kasoulidhis said the Greek Cypriot side will not accept the presence of Turkish troops in the area stretching from the Dherynia road to the sea. The spokesman said the United Nations clarified to the Cypriot Government that no promises were given, contrary to what the Turkish Cypriot press had reported. He added: As Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special representative in Cyprus, admitted, efforts are being made on the issues of access and the Famagusta map.
