This is the first visit to Switzerland by Qiao, chairman of China's National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, at the invitation of President Gert Haller of the National Council of the Federal Assembly of Switzerland. Qiao said in a written speech upon his arrival that China and Switzerland have had friendly contacts for a long time. Switzerland is one of the first Western countries to have recognized the People's Republic of China and established diplomatic ties with Beijing. China has always respected Switzerland's neutral position and attaches great importance to developing ties with this European nation, he said. Over the past few years, the Chinese leader added, cooperation between the two countries has progressed smoothly in the fields of politics, economy, science and technology as well as culture. "We are very pleased to note that the contacts and cooperation between China's NPC and the National Council of Switzerland's Federal Assembly have also been further developed," he added. Qiao, who is in Europe on a three-nation tour which will also take him to Austria, said the purpose of his current visit to Switzerland is to acquaint himself with Switzerland's parliamentary and government leaders as well as friends from all walks of life here. He also hoped to increase mutual understanding, deepen friendship and expand cooperation through the current visit so as to further push forward the friendly ties between the two countries and the two parliaments. Qiao and his party were greeted at the airport by Ricardo Jagmetti, president of the Council of States of Switzerland, Erwin Schurtenberger, Swiss ambassador to China, Xin Futan, Chinese ambassador to Switzerland, and Jin Yongjian, Chinese permanent representative to the U.N. office at Geneva.
