According to him, there is little chance of forming a cabinet on a BSP mandate in this parliament. The National Council of the non-parliamentary Bulgarian Liberals Party adopted the principles of an election platform, listing its priorities as follows: "Bread, security, private property, preferences for Bulgarian business and a united Eastern Orthodox church". [passage omitted] The second congress of the Union of Tobacco Producers was held in Plovdiv. According to its re-elected president, Mr Georgi Petrov, 1993 was the worst year Bulgarian tobacco producers have ever had.

Many of the customers are Serbs, Macedonians [from The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia] or Albanians from Kosovo. Three Bulgarian workers were caught in an attempt to steal gold from a jeweller's in Kocani (The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) and are now serving a prison term in Skopje, reports a local newspaper in Radomir (western Bulgaria).
