Thus, people are paying great attention to how the difference will be settled in the future. The difference in views between the United States and North Korea originated with the issue concerning the position North Korea is holding regarding the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty [NPT]. In other words, North Korea claims that since it is still in a state of "withholding the withdrawal from the NPT," it has no responsibility to fulfill its obligations as an NPT member. Based on this theory, the North Korean side says it is not in the position to accept regular and non-regular inspections prescribed in the accords of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] but would only cooperate with the United States for ensuring nuclear safeguards and its continuity. Therefore, experts believe that such a claim made by North Korea is a pitfall that would be used as an excuse for North Korea to refuse the IAEA inspection whenever it wants or to restrict the scope of the inspection. It has been learned, however, that North Korea is not opposed to accepting the IAEA inspection at the present stage and that North Korea has agreed in principle to include seven nuclear facilities in the IAEA inspection. During the 29 December contact, North Korea proposed to hold nuclear negotiations with the IAEA in Pyongyang. The U.S. side, however, conveyed its position to discuss a detailed procedure in Vienna where the IAEA Secretariat is located. Therefore, the issue of whether North Korea will accept the entire contents of ordinary inspections demanded by the IAEA or accept only a limited inspection or an inspection with possible future limitations in order to ensure nuclear safeguards and its continuity, as North Korea openly claimed, will be a key to working out a compromised plan between North Korea and the United States. Concerning this, White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers stressed that the United States will continue demanding overall inspections and revealed the position that the United States will not accept the proposal for a limited inspection or inspections that have the possibility of future limitations. The New York working-level contact between North Korea and the United States is aimed at reaching an agreement only on the general direction, and the agreement on detailed issues including the inspection method will be made at the forthcoming negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA. Experts believe that North Korea and the IAEA will reach an agreement when the New York working-level contact between North Korea and the United States conclude. Therefore, in the event that North Korea insists, in actuality, on a limited inspection or an inspection with the possibility of limits in the future, instead of a nominal acceptance of an inspection, only to justify its position, the U.S.-North Korea working-level negotiation can hardly be about to reach its conclusion.
