The company had planned to expand the use of Motorola systems by investing 30 billion yen over the next two to three years, and Motorola was informed of this plan. Ido's plan was supposed to have been used as a "trump card" in negotiations [with the United States]. But the United States has come up with new demands, including increasing the number of base stations. As far as Ido is concerned, this means even this most difficult, final choice has been simply ignored, and Tsukada, president of the company, is infuriarated, saying: "Motorola is entering and exiting the arena of government-to-government negotiations as it pleases. This is something Japanese manufacturers cannot even contemplate." The United States has complained from the beginning that the service area for Motorola systems is small compared with that for NTT [Nippon Telegraph & Telephone] systems. While NTT systems cover 94 percent of the population in their service area, Motorola systems cover only about 60 percent. [sentence as published] What the United States insists is that "as long as the area where cellular phones can be used remains small, the use of the phones will be slow to grow." But Ido had thought that if its plan was implemented, the coverage rates of the NTT systems and Motorola systems would be about equal, and the United States "would not be able to complain."
