That day, defence bureau director of the Defence Agency of Japan Murada blared at the same place that Japan "is studying rules of actions of the self-defence forces [SDF] involving naval deterrence, combat regulations and the sphere of aerial action" to "cope with an emergency case connected with the `nuclear suspicion' against North Korea". Earlier, the ground "SDF" showed a bellicose move of working out a new strategy attatching importance to "the influence of the situation on the Korean peninsula" which would replace the strategy of "attaching importance to the North". Facts eloquently show that the Japanese reactionaries are promoting on a full-dressed stage the reorganisation of the wartime system for a war of reinvasion against DPRK under the name of "reaction in case of emergency", taking issue with the fictitious "nuclear issue" of the DPRK. But the Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, clearly seeing the possible consequences of their reckless acts, and promptly give up the moves to stage a comeback to the Korean peninsula.
