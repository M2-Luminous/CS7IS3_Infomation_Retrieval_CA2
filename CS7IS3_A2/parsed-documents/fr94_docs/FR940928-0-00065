FR940928-0-00065 FR940928-0-00020 Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments Program; Fair Market Rent Schedules for Use in the Rental Certificate Program, Loan Management and Property Disposition Programs, Moderate Rehabilitation Program and Rental Voucher Program Schedules B and D_General Explanatory Notes 1. Geographic Coverage a. The FMRs shown in Schedule B incorporate the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) most current definitions of metropolitan areas (with the exceptions discussed in paragraph b). HUD uses the OMB Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area (PMSA) definitions for FMR areas because they closely correspond to housing market area definitions. FMRs are housing market-wide rent estimates that are intended to provide housing opportunities throughout the geographic area in which rental housing units are in direct competition. b. The exceptions are counties which have been deleted from seven large metropolitan areas whose revised OMB definitions were determined by HUD to be larger than the housing market areas. The FMRs for the following counties (shown by the metropolitan area) are calculated separately and are shown in Schedule B within their respective States under the ``Metropolitan FMR Areas'' listing: Metropolitan Area and Counties Deleted Atlanta, GA_Carroll, Pickens, Spalding, and Walton Counties. Chicago, IL_DeKalb, Grundy and Kendall Counties. Cincinnati-Hamilton, OH&hyph;KY&hyph;IN_Brown County, Ohio; Gallatin, Grant and Pendleton Counties in Kentucky; and Ohio County, Indiana. Dallas, TX_Henderson County. Lafayette, LA_St. Landry and Acadia Parishes. New Orleans, LA_St. James Parish. Washington, DC_Berkeley and Jefferson Counties in West Virginia; and Clarke, Culpeper, King George and Warren counties in Virginia. c. FMRs also are established for nonmetropolitan counties and for county equivalents in the United States, for nonmetropolitan parts of counties in the New England states and for FMR areas in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Pacific Islands. d. FMRs for the areas in Virginia shown in the table below were established by combining the Census data for the nonmetropolitan counties with the data for the independent cities that are located within the county borders. Because of space limitations, the FMR listing in Schedule B includes only the name of the nonmetropolitan county. The full definitions of these areas including the independent cities are as follows: Virginia Nonmetropolitan County FMR Area and Virginia Independent Cities Included With County 1County 1Cities Allegheny Clifton Forge and Covington. Augusta Staunton and Waynesboro. Carroll Galax. Frederick Winchester. Greensville Emporia. Halifax South Boston. Henry Martinsville. Montgomery Radford. Rockbridge Buena Vista and Lexington. Rockingham Harrisonburg. Southhampton Franklin. Wise Norton. e. FMRs for Section 8 manufactured home spaces are established at 30 percent of the two-bedroom Section 8 Rental Certificate program FMRs, with the exception of the areas listed in Schedule D whose FMRs have been modified on the basis of public comments. The FMR area definitions used for manufactured home spaces are the same as for the Section 8 Certificate program. 2. Arrangement of FMR Areas and Identification of Constituent Parts a. The FMR areas in Schedule B are listed alphabetically by metropolitan FMR area and by nonmetropolitan county within each State. The exception FMRs for manufactured home spaces in Schedule D are listed alphabetically by State. b. The constituent counties (and New England towns and cities) included in each metropolitan FMR area are listed immediately following the listings of the FMR dollar amounts. All constituent parts of a metropolitan FMR area that are in more than one State can be identified by consulting the listings for each applicable State. c. Two nonmetropolitan counties are listed alphabetically on each line of the nonmetropolitan county listings. d. The New England towns and cities included in a nonmetropolitan part of a county are listed immediately following the county name. e. The FMRs are listed by dollar amount on the first line beginning with the FMR area name.
