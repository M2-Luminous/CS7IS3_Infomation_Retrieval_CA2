He discussed state affairs with other NPC deputies. After the meeting, Jiang Zemin agreed to an interview with our station correspondent. The following is a related report from Beijing by special correspondent Zhu Mei: [Begin recording] [Zhu Mei] From assuming the post of Shanghai mayor to becoming general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Jiang Zemin has always showed great concern for the shopping basket issues of urban residents. He often said the situation can be determined from what is in citizen's shopping baskets. Jiang asked cadres at various levels to place the shopping basket issue on their important daily agendas. Today, he once again mentioned the topic of shopping baskets. [Jiang Zemin] I am concerned about commodity prices. I had been in Shanghai for many years and roughly knew the prices of foodstuffs in all the markets. I am also (?interested) in commodity prices in Beijing. Regretfully, I cannot go there to ask about prices. However, family members often go to the Xidan Food Market. [words indistinct] Eggs were 2.8 yuan in Shanghai. Right? Now the price seems a little cheaper, something like 2.7 yuan. Generally speaking, the masses still have complaints about commodity prices, feeling they are too high. However, now the capability and income level of the masses have also increased somewhat. [words indistinct] The residents are very concerned about the price of foodstuffs, such as preserved eggs, meat, and [word indistinct]. Their main concern is their shopping basket and (?food grain). [Zhu Mei] In his talk, General-Secretary Jiang Zemin stressed the dialectics of speed of our country's economic development. [Jiang Zemin] Development is the final word. This is totally correct. Comrade Xiaoping has made a series of important expositions on the issue of development. He asked us to seize opportunity in order to accelerate reform and development. In short, if you have conditions for development, you should be able to development in a relatively rapid manner. In areas lacking the conditions for development, you should create conditions for development; but you must not be too hasty, and must not insist on development if you clearly do not have the conditions for development. It will eventually create problems. I am talking about the situation of the entire country, including Shanghai. Every county and every district cannot develop in a balanced manner based on the same model. We all want to be rapid. Concerning speed, Comrade Li Peng put forward a figure of 9 percent. Of course this 9 percent cannot be applied to all locales because the situation in various regions is different. We cannot demand the same speed. We must not blindly seek output value and expand the scale of investment. We also must not solely depend on beginning new projects. In my opinion, Shanghai has very good conditions, including the quality of workers and level of management and market. The main conditions are all very good. Therefore we have great expectations. [Zhu Mei] Comrade Jiang Zemin had in the past worked at large and medium enterprises for a long time. He has great expectations in the improvement of large and medium enterprises in Shanghai, and has established a modern system for socialist enterprises. [Jiang Zemin] [Words indistinct] We should use a third eye to look at a book [as heard]. We should (?analyze the situation) from social and political angles. Whoever grasps the leadership of large and medium enterprise will have gripped the lifeline of the state. There is reason for it, because they are the backbone of the socialist ownership system. Therefore, we must do an effective job in developing state-owned large and medium enterprises, and must not fail in this work. We must only strengthen our efforts, and not weaken them. As to how to do a good job in this respect, I am willing to discuss this with you. For example, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee called for establishing a modern enterprise system. [words indistinct] The level of development of state-owned large and medium enterprises is different in various localities. For instance, the level of development in Shanghai is relatively high. Even in Shanghai, the situation is not the same. It is necessary to make an analysis. Under the leadership of the CPC, state-owned large and medium enterprises must still give full play to the administrative leadership of plant directors; party committees should adopt the role of political core. We should also develop the initiative of the broad masses of staff members and workers in production as the masters of the country. The trial of the joint stock system at selected units will not annul their position of being masters of the country; it will not annul their position. Therefore, we may have to give some assistance to state-owned large and medium enterprises which suffer from serious economic losses [words indistinct], but not those enterprises which have no future in development [words indistinct]. [Zhu Mei] Jiang Zemin talks with zest about refined art, popular songs, cultural accomplishments, and other light subjects. [Jiang Zemin] Concerning Shanghai's philharmonic orchestra, music, and related topics, in an earlier period there were [zui xin zu] and (?four great heavenly emperors) [si da tian wang]. In regards to them, we should give people guidance. So many people enjoy them, but are not allowed to watch. The Constitution has no such stipulation. In addition, some are fond of these things. Talking about popular songs, some are very good. But it seems a little bit too much if they indulge their passion in those things. If the great Chinese people do not know anything about Beethoven's 9th Symphony and (?happy song) [huan le song], [words indistinct] it is not good. I heard that our comrade (Min Huifen) has a large audience [words indistinct], and erhu [two-stringed bowed instrument] can be developed. Those things need support by (?performers), the state, and various departments. China is a nation with an outstanding culture; we also have several thousand years of history [words indistinct]. [Zhu Mei] At 1745 this afternoon, soon after the discussion with the Shanghai delegation, Shanghai reporters immediately rushed toward Jiang Zemin. I was the first to step forward and make a request of the general-secretary. [Zhu Mei] General Secretary Jiang, please say something to us. We are all from Shanghai. [Jiang Zemin] Of course. I hope Shanghai will develop more, and people will have a happier life. As a resident of Shanghai, I am convinced Shanghai has much talent and outstanding conditions. For instance, Pudong is developing quite well. I repeatedly said last year that the principle and policy for Pudong will be implemented in a firm manner. I am very grateful to you for asking me to come here and speak. [Zhu Mei] When a reporter asked the general secretary when would he see Shanghai's Yangpu Bridge, Jiang Zemin said: [Jiang Zemin, in Shanghai dialect] I wish I could go there tomorrow.
