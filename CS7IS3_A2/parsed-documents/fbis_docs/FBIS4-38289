The paper says: It is clear that with their new threats, Israeli officials want to exert further pressure against Syria and push it to do what the others have done, that is, abandon its rights. The paper stresses that Syria will never relinquish an inch of its occupied lands and that such threats will push it to stick even further to its rights, and, consequently, to work for the sake of a genuine peace in the region. AL-BA'TH says: Thus, there is no doubt that Israel wants a peace which will enable it to achieve what it failed to achieve in all its aggressive wars against the Arabs. Consequently, it maneuvers, procrastinates, and delays the peace process. Whenever substantive issues are raised for serious discussion, Israel evades them and starts raising secondary issues that do not concern the basic principles on which the peace process is based. The paper adds: Syria says complete and comprehensive withdrawal from the Golan Heights, South Lebanon, and the other occupied Arab territories will achieve the just and comprehensive peace. The implementation of this requirement is the cornerstone in the peace process. AL-BA'TH concludes by saying: We in Syria went to the Madrid Conference out of a genuine and true desire to achieve a just and comprehensive peace. We still, and will continue to, work with everyone for the sake of achieving a peace that will guarantee security, stability, and genuine peace to the region.
