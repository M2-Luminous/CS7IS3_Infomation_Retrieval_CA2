The U.S. proposal came in the latest round of bilateral talks on insurance that began in Tokyo Tuesday for a two-day run as part of the so-called trade "framework" talks, the officials said. In the talks, Tokyo urged Washington to standardize U.S. criteria on giving insurance licenses, describing the current state-by-state criteria as a barrier for foreign insurers looking to do business in the U.S. U.S. negotiators involved in the insurance talks told their Japanese counterparts that the federal government will encourage each state to adopt common standards on whether to issue an insurance license, the Japanese officials said. Japan and the U.S. are to hold the next round of bilateral talks on insurance next week in Washington to try to reach an agreement before the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in the Italian city of Naples. Insurance is one of the areas to which the U.S. gives top priority under the framework talks, which are intended to rectify the chronic trade imbalance between the two countries.
