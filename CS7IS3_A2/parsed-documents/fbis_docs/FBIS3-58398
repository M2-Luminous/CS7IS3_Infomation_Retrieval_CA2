Did the heads of states and governments who gathered in Brussels over the last few days on the occasion of the reputedly "historic" NATO summit rise to the occasion? It is worth repeating that the summit was first and foremost a test for the U.S. Administration, on whose initiative it had been convened. This was an opportunity for the United States to disclose its "vision" of a European policy which seemingly had fallen by the wayside since Bill Clinton came to power a year ago. The imaginative and concrete proposals brought to the summit by the Americans bear witness to a genuine commitment to their responsibilities. To Central and East European countries which have been fearing the consequences of an overly exclusive focus on Russia, they offered a Partnership for Peace. To West Europeans, they offered a possibility to carry out independent actions using NATO resources. Central Europe European partners of the United States within NATO, including France, were appreciative of this American effort at rethinking NATO. But will statements made at the summit be enough to appease Western skeptics -- for whom the alliance is an obsolete relic of the Cold War -- and Eastern skeptics -- who, on the contrary, view it as a promise of stability and peace for the future? Everything will hinge on the way the decisions made in Brussels are implemented. If it helps Central and East European countries in transforming their military structures, if it harmonizes their defense capabilities with those of NATO, if it lays the foundation for joint operations, if it contributes to the necessary renewal of attitudes within post-Soviet military institutions, the Partnership for Peace will have done more for its intended beneficiaries than grand statements or promises of assistance which no one will feel constrained to keep. Nevertheless, nations which have demonstrated that they are willing and able to join the democratic club should not be kept out of the alliance. For Central and East European countries, and especially would-be members of the European Union, the Partnership for Peace must lead to full integration into the alliance. Confining these countries to the sidelines for a long time would only undermine the faith their governments and citizens have placed in the values of democracy and free enterprise, and would create a zone of instability which would one day bring grief to the whole of Europe. While it is essential to avoid making Central Europe feel ignored, it is just as crucial to avoid isolating Russia. Should Russia come to feel cornered, it not only would become far less predictable, but would also accumulate colossal resentment against the West. Convinced of Western malevolence toward it, it would undoubtedly attempt to recreate a buffer zone through reasserting control over neighboring countries. Of course, its support at the UN Security Council, which alliance countries have managed to benefit so much from over the past few years, would also be lost. The experience of post-World War II Germany shows that the best way to turn a former foe into an ally is not to humiliate or ostracize it, but to bring it into the game after drawing up strict rules by which it is expected to play. While Central European countries must be given firm assurances of future NATO membership, it is just as crucial to get Russia to commit itself within a strong security partnership. The Partnership for Peace makes this possible. It does not prevent integration into NATO to happen at varying dates depending on the country. On the contrary, it facilitates such a notion. It is up to each partner to show, through active participation, how determined it is to join the alliance. Indeed, the guise NATO is most likely to assume in the future is that of an alliance "a la carte." The types of interventions which NATO will have to carry out in the years to come, whether on its own initiative or under a mandate from broader-based collective security organizations, will require flexibility and interoperability of forces rather than permanent integration of such forces. After a long period of indecision, the U.S. Government has now acknowledged the consequences of such a situation by bringing to the table the notion of "combined joint task forces." Such forces, which would have the ability of pulling apart from the integrated structure, could be deployed under WEU [Western European Union] command for interventions which the United States would be unwilling to take part in. Bosnia This approach is congruent with French aspirations, as France would like the European Union to assume responsibility for conflicts which affect continental security. France will be ready to participate fully as soon as command and control procedures are defined to its satisfaction. Of course, it is clear that NATO must keep the upper hand wherever the Americans are willing to commit themselves. So significant progress has been achieved for items on the agenda. However, political enlargement and the reform of the alliance's military structure will be credible only if NATO demonstrates an ability to take concrete action when a conflict breaks out on the continent. The summit's agenda did not include the situation in the former Yugoslavia. France correctly sought to remedy this by asking its allies to give explicit support to the European Union's peace plan, and asking NATO to renew its commitment to the implementation of UN resolutions. Indeed, how can one remain passive while innocent civilians are being slaughtered every day in Sarajevo and other besieged Bosnian cities? More than once, the U.S. authorities threatened the Serbs with armed reprisals, only to back down thereafter. The Europeans, although primarily concerned with the safety of their blue helmets, are increasingly reluctant to bear the humiliation of being constrained not to use force. For the alliance, averting its eye from Yugoslavia would be akin to abdicating its very purpose. Indeed, its current relevance will be judged by its determination to intervene, militarily if necessary, to uphold the principles of freedom, democracy and law.
