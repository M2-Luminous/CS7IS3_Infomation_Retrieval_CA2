In 1993 the province approved the establishment of 2,188 new foreign-funded enterprises, involving an agreed use of 1.9 billion U.S. dollars in foreign funds. The figures represent 75.74 percent and 98.53 percent increases, respectively, compared with 1992. According to local officials, Hubei has so far approved the establishment of 3,433 foreign-funded enterprises, which are expected to bring in a total of 3.2 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment. Local officials attributed the foreign investment boom in the province to the implementation of the national strategy for opening and speeding up the development of areas along the Chang Jiang river, overseas investment promotion events, the increasingly improved investment environment and effective measures made to simplify approval procedures. Operational foreign-funded enterprises in the province are reporting good production and operation achievements, and a rapid growth of exports of their products. The 1,000 foreign-funded enterprises in operation realized 3.23 billion yuan from sales of their products last year, generating 197 million yuan in local revenue. These enterprises have earned 188 million U.S. dollars from exports in the past year, accounting for 11.2 percent of the province's total export earnings, the officials said.
