FR940223-1-00056 FR940223-1-00009 The rules submitted by Minnesota were intended to address nonattainment area new source review requirements and did not address visibility-related permitting requirements specified in 40 CFR 51.307. Therefore, USEPA is retaining the provisions of 40 CFR 52.1236, which note the absence of approvable State regulations for visibility protection and impose the Federally promulgated regulations of 40 CFR 52.26 and 52.28. Public comment is solicited on all elements of USEPA's proposed rulemaking action. Written comments received by [Insert date 30 days from date of publication] will be considered in the development of USEPA's final rulemaking action. Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600 et seq., USEPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. (5 U.S.C. 603 and 604.) Alternatively, USEPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The Act forbids USEPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds. Union Electric Co. v. USEPA, 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2).
