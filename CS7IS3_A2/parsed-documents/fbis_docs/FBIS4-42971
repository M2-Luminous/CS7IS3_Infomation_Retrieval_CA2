Returning to Cyprus tonight, Mikhailidhis said Russia is showing an intense interest in the Cyprus issue. He added that he and Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev discussed two of the alternatives suggested by the UN secretary general in his report on the confidence-building measures [CBM], that is, the exchange of views and the convening of an international conference on the Cyprus issue, as Russia had suggested. Commenting on the possibility that the UN secretary general will submit a supplementary report on the talks on the CBM's, Mikhailidhis said such an action is completely unjustified and not in line with general procedures.
