FR940825-0-00037 FR940825-0-00009 The FAA estimates that 2,672 airplanes in the U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 workhours per airplane to accomplish the required action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $67 (maximum) per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,354,704. This figure is based on the assumption that no affected airplane owner/operator has accomplished the required action. The $67 parts cost figure is the maximum an operator will spend. Many airplane owners/operators will spend much less than this, and some airplane owners/operators have already accomplished the required action. With this in mind, the FAA believes the future cost impact estimate to be much less than that presented above. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the final evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety. Adoption of the Amendment Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows: PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES 1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows: Authority: 49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89. ยง39.13 [Amended] 2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding a new AD to read as follows: 94&hyph;18&hyph;04 Univair Aircraft Corporation: Amendment 39&hyph;9017; Docket No. 94&hyph;CE&hyph;05&hyph;AD. Applicability: Models Ercoupe 415&hyph;C, 415&hyph;CD, 415&hyph;D, 415&hyph;E, and 415&hyph;G, Forney F&hyph;1 and F&hyph;1A, Alon A&hyph;2 and A&hyph;2A, and Mooney M10 airplanes (all serial numbers), certificated in any category. Compliance: Required within the next 12 calendar months after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished (See Note 1). To prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected and corrected, could progress to the point of failure, accomplish the following: (a) Install inspection openings in the outer wing panels and inspect the wing outer panel internal structural components for corrosion in accordance with the PROCEDURE section of Univair Service Bulletin No. 29, Revision A, dated June 7, 1994. Prior to further flight, repair any corrosion in accordance with instructions contained in the above-referenced service information. Note 1: Complying with the original version of Univair SB No. 29, dated January 27, 1994, is considered equivalent to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this AD, and is considered ``unless already accomplished'' for this portion of the AD. (b) Send the results of the inspection required by paragraph (a) of this AD to the Manager, Denver Aircraft Certification Field Office, 5440 Roslyn Street, suite 133, Denver, Colorado 80216. State whether corrosion was found, the location and extent of any corrosion found, and the total hours TIS of the component at the time the corrosion was found. (Reporting approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB no. 2120&hyph;0056.) (c) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with sections 21.197 and 21.199 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199) to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.
