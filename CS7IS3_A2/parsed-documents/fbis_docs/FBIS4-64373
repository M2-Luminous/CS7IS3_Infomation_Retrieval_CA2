Republican People's Party leader Deniz Baykal has said that he does not believe that a lasting peace can be achieved in Cyprus without accepting the equality of the two communities. Baykal is continuing his contacts in the TRNC. Baykal and the delegation accompanying him met with Denktas, Assembly Speaker Ayhan Halit Acarkan, Prime Minister Atun, Deputy Prime Minister Ozker Ozgur, Foreign Affairs and Defense Minister Atay Ahmet Rasit, National Unity Party Dervis Eroglu, and Communal Liberation Party leader Mustafa Akinci. In a statement at the meeting, Denktas drew attention to a statement made by Greek Cypriot leader Kliridhis to the effect that the doors of the EU will open for south Cyprus irrespective of whether the CBM's [confidence-building measures] prove to be successful. Recalling that both sides accepted the package submitted to them, Denktas added that it is Kliridhis who [word indistinct]. He quoted Kliridhis as saying: Either we say yes together with Denktas and enter the EU or we join the Union without them, which would be devastating for the Turkish Cypriots. Denktas added: This is tantamount to diluting the guarantee agreement and to canceling the rights granted to us. Denktas noted that the continuation of this injustice and the entry of south Cyprus to EU will secure the full integration of north Cyprus with Turkey. Pointing out that the two sides should get together to solve the Cyrus problem, Denktas added that the Greek Cypriot government has been rejecting the proposals being submitted claiming that it is the government of Cyprus and that, therefore, it cannot meet as equals with the Turkish Cypriot side. Denktas further stressed that an agreement cannot be reached without equality. [passage omitted]
