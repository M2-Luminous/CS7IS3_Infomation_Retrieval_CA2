"If the U.N. forces there were put at risk, as they were in the shelling of Gorazde, we would offer close air support," Clinton told reporters at the White House. "Every time we have been firm, though, in the end it's been a winner for the peace process, and I think it will be here," the President said. It was reported that after two days of NATO air attacks on Serb troops, Gorazde's Muslim defenders were firing at Serbs in an attempt to provoke a response which could bring more NATO air strikes. Clinton cautioned the Bosnian government forces "not to try to take advantage of this and violate the understandings themselves." He stressed, "We have to be firm in our reaction to plain violations of the United Nations resolutions, and in what we said our policy would be." "We have to be firm in pursuing the policy that we say we have," Clinton said, "it's our only chance for success." Russia Monday [11 April] vigorously denounced NATO air attacks against Bosnian Serbs, warning that the move would lead to an escalation of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Clinton said he had assured Russian President Boris Yeltsin that the United States had no interest in using NATO's airpower to affect the outcome of the war. "But we do want to protect the U.N. mandate and we do want a negotiation there," he said, "and I think that is what we are going to get."
