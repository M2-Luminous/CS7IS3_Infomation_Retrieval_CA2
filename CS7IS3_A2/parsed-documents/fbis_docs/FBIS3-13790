What can the Islamic states' foreign ministers offer other than a statement of condemnation and denunciation? [Velayati] I have asked the chairman of the Islamic Conference Organization [ICO] and the Pakistani foreign minister to call for an extraordinary conference of the Islamic states' foreign ministers. We are still working to convene this meeting. I believe the Islamic nation must express its attitude in this regard, and condemn what has happened in Hebron. We are seeking a unified position. For what has happened to the Palestinians in the occupied territories pains us all. We must take deterrent, firm, and decisive positions that make whoever entertains the notion of encroaching upon the Islamic nation experience a great deal of hesitation before he embarks on such encroachments. For more than half a century, the Palestinian people have continued to suffer from massacres at the hands of the Zionists, not to mention the harsh treatment accorded to them. We must learn from our Islamic history and support all Muslims who have come under the pressure of their enemies. [Shihab] What can you offer the victims of the massacre, other than prayers? [Velayati] There are various means of extending support. The most important form of support is political support, as well as the application of international pressure on the aggressor. When we speak of such means of support, we do not exclude other means of support. [Shihab] Such as what? [Velayati] I do not want to divulge the measures that I have in mind, and what we, as Islamic states, can do to mitigate the Palestinians' sufferings. Some of the measures we will take will be confidential. [Shihab] Iran has opposed the peace agreement the PLO and Israel signed in Washington in September 1993. Why have you opposed the agreement? Will you take a similar position if Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan sign similar agreements with Israel? [Velayati] Well, when we express such a position toward this agreement, this means that we do not approve of a certain policy. But, as you know, our opposition to such agreements does not mean that we will have disputes with the countries to which we are bound by strong ties, or that we will sever our ties with them. We maintain strong relations with Syria. We have communicated to our Syrian friends in no uncertain terms that we are opposed to the agreement or whatever has to do with making peace with Israel. We know Syria has its own thoughts on this particular issue and it is playing a clear role in the anti-Zionist effort. However, we realize Syria is coming under intense pressure not only in regard to its position on the Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights but in regard to south Lebanon as well. If we understand Syria's position, this is not to say that we will support whatever agreement it signs with Israel. Syria has its own clear, independent policy. The same goes for us. [Shihab] How did Syria respond to your observations about a possible agreement with Israel? [Velayati] As I have already pointed out, we talked with our Syrian brothers frankly. At the same time, we are all aware of the support Syria has made available to the Palestinian cause in all areas. Syria continues to extend support to the Palestinian cause. You are aware that the 10 Palestinian factions opposed to the peace agreement with Israel are still active in Damascus. [Shihab] Iranian news media said that after the al-Asad- Clinton summit, Syria would send an envoy to Tehran to brief you on the outcome. Did they send one? [Velayati] No one came to Tehran. [Shihab] Has Syria tried to mediate between Iran and the United States? [Velayati] As I have said, Syria did not send any envoy to brief us on the talks between al-Asad and Clinton. [Shihab] Why? [Velayati] You must ask the Syrian brothers. I must point out, however, that there is no precedent for this. In the past two decades, there have been meetings between President al-Asad and former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. Syria did not send an envoy to brief us on those talks. [Shihab] We have been hearing for some time that President al- Asad will visit Tehran. Will the visit take place soon? [Velayati] This is likely. The Iranian president. Hashemi- Rafsanjani, visited Damascus twice, but President al-Asad came here only once. [Shihab] This month, or next month? [Velayati] We have not yet decided on the proper time for this visit. Nonetheless, I believe it will be made in the near future. [Shihab] Do you believe the military action that Hizballah and the Palestinian factions initiated from southern Lebanon will continue if Israel agrees to withdraw from there, and signs a peace agreement with the Lebanese Government? [Velayati] I do not know, because the Palestinians and Lebanese will have to decide this for themselves. We do not want to force our own dictates on them. The Lebanese are engaged in acts of self-defense and waging a jihad to liberate their occupied territories. I do not know what will happen in the future. [Shihab] Security in the Gulf is a critical and thorny issue for the countries of the region. How does Iran perceive its role in the region? To what extent is it willing to cooperate with its neighbors in this regard? [Velayati] Safeguarding security in the Gulf region is a critical issue for all countries of the region. This issue is of strategic importance for all states, be they Iran, Iraq, or the Gulf Cooperation Council [GCC] members. I believe the six Gulf countries, namely, the six GCC members, may not, at present, agree to cooperate with Iraq in this regard. Nonetheless, we believe in the importance of this cooperation to promote stability and security. If there is tension for whatever reason, we all are dutybound to work to defuse tension through understanding and dialogue. [Shihab] Since you are speaking of defusing tension through understanding, I would like to pose the following question to you. Regarding your dispute with the United Arab Emirates [UAE] over the islands of Abu Musa, Tunb al-Sughra, and Tunb al-Kubra, you were reported to have said that there is a third party that seeks to maintain tension in the region in general, and between the UAE and Iran in particular. Can you name this party? [Velayati] It is not a single party. Some seek to take advantage of aggravated tension in the region in order to create additional reasons and justifications for the presence of some Western powers in the Gulf region. These parties are creating problems and promoting tension among states. [Shihab] Are you planning to visit Iraq soon, as some reports have said, in the aftermath of a recent visit to Tehran by a senior Iraqi official? [Velayati] This is contingent upon the success of the steps undertaken to implement Security Council Resolution 598. The most important things we expect in this regard is swapping prisoners of war, redrawing the disputed border, which was the scene of a devastating and wicked war, and various other measures, as well. The materialization of my visit to Baghdad is largely contingent upon progress in resolving the issues I have just mentioned. I hope Iraq will honor its commitments toward these issues so we may take a new step toward the future. [Shihab] What about your relations with Saudi Arabia and an exchange of visits and envoys? [Velayati] In the past, there were dark clouds in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran. However, if we look at the course of these relations recently, we will find improvement in these relations. Our relations with Saudi Arabia are positive; we are looking forward to developing and strengthening them in the future. [Shihab] A senior Iranian official described the establishment of a Kurdish state in northern Iraq as the creation of a new Israel that is rejected by Iran. Why? Are you worried about the strong cooperation between Western countries and some major Kurdish parties in the region? [Velayati] We fully believe in the importance of maintaining the unity of Iraq -- territory and people -- and its independence, regardless of who is running its affairs. Iran believes the continuation of Iraq, with its present and recognized borders, is important to the stability and security of the region. If anyone tries to set up an independent state in northern or southern Iraq this will be considered a threat to Iran's security and we will face this with firmness. [Shihab] What obstructs any improvement in your relations with the Egyptian Government? What is your opinion about the accusations that Iran supports some extremist Islamic movements in Egypt? [Velayati] Fortunately, the Egyptian interior minister recently announced that there is no evidence of Iran's support for the fundamentalist Islamic movements or of its interference in Egypt's internal affairs. In the past, we were victims of such accusations. We were the target of severe media campaigns by the Egyptian papers. We, meanwhile, denied such accusations. The conviction of the Egyptian political leadership that Iran has not practiced any illegal activities in Egypt or interfered in Egypt's internal affairs is an important sign regarding the return of Egyptian- Iranian relations to normal. [Shihab] Does this mean that we will see improvement in bilateral relations very soon, if not an exchange of official visits? [Velayati] Yes, I believe this, because it has been proven that we are innocent of all charges leveled against us. [Shihab] When will the UAE foreign minister visit Tehran to discuss the islands crisis, especially since a previously scheduled visit was canceled? [Velayati] I extended in the past, and now I am repeating, an open invitation to my UAE counterpart to visit Tehran at a time he sees as appropriate. I said in the past that Iran is very eager to resolve any misunderstanding with any of its neighbors, especially the UAE, through understanding and dialogue. [Shihab] You speak about the possibility of reaching a solution, and on other occasions you extend Iran's sovereignty over Gulf waters. [Velayati] What the Iranian Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majlis) did was to ratify a law approved by most countries. The UAE adopted a similar decision. What you spoke about deals with navigation rights, nothing more, nothing less. We will continue to be eager to coexist peacefully with our neighbors. [Shihab] Iran's relations with the West, and the United States and Britain in particular, continue to be bad. What do these countries want from you? [Velayati] This question should be addressed to the United States and other countries. [Shihab] What do you want from the United States? [Velayati] We want the United States to stop interfering in our internal affairs. This is a basic issue. We want the United States to stop besieging our economy, return our frozen money, and provide us with spare parts for the weapons that we brought from U.S. factories. [Shihab] Do Iran and Turkey cooperate or compete to spread their influence in the central Asian Islamic republics? [Velayati] We and Turkey are members of ECO [Economic Cooperation Organization] and the central Asian republics are members of this organization. Therefore, it is natural that our relations with Turkey are governed by cooperation in the interest of our two countries and the central Asian Islamic republics. In fact there are other things. Turkey may have concerns that differ from ours. [Shihab] What do you do in order to resolve the crisis in Afghanistan and the rivalry taking place between the Mujahidin? [Velayati] First of all, I want to say that we all pray for the end of fighting and for putting an end to war, destruction, and innocent victims. Secondly, we are doing our best in order to bring the different viewpoints of the belligerent factions closer together, because Afghanistan faced total destruction, first at the hands of the defunct Communist regime, then by the destructive war between brothers. [Shihab] The Iranian capital was packed with foreign visitors last week. In addition to the Chinese deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Indian foreign minister, and Russian deputy foreign minister and others were here. [Velayati] And the envoy of [Afghan President] Rabbani. [Shihab] At the meetings between these foreign visitors and President Hashemi-Rafsanjani, the president presented the idea of cooperation with their countries to form a regional force in Asia that solves conflicts between the countries of the region. Do you have information on what the president presented concerning this idea? [Velayati] We have begun practical steps to shape up ideas that encourage the strong and leading Asian countries to cooperate together in all fields. The first step is that the strong and politically active countries work out a preliminary concept on this cooperation, and later we will ask the other countries to join this alliance or grouping. I want to say that a leader of one of the central Asian republics of the former Soviet Union was the one who presented this idea to President Hashemi-Rafsanjani. President Hashemi-Rafsanjani was convinced of this idea soon after it was presented to him, and used the chance of the visits to Tehran by foreign ministers of two important countries, China and India, to reiterate his support for the idea. The idea received good attention by the Indian and Chinese guests. Iran previously expressed to Indian and Chinese officials its readiness for cooperation in order to implement these ideas through forming special committees. These committees will explain the concepts of each side regarding the working structure of such grouping or alliance and the role which it could play in the future to contribute to stability, progress, and the prosperity of the Asian nations. [Shihab] Observers have noticed a change in Iranian foreign policy over the past three years, especially toward some neighborly European countries. Does this mean that Iran has gone back on the slogan of exporting the revolution and the party which is not with Iran is against it? [Velayati] The Iranian Government has benefited from its previous experiments and began to follow a clear policy. We do not deny that this took some time. Following the success of the revolution, we were exposed to huge pressure from various sides. Therefore, our policy was not 100-percent sound and successful. Now that we have gained experience, we have begun to lay down firm bases for our policy. Any observer can judge the experiment of our revolution if we are compared with other revolutions. Despite this, I can say that we have passed through various stages: The first stage was represented by our endeavor to reach stability; and the second stage was represented by our endeavor in the fields of construction and planning.
