There were arguments and disagreements at the start of the meeting over the status of the congress delegates. One side demanded that only those elected by branches and subbranches during the recent elections should be delegates. The other side demanded that all those falling under the definition of Article 37 of the PDP Statute could be delegates. According to this article, delegates elected by the branches and subbranches, members of the PDP Presidium, members of the PDP Central Assembly, members of the PDP Supvervisory Council, and deputies and ministers representing the PDP in the parliament and Macedonian Government [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] can be congress delegates with full voting rights. After the congress participants voted for a working presidium and also to override the PDP Statute, thus denying votes to deputies, the members of the government and a section of the delegates demonstratively left the meeting. The delegation of the Kosovo Democratic alliance, consisting of Dr. Ali Aliu, Dr. Rexhep Gjergji, and Edita Tahiri, also left the meeting. The congress continued its proceedings with those remaining in the hall, which, according to the new rules, were only delegates elected by branches and subbranches and the chairmen of branches in Macedonia and in the diaspora, but who formed a quorum. The Party's Degeneration After the congress's working groups and commissions were elected, the greetings telegram to the congress from Kosova Prime Minister Bujar Bukoshi was read out. Dritan Shehu, general secretary of the Albanian Democratic Party, greeted the congress, calling it very important for the Albanians in Macedonia and a contribution to realizing human rights on the basis of the Helsinki Charter and the documents of the CSCE and to maintaining peace and stability in Macedonia, the Balkans, and the world. Dritan Shehu said in his speech, among other things, that a free vote is one that decides who is elected and where. Aleksander Xinho greeted the congress for the Albanian Republican Party, and said that it is important for the party to emerge strengthened from this congress and that he felt himself obliged to help the congress to proceed smoothly. Muhamet Bicaj, Kosova education minister, said that the only people to emerge disappointed from this congress will be those who want the PDP's destruction. There are no Albanians who want this party weaker. On the contrary, they want it to be strengthened. The Albanians must cultivate pluralism and broad hearts, because narrowmindedness is a damaging handicap. Milaim Fejziu, chairman of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms; Erdogan Sarac, chairman of the Turkish Democratic Party, the cardiologist Jusuf Rexhepi, and the actor Xhevat Limani also greeted the congress. Menduh Thaci, chairman of the PDP's Tetovo branch, presented the report on the party's work between the two congresses, and said among other things that the PDP was formed as part of a campaign of many years' resistance to inequality, assimilation, and repression, and as part of the successful efforts of patriots to raise the national and political awareness of the Albanians of these parts. By confronting the challenge of the rites of passage of the political system, despite all the visible and invisible traps, the PDP has passed the first test of democracy. I congratulate it on its success in the multiparty elections, in which it won 22 parliamentary seats in the Macedonian parliament, creating the opportunity for institutionalized political activity on the basis of its program. It is possible for a political party to reduce the scope of its interests to a ridiculous and absurd minimum, because of dogmatism, organization, ignorance, nepotism, careerism, personal or group interests, or mistaken judgments and alliances. The work of a political party is assessed by results, in other words by the maximilization of the interests of the people, social stratum, or nation that it represents. One might ask whether the PDP has done this. If we analyze the internal situation, the Albanians today cannot influence organizational matters of the state structure and their own position in the system. The communes exercise ceremonial functions, while the albanians have the status of a minority under the Constitutions. Their position in the parliament cannot be considered to be independent, because they are an appendix to another political party, with which they entered a coalition without a platform, something which is considered a strategic mistake. In Macedonian foreign policy, the Albanians do not even figure as a factor requiring consultation. The Albanian language media are a mixture of official reports, kitsch, and disinformation. The situation is similar in other fields of life: in the economy, security, culture, sport, entertainment, etc. The degeneration of a project, a movement, or a party begins when general interests are seen as personal or group interests. There are many who assert that the PDP has fallen victim to such a decline. The PDP has called an early congress to demonstrate the moral and political strength of the PDP and the Albanians for speedy regeneration. We hope this will be a congress of fast renewal, Menduh Thaci said in conclusion. A debate lasting many hours then followed, offering different comments and proposals about the PDP's future policy. The congress elected a 55-member Central Assembly, and this Central Assembly, in a closed session, elected a 14-member presidium from among its ranks. Arber Xhaferi was elected PDP chairman, Nexhibe Delloshi, Menduh Thaci, and Shazim Mehmeti were elected deputy chairmen, and Sefedin Duka was elected secretary. The Assembly elected a nine- member Supervisory Council. The congress ended its proceedings after midnight, at 0220. The Other Congress The members of the congress who demanded respect for the statute as the PDP's basic document, after leaving the hall where the congress was being held, organized their own early PDP congress in the hall of the Tetovo Communal Assembly. After verifying the status of participants and electing a presidium and working groups, Ilir Luma, member of the Central Assembly, presented the report on the work of the PDP between the two congresses. Among other things, the report stressed the successes achieved by the party in the period under review and the realization of the Albanians' demands for sovereignty and equality. The report emphasized the successes in the parliamentary elections, in building the coalition government, in cooperation with other Albanian parties in the former Yugoslavia, in building a common strategy for action, and in affirming the Albanian cause in the international arena. The report also stressed the weaknesses that have harmed the party and led to a loss of influence among the people. These involved shortcomings of organization and coordination, and failures to harmonize standpoints between the party and the parliamentary group, to always present a united front on the international scene, and to respect agreements, program documents, etc. For this reason, it became necessary to hold this early congress, so that we my achieve our programmed goals with new people who enjoy the trust of the membership. On the basis of a vote, the congress confirmed the mandates of the PDP Central Assembly, 37 of whose 55 members were present. The congress elected eleven members of a 15-member presidium (two seats were left for Gostivar, one for Kumanovo, and one for Struga, which will send delegates later). The Central Assembly elected Dr. Xheladin Murati, deputy chairman of the Macedonian parliament, as PDP chairman, and Naser Zymberi as secretary, while two deputy chairmen are to be elected later. The congress ended its proceedings at 2300. This congress did not approve a new program and statute, because those used hitherto remain in force. Despite all the hopes and wishes that the PDP's crisis would be overcome and that this party would remain united as the main force defending the sovereignty, identity, and political will of the Albanians in Macedonia, this did not happen, and the PDP Second Congress will go down in history as a congress of division. The PDP split definitively into two currents, into two large sections, and a bitter struggle between the two is expected over which will represent the continuity and inherit the legality and legitimacy of the PDP. It is certain that this will weaken the political strength of the Albanians as a people in Macedonia, that the Albanians will not be able to produce joint candidates in the local and Macedonian parties will exploit this disarray.
