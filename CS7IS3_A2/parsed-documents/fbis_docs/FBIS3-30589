On Saturday, 5 February, its members discussed the political situation that developed as a result of the government crisis and the resignation submitted by Marek Borowski, deputy prime minister and minister of finance. Snatches of statements by Aleksander Kwasniewski, Marek Borowski, and council members, which we were able to overhear near the door, suggested that the participants expressed severe criticism of the cadre, information, economic, and financial policy of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL]; they also seemed to be pointing to a lack of cooperation within the coalition. Talks between both coalition parties will probably be held on Monday [7 February]. Aleksander Kwasniewski officially confirmed that Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak is obviously breaching the provisions of the coalition agreement. Three of its four provisions are being implemented as the PSL partners wish. "We will not tolerate this state of affairs any longer," said Kwasniewski. According to him, the governing coalition will not break up if the intentions of both sides are clear, if both sides are willing to communicate with each other and implement a jointly agreed economic program. "We have expressed such an intention, and we maintain it; we would like a similar declaration on the part of the PSL so that we will know whether they want the coalition to remain as much as we do. Some activities lead us to believe that the determination to maintain it is different," said Kwasniewski, referring to the present conflict and to earlier disputes between the coalition partners. Despite these accusations, the SdRP chairman conceded that the discussion is characterized by a desire to reach an agreement within the coalition. Kwasniewski described Marek Borowski as the best person for the role of the finance minister now and a man responsible for the economy. When SdRP General Secretary Jerzy Szmajdzinski was presenting the conclusions of the almost five-hour discussion of the authorities of his party, he was much more cautious in choosing his words: "The SdRP decided that there is no need to escalate this conflict. The existing problems can be resolved among the members of the presidiums of both parties. It is desirable that both parties take a more precise joint stance on the issues of the economy, the budget, privatization, information policy, the government, and the method of conducting the cadre policy. He also admitted that there is no need to sign a new coalition agreement; however, as a result of the fact that it has not been kept, it is necessary to review the coalition's activities after 100 days of governing and to explain all doubts. He said that it was with sorrow that the RN of the SdRP received the resignation of Marek Borowski; he added, however, that the deputy prime minister is not the only candidate of the SdRP for this post. Nevertheless, each person who comes after him will be in a more difficult situation. "We do not want to die for anyone. We want Marek Borowski to be used in the further activities of the coalition, of the government. Everything is still possible." As they finished their session, the SdRP leaders expressed the hope that they would be able to meet with the prime minister as early as last weekend, all the more so because, during his morning talk with Sejm Speaker Jozef Oleksy, he is reported to have said that he wants to ease the conflict. However, he will first have a talk with the PSL leadership. "These will be talks that will explain everything to us," said Szmajdzinski.
