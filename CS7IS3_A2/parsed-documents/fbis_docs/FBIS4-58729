The two FIS leaders who granted an interview to pro-Islamic AL BAYANE daily said those who were forced to take arms for political reasons will end up opting for a way that will spare the lives of Muslims, restore security and faith, respect the nation's will to change and end injustice affecting innocent people. To a question on whether armed wings will comply to the Islamic party's eventual call to lay down arms, Abdelkader Boukhemkhem and Ali Jeddi said the FIS leaders strongly believe that their move will yield results because it is based on the charia (Islamic law) and on the people's trust as well as on cooperation with reformist forces of the country. The two men who were sentenced to 4 years imprisonment proposed four requisites likely, in their opinion, to bring about a climate favorable to the quest of solution: `ending injustice affecting people, lifting restrictions imposed on political freedom and information, charity and daawa (Islamic call) moves, lifting all obstacles preventing the FIS from undertaking its civilizational mission and restore to people the right to have a say'. They also voiced optimism that Algeria will overcome the crisis if the authorities meet requests of parties which enjoy popular credibility. For the two men, there are fundamental convergences on the assessment of the situation among the FIS leadership, five major political parties, ulema (Islamic scholars) and political figures.
