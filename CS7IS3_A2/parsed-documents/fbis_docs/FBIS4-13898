FBIS4-13898 "drnes079_o_94003" FBIS-NES-94-079 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 SYRIA Wrapup of Reaction to Rabin Remarks, Christopher Tour Wrapup of Reaction to Rabin Remarks, Christopher Tour Rabin Objectives Said `Obvious' JN2304170494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 1135 GMT 23 Apr 94 JN2304170494 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [Station commentary] [Text] Gentlemen: Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's statement about his willingness to dismantle the settlements in the Golan is not a new. It does not contain anything new to push the stagnant peace process forward. Rabin wants to precede Warren Christopher's tour of the region with statements that seem to offer concessions compared to previous positions. He wants to give the impression that Israel is offering new initiatives that require the other side, -- the Arabs, and Syria, in particular -- to offer concessions in return. The objectives of Rabin's attempt are obvious. He seeks to direct U.S. pressure -- which is supposed to be directed toward the party obstructing the peace process, Israel -- toward Arabs who have offered everything in order to make the peace process a success. Rabin's statement about Israel's willingness to dismantle the settlements does not respond to what is stipulated in the terms of reference of the peace process regarding the need for full Israeli withdrawal, dismantling settlements, and evacuating settlers from all occupied Arab territories. According to observers, Rabin's statements are just maneuvers before Christopher's tour. Rabin previously took positions he quickly revoked in order to adopt counter positions. After the Israeli Labor party won in the recent elections, the international community expected Yitzhaq Rabin to take the initiative to freeze settlement building in implementation of his electoral promises. However, after he assumed power, Rabin came out with a new theory concerning political and security settlements. He allocated great amounts of money in favor of settlement building, including U.S. loan guarantees. He did so despite the fact that he made a commitment to Washington not to spend a single dollar from these loan guarantees on expanding settlements. Despite Rabin's continuous talk about his willingness to bring momentum to the talks with Syria in order to reach a settlement, he has aborted practically every chance of making minimal progress. He did this when he instructed his negotiating delegation not to get into the issue of withdrawal from the Golan. Rabin met Syria's true peace intentions with the expansion of settlements in the Golan and the building of new ones. Peace in the Middle East requires deeds, not words. Syria, along with the Arab parties to the Washington talks, build their stands based on Israel's deeds, not its words. Arabs have heard a lot of Israel's peace claims, but they have not sensed anything tangible in the Washington talks and in the occupied Arab territories. Indeed, the reverse is true. For its part, Syria presented a paper containing objective and balanced principles and proposals since the sixth round. This paper was the center of world attention, except, of course, in Israel, which sought to block the adoption of the Syrian paper because its sixth article discussed full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. The Washington talks, which began two and one-half years ago, have not achieved the desired results despite sincere Arab intentions and because all Israeli officials, from all trends, have not directed their attention to peace. These officials entered a competitive display of extremism and intransigence. Settlement building, of course, was part of this competition. The whole world community agrees that the policy of settlements totally contradicts peace and that peace and settlements cannot coexist and that peace and occupation cannot coexist. The UN Security Council resolutions are clear and frank. They do not permit occupation and settlements and demand their total removal. The Arabs have not moved from the world's stand. Indeed, they have called for the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, the removal of settlements, and the exchange of land for peace. If Israel had responded to international law and efforts, as well as to true Arab intentions and adopted the Syrian proposals, peace would be prevailing in the region today. Despite all the Israeli prevarication, there is an opportunity today to achieve firm peace in the region, if Israel takes the initiative to withdraw from the occupied Arab territories and dismantle all settlements there. The question posed by the observers is: Did Rabin's statement express a substantive change in the Israeli position, or is it just a maneuver to mislead the world public opinion that discovered the atrocities of the settlers and the dangers they pose to the peace process after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre? The next few days, which will see a new tour by the U.S. secretary of state, is guaranteed to expose the reality of the Israeli positions. The peace process is in a real predicament and the chances to achieve peace are growing narrower and are threatening to disappear.
