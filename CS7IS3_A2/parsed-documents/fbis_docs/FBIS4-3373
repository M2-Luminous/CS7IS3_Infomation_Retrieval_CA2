Liu Hui, who was sent by Taiwan's KMT military intelligence bureau to sneak into the mainland to conduct espionage activities, was arrested according to law. This was another indication of the persistent hostility cherished by the Taiwan authorities. A very large problem exists in the development of cross-strait relations: namely, the persistent hostility on the part of the Taiwan authorities toward the mainland. The Taiwan authorities treat the mainland as a powerful foe posing a threat to the security of Taiwan. On 27 September last year, the Taiwan authorities held an army-navy-air force joint military exercise, comprised mainly of landing, anti-landing, airborne, and anti-airborne operations, in Penghu [Pescadores] area, targeting the mainland as the imaginary enemy. This was a military exercise of a comparatively large scale in recent years. In February this year, Taiwan's marines conducted a military exercise code-named (?Lien-ching 68), comprised mainly of offensive surprise landing operations from the sea, in waters off the coast of southwestern Taiwan. Meanwhile, the motorized units of Taiwan's army will conduct north-south joint war games soon. All of these military exercises are directed against the mainland. The scale of these exercises was rarely seen in those conducted in previous years. In addition, the Taiwan authorities' national policy center sponsored a seminar on the management of national defense to specially study the issue of Taiwan's security, treating the mainland as the main foe that poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Such practices on the part of the Taiwan authorities not only cause cross-strait relations deteriorate and spoil the peaceful and propitious atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait, but will make our own people sad and the enemy glad. For a considerably long period of time to come, the mainland will dedicate its efforts to reform, opening up, and economic construction, and will strive for fulfillment of the grand objectives of promoting economic development and building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Therefore, it needs an international and domestic environment of long-term stability to achieve this end. It is entirely groundless to say that the mainland poses a threat to Taiwan's security. Just the opposite, the mainland has taken a number of initiatives, such as dissolving the Fuzhou Military Region, reducing the number of army units stationed in Fujian Province, and making some ports, wharves, and military installations available for civilian use, to resolve the cross-strait hostility and to bring about a change in the situation of confrontation, thereby making important contributions to the improvement and development of cross-strait relations. The threat to Taiwan's security does not come from the mainland. Instead, it comes from the Taiwan independence movement that has been bent on disrupting Taiwan's stability and has been trying hard to split the motherland. The mainland has played an important role in checking the Taiwan independence movement. It is an important force that maintains Taiwan's stability and protects Taiwan's security.
