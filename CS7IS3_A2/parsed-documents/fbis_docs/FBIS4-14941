It has been receiving tourists, businessmen, missionaries, merchants, intelligence agents.... The special services are particularly interested in the Dnepropetrovsk region, where Ukraine's considerable scientific and industrial defense potential is concentrated. In a published statement Lieutenant General V. Slobodyanyuka [name as transliterated], chief of the Dnepropetrovsk Oblast Security Service, states that last year staffers from the Ukrainian Security Service administration monitored the unofficial presence in the region of more than 30 career foreign intelligence agents under different covers, as well as a large number of people suspected of involvement with foreign special services. Attempts to set up two [intelligence-gathering] stations in the oblast were blocked by the counterintelligence department. Hostile operations on the part of a number of European countries, as well as the United States, China, and Near East countries have been uncovered. Foreign professionals, as the general put it, are making active use on the region's territory of the entire known arsenal of subversive intelligence work -- from recruiting local citizens and gathering information through legal sources (the press) to the most sophisticated means of electronic espionage.
