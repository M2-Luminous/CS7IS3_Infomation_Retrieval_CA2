The PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party] senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Pedro Simon, the government leader in the Senate, has reacted with concern, especially because the STF trend was announced the same day Congress approved, on the first vote, the economic plan measures. "They did not even wait for the opposition to question the measure. It is as if the judicial branch was inviting the opposition to challenge the plan," Simon said. According to Simon, the government had no alternative proposal until 9 February in case the STF rejected the economic plan's promulgation, which is scheduled for the first week of March. The immediate promulgation method (or "sausage," as it was christened in Congress) has always caused controversy, but the PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, Nelson Jobim, the constitutional revision coordinator, claims that this is an internal affair of Congress and does not fall under court jurisdiction. After the first vote on the government measures, the PFL [Liberal Front Party] deputy for Pernambuco, Inocencio de Oliveira, the Chamber of Deputies president, said the Social Emergency Fund will be an excellent test for the "sausage method." According to Oliveira, both the government and Congress want the plan's immediate promulgation. Says Oliveira: "An STF decision against immediate promulgation would be a challenge to the two other branches and also to the public, which demands urgent measures against inflation." The PFL deputy for Minas Gerais, Gustavo Krause, the constitutional revision deputy coordinator, said the Social Emergency Fund's immediate promulgation is essential for continuing the revision. Says Krause: "The first case will set a precedent. If the courts do not ban the fund's immediate promulgation this principle will apply to all the other changes approved by Congress." Jobim said on 9 February that he was surprised at the comments by STF members, who spoke before taking any action against immediate promulgation. "It is surprising that judges should speak about actions that have not yet been undertaken. It is not the standard procedure," he said. Jobim claimed that the method already has been provided for in the regulations for the revision, adding that he does not intend to talk with STF members, minimizing the controversy. He believes there is no reason for criticizing the amendments' immediate promulgation. According to Jobim, considering that the revision modifies only some articles of the Constitution, it is not necessary to wait until the end of the process to put the modifications into practice. The PMDB senator for Rio Grande do Sul, Jose Fogaca, said that eventual STF opposition to the promulgation should awaken no concern, especially on the part of the government. He claimed that implementation of the URV [real value unit] by the economic team is very important for the government and does not depend on the Social Emergency Fund's implementation.
