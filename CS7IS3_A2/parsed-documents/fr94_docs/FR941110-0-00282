FR941110-0-00282 FR941110-0-00018 Adenophorus periens (pendant kihi fern) was first collected by Captain Fredrick William Beechey in the 1820s or 1830s. It was not formally described until 1974, when L. Earl Bishop published the name Adenophorus periens. Prior to its description, the names Polypodium adenophorus and Adenophorus pinnatifidus had been erroneously applied to the species represented by Beechey's specimen (Bishop 1974). Adenophorus periens , a member of the grammitis family (Grammitidaceae), is a small, pendant, epiphytic (not rooted on the ground) fern. The rhizome (prostrate stem) is covered with small dark, stiff scales 2 to 4 centimeters (cm) (0.8 to 1.6 in) long. Its yellowish green fronds are usually between 10 and 40 cm (4 and 16 in) long and covered with hairs. The fronds have slightly hairy stalks less than 1 cm (0.4 in) long. Each frond is comprised of oblong or narrowly triangular pinnae (divisions or leaflets) 5 to 15 mm (0.2 to 0.6 in) long with margins that are smooth or toothed and lined with sparse hairs. The pinnae are situated perpendicular to the axis of the midrib, with each pinna twisted such that its upper surface faces upward. Round sori (groups of spore-producing bodies) usually develop in the central portion of the fertile frond, forming two regular rows on each pinna. This species differs from other species in this endemic Hawaiian genus by having hairs along the pinna margins, pinnae at right angles to the midrib axis, by the placement of the sori, and the degree of dissection of each pinna (Bishop 1970, 1974; Hillebrand 1888; Linney 1989). Historically, Adenophorus periens was known from the following general areas: Halemanu on Kauai, the Koolau Mountains of Oahu, the summit of Lanai, Kula Pipeline on East Maui, and Hilo and Waimea on the island of Hawaii (Hawaii Heritage Program (HHP) 1992a1 to 1992a6, 1992a10 to 1992a13). Currently, Adenophorus periens is known from several locations on three islands. On Kauai, one population is known from the boundary of Hono O Na Pali Natural Area Reserve (NAR) and Na Pali Coast State Park on State land, one from Waioli on State land, and four are clustered in the Wahiawa area over a distance of 2 sq km (0.8 sq mi) on private land (HHP 1992a15 to 1992a17; Hawaii Plant Conservation Center (HPCC) 1991b, 1991c, 1992; Lorence and Flynn 1991). On Molokai, there is a single population of three plants on private land at Kamakou Preserve (HHP 1992a7). On the island of Hawaii, four populations are found at Olaa Tract, Kane Nui o Hamo Crater, Kahaualea NAR, and 2.4 km (1.5 mi) northwest of Puu Kauka on private, State, and Federal land (L. Cuddihy, National Park Service, in litt. , 1983, 1988; HHP 1992a8, 1992a9, 1992a14). The population at Kane Nui o Hamo has recently been affected by volcanic eruptions and drought and its status is uncertain (Hugo Huntzinger, National Park Service, in litt. , 1993). The statewide total of 11 current populations comprises approximately 1,280 individuals of this species; on Kauai, there are about 63 individuals; on Molokai, there are 3; and on Hawaii, there are approximately 1,215 (L. Cuddihy, in litt. , 1983, 1988; HHP 1992a7 to 1992a9, 1992a14 to 1992a17; HPCC 1991a to 1991c; Lorence and Flynn 1991).
