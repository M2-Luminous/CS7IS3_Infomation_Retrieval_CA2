Li Lanqing, standing committee member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau, State Council Vice Premier, and head of the task force in charge of cracking down on smuggling across China, chaired the meeting. The meeting held: Since August 1993, various localities across China have conducted a large-scale antismuggling drive. Party and government leaders at various levels, customs, public security, the administration for industry and commerce, and judicial departments have earnestly implemented the instructions of the party Central Committee and the State Council; have unified common understandings; strengthened leadership; have coordinated concerted actions; reinforced discipline; and upheld the policy of "arresting culprits at sea, blocking them on land, checking them in ports, controlling them at markets, and severely punishing them." We have taken concerted antismuggling actions; have integrated joint efforts to crack down on smuggling with improved comprehensive administration over the antismuggling drive; have stopped rampant smuggling activities in some localities; have screened and rectified markets of smuggled goods; and have penalized a group of smugglers. Consequently, the antismuggling drive has yielded interim results. According to incomplete statistics, in the past six months China has uncovered 10,062 cases involving smuggling and sales of smuggled goods amounting to 2.64 billion yuan. The meeting proposed: While conducting the nationwide antismuggling drive in 1994, we should further improve our understanding of the important significance in the antismuggling drive and should strengthen leadership in organizing work in this regard. We should promptly and specifically launch special antismuggling campaigns in accordance with popular issues in smuggling activities to prevent another new wave of smuggling activities from recurring. We should strictly prevent car- smuggling, which has already been stopped, from recurring; and should severely crack down on illegal activities at sea, including smuggling of cigarettes and home electric appliances. We should further intensify the investigation and handling of major and important smuggling cases; should severely penalize smugglers according to law; should strictly enforce the law, supervise, and inspect; and strengthen the development of antismuggling personnel. Li Lanqing said in his speech: The antismuggling drive is a protracted and arduous struggle. It yielded interim results after we have worked hard for more than six months. However, we definitely cannot lower our guard against the serious situation facing the antismuggling drive, and future antismuggling tasks are still quite arduous. He stressed: In 1994, we must realistically improve the understanding of leaders at various levels that the antismuggling drive is a protracted and arduous struggle; further improve our self-consciousness to carry out the antismuggling drive and regard the drive as an important component of the anticorruption struggle; and persistently and unwaveringly keep up the efforts so as to accomplish greater achievements.
