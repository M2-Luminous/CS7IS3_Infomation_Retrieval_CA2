In an exclusive interview with Renascenca, Deus Pinheiro states categorically that the Macedonia issue poisoned things during the Greek presidency: [Deus Pinheiro] They have let things be poisoned by the Macedonia issue and have created some friction both in relations with the member states and in the relations of the presidency with other institutions. Thus a decision by the Commission yesterday to take the case of The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the court of justice. I believe that this decision by the Greek Government to impose a trade embargo on The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--as far as I am concerned--is not only illegal in terms of Community law but also, politically, a shot in the foot. [Annuoncer] That was Joao de Deus Pinheiro in an exclusive interview with Renascenca which will be broadcast in its entirety tomorrow in the Por Ca e Por La program, at 1100 hours. [passage omitted]
