Hubert De Ronceray is still in favor of the application of Article 149 of the Constitution to solve the political crisis. The leader of MDN [Mobilization for National Development] warns against what he calls the newborn national conference industry. Professor De Ronceray who reviewed news highlights for the month of January, stopped on three facts: First, the congress at the national theater. Second, the decision of Haitian employers to shut down commerce and industry from 28 January to 9 February. Third, the new industry of national conferences. Hubert De Ronceray expressed his concern that certain initiatives have the effect of surgery that immediately kills the patient instead of saving him. While condemning the embargo which, according to MDN, has wrecked the economic and social institutions and is forcing 5 million people to despair or revolt, Hubert De Ronceray has urged the country's powerful forces to remain vigilant around Article 149 of the 1987 Constitution and avoid the false path born of confusion and despair.
