Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sources said unlike on 7 January, when it had to be postponed owing to a snag in the on-board computer system, Saturday's blast-off was flawless. However, while the tentative schedule for the blast-off was fixed between 7 and 5 p.m., it actually took off at 5.45 p.m. Agni, which has a range of 2,500 km, is one of the five missiles developed under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. The others being Prithvi, Akash, Trishul and Nag. A network of telemetry and tracking stations at the ITR, the Sriharikota High Altitude Range (SHAR), Car Nicobar and naval ships followed the flight sequence throughout till the payload impacted at the designated target. The white hot object was tracked by the naval ships confirming the success of the mission. The third launch of the test-vehicle was aimed at achieving longer range and advanced manoeuvrability during the re-entry phase of the flight for greater accuracy in guiding the payload to a designated target at long range. The missile used a solid propellant in the first stage and a liquid propellant in the second stage and was fully indigenous. It is 21 metres in length with a take off weight of 19 tonnes and a payload capacity of one tonne. There were no problems with the direction (azimuth) of the missile. Also the missile firing was stable and could do the critical pitch over manoeuvre--when the missile is fired in a vertical position and at a certain height it is deflected about 20-25 degrees during the first stage to put the missile into its designated flight path.
