For health safety, National Quarantine Service Director Wu Tsung-neng said all fishery produce from cholera-affected areas will undergo rigorous cholera checks and be kept for three to four days in customs. A shipment of frozen salmon from Chile, the first delivery of seafood since the government lifted bans on such imports, has already hit the local market, Wu said. Most countries impose no restrictions on fishery produce imports from cholera-affected or potential cholera areas, Wu said.
