In a statement issued here today, the PPP held the Israeli Government responsible for the massacre. This government facilitated the building of settlements for these criminals, armed them, and was lenient toward their previous crimes, such as what happened with the perpetrators of the al-Aqsa Mosque and the Hebron university massacres. The PPP added that the Israeli Government cannot guarantee the Palestinian citizens' security. In fact, it joins in inflicting more Palestinian casualties and punishes their kinsfolk by firing at them and imposing collective punishments on them. The PPP pointed out that such a situation cannot help achieve peace. It demanded that negotiations should be suspended until fair conditions conforming to the resolutions of international legitimacy are in place.
