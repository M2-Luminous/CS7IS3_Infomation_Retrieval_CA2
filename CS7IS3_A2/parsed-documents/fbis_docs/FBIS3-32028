The government announced the increase on 28 January. However, disturbances began on the eve of the announcement when the media leaked the news. Between 27 and 28 January at least four policemen and an undetermined number of students were injured during riots, while over 20 students were arrested. Union leaders and other important Ecuadoran leaders announced that they will promote a national strike and demonstrations this week to protest the increase in fuel prices. They have not specified dates yet. Edgar Ponce, the president of FUT [United Workers' Front] -- the largest workers' organization in Ecuador -- said that the government must understand that the people cannot take any more price increases. Ponce anticipated that the government's economic policy will trigger social explosions in Ecuador, such as the recent conflicts in Chiapas, Mexico, and Santiago del Estero, Argentina. In the public markets the prices of many basic necessities have begun to increase as a result of the increase in fuel prices. The government ordered a 71.2-percent price increase for the fuel with the highest demand and argued that this measure was necessary in order to counter the fall of international oil prices. Oil is the source of half of the government's revenues. An increase in the prices of basic necessities was confirmed in the markets yesterday. The price of milk, for instance, increased by 150 sucres compared to a week ago. In addition, food stores and supermarkets altered their prices eight days ago, without any response from Quito's Police Intendancy. Meanwhile, union leaders said that Ecuadoran workers unions were calling for a 24-hour general strike on 3 February to protest the economic adjustment measures implemented by the government. Edgar Ponce announced that FUT urged all organizations to participate in a preventive strike to request that the government reconsider its decision to increase fuel prices. On 28 January the government announced a 70.2-percent increase in fuel prices to counter, according to the government, a fiscal deficit estimated between $200 and $500 million. Ponce added that the strike is considered as a preventive measure, but it could become a progressive one if the government does not withdraw its decision. In addition, Gustavo Teran, a teachers union member, said that the National Union of Teachers, the Ecuadoran Student's Front, the Federation of Ecuadoran University Students, and Indian organizations will participate in a 24-hour strike on 2 February. Teran stated that the country's mass organizations reject the government's economic measures and will ask for Finance Minister Cesar Robalino to resign and for Congress to issue a statement repealing the measures. This morning, (Teresa Minuchet), a government deputy, asked Finance Minister Robalino to resign. Ponce pointed out that the workers' strike is being called because Ecuadorans have lost all hope that they can have a halfway decent standard of living. Ponce said that they are calling on all organizations to join the struggle by the country's stategic sectors -- Ecuadoran State Petroleum Enterprise, public employees, the Confederation of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador, the Agricultural Coordinating Board, teachers, farmers, drivers, homemakers, students, and the people in general. Ponce added that all Ecuadoreans are angry, and this has become increasingly obvious in the past days. He mentioned that a precedent was set in 1982 when the government yielded to protests and did not increase fuel prices. Today, hundreds of students continued protesting against the measures, and received support from the population, especially in southern Quito. Since this morning, students engaged in heavy confrontations with police in both Quito and Guayaquil, where they blocked several roads and caused traffic jams. Students in Guayaquil seized a bus, despite the fact that the drivers unions said they have not increased fares yet. A student leader said that the students will not allow any increase in transportation fares. Police responded to rocks being hurled by students with tear gas. Student leaders said that during the demonstrations on 28 January, 15 students were arrested while the students kidnapped a policeman. A student leader suggested an exchange of prisoners. Police spokespersons said that demonstrations spread in neighborhoods in southern, central, and northern Quito, most of them in high schools. The police have not reported any student arrests during today's demonstrations. Demonstrations have decreased somewhat due to a heavy rain in Quito and a drop in temperature, although some are still occurring in southern Quito.
