Addressing a combined parade of Army, Air Force, and the police in Kaduna, the head of state, General Sani Abacha, said some misguided citizens have been going round barracks and military formations trying to create confusion. He pointed out that such people were using religious and tribal sentiments in an attempt to discomfort members of the Armed Forces. The head of state, therefore, reminded members of the Armed Forces of their responsibility to ensure peace and stability of the country. Gen. Abacha then warned the soldiers to shun any mischievous characters manifesting themselves as politicians and self-proclaimed democrats. He drew their attention to the fact that in the event of any crisis, the soldiers would be the first victims. The commander in chief assured them that government was fully aware of the sacrifices they were making to keep the country together. He however warned that the present administration would not submit to blackmail from certain quarters in subverting the cause of the democratic process being implemented by government. On the economy, Gen. Abacha acknowledged that the country was passing through a difficult period but assured that the government would fully implement the measures announced in this year's budget to bring relief.
