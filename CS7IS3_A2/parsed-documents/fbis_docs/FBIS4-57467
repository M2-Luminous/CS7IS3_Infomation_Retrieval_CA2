During these past four years we have been working toward the objectives I mentioned that first day. In the government program I outlined for the people, I established the commitment that the Armed Forces would have a professional nature and would not belong to any political party. However, on that day also, I committed myself to putting an end to the war and to consolidating peace; to reducing the Army; and to placing the Armed Forces under the civilian authority of the president. Ever since that April morning we have been working on these objectives. We have been able to reduce the size of the Army from 84,000 men and women to only 14,000, thus turning it into the smallest army in Central America. As a result of this reduction in military expenditures, we have been able to increase investments for repairing and building schools and health centers. Today I am very happy to send to the National Assembly the Bill on Military [word indistinct] and Organization, Jurisdiction, [words indistinct], popularly known as the Military Law. This bill contains three essential military points: It establishes guidelines that ensure compliance with the functions of the Armed Forces, their professionalism, and their nonpolitical nature. The most important aspect of this bill is that once it is promulgated, Nicaragua will have, for the first time in its history, an army clearly subordinated to civilian power, committed to the Constitution, and it will not belong or submit itself to the interests of any political party or social class. Behind us now are the years of armies that belonged to groups or parties and that made the birth of democracy in Nicaragua so laborious. Today we are opening the doors to an Army of all the Nicaraguans. It will be done so that we never lose the democracy that has been won. It was difficult and hard to bring about the agreement with the Army. Never before in the history of Nicaragua had the civilian and military leaders of the country worked to draft laws that would guarantee civilian supremacy over the military. The work was hard and the road the government and the Army had to walk to reach this point was lengthy, but the commitment that both institutions have with a democratic and unified Nicaragua, conquered distrust and [word indistinct]. We have also agreed on appointing the new commander in chief of our nation's Army before the end of the year, just as I have announced on several occasions. This appointment will be made on 21 December of this year. This means that following the conclusion of the two-month transition established in Article 9 of this code, the new commander will be sworn in on 21 February 1995, the centennial anniversary year of the birth of General Augusto Cesar Sandino, and on that day General Humberto Ortega will retire. Dear Nicaraguans, on that 25 April I told you that Nicaragua was inviting us to bury not its children who die in fraticidal wars, but to bury, forever, weapons, so that the muzzles of cannons roar no more, as our National Anthem demands. The divided, poor, and conflict-ridden Nicaragua we received on that day, is being left behind forever. Thank you.
