UNITA's information secretary, Mr. Jorge Valentin, said the atmosphere at the United Nations, the mediator of talks which began in November, had been positive so far, but said government actions were creating mistrust and pessimism among negotiators. Mr. Valentin said the peace talks which had led to agreements in principle on various military and legal matters would be interrupted if the international community did not speak out against an increase in government military action.
