Does Ukraine Need It?"] [Text] We drew similar castles in our childhood -- graceful and inaccessible, hoisting tower spires tipped with cast iron flags and weathervanes into the sky over Brussels. There are not many trees in the city, but those we saw were decoratively trimmed. Their leafless limbs would have finally convinced us of the fabulousness of the city if their gothic crowns had not been ornamented with neon lights by Cartier, Gucci, or Citroen... During our four-day visit in Brussels, we did not have the opportunity to see Brussels in daylight. A Ukrainian delegation headed by Supreme Council Deputy Chairman Vasyl Durdynets would leave its hotel early in the morning, and when it was returning after a strenuous day filled with negotiations, briefings, and consultations, it would already be dark. Although it was an unofficial visit, the delegation included presidential advisers, an aide to the defense minister, and top officials from the Foreign Ministry. The visit had been organized and prepared by the Ukrainian Center for Studying Issues of International Security. The main goal of the visit was to obtain as much information as possible about the "Partnership for Peace" -- the latest NATO initiative -- which, in the opinion of NATO politicians, generals of the NATO Allied Forces Command in Europe, representatives of the North Atlantic Assembly, and all the people with whom the Ukrainian delegation met, "should build not barriers but bridges." "Let us get involved in combat, and later we will see," used to say an outstanding commander. Ukraine did this by announcing its support for the "Partnership for Peace" immediately after a NATO summit, at which leaders of 16 members of the bloc had decided what to do with Eastern and Central European countries knocking on NATO's doors. As is known, it had been decided at the summit not to open the doors but to let them look from behind the fence. Certain countries have received the NATO (or rather U.S.) initiative as a nice surprise, other states such as Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary have seen it as a big disappointment. Why? First of all, because they wanted to receive security guaranties from NATO, to outdistance unstable, bordering Russia, to ensure themselves against possible adventures from internal opposition, and to quiet the issue of redrawing borders, which has recently been voiced more and more often. However, the status of countries that are to join the "Partnership for Peace" is much more different than the one of the 16 permanent NATO members. Whereas the main goal of NATO has always been to protect its members from outside aggression, the "Partnership for Peace" does not mention any protection. This is the first point. Additionally, while soberly assessing reality, it becomes obvious that countries of the former Warsaw Pact are not in conflict with the West but with one another. Presuming that membership in NATO would prevent these conflicts from becoming more radical, they wanted to merge with NATO. However, many NATO officials with whom we met in Brussels emphasized that the Allied Forces defend the bloc members from external attack, not interfering in internal conflicts among themselves. Usually, they would cite the example of Turkey and Greece in this regard. This way, even if small countries of the former Warsaw Pact became NATO members, this would not have any influence on, for example, relations between Romania and Hungary. It is not even worth recalling that the "Partnership for Peace" does not provide such guarantees. One should not hope that this initiative can prevent possible aggression from Russia (in case the ideas of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia prevail). Moreover, the "Partnership for Peace" is a compromise between two superpowers; one of them dominates in the West, the other -- in the East. Undoubtedly, the United States, which plays first fiddle in NATO, was not against extending its sphere of influence to countries of Eastern and Central Europe. However, officials in Washington and Brussels take into account, first of all, the unstable situation in those countries, which may crack the monolith of the bloc, and second, the danger of isolating Russia. After all, I, personally, do not have any doubts that NATO does not want to infuriate Russia. Unfortunately, countries of the former USSR, except for the Baltics and Ukraine, unconditionally approve Russia's sphere of influence. Brussels is far more interested in the above-mentioned republics and countries which border with NATO countries. When the talks touched upon using NATO's peacekeeping forces under the aegis of UN or CSCE, a NATO official stated that the Western troops will never crisscross borders of the former USSR. In general, in his opinion, peacekeeping operations in this region should be conducted by a state which has direct interests there, and NATO apparently does not have any interests in our region, and the more so in the Asian part of the CIS. "We did not even know how to spell Tajikistan," admitted another NATO official. Yet, for the sake of justice, it must be admitted that there are also differing opinions in Brussels. For instance, one of the officials of the International Secretariat said that, in case a conflict erupts in the Crimea, NATO will not stand by indifferently. Nevertheless, the "Partnership for Peace" does not downgrade Russia's interests on "its territory." Hence, the following question arises: What are the real provisions of this idea? The Ukrainian delegation could not obtain an exhaustive answer, since NATO officials also do not have an idea with what the framework of "Partnership for Peace" will be filled. The idea was formulated not long ago, and it became officially presented on the occasion of the visit by comrade Clinton to Europe. It is expected that countries that will participate in the initiative will conduct military training and form peacekeeping forces in cooperation with NATO. The process of joint activities should lead to rapprochement of military authorities, strategic plans, and technical equipment. Only after this preparatory period, which, in the opinion of NATO generals, will take eight or 10 years, admission of new NATO members may be addressed. During the next several months, a structure for encouraging friendly relations among countries that have applied for membership in the "Partnership for Peace" and NATO will be established. Officers-representatives of "Partnership for Peace" members and 16 NATO countries will work out this structure. As of today, this all the information that is available, and it is followed by an array of unanswered questions. Among them are, for example, the following ones: What effect will the participation of CIS countries in the "Partnership for Peace" have on the CIS collective security system? In which countries and how often will training be conducted? (This is not an inappropriate question, since, for example, Poland would not like to host German troops on its territory during joint military training. There is also suspicion that many countries, particularly former socialist states, will not be delighted by the presence of Russian units on their territories.) What expenditures are needed to reach comparable standards of technical equipment? What will the procedures be for admitting new countries to NATO, following the "preparatory period?": Will they be admitted all at once or separately? (According to Western politicians, the "Partnership for Peace" was not been meant as an affront to anyone.) A great many things depend on the answer to the last question. After all, as of today, NATO is not in the best years of its existence. Not the Warsaw Pact but the common taxpayer has become its worst enemy by refusing to finance defense expenditures since the collapse of the totalitarian system. By the year 1995, the number of NATO Allied Forces will have been reduced by 25 percent, and certain units -- even by 45 percent. The lack of a common enemy may boil down NATO to a UN military unit designed to protect or reestablish peace in troubled points. It has not been ruled out that, having expanded itself to the entire northern hemisphere, NATO will catch a second breath while facing a potential South-North conflict. Still, NATO is the only guarantee for stability in Western Europe, and this alone is sufficient justification for its existence in today's unstable times. Nonetheless, the concept of global security is as follows: The times of blocs have gone. For many, it is hard to realize that. Not taking into account the fact that the "Partnership for Peace" was meant to calm Russia's fury but considering it as a bridge unifying the entire northern hemisphere from Vancouver to Vladivostok, it becomes clear that Ukraine should participate in it. After all, the system of global security is to last dozens of years, and we should participate in digging its foundation. It is particularly important to realize this today, when the "Partnership for Peace" is merely an insurance policy without any guarantees for Ukraine, and we do not have money to pay for it. Ukraine itself will have to finance military training and the modernization of equipment, since NATO is not interested in our outdated defense industry complex or TU-160 airplanes. Therefore, the decision concerning Ukraine's participation in the "Partnership for Peace" is a political decision aimed at a long perspective rather than the present moment. Today, it is necessary to concentrate our attention on the economy, conduct reforms, and make all possible efforts to include the entire potential of the state in this process. This is the only way we can receive security guarantees. Only having revived our economy, we will be reckoned with. Only this way, we will be able to withhold our decisions and integrate into a civilized Europe. For the time being however... For the time being however, at the NATO headquarters in Brussels, at the conference room where the Ukrainian delegation met with top officials of the NATO International Joint Chiefs of Staff and Secretariat, two maps of the world hang on the wall: One depicts 15 states, the other displays four black letters painted against a pink background -- USSR. The sooner we will convince the whole world and NATO members that the second map is obsolete the better...
