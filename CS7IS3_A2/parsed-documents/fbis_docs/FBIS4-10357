Luis H. Moreno refuses to accept the conclusions of a U.S. report, which states that the Panamanian Government has implemented several measures to reduce the risks involved in misusing the Panamanian banking center. [Begin Moreno recording] Bankers in the National Banking Association, among whom I count myself as a representative of the National Bank of Panama, have done and continue to do everything possible to reduce the incidence and risk of misuse of our services in the form of money laundering. We have not done it because the United States asked us to or because we want to qualify for a loan, but because we are convinced that attacking and fighting money laundering is a patriotic duty. In so doing, we are also fighting drug trafficking, one of the worst plagues of our time, which jeopardizes our young people and our entire community. That is the real reason; it is not to qualify as one of the good little boys. All we want is to fulfill our patriotic duty. This government has carried out innumerable actions and made great effort that have been unacknowledged until now. Beginning in March 1990 we took effective steps to control cash deposits at banks. Since then and for the last four years, Panama has implemented an incredible number of controls such as that last measure you just mentioned: declaring the amount of cash one is bringing into the country when going through customs, which is something many other countries do. We will continue to do so, because this is not something that will go away with two, three, or even 100 measures. The United States, which is the qualifying party, launders the most money in the world. The United States invests tens of billions of dollars each year and they have still been unable to do solve the problem. [end recording]
