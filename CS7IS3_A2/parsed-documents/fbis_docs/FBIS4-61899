FBIS4-61899 "drsov091_t_94007" FBIS-SOV-94-091 Daily Report 10 May 1994 BALTIC STATES Estonia Ruling Party Faction Protests Russian Victory Celebration Ruling Party Faction Protests Russian Victory Celebration WS1005143494 Tallinn BNS in English 1255 GMT 10 May 94 WS1005143494 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] Tallinn, May 10, BNS -- The parliament faction of the senior political party in the Estonian governing coalition, the Pro Patria, issued a protest against Monday's [9 May] lighting of a memorial fire at the feet of a statue of Russian soldiers killed in World War II. The temporary re-lighting of the fire in the memorial at Tonismagi, Tallinn, was authorized by Tallinn City authorities. The Pro Patria faction in its statement today reminds that the victory of the Soviet Union over Nazi Germany in World War II meant for Estonia just replacement of one occupation with another. "Also at the meeting at Tonismagi yesterday calls directed against the Estonian statehood were voiced and the symbols of a country that occupied us -- of the Soviet Union -- used," the Pro Patria says. Quoting the fact that the Tallinn council and City Government are headed by opposition Coalition Party leaders Tiit Vahi and Jaak Tamm, the statement also points out that at a time when the Coalition party-led municipal administration gave a green light to the anti-Estonian rally, also attacks by the opposition against the Estonian Government delegation for talks with Russia have escalated. "The Estonian delegation has remained true to Estonia's interests in everything and everywhere. At the same time we are concerned about the using of the Russian card as a tool to achieve domestic political aims by some political forces. We cannot go to concessions over issues vital to the Estonian state and people," the statement reads. The permission issued by the municipal administration to Russian organizations to re-light the eternal fire was also protested by another ruling coalition member -- the National Independence Party. "Lighting of the eternal fire was a moral support to the occupation forces still in Estonia," the party's Tallinn branch said in a statement. The protests came after Russian organizations had held a ceremony at the Tonismagi memorial before noon on Monday to mark the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. Wreaths were laid at the monument Monday by representatives of the Tallinn veterans league, the Russian Assembly, Russian deputies in the City Council, and the Russian Embassy in Tallinn. The ceremony was followed by an Orthodox Holy Liturgy in the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral at nearby Toompea.
