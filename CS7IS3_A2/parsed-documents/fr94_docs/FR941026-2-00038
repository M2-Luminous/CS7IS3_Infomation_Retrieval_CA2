FR941026-2-00038 FR941026-2-00022 (12) Information on the availability of less environmentally damaging practicable alternatives to satisfy the basic project purpose_reducing traffic congestion in the greater Nashua area_taking into account cost, technology, and logistics; (13) The extent to which local improvements, such as adding additional lanes, overpasses, and mini-bypasses, could provide traffic relief; (14) The effectiveness of TDM/TSM in reducing traffic under a no build or partial build alternative. If a full build is permitted, what TDM/TSM solutions should be implemented and why?; (15) Information on the current mitigation plan and whether it would replace the functions and values of the aquatic habitats destroyed or degraded; (16) The potential for a different or supplemental mitigation plan which could reduce the direct and indirect impacts of the NHCH to an environmentally acceptable level. Mitigation could involve avoidance, by bridging for example, additional wetland creation, habitat preservation, additional water quality mitigation measures, watershed and aquifer preservation, up-front success requirements or other factors. Recommendations of appropriate sites are encouraged. (17) The current preservation package and additional preservation options, and whether the protection could offset the likely secondary and cumulative impacts of the highway. The record will remain open for comments until December 6, 1994. All comments will be fully considered in reaching a decision to either withdraw the proposed determination or forward to EPA Headquarters a recommended determination to prohibit or restrict the use of the wetlands as a disposal site for construction of Nashua-Hudson Circumferential Highway.
