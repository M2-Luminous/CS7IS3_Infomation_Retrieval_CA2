Participating in the conference and exchanging views were nuclear energy specialists from the United States, Canada, Japan, Russian, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine. The primary purpose of the conference was to draw up directions for the development of nuclear energy in our country under the leadership of the Republic National Nuclear Center. What does that mean? This means that the former testing area, the equipment and reactors used for tests there, will be used for peaceful purposes, that is to supply energy to industry and the economy. However, there will be nothing easy about this. This is something which will be resolved only after a lot of discussion. In particular, there is concern about future safety. Thus, our reporter shares with us some of his thoughts arising from the conference regarding these issues. It cannot be hidden that, towards the end of the 20th century shortage of energy supplies in all corners of the world are cooling the people's economy. It is clear that this crisis is giving our country something to think about, along with the other Soviet republics which have now achieved their independence. This conference taking place in our Republic also discussed plans drawn up for the future of energy in our country. Energy, in Kazakh terms, light and heat, are certainly sources of life. At present it is possible for any thinking citizen of our sovereign country not to think about energy? However, if we are not to depend on others for the sources of life, are there possibilities for us to create them ourselves? Do we need nuclear power plants or do we not need them? We need them. If we can develop them in a way not dangerous to our lives what is wrong with that? There is a throbbing which has remained behind in the hearts of our people. It is the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. No one has yet forgotten it. They cannot forget it. This being the case, the most important question is the safety of human life. What must we do to achieve this. On this account the question must be posed more broadly and more directly. We must provide a complete and thorough ecological evaluation of the damage to the environment and to the people due to explosions and tests in Kazakhstan, and, likewise, in all of the nuclear testing areas of the world. Likewise, we must broadly research the effects of a nuclear power station on the environment and on the people. Together with this, the questions of protection in social and economic terms of those harmed by explosions in the former testing area, of assisting the people in ecological, biomedical and psychological terms, of regulating from a legal and political standpoint the resolution of very critical environmental questions, of creating a mechanism for economic security, must assume primary priority. In order to accomplish this, we must form an authoritative international commission. Without this an uneasy people will make known its alarm at the damage, aside from the benefits of a nuclear power station. According to what was said at the conference by the scientist-specialists, a nuclear power station built according to the work plans of the National Nuclear Center is not something that can be completed in the near future. It seems that it would take 10-15 years. However, looking very critically at preparatory work going on now is something which will be a guaranty of the life of the people. This being the case, we must not keep the work which has begun out of sight of the people. Indeed, I am not against the objectives for the development of the people's industry and enterprise. However, we must not forget that nuclear power specialists are subordinates, and we must remember that a great deal of secrecy is associated with their work. There is another major question which must be discussed here. That is the danger that Kazakhstan will remain a repository for radioactive wastes. This is a problem for Semey Oblast in particular. There is no doubt that the former testing area has been closed. However, there are still radioactive wastes left behind by the explosions. We must not forget that they will still present a problem after our time has passed. Burial of these radioactive wastes has now become a major issue. Ghadilet Andianuly, director of our Republic's National Nuclear Center, in answer to my question, said: "It is right that you should be alarmed about this. However, we cannot take things which came to life here and bury them in other places. Countries will not receive the radioactive wastes of others. Bearing this in mind, we must look for the right way, make wastes safe and bury them on our own lands. Major measures will be needed to achieve this. However, at present we cannot say where we will bury these wastes. State permission and a decision will be necessary for this. At the same time, the views of local people will be heard. On the other hand, the talk of building a nuclear power plant is something different. It must take place when our Republic is suffering economic difficulty. Its importance is very great for removing industry and the economy from crisis. A safe nuclear power station could have a major influence upon a clean environment. The reason is that many thermo-electrical power stations in our republic produce massive amounts of dust, smoke, and cinders. If we take into consideration that on top of this, 16 billion tons of wastes from the production and processing of valuable resources are collected in the storage areas of industrial establishments. All is nothing but poisons. Thus, to be free of this a safe electrical station is needed." We listened to the speech of Professor Yoshi Fujie, chief of laboratory research for nuclear reactors of the Tokyo Technology Institute. According to what Yoshi Fujie said regarding the safety of nuclear reactors for humans, there is no nation ahead of Japan in this area. For example, while the accident at Chernobyl shocked the world, there have also been accidents in the United States, Britain, and France. However, there has not, up to the present, been a single accident in Japan, which in one of the smallest territories in the world has the largest number of nuclear energy reactors, 42. It appears that the first nuclear power plant was opened [in Japan] during the second half of the year 1950. In the future the number of nuclear power plants in Japan will reach 55. We thought that we must take our example from a country which has so successfully dealt with the atom. One interesting thing, is that the dangers of a nuclear power plant do not frighten the Japanese. The professor proved this completely. The reason is that the Japanese seem confidant of the knowledge of their nuclear specialists and scientists. When we think about this, it becomes apparent that we also need scientists and specialists with profound knowledge, who have been produced by our people. Whatever we say, we know our own souls. This is the reason why we look with less confidence on others who come to take advantage of us. In this connection we must speak of the educational establishments which are to be opened by the Kazakhstan National Nuclear Center. They will prepare future atomic scientists and specialists of our own nationality. As for specialist cadres, Fedor Fedorovich Safanov, deputy chief scientist for the Semey Testing Area, USSR state prize laureate, mentioned, in this connection, that many scientists of the former testing area had gone to Russia. When I asked: "what will you do now?", the major-general replied: "I will remain in Kazakhstan. I will become one of the scientist-specialists of the nuclear power plant." This person drew attention to the involvement of the National Nuclear Center with the area's environment, to questions such as turning over the task of investigating the testing area and quickly cleaning up the radioactive wastes there, and to overcoming the danger when the subterranean riches of the area are recovered. In any case these are proper concerns. We will have to investigate each of them individually in the future. The investigation should begin now. Nuclear energy should inspire not a little fear in human beings. In support of this we may mention the accidents at nuclear power plants in the United States, Britain, and Ukraine. According to official information, nuclear production appears to have polluted the surface of the earth at a level of 6 million curies. Two and a half thousand of the 60,000 nuclear weapons made during the age of nuclear testing have been exploded for test purposes. More specifically, it is no secret that almost 1,000 have been exploded in the United States, and more than 500 in the former Soviet Union, most of them in Kazakhstan. Each explosion has done irreparable damage to the environment, and to the people living in the testing area. Since the closure of the Semey testing area, efforts to overcome and clear up the damage have gone forward very slowly. The ones responsible have not had to explain their guilt before the people. Let us take a quick look at one fact. The United States has spent a total of 10 trillion dollars on all types of arms since the Second World War. At present, however, up to 200 million dollars are appropriated each year to clean up the environment. With us there is no money at all for such work. To tell the truth, in our country the ecological rights of people are not protected. Due to little oversight, the sources of nuclear power and the nuclear industry are continuing to increase pollution by radioactivity. First and foremost, the ecological rights of citizens must be protected at the state level by a special law. "Make no mistake about it. What we are doing is discussing now the future of nuclear energy." So said V. Vasilenko, chairman of the Council of Experts for Social Ecology of the "Nevada-Semey" International Antinuclear Movement. We are on no easy path. As we have said, local people must still bear in mind one frightening thing. This is the fact that things have not been collected from test sites in the testing area. It seems that presently the livestock of the people are being pastured in these areas. It has been claimed that testing area authorities have been forced, because of a lack of funding due to market pressures, to leave the area unguarded or otherwise unsecured, and that they have no choice but to sit on their hands. But does it have to be like this? On 29 August, 1991, our hair stood on end when we realized that there was still the danger of an explosion prior to Republic of Kazakhstan President Nazarbayev issuing an official edict to close the Semey Testing Area. Since the Russian and Kazakhstan governments did not quickly made a decision about this, the situation remained very difficult. The local people were very alarmed at this. In fact, the testing area has been closed, but we cannot free ourselves from the danger. This being the case, we are thinking of building a nuclear power plant in the 21st century. This will prove a correct decision. However, when a nuclear power plant remains incomplete, how can we clean up the mess in the testing area? The thought disturbs us that with one labor remaining incomplete and still dangerous, how can we begin a second, new effort?
