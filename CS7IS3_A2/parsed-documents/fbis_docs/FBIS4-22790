Only the Reuters agency was left. In April on Channel 1 a program will be aired which for now has the conventional name "Post Scriptum." Thanks to the Ostankino television company, Reuters will finally break into our information field. On Saturdays there will 50 minutes about all over the world. It will be an information vinaigrette made up of video materials on any subject: from fires in the forests of the Amazon to the Oscar ceremonies--the topics for the program will come from 130 Reuters bureaus scattered throughout the world. The agency's Moscow office receives "pictures" from all over the world 24 hours a day. Then the short subjects are sold to television companies--each takes a maximum of two minutes. And 90 percent of the items are not used. "Post Scriptum" will work with this material. Initially they wanted to call the program "The World and Us." Incidentally, this name reflects the subject matter of the program better, but it sounds fairly hackneyed for our TV. Ostankino is placing great hopes in this program. The deputy chairman of the television and radio company, Grigoriy Shevelev, at a news conference devoted to the grand new project proudly emphasized that in principle Russian journalists could create such a program even without help from Reuters. The problem is that, as always, we lag behind in technology--both the production of programs and technical support. Cooperation with Reuters, which can offer fantastic possibilities for our television--from the organization of television bridges from any point on the planet to live interviews with the Queen of England or Bill Clinton--is extremely advantageous for Channel 1. On the other hand, Ostankino's image, in Shevelev's opinion, is costing a great deal. True, this can be debated. At the present time the television company has lost its best information personnel in Yevgeniy Kiselev, Tatyana Mitkova, Mikhail Osokin, and other stars, and the news programs on Channel 1 are regularly withering before our eyes. Representatives of the Reuters agency have not spoken about the project's commercial advantage for their side but they have not insisted on being called patrons either. The Ostankino leaders are hoping for the project to be incredibly successful also because the extremely popular television journalist Vladimir Molchanov has agreed to host the program. According to the contract he will not only draw on the information agency's bottomless well but also will be able to order Reuters material himself. This is a privilege that none of our television journalists has ever had before. He will have complete freedom and independence in selection. And we will be able to see and judge the results ourselves. Most likely Reuter's topics will acquire a Russian interpretation on Vladimir Molchanov's program. This project is just the beginning of cooperation with Reuters, which even today is thinking about taking the next step--creating a joint news program. "Post Scriptum" will be an information program, but it is not intended to have anything in common with "Itogi," "Namedni" or "Voskresenye." In turn, Molchanov announced that his program would not be political. Perhaps the viewers will actually see normal present-day life and not reminiscences of the accursed past or somber thoughts about a gray future. Looking at the last authorial programs of the popular journalist and host, many people were about to decide that Molchanov was "finished." It is no wonder that his journalist colleagues ask themselves if they were seeing a dying Molchanov. But we still did not forget that Vladimir Molchanov is a high-class professional and his remarkable information-entertainment program "Before and After Midnight" became a lively political program after the fourth broadcast. At the same time the lyrical Molchanov cannot get used to live broadcasting and the fast pace: In times that are now long past he hosted the "Utro" and "Vremya" programs. Vladimir Kirillovich himself thinks that the program will be devoted primarily to the main aspects of the life of civilization: "We have become very gloomy people. I am afraid there may not be any people in all the world gloomier than those in Russia and the former republics of the Soviet Union. So we want to recall that the world lives not only with problems of murders, gangsterism, poverty, and racketeering. We hope that many of our programs will deal with special subjects. Perhaps the very first program will be devoted to the world of the press and television." But fans of the "early" Molchanov should not foster illusions about a revival of "Before and After Midnight," which so many loved. The more so since the old team (Irina Zaytseva, Aleksandra Livanskaya, and Aleksey Denisov) have their own work and programs. Moreover, Molchanov does not want "Post Scriptum" to be called his program.
