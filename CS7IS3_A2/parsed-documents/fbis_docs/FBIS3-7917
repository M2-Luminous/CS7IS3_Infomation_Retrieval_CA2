Taking account of the historical truth concerning Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], the Constitutional Forum categorically rejects the Serbian and Komintern thesis of Macedonianism and, in conformance with the facts of history, declares that the Slavs in Macedonia are native [prirodni] Bulgarians. We are distressed, however, to have to confirm that the agents of authority representing the Bulgarian state continue to handle the Macedonian question in the spirit of the Komintern doctrines. In this connection, the Constitutional Forum demands the following: -- Reestablishment of the historical truth concerning the Bulgarian nature and origin of the Slavs in Macedonia. The president, parliament, and government should issue declarations to this effect and mount an international campaign to defend the national rights of our compatriots. -- Opposition by diplomatic means to the pressure being applied to Macedonia by Greece and Serbia to ensure the possibility for the state of Macedonia to develop in peace. We are convinced that the democratic Bulgarian public is bound to defend the historical interests of the Bulgarian national spirit in Macedonia, while our state guards against a settlement of the Macedonia question by the use of force. We call upon the mass media to handle the Macedonian question in conformance with the historical truth.
