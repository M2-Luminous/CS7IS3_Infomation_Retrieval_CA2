FR940822-1-00028 FR940822-1-00006 12. Sites Which Cannot Be Released for Unrestricted Use Comment. Many commenters stated that the NRC should establish standards for both unrestricted and restricted release of sites while others recommended that the NRC require all sites to be remediated suitably for unrestricted use. Some commenters stated that sites should continue to be licensed by the NRC if they cannot be reasonably decontaminated. Also, commenters stated that the NRC should consider the option of restricted future use of decommissioned facilities only after a rigorous public participation process. Many commenters stated that unrestricted release should be the goal, but that realistically, some sites cannot be remediated suitably for unrestricted release. Response. The proposed rule provides for both unrestricted release and restricted termination of the license under prescribed conditions. The requirement that the licensee convene a Site-Specific Advisory Board early in the development of proposed decommissioning plans should help ensure substantive public participation in decisions concerning possible restricted termination of the license. As previously discussed, the staff is aware of sites, such as sites with significant volumes of thorium contamination, that will require extensively remedial efforts to achieve the proposed requirements for restricted or unrestricted release. If these sites cannot be remediated to achieve at least the restricted release criteria, then the site license will remain in effect indefinitely until technology or resources become available to achieve compliance with the criteria. In the interim period, NRC will ensure appropriate control of the licensed site on a site-specific basis, including access restrictions, environmental monitoring, personnel monitoring, posting, mitigative actions, and other measures directed at ensuring the stability of the radioactive material and protection of the public health and the environment. 13. Waste Disposal Comment. Several commenters questioned whether there is enough space at a regional disposal facility for the voluminous soils and other materials that are expected from decommissioned sites. Other commenters stated that irrespective of where or how wastes are disposed, the costs of nuclear waste management will be high. Some commenters suggested that the option of leaving radioactive wastes on-site should be considered as a temporary or intermediate option to permit decay of radioactive wastes and allow time for resolving long-term waste disposal problems. Response. The NRC staff recognizes that decommissioning to radiation levels approaching background may produce large volumes of low-level waste which could affect the availability of regional disposal capacity. However, the proposed rule would require the licensee to consider significant radiation doses and risks resulting from transportation and disposal of radioactive wastes generated in the decommissioning process when determining ALARA for a specific decommissioning action. If disposal capacity were to become temporarily limited, on-site storage and containment of wastes may be necessary until a disposal site becomes available. However, any temporary onsite storage and containment of radioactive wastes be done under the provisions of an existing NRC license, and the site would not be decommissioned until this waste had been removed from the site. The radiological and non-radiological impacts associated with disposal of the types of radioactive waste generated in decommissioning were considered in NRC's development of the Environmental Impact Statement in support of the low-level waste disposal requirements in 10 CFR Part 61. Impacts associated with extended storage of waste onsite or at a centralized storage facility would typically be considered as part of environmental analysis in support of issuing or renewing facility licenses or of approving decommissioning actions at a licensed facility. 14. Minimizing Generation of Waste Comment. Many commenters recommended that the NRC discourage or stop licensing nuclear operations that generate nuclear wastes. Several commenters stated that environmental organizations would be willing to talk about ways to decommission nuclear operations and to dispose of radioactive materials only if power plants were no longer permitted to operate. Other commenters supported the continuation of nuclear power. One commenter urged the NRC not to take sides for or against nuclear power and stated that the policy debate on the relative merits of various power-generating options should be held in another forum (e.g., Congress). Some commenters observed that high costs of decommissioning and waste disposal could help to minimize waste generation. Some commenters recommended that the rulemaking should deal with source reduction of nuclear wastes. Some commenters suggested that decommissioning proposals should be submitted and approved at the design stage and, consequently, newer facilities should be easier to decommission. Response. The NRC agrees that newly licensed facilities should be encouraged in designing and operating nuclear facilities to minimize the generation of radioactive waste and facility contamination. The proposed rule would require applicants for licenses, other than renewals, after the effective date of the rule to describe in the application how facility design and procedures for operation will minimize contamination of the facility and the environment, facilitate eventual decommissioning, and minimize the generation of radioactive waste. 15. Radon Comment. Many commenters recommended that the NRC should impose limits to control exposure from radon emissions at decommissioned sites because radon exposures could be a significant health problem. Commenters in favor of NRC setting a radon standard stated it should be possible to make a good estimate of how much radon comes from licensed material. Commenters not supporting the NRC's setting a radon standard stated that the need to deal with radon at licensed sites should be considered site-to-site and that radon control should be left to local zoning boards and housing authorities. Response. The NRC staff believes that it is not possible to measure or distinguish concentrations of radon which will produce radiation doses of a few mrem TEDE/y above background using current technology. This belief is based on: (1) Recognition of the ubiquitous nature of radon in the general environment; (2) Large uncertainties in the models used to project radon concentrations in indoor air based on soil concentrations of precursors; and
