Chechen law enforcement bodies stormed the buildings seized by rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov who organised a mutiny against Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev's rule. Casualties were reported on both sides. Such an outcome had long been foreseen by Chechen leaders who repeatedly insisted on the disarmament of illegal groupings. Last Saturday, Groznyy's military commandant ordered the leaders of illegal armed groups to surrender and hand in their arms. The National Security Department officially charged one of the most influential field commanders Ruslan Labazanov with destabilising the situation in the republic. Labazanov once served as Dudayev's adviser but later the Chechen leader distanced himself from Labazanov who is now said to be in charge of a group of several hundred people. The rebels led by Labazanov and Suleymanov equipped with firearms and seven armoured vehicles marched to the centre of the city this past weekend and presented a list of demands to Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev and his government. The government unsuccessfully tried to settle the conflict through negotiations, but after long and fruitless debates rebels opened fire on the headquarters of the National Security Department and attempted to stage a rally on the central square. By 4 a.m. presidential forces sealed off the rebels in one of the districts of the city and after a long fight involving armoured vehicles stormed four five-storey houses they occupied. About 15 to 20 people were wounded on both sides. The government troops lost eight people, including the commander of a task-force unit, Khamzat Khankarov. One of the rebel leaders, Suleymanov, was arrested and hospitalised in a critical condition. The fate of Labazanov remains unknown. The search for the rest is underway. The Chechen Government is holding an emergency session to discuss the situation and ways to normalise it. Informed sources said that the opposition of the Nadterechny and other "rebellious" districts was not involved in the incident. Commenting on the situation in the republic, Yaragi Mamodayev, leader of the government of "Popular Trust" who was recently banished from the republic, stressed that Dudayev has no other alternative but national reconciliation. Mamodayev calls for forming a coalition government which he is ready to head and for the soonest Russian-Chechen talks. "We do not want confrontation or opposition between the Chechen people. We call for reconciliation and a political dialogue," he said.
