He said those meetings produced positive results which three months of talks with Israeli negotiators could not produce. Sha'th expressed the belief that what was achieved in Davos was the most that the Palestinians could achieve. He said: Today we are very close, closer than some might think, to reaching an agreement ensuring the beginning of implementation of the declaration of principles. Sha'th, however, refused to say when he expects a final agreement to be signed, adding: Our negotiating experience with the Israelis makes it difficult for us to set any timeframe. In an exclusive statement to AL-QUDS, Sha'th said: We should always remember that we are in a transitional stage in which the Israelis will maintain their presence in two points -- the settlements and the borders. It was agreed in the Declaration of Principles to call those points "foreign security and the settlements' security." We succeeded in confining this presence to the narrowest possible geographic area with the provision that there will be a Palestinian presence opposite the Israeli presence. Sha'th stressed that the Davos accord preserved Palestinian personal and national dignity. On whether the prisoners' issue was raised at the 'Arafat-Peres talks, he said: We are talking about an overall agreement that includes a reasonable timetable for releasing all Palestinian prisoners, without exception.
