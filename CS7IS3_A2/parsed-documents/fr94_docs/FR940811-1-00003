ACTION: Extension of time for filing comments. SUMMARY: The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') has requested public comments on its Trade Regulation Rule on Care Labeling of Textile Wearing Apparel and Certain Piece Goods (``the Care Labeling Rule'' or ``the Rule''). 59 FR 30733 (June 15, 1994). DATES: Written comments will be accepted until October 15, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments should be directed to: Secretary, Federal Trade Commission, Room H&hyph;159, Sixth and Pennsylvania Ave., N.W., Washington, DC 20580. Comments about the Care Labeling Rule should be identified as ``16 CFR part 423_Comment.'' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Constance M. Vecellio, Attorney, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, DC 20580, (202) 326&hyph;2966. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On June 15, 1994, the Commission published a request for comments on the Care Labeling Rule as part of its oversight responsibilities, to review Rules and guides periodically. Specifically, the Commission requested comments about the overall costs and benefits of the Rule and its overall regulatory and economic impact as a part of its systematic review of all current Commission regulations and guides. The Commission also requested comment on whether the Rule should be modified so as to: (1) Permit the use of care symbols in lieu of words; (2) revise the requirements for care instructions in order to provide consumers with information about whether a garment can be both washed and dry cleaned; and (3) clarify the ``reasonable basis'' requirements of the Rule. The comment period was scheduled to close on August 15, 1994. However, citing the complexity of the Rule, the American Textile Manufacturers Institute requested that the Commission extend the comment period for 60 days, until October 15, 1994. To provide all interested parties with an adequate opportunity to address the issues on which comment is sought, the Commission has determined to extend the comment period until October 15, 1994 List of Subjects in 16 CFR Part 423 Care labeling of textile wearing apparel and certain piece goods, Trade practices.
