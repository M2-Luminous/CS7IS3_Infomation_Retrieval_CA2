Numerous employees will have to be laid off in the next few years, and several institutions will have to be closed down. Resistance has developed to these plans. In the middle of an election year, the defense experts of the Bundestag will have to deal with a explosive document. After internal talks among the Bundeswehr leadership, budget and defense experts of the parliament in Bonn are to discuss the document before the elections in October. The report by Luftwaffe General Lorenz Huber might become the basis for a major austerity offensive within the Bundeswehr. It is becoming clear that the soldiers might not be the "main victims." The analysis that the representative for rationalization measures, drafted together with economic advisers, will hurt the army of civilian employees. The 370,000 soldiers are currently being supported by 151,000 civilians. Moreover, it is still unclear whether the 660 Bundeswehr barracks can be maintained. Huber's assumption is as follows: Administration is inefficient and highly unproductive in large parts of the armed forces. Thus, repairs are being carried out with too many personnel. The comprehensive report mentions several critical areas: - Stocks are too large: The arsenals of the Bundeswehr are worth 55 billion German marks [DM], with ammunition alone involving DM16.5 billion. A total of 70 percent was not requested in the last two years. - Expenditure is too high: In 1983 operating costs alone amounted to 77 percent of the defense budget. They could be reduced by 10 percent. - There is too much unproductive employment: A total of 130,000 people, including 35,000 civilians, are responsible for supply and service support. It is becoming clear that deep cuts could be carried out in the arsenals of the navy. The auditors believe that the workshops could do their jobs with 35 percent fewer people, thus saving DM850 million by 2002. In the army, 4,000 jobs might be reduced if no new jobs are created for those in repair units. In the hangers of the air force [as published] and its stores, 60 percent of the 3,000 employees would be superfluous if industrial yardsticks were applied, the working groups called Combat Team Huber at the Bundeswehr found out. A comparison between an air force hanger and Dasa reveals the following: The enterprise that belongs to the Daimler concern works with 50-percent higher productivity and at costs that are 30 percent lower. One of the major reasons for this deplorable state of affairs is that there are too many levels -- up to 10 -- of responsibility. The working group has not issued any specific recommendations for the reduction of jobs, which is very difficult to carry out anyway: Many civilian positions are held by employees with tenure. Moreover, there are firm plans to reduce civilian jobs from 19,000 to 13,000. Yet there is always room for more cutbacks: Expenditure on education measures (involving over DM2 billion) could be reduced considerably if civilian training institutions were also used. As in every civilian enterprise examined by auditors, the middle management of the Bundeswehr rejected Huber's proposals for cutbacks. Annoyed about reductions concerning other items in the defense budget, some generals have refused to cooperate. Huber signed the report, handed it over formally, and then asked to resign. He claimed he was not receiving sufficient support. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe was not exactly happy. Huber is to receive a practice-oriented job -- as the head of the Procurement Office of the Luftwaffe.
