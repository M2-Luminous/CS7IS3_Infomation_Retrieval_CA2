FBIS4-29599 "dreas118_a_94030" FBIS-EAS-94-118 Daily Report 17 Jun 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Coalition Urges Invalidation of Hosokawa Summons Coalition Urges Invalidation of Hosokawa Summons OW1706154694 Tokyo KYODO in English 1441 GMT 17 Jun 94 OW1706154694 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, June 17 KYODO -- The ruling parties urged House of Representatives Speaker Takako Doi on Friday [17 June] to invalidate the lower house Budget Committee's decision to summon former Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa for testimony on his suspected personal financial deals. Ichiro Ozawa, the coalition's top strategist, and other ruling coalition officials handed over to Fukumaru Tani, secretary general of the lower house Secretariat, a letter of requests addressed to Doi, political sources said. Tani was quoted as telling the officials that Doi had no other choice but to regard the committee decision on Thursday as being properly taken. The coalition letter criticized lower house Budget Committee Chairman Tsuruo Yamaguchi for overriding coalition members' objections and declaring that Hosokawa must testify under oath next Tuesday. The coalition officials also handed over a letter to Yamaguchi demanding a re-vote on the issue, the sources said. The lower house Secretariat, however, has already taken procedures to summon Hosokawa, officials said. The law for testimony of witnesses under oath in the Diet provides penalties of imprisonment up to a year or a fine up to 100,000 yen against those who refuse to testify without adequate cause. Ozawa, secretary general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], the coalition's core party led by Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, told reporters that Hosokawa does not have to testify, calling the committee decision "invalid." For their part, the two largest opposition parties -- the Liberal Democratic Party and the Social Democratic Party -- proposed the punishment of former Labor Minister Toshio Yamaguchi, an independent lower house member, saying he tried to throw a glass of water over Tsuruo Yamaguchi when the committee chairman declared that Hosokawa would be summoned. The opposition parties forced the summoning motion through the Budget Committee in an apparent bid to use Hosokawa's case to their advantage and force Hata's minority government to step down. Hosokawa's questionable deals were partly responsible for his resignation as premier in April. Hosokawa's former financial secretary told the budget panel Wednesday that Hosokawa has paid back a 100 million yen 1982 loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa Kyubin trucking firm, denying allegations that Hosokawa may not have repaid the money and that it was received as a secret political donation.
