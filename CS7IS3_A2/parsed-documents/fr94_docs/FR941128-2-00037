We will work closely with you and your staff to develop a responsive Implementation Plan. The Implementation Plan will be forwarded to you in accordance with 42 U.S.C. §22864. The Implementation Plan will provide specific milestones for accomplishing the commitments described in the preceding paragraph. ␣␣␣Sincerely, Hazel R. O'Leary.
