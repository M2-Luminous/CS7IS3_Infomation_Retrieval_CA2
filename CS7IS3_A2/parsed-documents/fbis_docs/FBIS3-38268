[EL PAIS] How would you explain CiU's cooperation with the PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] to a citizen of Ribadeo or Jerez? [Roca] It can be explained very easily: Spain has a government thanks to us, and if there were no government, we would be much worse off than we are. The mere announcement of the agreement between CiU and the PSOE was sufficient for the Bank of Spain to lower interest rates the following day. If there is any kind of measure to encourage the productive economy, job creation, or tax improvements for enterprises, it will be thanks to the proposals which we have introduced into the overall budgets. Much remains to be done, and we cannot be completely satisfied, but it is clear that all this shows quite a favorable balance sheet and, if recovery begins in 1994, the effort will not have been in vain. [EL PAIS] Are you saying that accusations that everything you have done was in return for quids for quo for Catalonia are untrue? [Roca] It is terribly irritating and unfair to accuse us of acting with only Catalonia in mind; nobody has been able to present evidence to substantiate it. The famous transfer of 15 percent [of personal income tax revenue to the autonomous communities] benefits everybody: Everybody approved it, and there is Galicia, which now wants more, and the Balearics, which said no and then changed their mind. This is a bad way to conduct politics, and a dangerous way. [EL PAIS] Have you anybody in particular in mind? [Roca] I have somebody in particular in mind, but I will not say who, because that would be rising to the bait they wish to set for us. I will have a clear conscience not to have responded to that falsehood. It was very rough play, of a kind that is hard to forget. [EL PAIS] Are you pointing at the People's Party? [Roca] They will know. I will not say, but you cannot tell lies with impunity or try to create a bad image in the rest of Spain without any restraint in generalizing about all Catalans, which is even more offensive, because it also includes those who voted for them. [EL PAIS] Why do you not defend yourselves against the accusations of blackmail? [Roca] It is not for us to defend ourselves. That would be accepting a strategy that seeks to put us on the defensive. Let the PSOE explain why it is demanding our cooperation. A few months ago, the People's Party would not speak of pacts, and now it is very eager. The United Left [IU] is also attempting this; whether it would be sensible to accept its terms is another matter. CiU does not reject extending the pact, but let it be clear to everybody that reaching agreement means forgoing taking advantage of the crisis. Those who reach agreement courageously accept the aim of emerging from the crisis -- not benefiting from it. [EL PAIS] It is asserted that Jordi Pujol is more chary of cooperation with the government than you. [Roca] When Pujol said he was not entering the government, he was accused of being unsupportive; when we give support from outside the government, we are called Phoenicians [fenicios -- allusion unknown]. Is it not our participation in decisionmaking that some people find hard to accept? Is it or is it not possible that there is a blueprint of a strong and legitimate state for the whole of Spain on the basis of a Catalan nationalist vision, or can we only have a blueprint for Catalonia, because we are a Catalan nationalist party? We have already given the answer: Catalan nationalism is also an idea about what Spain can and should be like -- certainly more pluralist than others see it. [EL PAIS] If the People's Party wins the next election without a majority, will you give them your cooperation? [Roca] We will speak when the next legislative term comes. In any event, you will appreciate that it must be very awkward to demand cooperation of somebody who is so reviled. Look, in Europe 12 heads of government of all ideologies meet and reach agreement on an economic action and job creation program that should be implemented in their respective countries. In Spain it is not possible to reach agreement on this same policy with the People's Party, which does not accept what its ideological families advocate there. [EL PAIS] For how long will you continue to support the Socialists? [Roca] Our support will always be given in terms of the agreement of aims. If the agreement disappears, we will see. It is for the Socialists to administer this stability which we have made possible in order to seek new areas of agreement. The change in economic policy is not complete; more things are needed. Is there or is there not a desire to carry on? It is for the Socialists, not ourselves, to reply. We are affected by neither the criticisms nor the difficulties: Are they prepared to accept the correction which economic recovery will require of them? [EL PAIS] The Socialists are accused of winning the election with a left-wing vote only to reach agreement with the Catalan right. [Roca] The current political situation requires strong and sound leaderships. Society wishes to feel it is involved in a project which those directing it believe in. This injection of conviction could be even more important than the actual success of the measures contained in the project. Spain lacks guidance and leadership; there are contradictions, apprehensions, and hesitations, and an impression of lack of conviction about the measures proposed is being conveyed. That is Spain's most important deficit. It is up to the government and Felipe Gonzalez to rectify the defici. [EL PAIS] So do you believe the IU's reproaches are giving the government a complex? [Roca] I do not know whether or not what the IU could say is giving it a complex. It should have no reason to have a complex. I know of no government in Europe the reaches agreement with the IU's counterparts; that is why Julio Anguita accuses Gonzalez of doing the same as the other European governments are doing. [EL PAIS] How could internal clashes in the PSOE affect emersion from the crisis? [Roca] The PSOE is too important for its problems not to affect the country's own image, its reputation, and even the ability to create confidence in the future. The Socialists must understand this. How can they call for efforts while they themselves simply cannot reach agreement? If their congress does not go well, the consequences will affect everybody. [EL PAIS] How is your cooperation with the central government understood in Catalonia? [Roca] What we are doing is understood very well. Everything is being done very comprehensively, without any kind of specific repercussions for Catalonia. There may be people who tell you: "You could take advantage of the situation," but we have not done so, and we are glad that this is so, although I will not disguise the fact that we feel dissatisfied at not having made progress in the autonomy field. There is a false impression, as if autonomy were a Catalan or Basque matter. I believe that none of what Catalonia demands in the field of implementing autonomy is rejected by the others. We have undertaken the role of promoting the implementation of autonomy in Spain from which everybody later benefits. [EL PAIS] The impression is that you people feel comfortable in your role of assisting the government. [Roca] We are very bad at handing out criticism; our sense of responsibility gets the better of us. We like to take part in decisionmaking, but, moreover, the house's political makeup is being forgotten here. We are the only ones who can do what we are doing. The People's Party feels it is the alternative, the IU believes it must constantly oppose, and the others are too small to muster the seats which bring stability. We have not fared badly. We have already supported the Union of the Democratic Center, and CiU is the only political force in the whole of Spain that has increased its number of voters in every election since 1979 -- from 500,000 votes in 1979 to 1.16 million in last October's election.
