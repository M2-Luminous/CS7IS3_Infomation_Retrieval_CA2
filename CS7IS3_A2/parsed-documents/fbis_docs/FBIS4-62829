One of the party leaders, Aleksandr Vengerovskiy, told the chamber that his party has repeatedly been the object "of aggression from the mass media" and insisted that the program author and commentator, Nikolay Svanidze, be suspended until the court tries the case. Vengerovskiy's supporters failed to muster enough votes to request the leadership of the Russian Television Broadcasting Company to act accordingly. The press service of the Liberal-Democratic Party in the State Duma circulated a report announcing that "all members of the LDPR group of deputies in the State Duma have filed suits in the court against Svanidze".
