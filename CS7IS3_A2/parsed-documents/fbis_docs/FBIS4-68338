Kamanin "Is Access to Outsiders Allowed?; Our How We are Entering the World Space Market" the first paragraph is an introduction] [Text] The critical state of the national space industry is approaching a limit beyond which its resurrection in the years immediately ahead may become impossible. In striving to avert the impending catastrophe, the Russian Space Agency (RSA) is imparting maximum efforts for the commercialization of all space activity in the country and to enter the world market. Recent publications in the foreign press give eloquent testimony of the "successes" attained by the RSA in this field. To start off I will cite an article by J. M. Lenorovitz, senior international editor of AVIATION WEEK AND SPACE TECHNOLOGY, included in a special number of this journal in the Russian language under the highly promising title "Russian Commercial Launches Not Far Off." "The United States has defined the conditions for entry of Russia into the world market for commercial launches of boosters and has notified West European representatives of the need for concessions in the direction of development of free competition. The fact that an American-Russian agreement was signed ... has caused dissatisfaction among representatives of the American aerospace industry..." This same article states that one Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican from California, tried to console the representatives of the leaders of aerospace companies, declaring that it was necessary "to perceive the appearance of a competitor in the form of Russia to be a result of the collapse of the Soviet Union, long awaited by the United States." Just what are the conditions causing the dissatisfaction of American entrepreneurs, who for some reason or another have "forgotten" the principal precept of the businessman: "Whatever you do in this world you have to pay for it?" Under the adopted agreement Russia up to the end of 2000 can conclude not more than one contract annually for the launch of geostationary satellites by Russian carriers and contracts for the launch of low-orbit satellites must be specially examined in each individual case; the "bilateral agreement applies to all satellites put into space regardless of where they were constructed and by what countries they will be operated." Businessmen in the United States have exhibited a touching concern about the income of Russia: the amount of payment for each commercial launch of the Proton carrier must not be less than 92.5% of the price asked for similar launches by American or West European companies. Moreover, the congressmen and representatives of the American administration are not without success playing the role of good Samaritans, as if defending Russian interests against the encroachments of evil West European commercial interests. The latter, it goes without saying, are not delighted with the attempts of "Russian agents" to intrude themselves into the "trade ranks" of the world space market. But American businessmen, in turn, are anxious about the considerable fraction of Western Europe in profits from commercial launches of satellites despite their own relatively small (35%) share. That is why they, relying on the protectionist policy of the American government, are striving to dictate their rigid requirements on the concluding of trade deals with both new and well-known competitors. As declared by an assistant of the U.S. Trade Representative, Peter Allgeier, ... the representatives of Western Europe are trying to load the agreement, defining such (fettering for Russia and other potential competitors -- L. K.) rules, with simplification of the procedure for their obtaining sanctions by the American government for carrying out launches. What kind of profits can we count on in the event that the bilateral agreement enters into force within the framework of the restrictions set by them? Yuriy Koptev, general director of the Russian Space Agency (RSA), declares with assurance that participation of boosters in commercial launches and the sale of rocket-space technology will annually bring Russia not less than 200-220 million American dollars. However, we take into account that in 1992 the total world profits from the commercial use of space technology attained 13.2 billion dollars; the income from the use of boosters did not exceed 1.2 billion, that is, 9% of the total sum. This means that the country which was the first to blaze the trail into space will be allowed to receive for making its boosters available to other countries not more than 1/60th of the total world "space profits." So that, pardon me for saying so, is the net result of commercialization... And then there's another "space ultimatum" which the American administration directed to the Russian government in connection with the contract concluded in 1991 between the USSR Glavkosmos and the Indian Space Agency on the delivery of cryogenic engines to India. For the freezing of the two-million dollar contract with India we were handed a "bird in the bush": increased chances for Russia to participate in construction of the Freedom orbital station were promised. President Clinton, on the basis of expert evaluations, has set a limit of 10.5 billion dollars on the financial expenditures for constructing the Freedom station up to the end of the 20th century, either independently or in collaboration with Western Europe and Russia. As already reported in the press, the Russian prime minister Vladimir Chernomyrdin, in setting off for negotiations in the United States, declared that the participation of Russia in implementation of the Freedom project would enable the Americans to come out ahead by more than two billion dollars. But what would we receive? The directors of the Russian Space Agency declare that for the assistance which Russia will give the United States in constructing the station they will pay us 600-700 million dollars. We note: in the event of adoption of a joint trilateral project a good half of the station modules will be units developed for our future Mir-2 station and the American laboratory will be occupied with not more than a quarter of the total volume of construction. Why, you may ask, do we place such a low value on our work, our scientific and technical achievements? After all, the minimum cost of the American "quarter-share" of the future station is estimated by American specialists at 10.5 billion dollars, whereas the Russian "half," if our prime minister is to be believed, is only the 2 billion saved by the Americans due to use of units from the Mir-2 station. And why can we, if the RSA is to be believed, receive only a third of this obviously understated sum? From everything said above a conclusion follows which is as evident as it is disconsoling for us: neither our West European space partners, nor the Americans, are burning with desire to have still another competitor in the space technologies and services market. And therefore our penetration into the world space market conforms to the Russian proverb: "he went for the wool and returned with the clippings." Editor's note. The author of the article has touched on the most important aspects of the entry of Russia into the world space market. We are sure that there also are other opinions on this subject. Accordingly, we invite all interested readers to continue the initiated discussion.
