We can only imagine an opening toward the MSZP if the SZDSZ is the dominant force of the coalition, SZDSZ campaign chief Balint Magyar said at the party's news conference on 1 April. He also said that the chances of the SZDSZ forming a coalition with the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] are minimal. Magyar believes, however, that cooperation with the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP] is "worth considering and it can be a healthy development in a given situation." It seems to be natural -- and is also supported by public opinion polls -- that people want to vote the MDF out of government. The only question is whether the people will give their confidence to the SZDSZ or the MSZP to form the government. According to Magyar, it is the SZDSZ whose policy will not increase the division of society. Therefore, the ideal solution would be a government dominated by liberals, with a concentric structure. The data that 81 percent of people would like to see the SZDSZ as part of the future coalition also shows society's support for the party. However, in order also to find the way toward the center right parties and to form a broad coalition, it is necessary that the MSZP does not become dominant. Gabor Fodor reported on the public opinion poll data according to which the SZDSZ is "slowly but surely" progressing toward its goal. According to Fodor, it is important that the MSZP has the largest number of sure supporters but, because of the characteristics of the Hungarian electoral system, the SZDSZ may achieve a very good result in the second round of the elections. It can be expected that, because the MSZP considerably divides society, many people will choose the SZDSZ in the second round because it is the least rejected party. In contrast to this, due to the worrying processes in the party and the strengthening power of the etatist trend that advocates redistribution by the state, the MSZP is rejected by a large segment of society.
