In an interview with the Port Moresby newspaper, THE NATIONAL, Mr. Iangalio said that although export prices for oil and other commodities were rising and PNG was experiencing a high level of economic growth, the government budget deficit was unacceptably high, and foreign reserves were falling to crisis level. He blamed Papua New Guinea's financial troubles in part on the closure of the Bougainville copper mine, over optimistic estimates of government income and success of budget, and uncontrolled spending by the public sector over a number of years.
