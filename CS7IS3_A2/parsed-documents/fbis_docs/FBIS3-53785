PPP Parliamentary sources told Dawn that both the Bhutto ladies had decided to sort out their differences without involving anybody else and issuing statements against each other. The PPP parliamentary party held a meeting at the Prime Minister's House on Sunday [16 Jan], which Begum Nusrat Bhutto was not at all expected to attend. But, according to sources, everybody was surprised when she entered the hall where the meeting was about to begin. All the participants stood up and loudly said: "Welcome, welcome." Begum Bhutto then went to the Prime Minister and kissed her. She also kissed Mr. Asif Ali Zardaris's forehead. Begum Bhutto, the sources said, kept smiling during the meeting and exchanged pleasantries with the members. According to one member, she said how could she quarrel with her own daughter, specially when Mr. Nawaz Sharif and his colleagues were all out to take advantage of a family feud. The sources said Begum Bhutto also briefly chatted with Mr. Shabbir Chandio, MNA [Member of National Assembly] from Larkana, and told him that she had decided to work out an amicable solution to differences with her daughter, without involving anybody else. The sources said that the Prime Minister had a detailed meeting with President Farooq Leghari on Saturday [15 Jan] night and discussed with him Begum Bhutto's quarrel with her and her partymen. The President assured her that he would meet PPP's former chairperson after he returned from a tour of Saudi Arabia and try for a reconciliation between the Bhutto ladies. The sources also termed it a ceasefire and according to Ms. Rukhsona Bungush private secretary to Begum Bhutto there would not be anything special for another "three or four-days." She was tightlipped when approached for further comment. She however, said: "Things are improving, you better wait." The sources said the Prime Minister and Mr. Asif Ali Zardari drove to Begum Bhutto's house on Saturday night without any protocol. They stayed there for quite some time and discussed their differences on a number of issues. Begum Bhutto reportedly broke into tears and embraced and kissed her daughter. She said she was not expecting the Prime Minister and her husband. The sources claimed that there was a gradual thaw in relations but were the mother and the daughter. "Both Begum Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto have ultimately realized that their differences could be exploited by the issueless Opposition led by Nawaz Sharif," a source said, claiming that a formula was being worked out for a permanent peace between them. The entire press corps of the capital reached the Parliament building on Sunday just to have a first-hand report on the differences between the Bhutto ladies since Begum Bhutto was to move a privilege motion and a resolution in the National Assembly [NA] secretariat to discuss Jan 5 incident at Larkana. Almost the entire I'ML (N) [Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz] parliamentary party took part in Sunday's proceedings sensing that there would be a lot of fireworks in the National Assembly. However, according to NA secretariat sources, she had decided not to move any motion in the House. Party sources said it was difficult to say at this stage that differences between the Bhutto ladies had been removed. But the sources sounded quite optimistic that the meeting held on Saturday night would ultimately lead to a rapprochment between the mother and the daughter.
