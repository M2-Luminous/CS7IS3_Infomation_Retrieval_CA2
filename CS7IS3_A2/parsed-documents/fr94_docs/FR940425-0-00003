FR940425-0-00003 FR940425-0-00001 Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived its review process required by Executive Order 12866. This rule adds Germany to the list in part 94 of countries declared to be free of rinderpest and FMD. This action removes the prohibition on the importation into the United States from Germany of ruminants and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat from ruminants, and relieves restrictions on the importation from Germany of milk and milk products from ruminants. This action does not relieve restrictions on the importation of live swine and fresh, chilled, and frozen meat of swine from Germany because Germany is still considered to be affected with hog cholera and SVD. Based on available information, the Department does not anticipate a major increase in exports of ruminants and fresh, chilled, or frozen meat of ruminants from Germany into the United States as a result of this rule. The value of total U.S. imports of cattle in 1992 was $1.24 billion; U.S. imports of sheep in 1992 totalled about $2 million. The United States did not import any cattle or sheep from Germany during 1992. In fact, no cattle or sheep were imported into the United States from any country in Western Europe during 1992 (USDA, National Agricultural Statistical Service [NASS], Agricultural Statistics Board [ASB] ``Agricultural Statistics, 1992''). Western Europe is not a source of ruminants for the United States and we anticipate that any increase in the importation of ruminants from Germany as a result of this rule would have a negligible impact on existing trade patterns. Currently, due to APHIS restrictions, the United States does not import uncooked meat or meat products from Germany. In 1991, total meat production in the United States (excluding pork) was just under 10.7 million metric tons, while total meat production in Germany (excluding pork) was 2.2 million metric tons, about 20 percent of United States production. It is improbable that Germany would begin to export any significant portion of its meat products to the United States as a result of this rule. Therefore, we estimate that the effect of this rule on domestic meat prices or supplies would be insignificant. Similarily, we do not anticipate a major increase in exports of milk and milk products from Germany into the United States as a result of this rule. Importation into the United States of all dairy products, except for casein and other caseinates, is restricted by quotas. Furthermore, while the United States imports more than half of the casein produced in the world and the regulations allow casein and other caseinates to be imported from countries where rinderpest or FMD exists (if the importer has applied for and obtained written permission from the Administrator), Germany currently exports only a small amount of casein to the United States. For example, in 1992, the United States imported 95,000 metric tons of casein worldwide, but only about 2,400 metric tons (2.53 percent of worldwide imports) from Germany. Consequently, we believe that declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD will have no significant effect on the amount of casein imported into the United States. The effect of declaring Germany free of rinderpest and FMD on the trade in bovine embryos and semen would also be minimal. The United States is a net exporter of bovine embryos and semen; in 1991, the value of bovine embryo and semen exports totalled to $46.5 million and 10.2 million, respectively, while imports amounted to only $2.7 million and $89,159, respectively. Though similar trade data was not available for Germany, we believe that due to the relatively small size of the German market, any increase in the export of bovine embryos and semen from Germany would have a minimal impact on the United States market. It is not likely that many United States importers, all of whom are considered small entities by Small Business Administration standards (defined as having fewer than 100 employees), will be interested in importing bovine embryos and semen from Germany. APHIS expects that the value of any imports will be minimal in comparison to the domestic production of these entities. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.
