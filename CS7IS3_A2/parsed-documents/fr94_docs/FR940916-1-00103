FR940916-1-00103 FR940916-1-00016 In this rulemaking FRA proposes to allow significant increases in the maximum distances trains may travel between brake system inspections where mechanical forces perform the inspection function (including a complete inspection under 49 CFR Part 215). The latitude that would be provided under this rule would result in fewer inspections per distance traveled and reduce the number of opportunities that will exist for a serious defect to be found before it could result in a train accident. It is imperative, therefore, that each inspection be of uniformly high quality. Meaningful and enforceable qualification requirements for personnel will help raise the overall quality of inspections. Technological change presents an additional reason for placing strong emphasis on qualifications of personnel. Train crews and mechanical personnel alike are confronted with an increasing variety of power brake arrangements and features. Recently, the Association of American Railroads has announced an intensified effort to develop and deploy electronic braking systems on freight equipment. These trends will make it important for personnel to be fully familiar with the systems that they are required to inspect and maintain. FRA recognizes that although technological advancements may increase the need for more qualified maintenance forces, they may also reduce the complexity and extent of the inspecting and testing requirements for certain equipment with the emergence of brake indicators and sensors or the development of more reliable equipment. Consequently, FRA proposes to establish broad qualification requirements and issue specific training and experience guidelines based on the type of inspections, maintenance, or tests an individual employee performs. Several railroad commenters suggested that there is no reason for individuals who solely perform pre-departure air brake tests and inspections to be as highly trained as a carman. FRA tends to agree with these commenters since carmen perform many other duties which involve the maintenance and repair of equipment in addition to brake inspections. Therefore, the proposed training guidelines are less stringent for those individuals that perform only brake inspections and tests. FRA intends for these training guidelines to apply not only to railroad personnel but also to contract personnel and personnel in plants that build cars and locomotives that are responsible for brake system inspections, maintenance, or tests. The American Public Transit Association (APTA) suggested that FRA provide broad training and experience guidelines and allow each railroad to develop its own qualification and certification program, which FRA would then review and approve if it met the general guidelines. This method provides significant flexibility to each railroad, but would require complex and timely evaluation of a potentially large number of disparate plans. FRA's experience with this ``review-and-approval'' approach (e.g., the locomotive engineer certification program) indicates that FRA's limited resources are severely overburdened when FRA is required to approve individual plans for over 600 railroads and many contract facilities that perform work subject to the regulations. This could result in some plans not being finally reviewed and approved for several years. While providing latitude for innovation, this approach could also become a source of costly disputes. FRA believes that the approach contained in this proposal may avoid many of the problems inherent in an approach similar to that suggested by APTA while preserving its advantages. FRA intends to propose broad performance-based standards in the rule text for various individuals depending on the type of brake work they perform. Due to the significant proposed incentives that are being offered to railroads that use personnel meeting the proposed qualification requirements for mechanical and electrical inspectors to perform brake work, FRA must be able to determine uniformly if sufficient training and experience have been afforded to those individuals deemed qualified by a railroad. Consequently, FRA also intends to issue specific training and experience guidelines that FRA believes, based on its considered judgement, a railroad's training program must contain in order to ensure individuals possess the minimum knowledge and skills necessary to perform the duties required of them. FRA believes that this approach will allow each individual railroad the flexibility to develop and implement a program to train and qualify employees and issue credentials based on its own unique operating conditions and equipment, while ensuring that a minimum level of competence is maintained throughout the industry. Although FRA is proposing that specific training and experience requirements be issued as guidelines, at this time, FRA recognizes that the purpose and need for these requirements may be better served if these guidelines were part of the rule text and will consider this option when drafting the final rule. Therefore, FRA solicits comments from interested parties regarding not only FRA's proposed approach to this issue and the specific training and experience guidelines contained therein, but also any comments or opinions as to whether the specific training and experience guidelines should be contained in the text of the final rule. FRA also recognizes that there may be other approaches that are equally viable. Consequently, FRA seeks comments from interested parties regarding alternative methods and approaches for ensuring that properly qualified individuals are performing brake inspections, tests, and maintenance. Commenters are requested to identify alternative criteria for training programs and to specify present or planned approaches that might be unduly constrained by the text of the proposed rule. FRA also has some concerns regarding the application of the proposed experience and training guidelines to newly hired train-service employees. There is a current trend toward the use of smaller train crews, and thus, heavy reliance will in some cases be placed on a single ground employee with little training and experience. In order to avoid this pitfall, FRA specifically solicits comments regarding various methods and approaches for structuring training programs to ensure that the proposed training and experience guidelines can be met by newly hired train-service employees prior to their being assigned duties for which the training and experience are required.
