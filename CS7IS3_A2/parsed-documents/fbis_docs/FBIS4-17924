Yeltsin understands the doubts expressed in the State Duma regarding the advisability of holding joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises at the Totskiy training ground in Orenburg Oblast. Having studied a pertinent submission from members of the State Duma, the opinions of deputies and military experts, and the assessments of the opposition, the president has instructed the Ministry of Defense to hold additional consultations with the U.S. side regarding this issue and to reconsider the matter with due regard for both the stance of the Russian lawmakers and comments made in this connection by the general public. But meanwhile.... Pentagon Pressure U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has called Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and urged him to make efforts to ensure that the joint Russian-U.S. command and staff exercises planned earlier by Moscow and Washington go ahead in Orenburg Oblast This was announced by U.S. Department of Defense spokesman Kathleen de Laski, commenting on a report from the Russian president's press service passed to the Pentagon by ITAR-TASS's Washington desk regarding the possible cancellation of the joint exercises. The Russian defense minister noted the concern expressed by W. Perry regarding the exercises and promised to relay this concern to the government, deLaski said. As far as we know, the Russian Government has not yet made a final decision on the exercises, which are slated for July this year. In the opinion of the U.S. Government, these exercises will represent a very good start to broadening contacts between the two states' armed forces. We naturally hope that the plans to hold them will materialize. The cancellation of the joint Russian-U.S. military exercises at the Totskiy training ground near Orenburg "would be a blow to U.S. efforts to develop cooperation with Russia," THE WASHINGTON POST writes. According to Pentagon spokesman David [as published] Boxx, U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry regards the joint exercises as "an important symbolic first step toward cooperation between the military departments of Russia and the United States." Citing a high-level representative of the U.S. Defense Department, the newspaper indicates that "the issue of holding the joint exercises, and also Russia's participation in the Partnership for Peace program, will be discussed next week during a visit to Moscow by a high-level delegation of Pentagon representatives who are traveling to Russia for planned consultations with the Russian side on a wide range of problems associated with ensuring security."
