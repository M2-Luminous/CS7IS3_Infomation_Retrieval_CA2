Their statements are included in the report by Commissioner Jean-Pierre Lachapelle, appended to the parliament's Ancia file. At the request of the Liege examining magistrate, Veronique Ancia, the inspector also scrutinized the contracting procedures. He concluded that they amount to a case of unfair competition. Following an inspection at Agusta, inspectors from the High Committee of Inspection concluded that the Italians sold their helicopter at 12 percent under the cost price. According to the inspectors, a twin-engined helicopter was supplied for the price of a single-engined helicopter, constituting "a sale at a loss." The company refused to offer any explanation for this "abnormally low price." "On the basis of the legislation regarding public contracts and the comments of Professor Flamme (the same expert which Deputy Prime Minister Guy Coeme called to his defense), this was sufficient reason to refuse the Agusta offer," writes inspector Lachapelle of the High Committee. He confronted three high-ranking army officers with this conclusion. They openly agreed with him. "According to the law, a contract may not be awarded in such circumstances," declared General Major Jacobs on December 1992. "I did not know it, but Agusta's offer should have been rejected on the grounds that the price was abnormally low," said General Major Fournier on 8 December 1992. Control From Inspector Lachapelle's report, it also appears that the Finance Inspectorate could not subject the contracting file to a thorough financial control. Inspector De Caesemaerker had just 24 hours in order to give an "urgent advice." [passage omitted] There was no question of a budgetary control. "In agreement with the minister," the assistant private secretary to the national Defense Minister Guy Coeme -- Jean-Louis Mazy -- decided to sidestep budgetary control. Such control is, however, obligatory by the terms of the ministerial decision of 13 March 1986. The head of the department responsible for the budget control protested against this maneuver. According to Mazy, budget control was scrapped "in order not to unnecessary delay the procedures." Nothing of the question, says inspector Lachapelle of the High Committee: "The real reason is that a delay in the procedure would have obliged the authorities to take account of the latest offers from Aerospatiale (Agusta's French competitor)."
