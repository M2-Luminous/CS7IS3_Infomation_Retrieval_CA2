FR940208-0-00040 FR940208-0-00019 d. Permit renewal exclusion. Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (8) at IAC 27&hyph;40.32 that would exclude the need for a permit renewal if the Division determines that the phase II bond was released over the entire permit area before the expiration of the permit term. This proposed language is similar to OSM's final rule at 30 CFR 773.11(a) published in the April 5, 1989, Federal Register (54 FR 13814), that establishes that a permittee need not renew the permit if no surface coal mining operations will be conducted under the permit and solely reclamation activities remain to be done. However, the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 773.11(a) continues by requiring that obligations established under a permit continue until completion of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, regardless of whether the authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been terminated, revoked, or suspended. Iowa incorporates by reference, at IAC 27&hyph;40.31(207), that portion of 30 CFR 773.11(a) which requires that obligations established under a permit continue until completion of surface coal mining and reclamation operations, regardless of whether the authorization to conduct surface coal mining operations has expired or has been terminated, revoked, or suspended. Therefore, the Director finds Iowa's proposed rule at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(8) to be no less effective than the Federal regulation and is approving it. e. Permit application information. Iowa proposes to add a new paragraph (9) at IAC 27&hyph;40.32 that modifies its incorporation by reference of 30 CFR 774.15(b)(2)(i) to require that, in addition to the application information required by the Federal provision for a permit renewal, an applicant must also provide information concerning the ``current status of the mine plan, other details and the time table_if different from the one previously approved_for the remaining phases of the operation and reclamation plans.'' While the corresponding Federal regulation does not require this additional information, in accordance with section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11(b), the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations that are more stringent than those imposed under SMCRA and the Federal regulations. Moreover, the State regulatory authority has the discretion to impose land use and environmental controls and regulations on surface coal mining and reclamation operations for which no Federal counterpart exists. Section 505(b) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 730.11 dictate that such State provisions shall not be construed to be inconsistent with the Federal program. Therefore, the Director is approving Iowa's proposed revision at IAC 27&hyph;40.32(9). 15. IAC 27&hyph;40.34(3), Permit Application_Minimum Requirements for Legal, Financial, Compliance, and Related Information Iowa proposes to add, at IAC 27&hyph;40.34, a paragraph (3) that specifies that the general word substitution of the term ``Act'' with the term ``Iowa Code chapter 207'' at IAC 27&hyph;40.1(2) does not apply to 30 CFR 778.14(c), as incorporated by reference into the Iowa program, regarding minimum information requirements about violations that must be included in any permit application. As discussed in Finding No. 12 of this document, references to ``the Act'' in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 778.14(c) and section 510(c) of SMCRA include, in addition to SMCRA and its implementing regulations, all State and Federal programs approved under SMCRA. See e.g. (48 FR 44344, 44389) September 28, 1983. See also (53 FR 38868, 38882&hyph;38883) October 3, 1988. Thus, 30 CFR 778.14(c) requires information regarding violations received pursuant to SMCRA or any State or Federal law, rule, or regulation enacted or promulgated pursuant to SMCRA. In addition, 30 CFR 778.14(c) requires information regarding violations received pursuant to any non-SMCRA Federal law, rule, or regulation, or any non-SMCRA State law, rule, or regulation which was enacted pursuant to Federal law, rule, or regulation, which pertains to air or water environmental protection and which were received in connection with any surface coal mining and reclamation operation. Therefore, in the context of the State's incorporation by reference of the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 778.14(c), the term ```Act'' must be understood to have the same meaning that it has under the Federal program.
