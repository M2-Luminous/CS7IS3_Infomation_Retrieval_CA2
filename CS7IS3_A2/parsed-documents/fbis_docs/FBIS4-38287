FBIS4-38287 "drnes126_o_94002" FBIS-NES-94-126 Daily Report 30 Jun 1994 SYRIA Paper Criticizes Shamgar Commission Findings Paper Criticizes Shamgar Commission Findings JN3006070894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network in Arabic 0445 GMT 30 Jun 94 JN3006070894 Damascus Syrian Arab Republic Radio Network Arabic BFN [From the press review] [Text] Under the headline of "Peace of the Massacres," AL-THAWRAH comments on the Israeli report on the massacre at the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron. It says: We did not expect that the Israeli judiciary, which is tailored to suit Israeli foreign propaganda, would condemn Rabin's government or hold it responsible for the Ibrahimi Mosque massacre. The objectives of the Shamgar Commission's task are known. They are designed to clear the Israeli government and its army of responsibility for the blood of the victims of treacherous Israeli terrorism, to improve the Israeli image, and to eliminate the negative impact of the massacres on international public opinion. The newspaper emphasizes the danger signal that should draw our attention, which is that the Israeli government -- which the Shamgar Commission's report did not hold at all responsibile -- has warned, in a statement by Yitzhaq Rabin himself, that there is no guarantee that another massacre can be prevented. According to Rabin, terrorism and actions by mad people cannot be controlled by his security organizations. In a comment on the Commission's report, General Ehud Baraq, Israeli chief of staff, literally said he cannot guarantee that such incidents will not recur. A thorough reading of Rabin and Baraq's statements, AL-THAWRAH says, makes it apparent that Rabin and Baraq expect more massacres in the future. The newspaper says the report gives the green light to settlers to commit more massacres. The report intentionally covers the nature of the circumstances in which the crime was carried. These circumstances urge Rabin and Baraq to emphasize that other massacres are possible and claim that the occupation army will not stop these massacres.
