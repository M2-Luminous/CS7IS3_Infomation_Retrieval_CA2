Some 900 exhibitors from 35 countries are taking part in the week-long air show at the Changi International Exhibition and Convention Center. Opening the show, Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier General Lee Hsien Loong, urged the local aerospace industry to look beyond the confines of its home industry. He noted that Singapore has benefited from the rapid growth in aviation in the region. Last year, investment commitments in the industry here grew by over 40 percent to 163 million [Singapore] dollars. Gen. Lee said Singapore will continue to service the region as one stop center for aerospace services. It will also continue to play its role in developing the regional aviation market and aviation infrastructure. Gen. Lee however, noted that one potential obstacle to the growth of the industry would be infrastructure bottlenecks, especially insufficient airport capacity. He said newly developing economies like Vietnam and China will need to upgrade airport management, air traffic capabilities, and to build new airports as traffic volume expanded. Gen. Lee said economic liberalization in the region would create more growth and business opportunities for the aerospace industry.
