FR940812-1-00002 FR940812-1-00001 DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Agricultural Marketing Service 7 CFR Part 1004 [DA&hyph;94&hyph;19] Milk in the Middle Atlantic Marketing Area; Proposed Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Order AGENCY: Agricultural Marketing Service, USDA. ACTION: Proposed suspension of rule. SUMMARY: This document invites written comments on a proposal to suspend certain provisions of the Middle Atlantic Federal milk marketing order for the months of September 1994 through February 1995. The proposed suspension would reduce the percent of receipts that must be disposed of as Class I disposition by pool distributing plants, provide automatic pool plant status for supply plants and reserve processing plants that were pool plants during the months of September through February, and suspend the limit on the amount of milk that may be diverted to nonpool plants by cooperative associations and by pool plant operators. The suspension was requested by several Middle Atlantic cooperatives and handlers who contend that the suspension is necessary to assure that producer milk which has been historically associated with the market will continue to be pooled and priced under the order without incurring unnecessary and uneconomic movements solely for the purpose of maintaining pool status. DATES: Comments are due no later than August 29, 1994. ADDRESSES: Comments (two copies) should be filed with the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Gino M. Tosi, Marketing Specialist, USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, Room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6456, (202) 690&hyph;1366. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601&hyph;612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on certain milk handlers and would tend to ensure that dairy farmers would continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing. The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866. This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule. The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601&hyph;674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling. Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the suspension of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the Middle Atlantic marketing area is being considered for the months of September 1, 1994, through February 28, 1995: 1. In ยง1004.7(a), the words ``40 percent in the months of September through February, and'' and ``in the months of March through August,''.
