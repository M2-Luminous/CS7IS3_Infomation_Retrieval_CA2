By obtaining concessions from Banque Indosuez, which will represent syndications to be formed for the loans, the Korean government will be able to lower finance costs by $170 million, the Ministry of Finance said yesterday. In addition to low interest rates, the Ministry said, other terms such as debt-payment periods are favorable. The accord on the terms of the proposed French loans to Korea was signed by Chong Tok-ku, director-general for economic cooperation at the Ministry, and M. Tabouis, senior vice president of Banque Indosuez, yesterday afternoon. Korea and France are scheduled to sign an agreement on the French export and commercial loans in August this year after syndications are formed for the loans. The annual interest rate on a $1,617 million loan to finance the French export of TGV supertrains to Korea has been lowered from the 7.28 percent level to 6.25 percent, the Ministry said. The cut in the interest rate will save $150 million, the Ministry said. Added to this is $4.6 million saved from the reduction of the commitment fee from 0.325 percent of the loan per annum, which had been demanded by the French bank, to 0.28 percent. Korea has conceded to the French demand for a 0.4 percent management fee and a 1.2 percent insurance premium, the Ministry said. The debt payment period will be 18 years, including an eight-year grace period during which the payment of interest will be deferred, the Ministry said. The average interest rate on two commercial loans totaling $720 million, which the Korean Government will use to finance domestic purchases, will be 0.57 percent on top of the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR), down from the 0.75 percent spread which had been demanded by the French bank. This concession which Korea has obtained from the French bank will save $13 million, the Ministry said. The Tranche A loan of $411 million, which will be paid back in 12 years, has a 0.55 percent spread on the LIBOR, down from the 0.625 spread demanded by the French bank. The Tranche B loan of $309 million, whose debt-payment period is 15 years, has a 0.6 percent spread, down from the French demand for 0.875 percent. The commitment and management fees will be 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent per annum, respectively, as was demanded by the French bank. "A commercial loan with a 15-year repayment period is unprecedented in the world financial market," said Chong of the Ministry. "In addition, the interest rates (of the Tranche A and B loans) are very low." To secure concessions from the French Government, Chong said, Minister of Finance Hong Chae-hyong met with the French prime minister as well as his French counterpart when he visited France to attend the Asia Development Bank's annual meeting earlier this month. Following Hong's talks with the top French officials, he said, negotiations on loan terms proceeded speedily. "We expect the favorable terms we have obtained from France for the export and commercial loans will serve as a benchmark for Korean financial institutions planning to raise funds in the international financial market," he said.
