Muhammad Fa'iz Jibril, the Front's representative in Cairo, has emphasized that the meeting will discuss several proposals to tackle conditions in Libya in the light of the reports submitted by the Front's representatives inside and outside Libya. In a statement to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Jibril pointed out that the Front will discuss the situation in the event that the international sanctions imposed on Libya are intensified as a result of the Libyan leadership's refusal to hand over the two Libyan Lockerbie suspects. The Libyan oppositionist said that the internal situation will head the agenda of the Front's National Assembly. He pointed to the continuation of popular tension in the city of Bani Walid, stronghold of the "Warfallah" tribe, a pillar of President Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi's regime. Jibril said that Bani Walid has long been experiencing a state of undeclared civil disobedience in the wake of the accusations al-Qadhdhafi leveled at a number of officers (55 officers) belonging to the Warfallah tribe, namely that they worked to recruit elements to work for the United States. He added that Bani Walid is currently under a tight security siege for fear of the state of civil disobedience spreading to other areas.
