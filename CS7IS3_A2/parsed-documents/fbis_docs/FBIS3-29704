Supreme Commander ACM [Air Chief Marshal] Woranat Aphichari said the Government policy for the Armed Forces to procure weapons through barter deals was "impractical" and should be rectified. ACM Woranat's statement came after the Cabinet on Tuesday turned down the Air Force's request to forego the policy in acquiring a fleet of transport planes from Italy. The Air Force wants to buy six Italian-made medium G222 transport planes at a cost of US$131.5 million with funds allocated over the five years starting this year. [passage omitted] Responding to ACM Woranat's comments, Prime Minister Chuan Likphai before leaving for Trang province insisted the military must comply with the policy. "If (the military) can try, then it must try. If it has not tried and just thinks that it cannot do it, then that is not correct. If we try and it fails, then we can talk," Mr Chuan said. At the end of the Armed Forces' commanders' monthly meeting, ACM Woranat said the Government policy adopted in November would delay the arms acquisition process because the talks would be more time consuming. The delay could result in price increases and the Government having to pay more for the same equipment if deals could not be reached within deadlines. The Armed Forces had limited funds and the price increases would become a financial burden, he said. ACM Woranat insisted that the Armed Forces had tried to follow the Government's policy in the arms acquisition plans "but since we are facing the difficulty in implementing it, then we have to inform the Government". Under the Cabinet resolution in November, the Defence Ministry has assigned the Supreme Command to study how to barter Thai farm products for weapons. The Commerce, Agriculture and Foreign ministries will be told in advance by the Supreme Command from which country the military will procure arms and see whether barter deals can be made. [passage omitted] Lt-Gen Anuson Kritsanaserani, the director-general of the Armed Forces Information Office, said the armed forces commanders during yesterday's meeting expressed concern over the policy and assigned the armed forces comptrollers to look into the problem. He said the meeting also asked why the Cabinet did not impose similar conditions on contractors of mega-mass transit projects such as the elevated electric train systems. Defence Minister Wichit Sukmak earlier said the Air Force would strictly follow the Cabinet resolution in settling the aircraft deal with Italy but noted that any further delay in the acquisition might result in an increase in price and quality. RTAF [Royal Thai Air Force] commander ACM M.R. Siriphong Thongyai said he understood the Government's policy on arms procurement, saying that country would benefit from such a deal. However, he said the Government had limited time in the barter deal on G222s. [passage omitted] Deputy Prime Minister Suphachai Phanitchaphak said the Cabinet merely wanted to make the utmost benefit out of the plane purchase plan for trade negotiation with Italy. The Government had no intention to interfere with the armed forces in their arms acquisition process. If the barter deal was too difficult to achieve, Thailand could obtain some other forms of trade benefits from Italy. Thailand, for example, could ask Italy to ease its trade barriers on Thai canned seafood, or urge it to help talk with other European Union members to reduce tariffs on Thai exports such as tapioca or canned tuna sent to the community. The Government did not require that Thailand must purchase the Italian planes only through the barter deal. It may agree to such other things as more favourable trade terms or even for its support for certain Thai positions in the European Union, Mr Suphachai said. [passage omitted]
