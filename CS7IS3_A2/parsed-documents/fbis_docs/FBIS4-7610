Bosnian Serb army sources said on Sunday evening that the strongest Moslem assaults had been reported in the area of Mount Ozren, south of Doboj, where they had carried out several infantry attacks on Sunday morning before being forced to retreat with major casualties in their ranks. The Moslems fired ten shells on Doboj and continued to bring in fresh troops to the Teslic battlefront in the south. As part of an all-out offensive on the territory of the Bosnian Serb republic, Moslems have been continually shelling Doboj over the past five days, causing great damage to the town. Moslem units continued attacks in the area of Trebava east of Doboj and in the area of Brcko north of that town, as well as in the region of Srbobran (formerly Donji Vakuf) and Mt. Vlasic in central Bosnia. Despite a defeat suffered over the past few days in the areas of Gorazde, Cajnice and Foca, the Moslem army is carrying out new mobilization and re-grouping of its troops, Bosnian Serb army sources said. They said they had received an information that the Moslems had on Saturday night expected in vain a large quantity of weapons, ammunition and food to be airdropped in the Gorazde area. The Bosnian Serb army command said on Saturday that it possessed proofs that the airdrop operation (in which humanitarian supplies are parachuted to the population of Moslem enclaves in eastern Bosnia, including Gorazde) was being used for supplying the Moslem army with up-to-date arms. The Bosnian Moslem army has used those weapons in its latest offensive on Serb positions from the direction of Gorazde, where more than 10,000 Moslem fighters are based in spite of the fact that the enclave should have been demilitarized a long time ago under a resolution of the United Nations which proclaimed the town a "safe area."
