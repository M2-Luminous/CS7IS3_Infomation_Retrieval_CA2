ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule makes several changes in the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and Indian Housing. It responds to the public comments received on the interim rule that was published September 20, 1991, incorporating a few substantive modifications, as well as some clarifications and editorial revisions. This rule provides separate regulatory codifications of the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for public housing and for Indian housing, as appropriate for each. For Indian Housing Authorities (IHAs), the rule consists of subpart P of the Consolidated Program Regulations for Indian Housing (24 CFR Part 905); for Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), 24 CFR Part 906. The language of these two versions is identical, excepting only appropriate distinctions in terminology and phrasing, and in references to applicable Federal statutes and regulations on nondiscrimination and civil rights. In general, the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program works the same way for both PHAs and IHAs. EFFECTIVE DATE: December 12, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: With regard to the PHA version of the rule: C. Wayne Hunter, Senior Homeownership Programs Advisor, Office of Resident Initiatives, Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Room 4112, Washington, DC 20410.

With regard to the IHA version of the rule: Dominic Nessi, Director, Office of Native American Programs, Public and Indian Housing, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street, S.W., Room B&hyph;133, Washington, D.C. 20410.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Paperwork Reduction Act Statement The information collection requirements contained in this rule were submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501&hyph;3520) and have been approved under control number 2577&hyph;0201. Public Comments The interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program for Public and Indian Housing was published September 20, 1991 (56 FR 47852), with an effective date of October 21, 1991. Comments were received from 10 commenters, including six Public Housing Agencies (PHAs), one national association of PHAs, two legal services organizations, and one private consultant. All comments have been considered, as indicated by the discussion below. Because the texts of the IHA rule (Part 905, subpart P) and the PHA rule (Part 906) follow a parallel format, with provisions that are substantially the same, the following discussion applies to both, except where noted. In most instances, dual section references are cited, with the section of the IHA regulation followed by the corresponding section of the PHA regulation, e.g., §§905.1001/906.1 through 905.1021/906.21. Except where differences in the IHA and PHA versions are indicated, the term ``Housing Authority (HA)'' is used in the following discussion as a common term of reference to both PHAs and IHAs.
