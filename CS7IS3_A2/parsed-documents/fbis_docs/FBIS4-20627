Since R&D projects, funded by the budget type method, cannot fail, they will have to select themes which are risk-free, namely, extensions of the existing technologies. Projects which are supported by the reward-type funding, on the other hand, can take risks, thereby producing totally unexpected results. However, since incorporating this new method of funding into the existing budget-based accounting system was found somewhat difficult, AIST will have to find a way to solve this problem. For example, with a blueprint currently under consideration, MITI will provide a general research direction in its announcement, such as "an instrument for measuring emotion, designed to perceive such human emotions as joy and anger based on a person's appearance so that ideas or prototype devices which will achieve this goal can be solicited from researchers working at national research institutes, universities, or private industries." MITI, then, will select the best candidate for its project. What AIST is doing is to provide R&D funds using a method known as "a competition with prize money." With the existing R&D system supported by the budget-type funding, at the time a project is undertaken, its method and goal, for the most part, are already decided. "Collect marine organisms to obtain useful genes and matter" and "Develop heat-resistant material and use it to build an ultra-supersonic aircraft" are two such examples. The reward-type projects, on the other hand, are allowed greater flexibility and freedom in terms of method and idea. MITI has been successful in handling projects with relatively clear-cut goals, such as the establishment of semiconductor manufacturing techniques or the mass production of solar cells. On the other hand, its performance in developing uniquely original technology, the kind of projects which take the world by surprise, had been less than impressive. Concluding that such weakness was caused by the vary characteristic of the non-risk type project research, AIST has designed the type of research known as a leading-edge research, which can permit a certain amount of failure, in its industrial science and technology R&D system. The idea of using a reward funding formula for a part of a MITI research project has taken the above design one step further. Since the project is open to all qualified researchers willing to submit their ideas or prototype devices and since their selection process also is open, they tend to be picked up by mass media, which means that AIST can hope for rekindling of public interest in science and technology.
