FR940810-2-00008 FR940810-2-00006 [A&hyph;583&hyph;822] Termination of Antidumping Duty Investigation: Class 150 Stainless Steel Threaded Pipe Fittings From Taiwan AGENCY: Import Administration, International Trade Administration, Department of Commerce. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 10, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Michelle Frederick or Karla Whalen, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;0186 or 482&hyph;6309, respectively. Scope of Investigation The products covered by this investigation are Class 150 stainless steel threaded (SST) pipe fittings, defined as cast or forged stainless steel products used to connect pipe sections with an ability to withstand normal pressure service (150 pounds per square inch (psi) at 350 degrees Fahrenheit and 300 psi at 20 to 150 degrees Fahrenheit) as well as resistance to corrosion or extreme temperatures, or prevention of metallic contamination to materials in the system. Included in the scope of this investigation are both finished and unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings of any size. Unfinished Class 150 SST pipe fittings are defined as those products that have been advanced after casting or forging, but which require threading and machining to finish the fittings; finished Class 150 SST pipe fittings are defined as those products that have been formed in the shape of elbows, tees, reducers, etc. and have been further advanced after casting or forging, and require no further processing to be acceptable as a finished product to the end user. Class 150 SST pipe fittings are composed of alloys including, but not limited to, 304 and 316, and are manufactured in the shape of 90-degree elbows, 45-degree elbows, street elbows, tees, crosses, couplings, reducing couplings, half-couplings, caps, square head plugs, hex head plugs, hex bushings, unions, locknuts, and welding spuds. Excluded from the scope of investigation are SST pipe fittings manufactured in the shape of nipples. The products under investigation are currently classifiable under subheadings 7307.19.9030, 7307.19.9060, 7307.19.9080, 7307.22.1000, 7307.22.5000, and 7307.29.0090 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive. Termination of Investigation On July 28, 1994, the Department of Commerce (The Department) published its final antidumping duty determination in the Federal Register (59 FR 33432). In a letter dated July 22, 1994, petitioners, Capital Manufacturing Co. and Alloy Stainless Products, Co., notified the Department that they were withdrawing their August 2, 1993, petition, and requested termination of the antidumping investigation. A copy of this letter is available in the public file, located in room B&hyph;099 of the main building of the Department of Commerce. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.17(a), upon the petitioner's withdrawal of the petition, the Department may terminate an investigation after notice to all parties to the proceeding and after consultation with the International Trade Commission (ITC). Furthermore, the Department may not terminate an investigation unless it concludes that termination is in the public interest. We have notified all parties to the proceeding and consulted with the ITC. Further, because no party has objected to termination, it is reasonable to conclude that doing so will not disadvantage a U.S. industry producing a like product. Consequently, we have concluded that termination of the investigation is in the public interest. Accordingly, we are terminating the antidumping investigation of Class 150 stainless steel threaded pipe fittings from Taiwan. This action is taken pursuant to section 734(a)(1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and 19 CFR 353.17(a). Termination of Suspension of Liquidation The Department of Commerce has instructed the U.S. Customs Service to terminate suspension of liquidation of entries of Class 150 stainless steel threaded pipe fittings from Taiwan, entered or withdrawn from the warehouse for consumption, on or after March 8, 1994. All estimated antidumping duties deposited on entries of the subject merchandise shall be refunded and the bonds or other securities released at the time of liquidation. Dated: August 2, 1994. Susan G. Esserman, Assistant Secretary for Import Administration. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19538 Filed 8&hyph;9&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3510&hyph;DS&hyph;M
