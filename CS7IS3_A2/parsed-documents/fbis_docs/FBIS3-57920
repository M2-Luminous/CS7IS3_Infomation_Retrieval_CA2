Quite the contrary, talks might have failed finally. According to corresponding reports by both government parties, the negotiations on a new law on alternative national service, which lasted for months, have now failed. In fact, politicians declined to confirm this officially yesterday, but in hastily arranged news conferences and in numerous statements that were issued, both sides blamed each other for the failure. Thus, Defense Minister Werner Fasslabend (Austrian People's Party) announced that he has the impression that the Socialist Party of Austria [SPOe] was determined to prevent a successful conclusion. He no longer expects an agreement. SPOe manager Cap stressed in an interview with DIE PRESSE yesterday: "The truth is that the Austrian People's Party [OeVP] has always wanted the commission [that decides whether the reasons cited by young men in favor of alternative national service are plausible]. For me Fasslabend signaled that there will be no more talks." Shortly before the end of the year, agreement seemed within reach after renewed secret contacts between Chancellor Franz Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek: They suggested 11 months of alternative national service this year and delaying the decision as to whether and when it should be extended to 12 months. When difficulties occurred again in the negotiations between Fasslabend and Interior Minister Franz Loeschnak (SPOe), the OeVP finally lost its patience. The result is that the old law went into effect at the beginning of the year. Alternative civilian service lasts eight months, but reasons must again be given before a commission. However, currently no personnel and no infrastructure are available for such a commission.
