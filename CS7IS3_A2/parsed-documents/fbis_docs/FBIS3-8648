While you have achieved spectacular successes in the area of the administration of justice, you have been attacked for your views on the provision of justice for past crimes and your role in the disciplinary action against the media chairmen. [Balsai] I have indeed been attacked many times, but this is mainly due to the political situation. In Austria, for example, this position is often filled by people not committed to parties; therefore, the Justice Ministry is a kind of guarantee against party politicians. However, the situation is different in Hungary because it would have been alien to the unfolding democracy to place an expert rather than a party politician in a governmental position. Therefore, the justice minister has to implement the coalition's requirements, and from this it follows that his activities cannot always be supported by a full consensus. At the same time, this ministry was given a prominent role in establishing the legal background for the change of the regime, and the various political forces did not agree on this as well. People who have different views on all these issues tend to attack the justice minister, stating that he is not allowed to take part in politics because he would then exert pressure on the administration of justice. [Lencses] It is indeed difficult to interpret some of your statements in any other way. [Balsai] In theory, I might even agree with this view. However, when the coalition promised compensation in the form of the punishment of the responsible people belonging to the past regime, when--mainly in the interest of the legitimacy of the judges--it made its goal the replacement of the former leaders of the judiciary, or when our ministry was given the task of conducting disciplinary action against the leader of the public service medium that, according to the government, is under the supervision of the executive power, the justice minister could hardly be a politically neutral player in current affairs. [passage omitted] [Lencses] Let us return to your more immediate area: What achievements are you most proud of, and have you had any real painful failures? [Balsai] The complex legal regulation of compensation can give us cause for some satisfaction because we implemented the goals laid down in the Program of National Renewal. Similarly, I view it as a success that the courts have become truly independent and legitimate in every sense. I quietly note that the level of the performances might be lower than expected on the basis of the judges' income and conditions. However, this is not politics because it is a fact that the procedures are often protracted. On the other hand, the probable rejection of the draft bill on the public prosecution is one of my failures. It is possible that the timing was wrong and the gap between the opposition's leading jurist-politicians and our views has become too wide, although, some time ago, we held the same views on settling the constitutional position of the public prosecutor's office. [Lencses] Some people oppose subordinating public prosecution to the government precisely because you are the minister. [Balsai] This is an unjustified and impractical approach: We are leaving serious gaps in legislation because of short-term thinking and that focusing on particular people. As a matter of fact, it is also not true that the subordination of the prosecution to the government cannot be implemented because of the current court structure. However, we should now start to think about whether the next government will have better chances of getting the bills passed, which requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament. [Lencses] What are your views on the failure of the media bill? Because of the missing law, the provision of unbiased information will soon be out of the question, and we should also not forget about the peculiar personnel decisions and the many dismissals. [Balsai] I am not convinced that the Justice Ministry had the best conditions for preparing the bill. Therefore, I do not really see this as a personal failure. We did all we could and, if the talks are broken off, the reason will be that the opposition is insisting on the sacking of the two deputy chairmen. It is clear that this points beyond the media law because the preparation of a law cannot be linked to personnel decisions. As for unbiased reporting, I try to watch the news on television and the program "The Week" [A Het] and, in my view, they fulfill this requirement. [passage omitted] [Lencses] The parties making up the current coalition will probably not get an absolute majority [in the elections]. In this case, what will happen? [Balsai] It is almost certain that none of the parties can expect a similar result to that in 1990, namely, more than 40 percent of the mandates. What kind of government can be formed will obviously be decided at the coalition talks. However, it is certain that the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] will not enter into a coalition with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] or the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. Apart from this, we do not exclude any possibilities. At a time like this, it is wise to speak with caution and not to exclude certain factors from the start. However, the MDF would not be able to work together with the MSZP or the SZDSZ without a significant change in its political direction. [Lencses] Does this mean that you trust that you will be able to divide the liberal bloc and separate the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] from it? [Balsai] Indeed, it is only the FIDESZ that can be taken into consideration from there because it is possible that the Agrarian Federation or the Entrepreneurs' Party will not be parliamentary factors. I see much difference between the SZDSZ and the FIDESZ because the latter describes itself as a center party that represents national values. The term liberal has little meaning on its own because all parties would accept the values of liberalism! As a matter of fact, the FIDESZ is characterized much more by pragmatism than liberalism. [Lencses] However, what do the voters think about the FIDESZ's rapid approach to the MDF? [Balsai] In my view, the FIDESZ has not really changed; rather, it is the SZDSZ that has moved considerably to the left. Let us remember that, in addition to expressing a willingness to reach agreement, the statements of the leaders of the MSZP and SZDSZ actually reflect the intention to cooperate. [passage omitted] [Lencses] It is not impossible that, once the votes have been counted, the result will not be in your favor. [Balsai] [passage omitted] If the current coalition does not emerge victorious from the elections, rather than being a natural phase in the system of political rotation, this would be a failure because it would mainly indicate that a large number of citizens are disappointed with the process of the change of the regime. In this case, to whom would they give their vote of confidence? The legal successor of the former state party! [Lencses] Is this your failure or would it also be Hungary's fall? [Balsai] This would mean applying brakes to the development process; let us just think about the Polish example where the willingness of foreigners to invest has decreased, a general strike is imminent, and they have already moved further away from European integration. [Lencses] Are you afraid of the restoration of the former system? [Balsai] Here, we no longer need to be worried about a dictatorship, but we have to worry about the halting of a process that has already started and that is promising; in other words, we would find ourselves lagging further behind. Naturally, we cannot know yet whether the voters are patient enough and whether they can assess the events of the past four years with the necessary maturity. If they do, then they will give us another four years; if not, they will give preference to the rather uncertain new factors that might be appearing with fine-sounding promises. In this case, the economy will obviously be put on a different course of development, privatization will take a different direction, and welfare policy will be placed on different bases. However, I wonder who would benefit from a fundamental change in this phase of our development? [passage omitted]
