FR940617-1-00048 FR940617-1-00012 G. Comments on Chloroxylenol 12. A number of comments disagreed with the agency's Category III classification of chloroxylenol in the tentative final monograph. They argued that a reevaluation of the data previously submitted to the agency along with new data that have been submitted (Refs. 1 through 16) would provide adequate justification for classifying chloroxylenol in Category I for safety and effectiveness for use in antimicrobial soaps, health-care personnel handwashes, patient preoperative skin preparations, skin antiseptics, skin wound cleansers, skin wound protectants, and surgical hand scrubs. Several comments pointed out that the Antimicrobial II Panel unanimously concluded that chloroxylenol is generally recognized as safe for topical use in athlete's foot and jock-itch preparations. Based upon the submitted data (Refs. 1 through 16) and other information reviewed by the Antimicrobial Panels, the agency concluded in the amended tentative final monograph for OTC first aid antiseptic drug products that chloroxylenol (0.24 percent to 3.75 percent) was safe but not effective for short-term use as an OTC topical first aid antiseptic (54 FR 33644 at 33658). These data (Refs. 1 through 16) and new data submitted under the agency's ``feedback'' procedures (Refs. 17 through 30) are insufficient to support a Category I classification of the safety and effectiveness of the ingredient for other long-term uses, e.g., antiseptic handwash or health-care personnel handwash and surgical hand scrub. The agency concludes that chloroxylenol remains classified in Category III as an active ingredient for these uses. However, the ingredient would be considered safe for short-term use as a patient preoperative skin preparation but remains in Category III due to a lack of effectiveness data for this use. In the previous tentative final monograph (43 FR 1210 at 1222 and 1238), the agency stated that the data were insufficient to reclassify chloroxylenol into Category I, and the ingredient remained in Category III for safety and effectiveness. Indicating concern about the absorption of topically applied antimicrobial drug products used repeatedly by consumers over a number of years, the agency stated the following regarding the safety of the ingredient: Only the most superficial toxicity data in animals were submitted to and reviewed by the Panel. The Commissioner concurs with the Panel that toxicity in rodent and nonrodent species, substantivity, blood levels, distribution and metabolism, as well as any subsequent systemic absorption studies must be characterized *␣*␣*. The degree of absorption of PCMX following topical administration has not been established. The target organ for PCMX toxicity in animals also remains unidentified and should be shown in a long-term animal toxicity study.
