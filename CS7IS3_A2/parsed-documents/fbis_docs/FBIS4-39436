"We are not stuck on this program," he added. Kozyrev announced that he was going to discuss the issue at the meeting of the NATO Cooperation Council (NACC) in Istanbul in which he would arrive from Paris. "We believe that the NACC is maybe of even more importance than the Partnership for Peace program," he pointed out. We do not agree that the role of the NACC be brought down to that of a NATO adjunct. The NACC has its own future. It lets NATO reorganize itself and launch multilateral cooperation. This is quite an independent direction making a part of pan-European partnership, Kozyrev said. He also announced that in the near future Russian President Boris Yeltsin would put forward Russia's initiatives on development of pan-European partnership where the CSCE would play the key role. Kozyrev stressed that Moscow regarded the Russia-NATO document recently introduced in Brussels by Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev as much more important than the Partnership for Peace program. Kozyrev stated that the Russian formula in the political sphere of cooperation would be made known in Istanbul. "Afterwards, we will calmly negotiate with NATO, sign the frame document they are proposing and reach an agreement on our Russia-NATO program which is certainly more comprehensive and serious. We take the Partnership for Peace program into account. It is not primarily important for us. However, it is not least important for either," Kozyrev emphasized.
