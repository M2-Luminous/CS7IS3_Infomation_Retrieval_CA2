[Karadzic] The cease-fire was agreed upon a week ago and is not connected to NATO threats or the ultimatum. I believe that NATO is knocking at an open door and is flexing its muscles absolutely needlessly. Our commanders have drawn up some kind of agreement on a permanent cease-fire around Sarajevo. I have spoken to Mr. Akashi about this issue, and I prepared all this. This has nothing to do with NATO. [Correspondent] You will maintain the cease-fire? [Karadzic] Yes. It has been brokered by the representatives of the [warring] sides and Mr. Akashi. NATO has nothing to do with us. [Correspondent] Neither the Croats, the Muslims, nor the cochairmen want a joint commission to investigate the [5 February] Sarajevo event. Will you go on demanding it? [Karadzic] We have encouraging information that a commission will be formed and that a Serbian expert will be part of it.
