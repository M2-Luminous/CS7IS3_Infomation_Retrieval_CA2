Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that the Likud explains its motion by what it terms the government's inability to protect the state's vital interests and to conduct negotiations wisely and responsibly. The joint no-confidence motion of Tzomet and the NRP cites what it terms the government's inadequate struggle against terror. The YI'UD's motion of no confidence was instigated by the prime minister's remarks on Golan settlements evacuation. Coalition Chairman Eli Dayan has said in reaction that the conduct of the opposition, which exploits terrorist attacks for antigovernment incitement, reflects an absence of national responsibility.
