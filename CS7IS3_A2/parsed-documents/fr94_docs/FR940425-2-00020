FR940425-2-00020 FR940425-2-00017 Response: As discussed in the Environmental Assessment, the Navy is cooperating with the DOE in a comprehensive Environmental Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management, including Naval spent fuel. This Environmental Impact Statement will evaluate alternatives for spent nuclear fuel management until a permanent repository is available. The Idaho Federal District Court Order, as modified by the Court acceptance of the agreement among the Navy, DOE, and Idaho, requires the DOE Environmental Impact Statement to be complete and a Record of Decision issued by June 1995. Some of the alternatives which are being evaluated in the DOE Environmental Impact Statement will allow routine Naval spent fuel shipments to be resumed promptly. Therefore, it is by no means certain that storage at shipyards will be extended. The environmental impact of all of the alternatives being considered in the DOE Environmental Impact Statement will include any transitional impacts. Thus, the scope of this Environmental Assessment properly is limited to evaluation of alternatives for short term storage while the DOE's Environmental Impact Statement is being prepared. It would be inappropriate for the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program to speculate about the outcome of the DOE Environmental Impact Statement or what action the Federal Government might take. Comment: Department of Energy sites should be considered for short term storage. Response: Section 2.4 of the Environmental Assessment discussed why the Department of Energy sites could not be made available within the short term and thus are not ``reasonable'' alternatives. Several Department of Energy sites are being evaluated for long term storage of Naval spent fuel in the Department of Energy Environmental Impact Statement on spent nuclear fuel management. Comment: The Environmental Assessment does not adequately assess whether containers designed for shipping would be suitable for the different conditions of storage. Response: As described in the Environmental Assessment, the extremely rugged shipping containers were designed to withstand severe transportation accidents such as collisions, falls of bridges, fires, and immersion in water. Comparatively speaking, storage is much less taxing on the structural integrity of the containers. Nevertheless, the EA thoroughly evaluated the risks of potential accidents which could happen during storage. The shipping containers, in fact, are overdesigned for storage. Containers designed for transportation provide protection for severe accidents in excess of what could be reasonably expected to occur during storage. Comment: The Environmental Assessment should consider earthquakes. Response: The physical forces that an earthquake could subject a shipping container to are much less than those involved with the transportation accidents that the containers were designed to withstand. For example, one of the severe accidents which shipping containers are designed to withstand is a fall of 30 feet onto an unyielding surface (equivalent to a fall of 60 feet onto a reinforced concrete surface). Such a fall would subject a container to shock over 100 times greater than that of a severe earthquake. In practical terms, steel structures far less strong than the massive shipping containers fare well in actual earthquakes. Therefore, there is no need to evaluate the potential for an earthquake to damage a shipping container. Comment: The Environmental Assessment underestimated the impacts of severe accidents. Response: The Environmental Assessment evaluated a range of hypothetical accidents which could occur during storage. The most severe accident evaluated in the Environmental Assessment was an aircraft crash with the potential for breach of the shipping containers. While extremely unlikely, this is the accident with the greatest potential to damage the shipping containers during storage. The accident analyses were based on realistic evaluation of what could happen to Naval spent fuel in shipping containers during the hypothetical accidents. Naval spent fuel is rugged, metallic, nondispersible material, and it would be unreasonable to conclude that any significant fraction of it could be released to the atmosphere by any of the accidents considered. Even if the shipping container were to be breached by a large part from an airplane (which is unlikely given the massive nature of the shipping containers), the Naval spent fuel would remain in or near the container. There is no mechanism for grinding up the fuel and injecting it into the air. The long term application of very high heat, such as might be generated by a confined fire with a gasoline truck, would be necessary to drive some fission products off from exposed Naval spent fuel. Such a fire is not credible in the shipyard environment. The shipyard fire department is readily available to extinguish any fire quickly. Thus, the accident analyses in the Environmental Assessment are conservative. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;9906 Filed 4&hyph;22&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 3810&hyph;AE&hyph;M
