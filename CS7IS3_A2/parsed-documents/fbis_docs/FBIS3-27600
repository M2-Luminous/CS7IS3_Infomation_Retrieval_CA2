I dare not say I do. I am only one of these people. On 26 January 1993, I wrote a report entitled "`Ten Thousand People Want' To Become `Another Thousand People's Friends,'" introducing Tianjin's labor service market. In it, one short paragraph mentioned how the market guided the "wave of peasant laborers" and it also carried a short commentary affirming that the labor service market's exploration about that was very meaningful and that this should be continued. Honestly, although the short commentary discussed the question of how to guide and manage peasant laborers, I cannot but admit that I had misgivings about whether I could shoulder this heavy task for the labor force market. The labor force market now has limited conditions but the "wave of peasant laborers" is great. Although it may be possible to find jobs for some peasant laborers, the number is insignificant. Moreover, peasant laborers can move about freely. Are they willing to accept orderly management? My misgivings have been dispelled since I received a letter on 5 February from "a man who has a job," voicing his thoughts. The man is called Zhang Dejin, a worker in the service detachment of Shilou Fire Service in Fangshan district, Beijing. Although we never met, I can say for sure from his letter that he is a peasant worker, a villager from the hills. After reading the report of how Tianjin's labor force market guided the "wave of peasant workers," he wrote me a letter with great excitement, saying that "he had had this idea for six or seven years and had finally found the person to talk to about it." I am honored that as an author, I have the trust of a reader but I feel that the weight of the letter lies in the words which profoundly analyze the "indiscriminate flow of laborers" and which call for the founding of a peasant labor market with full expectations. Let me reveal the original contents of the letter to all of you. "After working for one year outside, I had this idea: Why does society call peasant laborers "indiscriminately flowing laborers." It means that first, they are flowing indiscriminately; second, there is a gap between city and rural people; third, peasant laborers create many unhealthy trends in society, exert a very bad influence on social stability, and so forth." The "wave of peasant laborers" makes a "wave" because of the large number of laborers who need transport each year and cause a big headache. Service personnel in buses and on trains are disgusted with them. Their bulky personal baggage causes inconvenience to work personnel. What they do causes harm to those who are touring, visiting friends and families, and on business trips.... How do city dwellers look on peasant laborers. Most of the laborers do filthy manual work and they do not change their working clothes. In a bus, if a peasant laborer stands by the side of a seated passenger, he will immediately stand up and give him the seat. What effect do their words and deeds have on city children.... City dwellers look down on them. They have reason to discriminate against them. When a person comes to a strange place without a cent, with very little education, and holding extreme views, what can he do in order to survive. What will he get up to? So long as someone gives him money and food he will do whatever he wants including committing crime. The starting point for prostitution in society is like this: A country girl whose head is full of feudalist ideas has been deceived. In order to fight back and survive, she can only live like this. What excuse do they use to abduct and traffic in women. Most of them use the pretense of employing workers, child workers from society. The article "Where Have the Hill Girls Gone" on page 10 of the 25 January edition of RENMIN RIBAO, was just part of the story. I am illiterate because I began to work very early and this has been very harmful to my own body." Here I have quoted large paragraphs of Zhang Dejin's original words. I did not even change his grammar and the mistake of not using question marks at the end of questions. Although the letter may have flaws, it does not cause the peasant laborer, who is in the wave, produce an inferior analysis of himself. If we say that city dwellers mostly see the surface of the "indiscriminate flow," then peasant laborers themselves dare to analyze the question from the angles of society and themselves. The beginning of the decadent phenomena. Peasant laborers consider bribing and giving presents as paying a debt of gratitude. Many have come to work in cities. I know that some of them, the quick minds as they are called in society, are up to some bad things. Now that peasant laborers need to be managed, they seize this opportunity to invite guests, give presents, and become laborers' foremen. Will these foremen still participate in labor? Many shoddy and fake products come from the hands of peasant laborers. For example, taking advantage of peasant laborers, many small private enterprises do not register for a place of temporary residence and do not obtain temporary residence certificates. They do not register with the authorities and yet begin production in out-of-the-way places on the outskirts and they sell their products by improper means. Moreover, these units also evade taxes and their products seriously affect the market. How do the small businessmen from the flowing population lead a life, and so forth? Can all these phenomena be resolved equitably? Yes, they can but who will trouble to do this?" "In areas where peasant laborers abound, there are no village-run enterprises and nearly no township-run enterprises. So what are the village and township work personnel doing? They have time, energy, and ability to rationally send peasant laborers to employing units. For what do peasant laborers hope? Before I left home, I had thought that it would be a little easier to make money in a place nearer home. There were already three parties that had asked for money, and there would not be a fourth party. A person who has a wife and children hopes that his family will be taken care of properly. It is more appropriate for him to be near home. There was an article on page five of the 29 January edition of RENMIN RIBAO entitled: "The Core of Rural Work Cannot be Independent of Developing Agriculture." Parents hope that their children will go to a definite place so they do not have to worry about them. Female housekeepers and female workers in individually-run restaurants are particularly afraid. Families hiring the housekeepers fear that they will not behave themselves. Bosses of individual entrepreneurs are the same. Employing units and individuals have the backing of the government's labor department. Peasant laborers have the backing of a basic-level village or township government and both sides have the sense of security. If villages or townships act as employment agencies, they can increase incomes and lessen peasant burdens at the same time. If so, foremen who only invite guests and give presents and who do not do labor must also participate in labor, thus promoting the current "anticorruption" work. It is the same now as when I worked as a worker that foremen do not work a single day and that, at the end of each month, they give presents, settle accounts, retain their portion, and give out the remainder as wages." Zhang Dejin's hope for the use of rural labor force is that it "be like conscription in which a certain unit registers at a designated place." He said: "The following are some of my suggestions for the rational arrangement for peasant laborers. My suggestion is that every city should have a labor service market. How many markets are like that of Tianjin. What figure makes the "wave of peasant laborers" a "wave." In order to cope with this, we can only begin work with the government first. Take back the portion previously taken by foremen and peasant laborers contribute their part. For example, registration fees and labor insurance can be used to develop the labor force market. If so, it would develop much faster than it does. For example, our Pingyuan County has a vast flowing population. Through the county's labor affairs bureau, peasant laborers had to pay several dozen yuan without going out in order to vie for vacancies in the Huabei Oil Field and Beijing's police and public security units. What vacancies there were, I did not have a good idea. Anyway, peasant laborers thought this was reasonable. The government labor affairs bureau can collect an introductory charge from employing units and individuals. They are very willing to pay the money. Establishing and improving the labor force market, step by step, by pooling funds from laborers is much quicker than the natural establishment. The greatest beneficiaries are the whole society, whole country, and laborers themselves." This ordinary, letter which is full of genuine feelings, is enough to enable city dwellers to understand more about the so-called "indiscriminate flow." The opinion on the significance, ways, and means of establishing a labor service market for peasant laborers in the letter does enough to win the respect of city dwellers. Having an idea of something is the foundation of understanding it and understanding precedes the "resolution" of a problem. Cities have a great responsibility to resolve the "wave of peasant laborers" and they are an important market for absorbing the rural work force. Only by first understanding peasant laborers can we enthusiastically think of the ways to take action to help them find a way out. Not only labor affairs departments should do this but also the government and all quarters of society should care for them. Peasant laborers are the main body of the labor force market. The fact that they have such earnest aspirations and ideas to establish a labor force market offers a good foundation for the establishment of this market. If we can find more jobs or make good arrangements for peasant laborers, their livelihood can be guaranteed and stability will prevail in society. Moreover, it is possible that many a good and talented people, such as entrepreneurs and scientists, will emerge from these peasant laborers one day! The opportunity is now. Zhang Dejin's letter also tells us one thing: "As a national traditional festival, the Spring Festival is a very good opportunity. Peasant workers are now spending the holiday back home and village and township governments have the best time to control their flow." Places charged with the task of exporting labor services must not miss this opportunity from now on. With the great importance attached to it by governments at all levels, with organization by labor departments, and with the support of peasant laborers and employing units, the rural labor force market will surely and undoubtedly grow and expand.
