"No national security issue is more important to us and to our children than a stable government in Russia dedicated to democracy," said Perry, who appeared at a confirmation hearing in the Senate. Now deputy to outgoing Pentagon chief Les Aspin, Perry said the Pentagon would strengthen military cooperation with the Russians and to "encourage the Russian military to be a force for reform, not an opponent of reform." Warning that "the road to democracy and stability in Russia is going to be rocky and twisted," Perry said the U.S. "must be patient and not be deterred by temporary setbacks" in Russia. Perry, 66, had been a professor in the School of Engineering at Stanford University and co-director of Stanford's Center for International Security and Arms Control before taking the current post. In the face of a smaller defense budget, Perry pledged to "institute innovative management techniques to vigorously foster acquisition reform and to preserve a necessary industrial base." According to Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn, there is a 13-billion-dollar gap between the Clinton 1994-1998 spending plan and what is called for under the recently-concluded military "bottom-up review." In addition, if inflation factors were taken into account, the Pentagon may face another 30 billion dollars shortage in the five-year period. Besides budgetary problems, Perry also has to cope with such headaches as homosexuals in the military and women serving in combat missions.
