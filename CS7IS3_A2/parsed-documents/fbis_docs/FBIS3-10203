The students have demanded the professors resume classes and suspend the 15-day-old strike. Carlos Mazariegos, faculty secretary, has told ACAN-EFE the 200 students have agreed to call off the measure after the professors concurred to hold an assembly to analyze the situation. The Medical Students Association detained the professors last night, local time, while they were holding an assembly at the university. The professors have not taught classes for 15 days in support of the doctors who are on strike nationwide in demand of a salary increase. This labor conflict coincides with the framework of the partial work stoppages and strikes staged by thousands of government workers as of four weeks ago in demand of an up to 40-percent salary increase. The students had announced they would release the professors once they made a commitment to resume teaching, in exchange for student support in their public demonstrations for a better salary. Mazariegos has said both groups would participate in an assembly called for by Faculty Dean Jafeth Cabrera during which the resumption of classes next week will be analyzed.
