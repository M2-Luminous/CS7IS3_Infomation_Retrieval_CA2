It was initially planned to begin in late April, but thus far there have only been long meetings and endless debates. The ethnic Albanians in Macedonia have demanded changes to the draft census law, particularly those provisions that encroach on the Albanians' right to declare themselves in their own mother tongue, in other words to fill in the census forms in the Albanian language. These requests have been supported also by the European Community, which has conditioned its funding for the census campaign upon their fulfillment. However, the Macedonian side does not agree, arguing that this would infringe Macedonia's constitution. It is actually the same constitution that the Albanians previously refused to vote for because it did not treat them as a nationality capable of statehood, as it does the Macedonians. Aside from the language issue, there are a number of other contentious clauses in the draft census law described as discriminating. Among other things, there is a fairly conspicuous attempt to classify Albanians into various subdivisions. Thus, Albanians presently living outside their native area for more than a year have to be registered in separate forms. Obviously, this differentiation is impervious to democratic logic and leaves room for falsification. Moreover, how can the final census figures be reliable when there is only one single Albanian working in the Macedonian Institute of Statistics? A single-nation statistics institution in a multinational state, can very easily issue whatever figures it chooses, in accordance with the political interests it represents. The ethnic Albanian censuses carried out in Macedonia in the past have more often than not turned into a heated issue, as happened quite recently in the Skopje parliament. The truth must come into the open without the slightest doubt. It is said that Albanians account for more than 40 percent of the republic's entire population, although the Macedonians say this figure should be halved. Only a census carried out in accordance with international regulations will reveal the real truth. Artificial hurdles placed in the way of its realization serve neither the stability of the republic, nor peace and good understanding in the region. At a time when Macedonia has been put in a difficult position because of the Greek blockade in the south and the Serbian aims in the north (Milosevic ignores FYROM as a state to the point that he does not even mention Macedonia in his "Balkan federation project"), it would be suicidal for this country to incite artificial conflicts with the Albanians, who undoubtedly are a basic factor for stability in that country and in the region as a whole. There is nothing that the ethnic Albanian census in Macedonia could disturb, aside from the chauvinistic waters whose sources can be traced to somewhere in Belgrade. Let us hope that reason will finally triumph, in the interests of the Macedonians, Albanians, FYROM, and the interests of tranquility and peace in the Balkan peninsula.
