Hirasawa, also a former vice finance minister, is widely expected to be become president of the Bank of Yokohama in June. People's Finance Corp. is a government-run firm that provides low-interest loans to small businesses. A rash of such high-profile appointments recently has raised anew the issue of "amakudari," the "descent from heaven" of ranking bureaucrats to influential private-sector positions.
