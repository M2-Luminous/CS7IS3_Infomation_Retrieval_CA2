FR940620-1-00020 FR940620-1-00006 5. Payment Procedures As noted above, the State must treat payment for services covered under the group health plan as a third party liability under section 1902(a)(25) of the Act. Where Medicaid must participate in cost-sharing for deductibles and coinsurance, the State is required to reimburse all cost-sharing at the employer-based group health plan payment rate. The State is not required to pay for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act which are the recipient's responsibility. Section 1902(e)(11) of the Act provides States with the option to continue payments to the group health plan on behalf of a Medicaid recipient after the recipient ceases to be eligible for Medicaid for a maximum period of 6 months from the effective date of the recipient's required enrollment in the group health plan under section 1906(a). A State electing this option must include this provision in its State plan, and should specify the length of the applicable period. 6. Federal Financial Participation Section 1906(c)(1) specifies that, for purposes of section 1903(a) of the Act, FFP is available as ``medical assistance'' for all premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations under the group health plan for services covered under the State plan. However, if the State imposes nominal cost sharing under section 1916 of the Act, payment of such amounts are the recipient's responsibility and are not paid for under section 1906. Therefore, FFP is not available for the nominal cost-sharing amounts otherwise permitted under section 1916 of the Act. If a non-Medicaid eligible family member must be enrolled in the group health plan in order to obtain coverage for the Medicaid eligible, FFP is available for premiums only (but not for any other cost-sharing expenses) for the non-Medicaid eligible family member(s) as payment for medical assistance for the eligible individual. If a Medicaid recipient's group health plan offers a wider array of services than those services covered under the State plan, no FFP is available for the deductibles, coinsurance and other cost-sharing obligations for non-covered services. For States that elect to cover individuals during the optional period allowed under section 1902(e)(11), FFP would be restricted to the individual's premiums and appropriate deductibles and coinsurance for services provided to the individual under the group health plan, and would not be available for payment for any other items and services covered by the State plan. If a Medicaid recipient is currently enrolled in a non-employer-based health plan and is also eligible to enroll in a cost-effective group health plan, the recipient must enroll in the cost-effective group health plan to maintain his or her Medicaid eligibility. If enrollment in both health plans remains cost-effective, FFP is available for the premiums of the non-employer-based plans specified in section 1905(a) of the Act. However, continued enrollment in the non-employer-based plan is not mandatory.
