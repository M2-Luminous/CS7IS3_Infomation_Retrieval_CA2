He is probably the most respected man in Gaza and very popular as a dissident within the PLO. ['Abd-al-Shafi] The peace agreement leaves many things to be desired, but its most important fault is that it does not question Israeli claims on the occupied territories. Also, it says nothing about the colonization process in Jerusalem and elsewhere. The Israelis claimed right from the start that this territory was Israeli territory. That is why they called the 1967 war a "war of liberation." That has remained like that: They have never admitted that they were occupiers. And that means that they have claims on the occupied territories. The fact that this agreement does not cover this aspect, and does not ask Israel to give up these claims, is its big fault. They are actively colonizing Jerusalem, despite the agreement which says that Jerusalem will come on the agenda in the final phase of the negotiations. In other words, Jerusalem has been virtually given up to the Israeli side. Nothing was said about the settlements -- there is a silent agreement on two different entities in the occupied territories. Firstly the Israeli entity, which is the "settlers," and secondly the Palestinian entity, with separate administrative and legal systems. This, too, will lead to major obstacles for us, on our way to our long-term goal, which is our own independent state. [KNACK] Do you not believe that in a later phase of the process the "settlers" would be sent back anyway? ['Abd-al-Shafi] Now, in the interim period, they could at the very least have given positive signs that the final outcome was still open for discussion. But all that Israel is doing at present is further reducing the credibility of that agreement on the ultimate solution. As I said back in Madrid, the settlements are not compatible with peace. Even James Baker agreed. [KNACK] You and others have signed a text which was sent to the PLO leadership in Tunis ... ['Abd-al-Shafi] That was a memorandum on democratic practice. After the agreement became fact, we wanted at least to be able to work democratically in managing our own affairs in the areas which will be transferred. We are certainly against 'Arafat remaining the only source of decisions. Therefore, we are asking for a broad basis to the decision making process, we are asking the Executive Committee to work as a collective leadership, we want competence and quality to not be sacrificed to political and personal considerations, things in that line ... [KNACK] Here in Gaza, the people are worried about a possible dictatorial regime which 'Arafat might bring from Tunis ... ['Abd-al-Shafi] Look, if we are going to manage our own affairs, then it is no more than normal that we ask that type of question. You should not read too much into that. An administration which meets the people's needs must be constructed along democratic lines: accountability, transparency and so on. The people are worried, they want to be certain that this is what it will actually become. [KNACK] How do you see such a democracy? In the past you refused to lead an opposition party in the name of Palestinian unity. ['Abd-al-Shafi] It is still too early to talk about that. I do know that pluralism is one of the aspects of democracy. If we organize our own society, in the context of freedom and independence and the rest, then pluralism will certainly be a part of it. But now we are thinking about that broad basis for the decision making process and collective leadership. I hope that the elections in July are orderly and produce an elected leadership which itself will work democratically. But real democracy is still a way off. You cannot just give or take democracy, democracy is a process. [KNACK] Do you think that the peace agreement can nevertheless have positive results? ['Abd-al-Shafi] I hope that we will manage our affairs competently and thus prove that we are capable of doing so. That is very important. That does not mean that we must forget the things which are not covered in this agreement. [KNACK] Do you believe that the leadership in Tunis can democratize itself? ['Abd-al-Shafi] Democracy can only be achieved in an atmosphere of freedom and independence. What we are thinking about now -- a collective leadership and the like -- is possible because the Executive Committee is made up of representatives of the different groups. If they introduce a spirit of democracy, then it will become an example of democratic practice. That would be meaningful in the present circumstances, and then the practice of the Palestinian National Council and the Central Committee could be democratized. That would be reflected in the behavior of representatives of the leadership who are appointed for the duration of the interim period. It is a process which creates its own dynamic, but first it must start. [KNACK] So won't it again be 'Arafat who decides to launch democratization? ['Abd-al-Shafi] No, it does not have to be that way. If the group of delegates has the will to push this through, then it can do so.
