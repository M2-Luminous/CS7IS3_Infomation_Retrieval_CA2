The interior minister referred to the unremitting rumors that have reappeared in the past days and added that they are meant to create a climate of uncertainty so as to inflame the people or cause a coup. Also, Defense Minister Rafael Montero Revette was called on to appear before the Congress and, during his remarks, got to the point of saying that Commander Hugo Chavez Frias was a subversive. [Begin recording] [Escovar Salom] The number of rumors that have been circulating in the past days are part of a psychological war. Certain people have wanted to start this psychological war to keep the Venezuelans in constant anxiety. They are, however, only rumors and gossip. The government cannot respond every time a person spreads a rumor. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Escovar Salom] The Interior Ministry does have a great deal of information but I don't have any to give to you at this time. [Reporter] [question indistinct] [Escovar Salom] Basically, it is only rumors, rumors, and more rumors. [end recording] Minister Escovar Salom did not say if the government's intervention in eight banks would prompt public disorder in the country. The students did riot outside the Central Venezuelan University on Wednesday, but the minister did not give importance to those events. He said they were all street gossip which did not merit great significance. As usual, however, he promised to give reporters more details at a later date on the groups promoting the rumors to destabilize the country.
