Colombia is a good example for them in this field. That is why Carlos Lage Davila, vice president of the Council of State and visible head of Cuba's policy, has come to Colombia. Lage also is responsible for the economic policy of Fidel Castro's government. His proposal to rescue the island from economic backwardness after holding relations with socialist countries for more than 30 years can be summed up as follows: [Begin Lage recording] We must seek new markets, open the door to capital investment, and develop new economic activities for the country's future. [end recording] Lage added, however, that tourism, one important aspect of the economic opening that is being discussed with Colombian industrialists, is not for all Cubans. [Begin Lage recording] It is true we have given international tourism priority status. The country is going through a difficult situation. Consequently, we must build facilities, incur expenses, and make sacrifices to bring in foreign currency. [end recording] The official said that the Cuban opening is straightforward and that soon the world's markets will be handling Cuban products other than sugar and tobacco.
