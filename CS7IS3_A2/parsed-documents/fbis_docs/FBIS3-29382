The U.S. side is just not making enough marketing effort," the source said. Last week, the U.S. and Japan failed to reach agreement on liberalizing the Japanese insurance market, one of the three priority areas under negotiation in bilateral framework trade talks. U.S. President Bill Clinton announced Wednesday that to address the trade issue, policy recommendations will be drawn up by the end of the week which could include revival of the punitive Super 301 trade measure. The source indicated the Japanese Government has few new measures up its sleeve to respond to the retaliatory measures the U.S. may take. "We are already doing everything we can to reduce Japan's trade surplus," he said.
