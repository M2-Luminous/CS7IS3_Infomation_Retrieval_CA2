The strike action, called by one of the two national trade unions, the Federation of Chadian Trade Unions, is being widely followed. Here in Ndjamena the administration has been completely paralyzed. Civil servants embarked on this strike action to back their demand for their salaries, which they have not received for several months. In its recent petition to the government, the main trade union federation called for the payment of two months of salary arrears to civil servants working in Ndjamena and three months of salary arrears to their counterparts in the provinces; the regularization of the financial situation of workers who were arbitrarily retired but later rehabilitated by the National Salvation Council; and the regular payment of salaries and allowances as of January, just to mention a few of the demands. This strike action, which started yesterday, will end on 8 January, but may be renewed if demands are not met by then.
