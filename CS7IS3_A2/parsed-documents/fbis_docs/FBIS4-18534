He said: "One cannot speak about a democratic system or a state of law without secularism. The secular state is a safeguard even for those who express ideas against secularism." Guven, who will retire on 15 March because of age limits, expressed his views on debates about secularism and the work of the judiciary. Guven said that one cannot say lawsuits are settled expeditiously in legal or administrative cases and noted that the Council of State takes at least a year to decide a case. Guven explained that work is under way to solve this problem in administrative trials by adding two more departments to the Council of State and expanding its staff to adequate levels. He added: "Because of the slow operation of the judiciary, the benefits expected from it are reduced to a minimum, and unfair practices persist. At a time when economic relations are expanding and inflation is soaring the losses of those who are harmed by these procedures are also growing. As a result it is necessary to go to the source of the problem." Making Laws Stating that the source of the problem is the way laws are drafted, Guven said: "Above all, one cannot say that the necessary attention is paid to the drafting of the laws. A law must be drafted not just for the administration but with the participation and input of professional groups and other organizations which may be affected by that law. If that is done, the number of disputes and therefore lawsuits may be reduced. This is a very important approach whose implementation, however, is difficult." Guven noted that the administration must comply with administrative judicial decisions and that contrary situations are not encountered very frequently in Turkey. He continued: "However, sometimes the administration complies only formally while weakening the effectiveness of the decision. When someone is removed from office, the administration rehires him or appoints him to an equivalent office. Then it goes and dismisses him again. That starts an unending process of lawsuits. One must not forget that the administrator who does not comply with the judiciary's decision may need the same judiciary's decision if he is removed from office some day in the future." Ottoman State Not Secular Commenting on debates about secularism that have intensified recently, Guven said that there can be no republic, democratic system or state of law without the principle of secularism and that this principle must not be debated. Stating that there are attempts to interpret secularism in Turkey in a way other than how it is defined at its source, Guven said: "There is an attempt to interpret secularism as freedom of religion and noninterference of the state in religion. This has absolutely nothing to do with secularism. A basic concept like secularism must be well-defined and its limits must be properly set. It is one thing for a state to be secular, it is another for it not to interfere in religion, beliefs, and thoughts. The noninterference of the state in religion means individual freedom of religion and conscience. A state which is not secular may also respect freedom of religion and conscience. Take for example the Ottoman Empire. But the Ottoman State was not secular. It was run by Islamic rules, Islamic codes of law and the provisions of the Koran, but it did not interfere in the religion of its subjects. That shows not that the Ottoman state was secular but that it was extremely respectful toward freedom of religion and conscience." Secular State Stating that a secular state cannot be under the influence of any religion, Guven said: "From this standpoint a secular system is in fact a safeguard of protection for all religions. A secular state is a safeguard even for those who express ideas against secularism. Every religion has its own denominations and sects. If we assume that the state is not secular, which of those sects will be dominant in the state? The dominance of any of those sects means that people who share the same religion will be even less protected than people from another religion. That is because there is closer rivalry between different sects of the same religion. Thus in a nonsecular state there would be no protection even for people who share the same religion as those who hold power."
