Involved in bulk misappropriation of electrolytic copper from the Ampelum copper field of Zlatna, Iulian Radulescu had been accused of selling, jointly with his accomplices, stolen copper to Turkey through a connection the ramifications of which are not entirely known yet. On 20 May this year the police and prosecutor's office of Alba County issued a warrant, his apprehension proper being possible as late as 26 May, when Radulescu returned to Romania from Spain, where, according to his statement, he had been invited to take part in an international symposium of Romanis held in Seville. "I want an inquest fitting my imperial status," he said upon his arrest, and promised to cooperate with the police for the clarification of the circumstances. According to the population census of January 1992, registered as living in Romania are 409,720 Gypsies (Romanis or Roms,) which form the second largest ethnic minority after Hungarians recorded as numbering 1,620,000. Gypsy leaders speak of figures higher than the official records. Iulian Radulescu "crowned" himself "Emperor of Roms Everywhere" in August 1993, more than one and a half years after the ceremony during which a cousin of his, Ioan Cioaba, proclaimed himself "International King of Roms in Romania on Five Continents." The two "crowned heads" are in-laws, their children having been married in 1989 in the United States. Both Radulescu and Cioaba live in Sibiu. The Gypsies in Romania do not seem to take the two "monarchs" seriously, most of them ignoring them completely. As in the case of other ethnic minorities, their leaders failed to be elected to parliament in the September 1992 elections. The Gypsies are yet represented to the legislative body by a deputy thanks to the provisions of the Romanian Constitution, which enables each ethnic minority to appoint a representative to parliament.
