Our correspondent Shakhnoza Ganiyeva reports on the efforts of Russia and Uzbekistan in the peaceful settlement of this conflict. [Ganiyeva] Anatoliy Adamishin, Russian deputy minister of foreign affairs, has arrived in Tashkent for a short visit. After a series of meetings with leaders of the foreign policy department of Uzbekistan he departed for Dushanbe. Before his visit to Tajikistan, during an interview for viewers of this morning program, Anatoliy Adamishin said that Russia pays very serious attention to what is happening in this region, particularly on the Tajik-Afghan border where the collective peacekeeping forces are deployed today. You will recall that according to an agreement existing between Russia and Uzbekistan on cooperation regarding certain international issues, these two countries are exerting every effort in order to ease by political means the tense situation on the Tajik-Afghan border, which in fact is the southern border of the CIS countries. [Begin Adamishin recording] Well, generally this is not a very easy task, and of course it is not close--not close--but it seems to me that gradually we are nevertheless moving towards this matter, maybe not as fast as we would like. Presently the most realistic option for talks are talks which can be held under the sponsorship of the United Nations, under the UN Secretary General's special representative Piris-Ballon. There is an agreement in this regard both with the government of Tajikistan and with the Tajik opposition. We are now talking about selecting a venue for these talks. It is our shared view with the Uzbek government and the Tajik government too, to begin these talks as soon as possible and finally determine what we will talk about. But unfortunately the Afghan groups are interfering in this matter. The fundamentalist and extremist forces of several Muslim countries are interfering in this. Of course, if this factor of external interference were removed I think the Tajiks would more easily find a common language with one another. [end recording] Peace talks are the only possible and realistic choice. If goodwill is demonstrated by both sides this could remove the tension along the border, or at least alleviate it.
