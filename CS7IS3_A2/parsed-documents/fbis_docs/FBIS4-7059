Yan, who is also the chairman of the government negotiating panel with the MNLF said the peace talks which seek to end the conflict in southern Philippines should not be derailed by rumors and suspicions. Both sides are now preparing for the second round of formal talks to be held in Jakarta, Indonesia. Published reports said that MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari resented a statement made by President Ramos, in answer to a question in a press conference last Monday, regarding possible MNLF participation in the forthcoming election. Misuari was also reported as planning to elevate the issue before the Organization of Islamic Conference or OIC. Yan said in a statement that this controversy should now be closed and the peace process given greater momentum by the spirit of understanding and accommodation. Yan said the president's statement was never intended to preempt the ongoing negotiation and that he [Misuari] should not impute sinister designs to it. With respect to Misuari's plan to raise the issue with the OIC, Yan said, it is not necessary. He said the president's statement was obviously made within the ambit of our national sovereignty and constitutional processes which OIC charter is mandated to respect. OIC is not a mediator in the peace talks he said, but a constructive participant and a partner for peace to both sides.
