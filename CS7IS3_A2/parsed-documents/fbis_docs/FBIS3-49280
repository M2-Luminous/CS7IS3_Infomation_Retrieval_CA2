The Russian position is the main -- but to be sure not the only one -- reason why NATO flinches at the thought of admitting Central and East European states to the bloc. Another major reason is the organization's unwillingness or perhaps even inability for serious change. It seems that chances for the admission of Poland and other states from this region to NATO will not be realistic until these two problems are solved. For the time being, we must be happy with the "Partnership for Peace." After President's Clinton declaration about the lack of agreement among NATO countries on the admission of "new democracies," it is highly unlikely that the situation can change with only a few hours left before the "16" summit. While any decision of the North Atlantic bloc can be approved by consensus, only four states -- Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway -- accept the possibility of NATO's expansion. Even if the bloc declares that Poland might become a NATO member in the future, this would be a nonbinding declaration. It will contain nothing that would allow Poland and other Central European states to count on NATO's helping hand in the event our security is jeopardized. However, lack of "written" guarantees on the part of the only military and political organization in Europe should not be demonized. If the West thought that defending Poland was in its interests, it very well might extend us some kind of military support. Otherwise, Poland and other states of the region would have to have to expect the support -- rather hypothetically -- of the United Nations and CSCE. Several months ago, NATO spurned a Hungarian request for security guarantees -- prompted by the Balkan crisis -- saying that country could count on aid from the United Nations if its security were threatened. Bad Russia According to a widely held belief, the main reason why NATO flinches at the thought of its expansion into Central and East Europe is the Russian position. Using an entire range of diplomatic and political means, Russia managed to force the West into respecting its interests and accepting its drive to influence the area west of its state borders. While the West says it denies Russia the right to veto NATO's expansion, at the same time it explains its reluctance to have new members by citing an unwillingness to create new divisions in Europe. NATO gave Russia the time it needed to realize its significance. The West has probably committed a new sin with regard to that country by trusting that the Russian political establishment will change its perception of the Russian place in Europe and the world. After all, we all laughed at Andrey Kozyrev's "joke" at the CSCE conference in Stockholm last year, when he warned of expansionist policies if the Yeltsin team lost power in Russia. In the Background Such Western policies have created the impression that Central Europe is being pushed to the background. European relations increasingly depend on the triangle connecting Washington, Bonn, and Moscow. Germany, which has been most vocal about the need to grant Poland and other countries admission into NATO, gives priority to relations with Moscow, and the United States proposes its "strategic partnership." This goes very well with Russia's efforts that Central European states be given security guarantees. According to this policy, our countries are left in a gray zone securing a kind of geopolitical balance in Europe. This would mainly apply to Poland as a country in a significant strategic location. The West also seems to attach great importance to the "order-maintaining role" of Moscow in the CIS. This was proved at the CSCE conference in Rome which sanctioned Russian peacekeeping missions on territory of the former Soviet Union. The Russian Army can guarantee relative stability in that region and will always be able to head off any worst-case scenario. Should the Russian position continue to influence U.S. and NATO policies so much, we can be waiting for NATO admission for a very long time. No one is sure how long it will take for Russian diplomacy to fully accept the sovereignty of countries which used to be its satellites. NATO's relations with our country have little to do with the scenario that is currently developing in Moscow. No matter what happens -- whether the situation takes a dramatic turn (coup or Zhirinovskiy-style eruption of nationalism) or democracy prevails with Yeltsin agreeing to Poland's membership in NATO -- this would have little effect on Western policy concerning us. This raises the following question: Does the Russian reluctance to see Poland in NATO give the West a good excuse, a smokescreen? Behind the Smokescreen The fact that the West participates in Moscow's game cannot be explained only by the fear of Russia or a reluctance to raise new barriers in Europe. NATO does not want any new members also because the expansion of a respected and wealthy group of 16 states would change the organization itself. Organizationally and financially, it is not prepared for rebuilding its structure, deploying troops according to new principles, reforming systems of command, and allowing the East open access to modern military equipment. Notably, at its Brussels summit, the bloc is not planning to alter the strategy it adopted at the end of 1991, despite numerous promises that it will adapt it to meet conditions in the changing world. The only new element will be a decision about creating the so-called combined operational forces which could engage in UN- or CSCE-sponsored actions (also in cooperation with the East). Also, experts prepared a 900-page report on NATO's participation in peaceful operations which, given the bloc's refusal to get directly involved in the Yugoslav conflict, will only be good for recycling. In addition, France is increasingly perceived as moving closer to NATO structures. From now on, the French defense minister could participate in its meetings. No French minister has attended a NATO defense meeting since 1966, when France withdrew from the bloc's military structures. NATO politicians and diplomats emphasize that the bloc's purpose should be to "organize" a security system. NATO could become the cornerstone of a common European system in the future which would consist of cooperation in the framework of NATO, the European Union, the CSCE, and the United Nations. However, this task might not be fulfilled either, if the North Atlantic bloc turns into an elite company, keeping "new democracies" outside. "Partnership for Peace" The concept of the "Partnership for Peace," as it is presented by its American authors, can be summed up in four basic points. 1. Becoming a NATO member is a process. 2. The "Partnership" is an initial step toward possible membership; at first, all of the 22 post-communist states and NATO's partners from the North Atlantic Cooperation Council will have equal chances. This, however, does not mean that some country will automatically gain NATO membership. 3. The "Partnership" will not be a substitute for the membership for states which have a chance of becoming NATO members. 4. Besides the above conditions, NATO will not define in the immediate future any specific conditions allowing, if met, candidates to count on membership or any timetable for admission. According to the "Partnership for Peace," consultations with NATO are possible when some East European state feels that its security, territorial integrity, or independence are threatened. From the West's point of view, the following provisions are supposed to be very important: 1. Defense and budget planning; 2. Democratic (political, civilian) control over the military; 3. Cooperation in peace missions conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and CSCE; 4. Specification by each "partner" of troops which could participate in joint operations; 5. Joint training, exercises, and maneuvers; 6. Search and rescue missions; 7. Establishment of representation bureaus at NATO headquarters in Brussels and the military headquarters (SHAPE) [Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe] in Mons; a teamwork of officers; The "Partnership" program will also be open for neutral states which, in contrast to Central and East European countries, never belonged to the North Atlantic Cooperation Council.
