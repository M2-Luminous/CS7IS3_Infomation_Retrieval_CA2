Gur asserted that "this is also the view held by the prime minister." Gur toured Elqana yesterday and participated in a special local council meeting. Gur added that "a long time" will pass between the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho agreement and an agreement on Palestinian self-administration throughout the rest of Judaea and Samaria. Once again, Gur noted that this is also the prime minister's position. Deputy Minister Gur also categorically denied the report that a special Army unit will be established to deal with the Jewish settlers in Judaea, Samaria, and the Gaza Strip and described it as "complete nonsense." He also denied rumors of an intention to distribute identification tags to Jewish settlers to facilitate their passage through security checkpoints. [passage omitted]
