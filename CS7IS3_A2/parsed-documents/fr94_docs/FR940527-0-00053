FR940527-0-00053 FR940527-0-00018 Second, the commenter notes that the BOF is in compliance with the applicable opacity limit. However, this comment does not address the key question here, namely the quantity of emissions that the applicable opacity limit permits from this source. Third, the commenter notes that a modeling-monitoring comparison suggests relatively low BOF emissions. This comparison is described most fully in Appendix H to a document presenting the control program suggested by Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, a document which is included as section (d) of Appendix I of the State's submittal. USEPA's technical support document for this final rulemaking provides a more detailed review of this comparison. USEPA finds the comparison unreliable, because the analysis found concentrations that did not change in accordance with changes in emissions, because differences among current allowable emissions and actual emissions at various times were not accounted for, and because spatial prediction errors (particularly in complex terrain) and other factors introduce substantial uncertainties into this type of comparison. Consequently, the comparison between modeled and monitored concentrations does not justify the low emission rate recommended by the company. Contrary to the commenter's concern, the proposed rulemaking does reflect a review of the full document prepared by a Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel contractor and submitted by the State. The principal argument in this document relates to the quantity of solids collected in the pollution control equipment, and is addressed at column 1 of 58 FR 41223 of the notice of proposed rulemaking. It should be noted that no specific basis for estimating 99.5 percent capture has been provided, and this estimate yields an emission rate substantially lower than a ``BOF monitor'' emission factor also provided in AP&hyph;42. Appendix H also provides visible emissions data showing opacity values slightly above allowable levels, but concedes that these data do not support any particular emission rate. In summary, the notice of proposed rulemaking reflected consideration of the evidence contained in the State's submittal, concluded that allowable emissions at the BOF are substantially greater than those assumed in the attainment demonstration, and concluded that the State's analysis did not adequately demonstrate attainment. The commenters have not provided adequate basis to alter this finding. Comment: A commenter believes that the State's submittal adequately addresses intermediate terrain. The commenter states that ``at the time of our analysis (January through September 1991), no EPA approved model existed for intermediate terrain processing. We used software developed for PSD applications in complex terrain in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and approved by EPA Region III.'' Response: USEPA guidance now and at the time of SIP development (1991) requires the use of both a simple terrain model and a complex terrain model at all intermediate terrain receptors. The higher estimated concentration on an hour by hour basis is used to judge attainment. (See Guidelines on Air Quality Models and a memorandum on the subject dated June 8, 1989, to Alan Cimorelli from Joseph Tikvart, chief of USEPA's Source Receptor Analysis Branch.) The commenter is correct that no single model was available at the time of SIP development (1991) to perform the full analysis. Nevertheless, procedures were (and are) available to perform such an analysis (or, in many cases, to perform briefer analyses demonstrably giving the same results), some of which were recommended to Ohio and West Virginia in a meeting with USEPA in March 1991. As for PSD applications, USEPA does not approve PSD permits in West Virginia or Pennsylvania. Although it is conceivable that USEPA may have failed to identify inappropriate treatment of intermediate terrain in selected PSD cases, the commenter has not shown that a precedent has been knowingly set that would be germane to this SIP analysis. Thus, no basis for exempting the State from this requirement exists. Comment: The State comments that condensible particulate matter emissions are negligible in the Steubenville area, but agrees to reexamine the issue and to address the issue in further documentation to be provided to USEPA. Response: The technical support document for the notice of proposed rulemaking identified absence of condensible particulate matter in the Steubenville emissions inventory as one of the deficiencies in the area's attainment demonstration. These emissions may or may not be minor, and this deficiency cannot be considered addressed without evaluation of available information for the emission points contained in the inventory. Comment: The State confirms USEPA's understanding that limits in Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;08(B) apply to all coke pushing operations and all vented material handling operations in the State. Response: The notice of proposed rulemaking expressed concern as to the enforceability of Rule 3745&hyph;17&hyph;08(B) for coke pushing and ventable materials handling operations. This rule requires implementation of at least one of nine reasonably available control measures, and sets a limit of 0.030 grains per dry standard cubic foot (or no visible emissions) if venting is required. USEPA proposed to interpret this rule as applying this limit to coke pushing and ventable material handling operations. The State's comment confirms that this interpretation is appropriate and consistent with the State's interpretation. Comment: One commenter noted that USEPA's notice of proposed rulemaking incorrectly characterized the limit for the one allowed excursion of the general stack opacity limit as being 27 percent. Response: The commenter is correct. The Ohio general stack opacity rule being approved today allows the one permissible 6-minute average excursion of the usual 20 percent opacity limit to have up to 60 percent opacity. Comment: One commenter submitted a lengthy statement of appeal of the State rules, thereby submitting a variety of comments. These comments are described further in USEPA's technical support document for this rulemaking. The comments include expressions of concern about BOF opacity limits, procedures used to adopt these State rules, accuracy of emissions parameters for LTV, and the need for controls given that monitoring shows attainment. Response: USEPA's technical support document provides a review of each of the submitted comments. In summary, USEPA has substantial evidence that the BOF opacity limit is reasonably achievable, USEPA remains satisfied with the procedures used to adopt these rules, USEPA has no reason to doubt any specific emission parameter (other than the allowable emission rate for coke quenching), and monitoring does not address whether emissions at full allowable rates would cause violations. Comment: Ohio EPA indicated plans to modify its rules in several ways to address USEPA's concerns. Ohio EPA intends to revise its quench water test method to provide for weekly averaging of 5 days' samples. Ohio EPA intends to submit a revised attainment demonstration for the Steubenville area. Ohio EPA intends to modify its rules to require that the entire control plan for Ford's Cleveland Casting Plant be implemented by December 10, 1993, thereby providing timely satisfaction of the RACM requirement in Section 189(a)(1)(C). Response: It appears likely that the anticipated rule revisions concerning quench water testing and concerning Ford's compliance schedule will satisfactorily address the relevant USEPA concerns. However, USEPA cannot base its review on anticipated rule revisions and analyses which have not yet been submitted. The comments do not justify revised judgment of the November 1991 submittal. However, with respect to the Cuyahoga County plan, if Ohio adopts and submits rule revisions as indicated in its comments, USEPA expects to be able to publish a notice of final approval of this plan, without further proposal.
