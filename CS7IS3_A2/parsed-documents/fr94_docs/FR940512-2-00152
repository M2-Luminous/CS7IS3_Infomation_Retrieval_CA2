FR940512-2-00152 FR940512-2-00069 In the Commission's opinion, the above goals also will be furthered by the requirement that convertible bonds be delisted whenever the underlying equity security is no longer subject to a reporting obligation. If the related equity merely moves from the NYSE to another market, it is not inconsistent with the Act for the Exchange to have discretion to continue listing the convertible debt, unless the underlying security is delisted because the issuer has violated one of the NYSE's corporate responsibility criteria. As a general matter, the Commission would have serious concerns about any proposal that does not provide for the delisting of convertible bonds where a company acts to disadvantage its shareholders. The NYSE addresses this concern by committing to delist convertible bonds when the issuer has violated corporate governance listing standards. Finally, at this time, the Commission believes that it is reasonable for the NYSE to treat the debt of certain noncorporate issuers ( i.e., foreign governments, American states and localities, government agencies) like the debt of ``unaffiliated'' corporate issuers. As such, non-corporate debt would have to meet certain rating requirements before listing. 32 Nevertheless, as the NYSE gains experience with listing and trading sovereign and municipal bonds, the Commission expects the Exchange to monitor the adequacy of its existing standards and to develop more narrowly tailored ones where appropriate. 32 See supra , notes 11&hyph;13 and accompanying text. In addition, such debt would have to comply with the applicable registration requirements of Section 12 of the Act. The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendment No. 1 clarifies and codifies the intent of certain language used in the original filing. Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period. Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rules change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to Amendment No. 1 between the Commission and any persons, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of such filing will also be available at the principal office of the NYSE. All submissions should refer to File No. SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;49 and should be submitted by June 2, 1994. IV. Conclusion It is therefore ordered, Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 33 that the proposed rule change (SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;93&hyph;49), including Amendment No. 1 on an accelerated basis, is approved. 33 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 34 34 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
