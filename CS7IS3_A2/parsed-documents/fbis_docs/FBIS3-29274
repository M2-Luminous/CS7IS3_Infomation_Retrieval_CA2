FBIS3-29274 "dreas032_d_94028" FBIS-EAS-94-032 Document Type:Daily Report 16 Feb 1994 South Korea Semiconductor Industry Expects Increased Exports SK1602020294 Seoul YONHAP in English 0713 GMT 15 Feb 94 SK1602020294 Seoul YONHAP Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Seoul, Feb. 15 (YONHAP) -- The South Korean semiconductor industry began this year with an unprecendented increase in exports, the Korean Semiconductor Industry Association and other business sources said on Tuesday. Global demand for semiconductors continued to rise early this year and exports of South Korean semiconductors soared last month. Exports are expected to increase further in the second half of this year when full-fledged exports of 16 mega DRAMs [dynamic random access memory] begin. Samsung Electronics Co. exported 248 million U.S. dollars worth of semiconductors in January, up 82.3 percent from a year ago. The figure marks Samsung's biggest export rate increase on a monthly comparison basis since 1990. Semiconductor exports by Goldstar Electron Co. increased 48.6 percent from 74 million dollars in January last year to 110 million dollars last month. Hyundai Electronic Co., which produces semiconductors mainly by assembling parts on already designed wafers, expanded its integrated processing production system which includes design, wafer processing and assembly this year to increase the added value of its exports. Hyundai exported 83 million dollars worth of semiconductors in January this year, up 73 percent from 48 million dollars a year earlier. Hyundai's proportion of integrated processing exports to exports of assembled semiconductors was one to two last year, but last month the proportion changed to three to one. Anam Electronics Co., which assembles only semiconductors, exported 155 million dollars worth last month, up 35.6 percent from the same month last year. Korean semiconductor makers plan to invest three trillion won (about 3.7 billion U.S. dollars) in facility investment this year. A business source said, "demand for 4 mega-DRAMs will soar to the peak this year, and demand for 16 mega-DRAMs will begin to increase rapidly from the second half of this year. South Korea's semiconductor exports are thus expected to easily surpass 10 billion dollars this year."
