FR940622-0-00102 FR940622-0-00020 50 CFR Part 630 [I.D. 061794A] Atlantic Swordfish Fishery AGENCY: National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Commerce. ACTION: Closure of the Atlantic swordfish drift gillnet fishery. SUMMARY: NMFS closes the drift gillnet fishery for swordfish in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 N. lat. NMFS has determined that the first semiannual quota for swordfish that may be harvested by drift gillnet will be reached on or before June 25, 1994. This closure is necessary to prevent the catch of swordfish by drift gillnet vessels from exceeding the quota. EFFECTIVE DATE: Closure is effective 0001 hours, local time, June 25, 1994, through June 30, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Richard B. Stone, 301-713- 2347. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Atlantic swordfish fishery is managed under the authority of the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. ) and the Atlantic Tunas Convention Act (16 U.S.C. 971 et seq. ). The implementing regulations at 50 CFR 630.24(b)(1)(i)(A) establish a quota of 69,286 lbs (31,428 kg) of swordfish that may be harvested by drift gillnet during the period January 1 through June 30, each year. Under 50 CFR 630.25(a), NMFS is required to close the drift gillnet fishery for swordfish when its quota is reached, or is projected to be reached, by filing a notice with the Office of the Federal Register at least 8 days before the closure is to become effective. Based on the current level of swordfish catch by drift gillnets, historic data on average catch per set for June, and the number of vessels fishing or expected to fish, NMFS has determined that the drift gillnet quota for the January 1 through June 30 period will be reached on or before June 25, 1994. Hence, the drift gillnet fishery for Atlantic swordfish is closed effective 0001 hours, local time, June 25, 1994, through June 30, 1994, when a new semiannual quota becomes available. NMFS may adjust the July 1 through December 31, 1994, drift gillnet quota to reflect actual catches made in the January 1 through June 30, 1994, semiannual period as specified in 50 CFR 630.24. During this closure of the drift gillnet fishery: (1) A person aboard a vessel using or having aboard a drift gillnet may not fish for swordfish from the North Atlantic swordfish stock; (2) no more than two swordfish per trip may be possessed in the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, north of 5 N. lat.; and (3) no more than two swordfish per trip may be landed in an Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, or Caribbean coastal state. Classification This action is required by 50 CFR 630.25(a) and is exempt from OMB review under E.O. 12866. Dated: June 17, 1994. David S. Crestin, Acting Director, Office of Fisheries Conservation and Management, National Marine Fisheries Service.
