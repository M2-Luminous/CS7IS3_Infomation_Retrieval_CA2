In a special address circulated this afternoon, the SDS National Coordinating Council (top political leadership) calls for united action on all democratic forces sharing the SDS principles and policy documents. For more than a year and a half now, the SDS has been trying in vain to precipitate early general elections (regular elections are due in the autumn of 1995). At its congress in early June, the ex- communist Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) declared itself in favour of elections this coming autumn. Extraparliamentary parties are also clamouring for early elections. On May 26, the Lyuben Berov Cabinet was voted confidence by parliament on the strength of a programme which covers the period ending this September. On May 20, parliament voted down the structural cabinet changes proposed by the prime minister. The SDS saw Prof. Berov's refusal to resign in the wake of the latter vote as a violation of the constitution which illegitimizes the government. The SDS petitioned the Constitutional Court to rule on the matter. The Court's ruling was announced today. According to it, the prime minister need not resign when parliament votes down any cabinet changes he may move. SDS Filip Dimitrov and BSP leader Zhan Videnov met yesterday to discuss ways of achieving early elections. They, however, failed to reach agreement. "SDS warns of the danger of turning the Bulgarian Parliament, controlled by BSP and its satellites, into a machine for recommunization of the country and for relapse into the methods of the half-century-old communist dictatorship," today's SDS address says. The coalition sees elections as the only way out. The union remains committed to the position, reaffirmed at its latest national conference in May, that it will not take part in the formation of a new government within the lifetime of the incumbent parliament. BSP leader Zhan Videnov says SDS would not provide guarantees of early parliamentary elections. "The intra-coalition problems which are taking the upper hand in the SDS deny it the possibility to implement flexible and pragmatic policy and that is why the resolutions of the SDS National Conference are followed blindly," the BSP leader emphasized.
