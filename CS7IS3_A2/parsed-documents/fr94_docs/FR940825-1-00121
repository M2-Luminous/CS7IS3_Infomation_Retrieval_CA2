FR940825-1-00121 FR940825-1-00009 As indicated previously, the Act does not require Tribes to submit TIPs. For that reason and other reasons specified above, EPA is not proposing to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for the implementation plan submittal deadlines specified in the Act. See Part III.B above. Further, EPA is proposing to accept any reasonably severable portion of an applicable Tribal implementation plan. EPA is proposing to apply the completeness criteria to TIPs in the manner described below. If a Tribe submits a reasonably severable portion of a TIP that meets applicable completeness criteria, EPA will continue to process the submittal. If the submittal is incomplete EPA will return it to the Tribe, identifying the deficiencies. EPA will exercise one of two options with respect to a complete TIP submittal. EPA will fully approve any portion of a TIP if it is reasonably severable and meets the applicable Federal requirements. For any portion that is not approvable, EPA will disapprove the submittal and work closely with the Tribe to correct the identified deficiencies. However, as noted earlier in Part III.B, EPA's disapproval of a TIP will not have the mandatory sanctions consequences that apply to States under section 179 of the Act or the consequences under section 110(c)(1) of requiring a FIP within two years of the disapproval. As with SIPs, TIPs should be submitted to the EPA Regional Office for the region in which the Tribe is located. Addendum B to this notice contains a list and the addresses of EPA's Regional Offices and a map indicating the regions that they encompass. Any Tribes that have not yet been determined to be eligible by EPA for CAA program purposes must submit the materials described in Part III.A above, in conjunction with any TIP submittal. 3. Procedures for Reviewing Other Tribal Air Programs (``TAPs'') EPA will review all other Tribal air program submittals in light of the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements as well as EPA policy, including the modular concept described above. EPA is proposing in today's rule to treat Tribes in the same manner as States for all of the provisions of the CAA, with the limited exceptions identified in Part III.B & C above. However, EPA recognizes that in proposing this rule and obtaining comments, EPA may not have anticipated and identified all of those requirements applicable to States that would be infeasible or inappropriate to apply to Tribes. Therefore, EPA is proposing to add a regulatory provision that will generally allow Tribes to demonstrate to EPA, in conjunction with the submittal of a TAP, that treatment of a Tribe in the same manner as a State for a particular provision is inappropriate or administratively infeasible. EPA will review the Tribal demonstration and take appropriate action. TAPs should be submitted to the Regional Office for the region in which the Tribe is located. See Addendum B. EPA will internally review TAPs in the same manner as it reviews State submittals for the specific CAA programs presented, consulting with and obtaining the concurrence of the appropriate EPA offices. A determination that a TAP is not approvable or that a Tribe has not met the general eligibility requirements described in Part III.A above does not preclude the Tribe from making subsequent submittals at a future date. If EPA determines that a Tribal submittal is deficient or incomplete, EPA will work closely with the Tribe to identify and correct the deficiencies. D. Revisions to CAA Implementing Regulations The regulations implementing the CAA span many pages of the Code of Federal Regulations. In today's action, EPA is proposing to add new 40 CFR part 49, which will address the Tribal CAA authority described in this notice. To implement this authority EPA is also proposing to add a general requirement in part 49 that eligible Tribes will be treated in the same manner as States under all of EPA's existing, currently effective regulations implementing the Clean Air Act, except those regulations implementing provisions of the CAA for which EPA has concluded that it would be inappropriate to treat Tribes as States. Such exceptions are described in detail in Part III.B of this notice.
