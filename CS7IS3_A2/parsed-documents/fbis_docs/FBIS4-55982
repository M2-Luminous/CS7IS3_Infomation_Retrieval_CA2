This is roughly the opinion of Jan Hronik, who took part in the talks on behalf of the Trade and Industry Ministry. During his visit to Moscow in April and within the framework of his talks on restructuring the Russian debts, Vaclav Klaus also agreed with the Russian prime minister that the list of goods that Russia, during the course of this and next year, would deliver to Czech enterprises as part payment of its debts will be signed in May. In Prague, however, the Russian delegation -- according to Hronik -- submitted a list of goods that does not correspond to the requirements and needs of the Czech side, even if the goods were to be earmarked for reexport. Apparently, the bulk of the Russian list was made up of engineering products, which are manufactured in the Czech Republic, while the Czech side would be interested, first and foremost, in certain Russian raw materials. Nevertheless, the two sides are willing to work further on the list and to harmonize their concepts, although it is clear that the Czech Republic will, obviously, be more active. There already exists a draft mechanism whereby the receipts from the eventual import of Russian goods would be divided between the enterprises that have outstanding claims in Russia. Their overall amount hovers around $300 million. A little progress was also made on the possibility of capitalizing these outstanding claims. In Prague, the Russian side submitted proposals for facilities in which the state is still involved and that the Russian state would perhaps be willing to offer the Czech enterprises in return for their outstanding claims. This involves, for example, electrical engineering and petrochemical products and some unfinished facilities. The Czech firms interested in capitalizing their outstanding claims in Russia can already "hold consultations" with the Russian State Committee for the Administration of State Property -- which is the local version of the Czech National Property Fund -- on their concepts. Nevertheless, a law is only now being drafted in Russia that would make foreign investment possible by a form of capitalizing outstanding claims. Russia does not have the slightest wish to include oil and gas in the list of goods suggested as a part payment of its debts. Nevertheless, following the Prague talks, it seems that an inter- governmental protocol could be signed in the foreseeable future that would guarantee the Czech Republic a long-term Russian supply of both oil and gas. Whereas, in view of the envisaged diversification of sources, the precise volume of oil would be specified every year (this would involve roughly 7.0 million tonnes per annum), in the case of gas, the protocol would define directly the amount for each year (8.0 billion cubic meters in 1996 up to 10.5 billion in the year 2000). Naturally, the payment for the oil is expected in convertible currencies at world prices and at world conditions, while part of the gas could perhaps be paid for by Czech construction and supplies for the Russian gas industry and by transit services.
