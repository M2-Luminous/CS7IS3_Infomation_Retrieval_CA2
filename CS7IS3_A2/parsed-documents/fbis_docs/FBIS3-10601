The document presented by the United States was adopted by a vote of 24 in favor and nine against, with 20 abstentions. Nicaragua and El Salvador were the only Latin American countries to back the resolution. According to diplomatic sources, the result of the vote did not satisfy the United States which insisted, up to the last minute, that it would obtain 40 votes in favor. A project similarly based on selectivity and discrimination in the treatment towards Cuba at the UN Human Rights Commission was also approved under U.S. pressure last year, by a vote of 27 in favor -- only three more than this time.
