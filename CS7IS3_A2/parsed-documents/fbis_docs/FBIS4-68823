And the struggle between proponents and opponents of "intervention" in the domestic money-credit market today has moved on to the political plane and is raising havoc mainly in the corridors of executive and legislative power, including presidential structures. As we know, the next stage in the backroom battle involved in the determination of the role and position of foreign banks in Russia's financial system ended with a victory for the "isolationists" in the form of Edict of the President of the Russian Federation No. 1924 of 17 November 1993. There is no doubt that on this protectionist normative act, which caused a stormy reaction from the "internationalists," lies the stamp of political conditions related to the election campaign underway during this period, which certain domestic banking structures were able to take advantage of. But the discussion is continuing up to the present time. More and more frequently voices are ringing out, including at the highest level, from people who are in favor of overriding or amending this presidential edict, which limited for the period up to 1 January 1996 the activity of foreign banks on the territory of the Russian Federation to operations with legal entities and individuals who are nonresidents of the Russian Federation. Perhaps even keeping in mind the fact that we are striving to become more open to the outside world and actively inviting foreign investors in (let us note that in practically all international economic or financial forums, from negotiations concerning entry into the GATT to backroom conversations at the session of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in St. Petersburg, the theme of "reciprocity" is present in one form or another), not a single objective economist will give a simple answer to the question of whether foreign banks are an evil or a good from the standpoint of Russia's national interests. Internationalization As a General Tendency in the Development of the Modern System Internationalization of the credit and banking sphere, which is an objective consequence of the process of globalization of capital and the expansion and deepening of international economic relations, has become a most important factor in the entire system of the world economy today. The most significant role in foreign expansion of loan capital in the modern stage belongs to the largest banks of the United States, Japan, and the leading countries of Western Europe which, relying on their stable domestic positions, have become powerful credit and financial centers. Their activity is having an ever more appreciable effect not only on the credit-monetary and currency policy of developing countries but also on their overall economic policy. In recent years leading transnational banks (TNB) have been exerting an ever greater influence on the domestic political processes of their host countries. Let us recall that a most important factor in strengthening international expansion of banks of the United States and other developed countries during the 1970's and 1980's was the need for comprehensive credit-financial service for industrial TNK's [transnational corporations] which were busily expanding their activity on a global scale during that period. During all these years the rates of growth of revenues from the activity of foreign branches outstripped the profit from operations in the national market. Therefore even by the middle of the 1980's the proportion of the profit of American TNB's from international operations amounted to about 50 percent. As world practice shows, the development of foreign expansion of TNB's usually goes through three stages. Thus for the TNB's of the United States up until the middle of the 1970's the attack on foreign markets proceeded along the extensive path (quantitative increase in the number of foreign branches, encompassing new geographical zones), which corresponded to the period of internationalization of capital "in breadth." For the five years after that the prevailing tendency was internationalization of capital "in depth," that is, intensive penetration of TNB's into the national monetary-credit systems of the receiving countries in order to cover clients and functions of local banks, which was accompanied by an increase in the assets of the foreign branches. In parallel, operations of TNB subdivisions in world financial centers have expanded and become more complicated. The first half of the 1990's, in our view, is characterized by two important tendencies in international banking: First, there is a further liberalization of national banking legislation on the plane of removing restrictions on the activity of foreign institutions within the framework of processes of deepening international economic integration on the global and regional levels; second, there is a marked growth of the number of takeovers and mergers in order to consolidate capital and enlarge the leading national banks as a means of protection from foreign competition and consolidation of their own international positions. The Reality and the Prospects As of November 1993 there were 1,932 commercial banks registered on the territory of Russia, including 155 with the participation of "nearby" foreign countries and 15 in which the share of foreign participation exceeded 50 percent. In keeping with the "Conditions for Opening Banks with the Participation of Foreign Investments on the Territory of the Russian Federation," the maximum amount of foreign capital in the banking system of Russia has been set at 12 percent. Actually at the end of 1993 it had not reached 8 percent of the total capital of banks registered in our country. Among the vigorously functioning institutions with foreign capital one can include the International Moscow Bank (MMB). Of its joint-stock capital, 60 percent belongs to five European banks (of Austria, Germany, Finland, Italy, and France) and 40 percent--to three Russian banks. It began its activity in October 1989, specializing mainly in operations in foreign currency and gradually expanding the range of services it offered. As of the beginning of 1994 in terms of assets (3.05 trillion rubles [R]) the MMB occupied fourth place on the list of the largest commercial banks of Russia. If one is to speak of banks with 100 percent foreign capital, one would have to single out the Austria bank, which in the autumn of 1992 was the first to receive a license from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation to open a branch in Russia. Beginning at this time this bank has operated on our market practically without competition from other foreign credit-financial institutions, since banks with French, Swiss, German, or American capital, which also had general licenses for the right to conduct banking operations on the territory of Russia, were occupied mainly with studying the market and investing in their own real estate, and they were unable to occupy real positions in the financial system of the Russian Federation until the president's edict was published. According to estimates of specialists from this bank, the fears that the large Russian clients could switch their service to foreign competitors, if they were given a general license and the president's edict were overridden, are quite justified. But if in the near future activity in Russia were to be developed by such powerful and aggressive banks as Credit Lyonnaise, Societe Generale, Credit Suisse, BNP-Dresdner Bank, Citibank, and Chase Manhattan Bank, the outflow of solid clients from the Russian banks could start to avalanche. To all that has been said it should be added that several other large Western Banks today are waiting for licenses from the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, and about 100 "prospectors" with the rank of representatives could wish to be transformed into branches as soon as they can perceive any real advantage from such a step. Russian Banks Abroad At the present time even for the largest Russian commercial banks the existence of foreign structures outside the CIS is an extremely rare phenomenon. At the level of branches there is Inkombank in Cyprus and National Credit in the United States. The latter has not really developed yet. Other banks must be satisfied with a few representative offices at best. Actually as of the beginning of the year only in Nicosia was there a full-fledged functioning branch of Inkombank, which rendered its clients a fairly broad spectrum of service: opening and keeping of current, savings, deposit, and other accounts; making settlements for export-import operations; insuring foreign trade, credit, and deposit transactions; managing free monetary funds; conducting operations on the money market and the capital market; organizing marketing research of trade and financial markets of the Mediterranean and Near Eastern regions. A representative office of the Optimum Bank has also been opened on Cyprus. (This zone in general is attracting the attention of Russian Businessmen because of the offshore conditions and the liberal legislation in effect there.) Inkombank also has representative offices in Frankfurt-am-Main (Germany) and Geneva (Switzerland). This same bank has an office of a legal representative in New York. The Stolichnyy Bank maintains a representative office in the Netherlands which it is planning to transform into a branch. After the signing of the edict on restricting the activity of foreign banks on the territory of Russia the process of foreign "expansion" of Russian commercial banks began to falter. Taking advantage of bureaucratic obstacles, our Western partners are making Russia understand the principle of parity. Therefore, although formally local registration does not impede this, they are slowing up the consideration of documents for the transformation of the Geneva representative office of Inkombank into a branch and the creation of its subsidiary company in Germany. For the same reason Menatep and Kredit-Moskva cannot regulate similar problems in the United States and Optimum--in Switzerland. In our view, the West does not always react objectively enough to the situation developing with respect to problems surrounding transnationalization of Russia's banking. Taking into account Russia's status as a "developing banking power" (the oldest commercial banks are only six years old), we could quite justifiably count on preferential conditions. Unfortunately, legislation in certain countries prohibits foreign banks that have been in existence for less than 10 years from opening branches. Let us emphasize that respectable banking circles value their reputation very much. This closed corporate caste is unwilling to open its doors to newcomers. Unfortunately, in the West there is the widespread conviction that organized crime has significantly penetrated into Russian commercial structures, including the banking sphere. And Russia as a whole is in the category of countries with a high political risk for investments and long-term business partnership. Speaking of quotas and the prospects of foreign expansion, one cannot forget about the existence in Russia of a network of former Soviet foreign banks which after the severe crisis at the end of 1991 were associated with the suspension of payments by the Foreign Economics Bank and significantly stabilized their position. Now more than 50 percent of their shares belong to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the rest are distributed among other banks. So in the future most powerful commercial banks could break into Western Europe and other regions by acquiring a controlling block of shares of these financial structures which are still under the control of our state. The advantage of these banks consists in that they are known in international business circles, they have a stable position in national markets of certain countries, and they have highly skilled personnel and good technical supply. In solving the problem of the entry of Russian commercial banks into "more distant" foreign countries, an important role will undoubtedly be played by the Central Bank of Russia, whose leadership is frequently unjustifiably criticized because of its lack of an active position in negotiations with central banks and banking commissions of foreign countries regarding granting our credit institutions a most-favored-nation status. In parallel the Central Bank of the Russian Federation is reproached because it "poorly" protects the interests of the Russian commercial banks on the domestic market, granting preferential, almost offshore conditions to foreign competitors. Behind accusations of the Central Bank for "non-patriotism" one can frequently see objective selfish interests of individual Russian commercial banks which quite justifiably fear competition from the transnational banks of the United States, Western Europe, and Japan, which are considerably more powerful financially and more experienced on the professional plane. In this connection it should be emphasized that one of the main tasks of the Central Bank is to stimulate the overall effectiveness of the country's banking system, including through healthy competition. `For' and `Against' Most frequently people look for an answer to the question of whether "to allow or not to allow" competitors from abroad into our country along the paths of analysis of the consequences of this kind of invasion for the Russian banking system and the country's economy as a whole. And if one is to indicate the extreme viewpoints, among the arguments "for" one can include the following: Foreign banks would have to bring with them century-old traditions, advanced technologies, high quality of service, professionalism, many years of experience in operating in developed monetary-credit markets of Western countries, obedience to the law, and along with all this incentives for healthy competition. The arguments "against" are basically concentrated around the problem of "occupation" of the Russian market by financially powerful foreign banks which will quickly take over the young growth of national commercial banks and take key levers of administration of the domestic economy into their hands. Many Western experts are insistently recommending to the Russian Government and the new parliament that they permit foreign banks to freely conduct operations in Russia. During a business meeting of Russian and American bankers held in Washington in January 1994 the chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States, K. Brodie, expressed his negative attitude toward the restrictions introduced in Russia on the activity of foreign banks. He was supported by representatives of the Russian commercial bank Tokobank. On the other hand, the leaders of the Association of Russian Bankers and Inkombank advanced arguments in support of the president's edict. On the whole this kind of polar attitude toward the given problem is typical of the banking environment in Russia. As a poll conducted by the bulletin "Russian Economic Barometer" showed, a negative attitude toward the idea of the presence of foreign banks in the credit and stock markets of Russia on a par with domestic ones was expressed by 55 percent of the representatives of the boards of the leading banks of 32 regions of Russia, 35 percent of the respondents were inclined to be positive, and 10 percent were neutral. This same poll also showed that large profitable banks with a permit for the capital were more inclined to fear foreign competition. It is known that such extremely large Russian banks as Most-Bank, Stolichnyy, and Menatep have a negative attitude toward removing the restrictions on the activity of foreign banks in the domestic market. A more restrained position is held by the banks Imperial and Rossiyskiy Kredit, whose leaders think that to close this sphere off to foreign competition is unthinkable while control and certain restrictions (but not as severe as are envisioned by the president's edict) are necessary. There are marked disagreements regarding this problem on the high political Olympus of Russia. In civilized countries such contradictions are resolved through the normal legislative process and not "pirate" regulation of banking activity. It should be noted that attempts to regulate the situation and achieve a compromise have been made repeatedly. Let us recall that at the end of the summer of 1993 at a conference with the participation of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, the government, and representatives of the commercial banks it seemed that mutual understanding had been reached. But soon there appeared the notorious letter signed by the president of the Russian Federation which presented amendments to the law on banking activity. As a result "pro-Western" sympathies began to be ascribed to the head of state on the grounds that he was against having foreign banks end up with "less favorable legal conditions than those of domestic banks." After the last November edict the vector of criticism shifted in the opposite direction. The demand for protection of the national financial market is objectively justified, especially during the period of its establishment, but complete isolation from foreign influence is hardly reasonable. In this connection, in our view, the Central Bank of Russia took a fairly weighed position of "restrained liberalism" or "reasonable protectionism," with respect to accepting foreign investments into the banking sphere of Russia. This policy of "half-open doors" presupposes gradual access in doses for those foreign banks that have a stable financial position and an irreproachable business reputation. Recently in one form or another the question of the need to amend the president's edict has also been raised by members of the Cabinet of Ministers who are leaders of the leading economic ministries. During the time of the visit of the chairman of the state Duma to the United States he also expressed the idea that the presence of foreign banks in Russia is necessary for healthy competition. There is no doubt that there is another aspect to this entire story. If the presidential structures and the government as well as the new parliament start to defend the interests of foreign credit-financial institutions too zealously they could lose support from a considerable part of Russian banking circles. If they strike in the other direction and take too rigid a position with respect to foreign bankers, many questions of trade and economic cooperation with the West, the attraction of foreign investments, regulation of foreign indebtedness, and Russia's entry as a full-fledged member into the international economic community could be appreciably aggravated. What To Do? If the question of the need to attract foreign capital in order to advance our economy today no longer evokes even sluggish discussions (we are "for" and so far they are not very eager toward us), the problem of forming an infrastructure for their effective functioning should not cause such stormy negative emotions on the part of politicians and financial experts. In the appendix to the message from the president of the Russian Federation to the state Duma containing a list of draft laws planned to be raised for discussion in 1994, No. 32 is the number the legislative act, "On the Banking System of the Russian Federation," which should determine the legal position of foreign banks in our country. Apparently it will be necessary to conduct serious hearings regarding this draft law so as to find a compromise on this problem that is acceptable to all parties. Otherwise the normative base of the most important economic sphere in the country will remain a field where there is play without rules, where lobbyists representing interests of individual involved financial groups will always end up in "fisticuffs." And a last remark. A law "On Lobbying Activity in the Russian Federation," which was prepared long ago and was lost in the archives of the last parliament, should be immediately included on the list of legislative acts to be adopted this year.
