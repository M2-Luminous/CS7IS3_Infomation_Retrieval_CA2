Wednesday and were taken to Peace House on the Southern side of the border by American Ambassador James Laney for a 30-minute break before the big crossover. They were led into the Military Armistice Commission (MAC) conference room at 10:50 A.M., pulling up in a motorcade of four vehicles. The former President, clad in a dark grey suit, emerged from a Cadillac with his wife and waved to the press without answering any questions. Showing some emotion as he stopped at the Military Demarcation Line, which is only about 5cm in width, Carter waved at both halves of the divided peninsula for a few minutes. -- Carter came to Seoul once before -- in June 1979 when he stayed overnight at Camp Casey -- but this was his first visit to Panmunjom. The former U.S. leader will make history of sorts by becoming the first person to go to the North via Panmunjom and return to Seoul, again via the truce village. Previous foreign visitors, including U.S. Rep. Gary Ackerman and U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali, had all passed through Panmunjom to enter North Korea but flew out directly from Pyongyang to Beijing. -- Pak Im-su, deputy chief liaison officer, and two others came down from the North Korean side to greet Carter. Forrest Chilton, U.N. secretary to MAC, introduced Carter to Pak and the former President headed to the Northern side after a brief entry procedure. The ex-first couple posed for the media -- CNN, China's XINHUA news agency and Russia's TASS -- again in front of Panmungak on the northern side. --The mood was unusually tense on the southern side because of the status of the former U.S. President, according to Seoul officials. "He may be an ex-President, but the U.S. side is providing security as if he were an incumbent," said one official. "A mobile task force is waiting within one minute's running distance." Inside sources pointed to a significant increase in the number of security officials from both the South Korean and American military. Two officials from the U.S. Presidential Security Office reportedly entered North Korea Monday for a prior safety check, attesting to the tight preparations by the U.S. side. The vice director of the International Department at the North's Nodong Party, Song Ho-kyong, was spotted on a stairway about 30 meters from the demarcation line as part of Pyongyang's welcoming committee. He remained aloof until he saw Carter arrive in Panmunjom, then trotted down the stairs to welcome him. -- The Carters had to send their luggage ahead two hours in advance after regular customs clearance. Officials said the procedure was the same as airport customs clearance, conducted by customs officials specially dispatched for the day. Later, Chilton made a brief announcement that Carter had successfully entered North Korea at the end of the crossover. He said the South had asked the North to guarantee the former President's safety at the demarcation line, and North Korea readily agreed.
