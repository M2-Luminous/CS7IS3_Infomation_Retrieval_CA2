FR941102-1-00040 FR941102-1-00007 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 52 [IN22&hyph;3&hyph;6576; FRL&hyph;5096&hyph;9] Approval and Promulgation of an Implementation Plan for Vehicle Miles Traveled; Indiana AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency. ACTION: Proposed rule. SUMMARY: The United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposes to approve a request for a State Implementation Plan (SIP) revision, addressing the Lake and Porter County ozone nonattainment area, submitted by the State of Indiana for the purpose of offsetting any growth in emissions from growth in vehicle miles traveled (VMT) or number of vehicle trips, and to attain reduction in motor vehicle emissions, in combination with other emission reduction requirements, as necessary to comply with Reasonable Further Progress (RFP) milestones and attainment requirements of the Clean Air Act (Act). The rationale for this proposed approval is set forth below; additional information is available at the address indicated below. DATES: Comments on this proposed rule must be received on or before December 2, 1994. ADDRESSES: Written comments should be sent to: J. Elmer Bortzer, Chief, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), USEPA, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604&hyph;3590. Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for inspection during normal business hours at the following location: Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois, 60604. Please contact Patricia Morris at (312) 353&hyph;8656 before visiting the Region 5 office. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia Morris, Regulation Development Section, Regulation Development Branch (AR&hyph;18J), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 5, 77 West Jackson Boulevard, Chicago, Illinois 60604, (312) 353&hyph;8656. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background Section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act, as amended in 1990 (Act), requires States containing ozone nonattainment areas classified as ``severe'' pursuant to section 181(a) of the Act to adopt transportation control measures (TCMs) and transportation control strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips, and to attain reductions in motor vehicle emissions (in combination with other emission reduction requirements) as necessary to comply with the Act's RFP milestones and attainment requirements. The requirements for establishing a VMT Offset program are discussed in the April 16, 1992, General Preamble to title I of the Act (57 FR 13498), in addition to section 182(d)(1)(A) of the Act. For certain programs required under the Act (including VMT&hyph;Offset), USEPA had earlier adopted a policy pursuant to section 110(k)(4) of the Act to conditionally approve SIPs that committed to provide the USEPA with specific enforceable measures by a date certain. That interpretation was challenged in Natural Resources Defense Council v. Browner , consolidated lawsuits brought in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. In a full opinion, dated May 6, 1994 (and in a March 8, 1994 Order and April 22, 1994 Amended Order issued earlier), the Court found that USEPA's conditional approval interpretation exceeded USEPA's statutory authority. While the Court did not specifically address the VMT Offset program in its orders or opinions, USEPA believes that the Court's general conclusions that the USEPA's construction of the conditional approval provision was unlawful precludes USEPA from taking action to approve any submitted VMT Offset committal SIPs. On September 10, 1993, the USEPA published a proposed rule (58 FR 47701) to conditionally approve Indiana's commitment for the VMT&hyph;Offset requirement. In light of the Court opinion, Indiana has withdrawn the committal SIP in a letter dated July 5, 1994. In light of the outcome of the litigation, USEPA has decided that it would be appropriate to interpret the VMT Offset provision of the Act to account for how States can practicably comply with each of the provision's elements. The VMT Offset provision requires that States submit by November 15, 1992, specific enforceable TCMs and strategies to offset any growth in emissions from growth in VMT or number of vehicle trips sufficient to allow total area emissions to comply with the RFP and attainment requirements of the Act.
