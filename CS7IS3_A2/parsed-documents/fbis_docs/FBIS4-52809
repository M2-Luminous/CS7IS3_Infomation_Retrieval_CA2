The Americans will hand over maps, snapshots, identity cards, and other battlefield souvenirs that they hope will help to trace some of more than 300,000 Vietnamese who went missing in action. The items were collected from U.S. veterans and are to be presented by a 16-member delegation. The Vietnamese veterans of America believe that if initiative can make a significant contribution to the 20-year effort, they make accounting for 2,234 American POW-MIA [Prisoners of War-Missing in Action] and Vietnam's 300,000 missing.
