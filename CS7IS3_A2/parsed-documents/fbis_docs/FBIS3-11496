The chief of state said it is "merely a sort of warning regarding our relationship." "We are doing the same over (agricultural) subsidies: We are telling the United States that they cannot continue to subsidize the sale of wheat to Brazil because it causes huge damage to Argentina." Menem said this during an impromptu news conference granted at the press room at Government House, shortly before receiving U.S. Vice President Albert Gore.
