On Sunday, mass circulation daily SABAH published a claim by Culture Minister Fikri Saglar, also the secretary general of the ruling Social Democrat People's Party (SHP), saying that General Gures and some other leading members of the Turkish Armed Forces were making contacts to set up a government of technical experts led by Saracoglu as an alternative to the current government of Tansu Ciller. Saglar said Gures has to reply to such claims and give a straight answer as to whether he is making such contacts. Both SABAH and daily GUNAYDIN also reported on Sunday that Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has had secret meetings with State Ministers Necmettin Cevheri and Bekir Sami Dace to seek ways of extending Gures' term of office. Both the papers said Deputy Prime Minister Murat Karayalcin, the chairman of the SHP, did not object to such an extension. SABAH said only Demirel is against such a move, because legal experts say such an extension is legally impossible. GUNAYDIN, which has military links, said Ciller asked her ministers to work on the extension maneuvers in strict secrecy and that parliamentary approval should not be necessary. The paper said Ciller told the two ministers that she had agreed with Gures on a democratization package and added she did not want the general to become a target of criticism if such an extension is carried out. The general staff announcement said the public knows well that the military is not the authority to set up governments. The announcement said the newspaper reports are based on political assumptions "which have nothing to do with the duties of the military." It called the press reports absurd and said the public should not give any credence to such allegations.
