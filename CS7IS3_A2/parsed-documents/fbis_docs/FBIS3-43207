FBIS3-43207 "cr00000003994001" 27 January 1994 Article Type:FBIS Document Type:FOREIGN MEDIA NOTE--FB PN 94-007--MAGHREB MAGHREB PRESS REVIEW No. 1 This press review series focuses on economic, social, and demographic issues in the Maghreb countries of Algeria, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. ALGERIA UMA, Algerian Presidency Viewed According to London expatriate daily AL-HAYAH, Algeria may be distracted by its civil unrest and economic problems in leading the Arab Maghreb Union (UMA) after assuming the UMA presidency on 1 January 1994. However, Algeria may be able to promote a resolution of the Western Sahara issue, possibly by supporting the UN-mandated referendum, and may find itself in a better position to negotiate its border with Morocco. According to the article, "All observers agree that the UMA will not be an effective organization as long as Morocco and Algeria have no strategic accord since they form the backbone of the Union." The AL-HAYAH article also stated that Algeria's relations with Tunis have improved since the two countries finally drew fixed borders, but that its relations with Libya were still uneasy because of al-Qadhdhafi's alleged support for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). Regarding the UMA's international role, AL-HAYAH said that Algeria will not be able to repeat its 1990 hosting of the Mediterranean Basin summit because of the impasse between Libya and the United States, France, and Britain. A commentary in Casablanca daily AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISHTIRAKI compared the UMA to an invalid still confined to the recovery room, and questioned whether Algeria could revitalize the UMA in view of its own problems. In addition to its internal strife and the UN sanctions against Libya, Algiers would have to deal with the significant problem of the European Union's insistence on negotiating separate deals with individual Maghreb countries, rather than negotiating with the entire region. AL-ITTIHAD AL-ISHTIRAKI commented, ??Now five years old, the UMA needs a thorough evaluation to recognize its fractured state and to put things back together. If there really is an intention to continue the organization and to build it, it must not remain a structure far removed from the citizenry and from being concerned with their needs and idealism. Indeed, the Arab Maghreb, which fought collectively against colonialism in the Tangiers Conference 35 years ago, should not now be under the exclusive control of the ruling powers, nor should it be a prisoner of their transitory policies."

Both projects also include large-scale co-financing from international donors and domestic institutions and reportedly reflect the international community's high support for rural development and water-supply projects. A $353.6 million water supply project is to receive a $160 million loan, repayable over 20 years with a five-year grace period. Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) and the African Development Bank will provide $84 million and the rest will come from domestic sources. The project is intended to restructure regional utilities in Casablanca, Fes, Rabat, Kenitra, Meknes, and Marrakech, and strengthen other water-sector institutions, including the National Office for Drinking Water (ONEP). The World Bank has also committed $100 million to a $1.15 billion rural finance project to promote private investment in rural areas. One of the project's main aims is help the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole move away from its core farm and forestry investment to banking on a broader scale. This will receive substantial co- financing including an estimated $30 million from the French Caisse Francaise de Developpement; $34 million from Germany's Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau; and $60 million each from the European Investment Bank, the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, and the OECF. (London MEED 25 Dec 93) TUNISIA AL-HADATH Director Receives Threat Rabat daily AL-MAGHRIB has reported that the staff of Tunisian Arabic-language weekly AL-HADATH received a telephone call on 29 December directed at the manager-chief editor, demanding that he "stop writing about the (Muslim) brothers; otherwise he will suffer the same fate as Faraj Foudah." Additional threats were made on 30 and 31 December. AL-HADATH reportedly stated that management attached "little importance" to these threats, attributing them to "traffickers in religion" and to "plain assassins," and noting, "This strengthens our belief that we are on the right track--that of fighting for Tunisia." (Rabat AL-MAGHRIB 1 Jan 94) Health Services Statistics According to public health sector statistics, as of 1 September 1993 there were 1,579 general practitioners and 1,113 specialists providing medical services in Tunisia. The specialists numbered 243 surgeons, 86 gynecologists, 54 opthalmologists, 42 ear, nose, and throat specialists, and 44 radiologists; the remaining 523 were in other fields. In the private sector, there were reportedly 2,100 doctors, including 1,000 specialists. (Tunis LE TEMPS 19 Nov 93) Technical Cooperation Program The Tunisian Agency for Technical Cooperation reported that 694 individuals departed for Gulf and Western countries in 1993 as part of bilateral cooperation programs. Many of these technical programs were underwritten by international organizations such as the World Bank, the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development, and the United Nations Development Program. One-third of the 694 came from the education sector, another third from the health sector, and the remainder from engineering, electrical energy disciplines, telecommunications, petroleum, agriculture, mechanics and computer science. The number of Tunisians currently employed by these programs in other Middle Eastern countries is as follows: Saudi Arabia (4,034); Oman (1,909); Qatar (502); UAE (404); Bahrain (111); Kuwait (87); and Yemen (62). Some 283 are employed in Western countries, including Europe, the United States, and Canada, with 114 of these working in France. (Tunis LE TEMPS 8 Dec 93) Olive Oil Surplus Reported According to LE TEMPS, olive oil production has been facing pricing, distribution, and stocking problems due to the domestic market's inability to absorb surplus quantities. Although production totals have been estimated at 320 million tons, exports will only absorb 110 million tons, with the remaining 210 tons to be sold on the local market, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. The article noted that the domestic olive oil market is "sluggish" since consumption has moved to other types of seed oil because of the longstanding policy of reserving olive oil for export. In addition, olive oil must compete on the domestic market with "inferior" imported seed oils that are sold at competitive prices. The article further reported that "significant quantities of imported oil at subsidized prices" will also be marketed. The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed a revised price schedule to make the surplus olive oil more competitive; however, by lowering prices, production in the northern and southern regions could be discouraged altogether. According to LE TEMPS, Minister of Agriculture Mohamed Ben Rejeb believes that the current problems are temporary and will diminish "if everyone does his part." The state's Office of Olive Oil has reportedly "hidden" the problem by "financial juggling" that "has created a deficit of 137 billion (dirhams) and 400 billion in bank debts,.. The bailout bid is costing the government 103 billion and the banks 20 billion." The article further stated that companies will not weather reduced prices at a time when the industry is being privatized. According to LE TEMPS, although the supply of olive oil is increasing, the lack of financing and distribution systems will ensure a continuing surplus problem.
