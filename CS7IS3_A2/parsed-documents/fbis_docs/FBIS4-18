FBIS TRENDS-07APR94-YUGOSLAVIA-CROATIA Yugoslavia-Croatia: Milosevic Tells RSK to Shape Up Yugoslavia-Croatia: Milosevic Tells RSK to Shape Up In an apparent effort to strengthen the claim that the Republic of Serbian Krajina (RSK) in Croatia is a sovereign state, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has called on the Serbs of the RSK to put their house in order by ending what he labeled extremist politics and lawlessness. His meeting in Belgrade on 6 April with RSK "President" Milan Martic and "Premier-designate" Borisav Mikelic was aimed at demonstrating his support for the two leaders and putting an end to the infighting that has blocked the formation of a new government in the RSK since the December 1993 elections. Milosevic sharply attacked "extremists and extremism" and denounced "individuals" who are "up to their necks in crime" and threaten to "tarnish" the Serbian nation's reputation. He singled out the Serbian Radical Party and "other irresponsible groups and individuals," saying they have engaged in "destructive" politics in the RSK assembly. He was likely referring to the Radicals and to former RSK president Milan Babic and his wing of the Serbian Democratic Party, who have tried to block Martic's and Mikelic's efforts to form a new RSK "Government" (Tanjug and Belgrade TV, 6 April). Babic, who had been offered the deputy premiership in an effort to form a coalition government, recently announced that he had "postponed" talks about his participation in the coalition (Tanjug, 30 March). Even before Babic's announcement, Martic had complained that assembly infighting was leading the "state" into "total chaos and anarchy" (Belgrade TV, 23 March). Suggesting that Milosevic's intervention may have had its intended effect, Mikelic declared that he would put together a government by 9 April and that the Krajina Serbs are "on the road of calming down passions" (Tanjug, 7 April). Like recent statements of other FRY leaders, Milosevic's 6 April remarks gave no hint that he would backtrack on the Serbian claims that the RSK has the right to self-determination and that Croatia never established its sovereignty over the territory held by the Serbs. (See Note 1) He also continues to steadfastly defend the Serbs' right eventually to incorporate all territory they inhabit into a Greater Serbia. Moreover, his statements at a press conference during a 5 April visit to Romania suggest that he continues to view all Serbs in former Yugoslavia as embodying a single political entity for which he has the right to speak. Denying that the Serbs are the aggressors, he claimed that the United Nations has "punished and attacked those"--i.e., the Serbs--"who wanted to preserve and save their country." He called the "fact" that the Serbian "nation was accused of aggression against its own country" one of the "absurdities" in international politics "at the end of the 20th century" (Belgrade TV, 5 April). However, Milosevic, ever striving to rid his country of UN economic sanctions, reiterated his long-standing position that he supported "peace talks" as the "only correct way" of resolving the crisis (Tanjug and Belgrade TV, 6 April).
