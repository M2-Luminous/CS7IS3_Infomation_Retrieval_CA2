The text of this message is as follows: Your Excellency Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani, president of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Dear Mr. President: I am sure that Your Excellency is aware of the tragedy that has befallen the inhabitants of Gorazde. The Serbian Army, which for the past two years, before the eyes of the world, has committed barbaric crimes in Bosnia-Herzegovina, is at the moment laying siege to a city that has 70,000 inhabitants, most of whom are women and children. The people of that city are desperately awaiting the assistance of international organizations. Dear brother, at the most difficult and hard times, the Iranian people and Government have been with us and have helped us. Therefore, we will never feel alone. We are confident that you and the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran will make every effort to defend the inhabitants of Gorazde and to prevent their destruction [soqut-e hasti], in view of the spiritual values which we adhere to. Our faith and certainty in the brotherly assistance of Iran gives us the confidence to remain steadfast during these very critical moments. May the merciful and compassionate God protect you with his blessings. With the most sincere greetings, [Signed] Alia Izetbegovic [Dated] 17 [as heard] April 1994, Sarajevo
