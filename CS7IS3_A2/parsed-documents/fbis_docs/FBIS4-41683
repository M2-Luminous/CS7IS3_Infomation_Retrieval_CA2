According to Yakov Urinson, first deputy economy minister, this is even less than in Estonia, which is a "very small country." In an attempt to stimulate interest among investors -- both Western and Eastern -- in Russia, a Consultative Council for Foreign Investments is being created under the Russian Government and will hold its first session in Moscow next Monday under the chairmanship of Viktor Chernomyrdin. The leaders of 14 large corporations which either already are investing money in our economy or are intending to do so have been invited onto the council, whose main function, as far as may be judged from comments by government spokesmen, will be to outline or adjust the general course and strategy of Russia's investment policy. There is, of course, a certain risk that the council may be turned into a powerful grouping, which will promote the interests of the corporations represented on it. But in conversation with journalists Urinson ruled that risk out, stressing that the council's activity "will not be dedicated to specific investment projects but will be concentrated solely on questions of principle." It is expected that at the first session the Russian Government will unveil a set of measures designed to increase the influx of foreign money. The plan will include among other things draft amendments to the recent law on foreign investments, which, from the Moscow White House viewpoint, is not entirely adequate to our present-day economic realities. It is not impossible that the plan will finally answer the question which is being actively debated in the government itself and outside it, namely whether it is worth creating special conditions for foreign investors. In the view of the deputy minister of the economy (his "personal" view, as he stressed), "this hardly neerds to be done." I wonder whether his opinion will prove decisive. One final point: There is clearly some irony in the fact that the U.S. banking corporation, Citicorp, figures among the council's members. This corporation, which is undoubtedly a major potential investor, is affected by the restrictions contained in the president's edicts on the activities of foreign banks in Russia.
