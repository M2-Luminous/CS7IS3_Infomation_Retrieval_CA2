Addressing the China-U.S. Trade and Investment Seminar at the Asia Society here today, Wu said that the two countries have signed contracts worth of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars and 134 agreements valued at 4 billion dollars in the fair.

Wu noted that she hoped the fair will also have a greater breakthrough than that in Los Angeles. The trade fair, which was deemed as the largest of its kind held in the United States, began on April 11 in Los Angeles. Representatives from 26 Chinese provinces, and municipalities and eight ministries and commissions of the central government have brought with them over 800 projects to the United States. Briefing economic development, especially foreign trade and business growth in China, the minister noted that for the past 15 years, China's foreign trade grew faster than its GDP. The foreign trade volume last year stood at 195.8 billion U.S. dollars, making China the 11th largest trading nation in the world. She added that foreign direct investment in China has registered rapid development with the number of foreign invested enterprises reaching 170,000 and the actual foreign investment in China totaling 60 billion dollars. On China's import volume last year, she said it amounted to 104 billion dollars. "Based on this, China's total import volume for the next seven years will top 1,000 billion dollars," she predicted.
