JPRS-CST-93-006, 6 Apr 93 p 41]] [Text] Shenzhen -- A Shenzhen-Hong Kong programme for producing super-large-scale integrated chips -- the largest such programme in China -- announced last week the establishment of its Chinese-side investment company. The Shenzhen Saige High-Tech Investment Co., Ltd. will co-operate with a large European company in producing super-large-scale integrated chips in the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone and in conducting its after-processing work in Hong Kong. The total investment is expected to exceed 8.7 billion yuan or $1 billion, according to Wang Dianpu, chairman of the board of the Shenzhen Saige Group, the major shareholder in the investment company. At the opening ceremony last week, Wang noted that in 1991, the super-large-scale integrated programme was designated a State-class high-tech project. After two years of preparation, the chairman said, the company was officially established with a total registered capital of 280 million yuan ($32 million). The company has five shareholders. Besides the Saige group, they are the Shenzhen Urban Construction Group, Shenzhen New Industry Investment Co., Ltd., Shenzhen Zhongcheng Electronics Engineering Co., and Shenzhen Chang Ho Industry Co., Ltd., a joint venture by mainland and Hong Kong parties. The Saige group controls 62.6 per cent of all shares. Wang said the company will invite more large companies in Shenzhen to buy shares. In the near future, Wang said, the company will emphasize designing, producing, packaging, and testing technology for super-large-scale integrated circuitry and related industries. Meanwhile, by making ample use of the State's preferential policies for the high-tech industry, Wang said, the company will develop new high-tech industries and diversify its business. Over the long term, Wang said, the company hopes to develop into a powerful multinational corporation. The super-large-scale integrated programme will be built in phases. In the first phase, the company will build an after-processing plant and a design centre at the Futian Bonded Area in Shenzhen. It will cover more than 37,000 square metres. According to Wang, the company will use advanced production equipment and technology to design, package and test various kinds of integrated circuitry. The first-phase project, costing nearly $100 million, is expected to produce 318 million integrated chips each year. Most will be exported. The project is expected to go into operation next year. ``It will be the most advanced in technology and the largest in scale of the country's competing manufacturers,'' Wang said. He added that it would play an important role in promoting the country's electronics industry, narrowing the technological gap between China and developed countries, and pushing forward the industrial development in South China.
