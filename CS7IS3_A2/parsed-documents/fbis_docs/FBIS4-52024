Icebergs and reefs lurk in the rough seas of the post-Cold War era. Unfortunately, neither our ship nor the American one has a discerning captain on board. An Unmanageable Situation The setting is the White House. The time is the afternoon of 11 February, the day when Prime Minister Hosokawa and President Clinton held a joint press conference at the conclusion of the Japan-U.S. summit. There were cheerful expressions on the faces of some of Foreign Minister Hata's retinue of top-ranking Foreign Ministry officials, in contrast to the somber expressions on the faces of the U.S. Government bureaucrats lined up at the right side of the podium. Some of them were smiling, their faces flushed, possibly from the exhilaration of having said no to the United States for the first time in the postwar era. With the breakdown of the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, the scene shifted from diplomatic negotiations between the two nations to Japanese and American domestic and international politics. Public opinion based on complex emotions came into the picture, and the situation became even more unmanageable. In the next act of this drama, the curtain may open on severe retaliatory measures invoked by President Clinton, including sanctions against Japan. But eventually, the President is bound to lean toward building a framework for new Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. If he does not, given the profound economic interdependence between the two nations, a trade war may erupt. And if it becomes serious, it will be the American consumer who suffers. To avoid being blamed for the breakdown of the negotiations, and to create the impression that Japan is responsible for it, President Clinton has no choice but to resort to heavy-handed methods. The truth is, though, that the President is aware that the United States is also partly to blame for the failed negotiations. But first and foremost, he is determined to convince the American people that he is a forceful leader. However, by using such methods he is playing a power game, and is thereby courting real dangers, for the following reasons: The leaders of both nations agreed to couch the reasons for the breakdown in negotiations in a euphemism, i.e., "the maturing of a relationship." But there is no hope of building an adult relationship of equal importance to both nations any time soon. Prime Minister Hosokawa stated any number of times that the Japan-U.S. relationship has matured, but his statement was later contradicted by Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to the United States, who does not believe that it has. Meanwhile, President Clinton is under pressure to demonstrate strong leadership by instituting a health care system, reforming the welfare system, combating crime, and by skillful handling of foreign affairs. His methods are completely opposite those of former President Bush, who valued establishing good communications with foreign heads of state, and who strived to avoid "miscalculations" in international political moves. Furthermore, dealings between Japanese and American bureaucrats are overshadowed by suspicion, and are far from what one would expect of a "mature relationship." During the Cold War, a crisis management system was in place, which prevented the outbreak of trade wars. But that has collapsed, with the "about-face" of the State Department and the Pentagon. In Washington, the prevailing wisdom now is that Japan-bashing is a safe game to play. The belief is widespread that Japan will not implement its own harsh measures in retaliation. However, if the Americans decide to impose sanctions on Japan because of the breakdown in the recent negotiations, the reaction from the Japanese public and the Japanese media will be far stronger than ever before. There is a distinct danger that there will be more emotionally charged hostility between the people of the two nations. If the leaders of the two nations err in their handling of these problems, they may find themselves faced with an unmanageable situation. The Japan-Is-Different Theory--The Starting Point The "numerical indicators," the main reason for the breakdown in the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations, were inspired by the Japan-is-different theory. A leading exponent of this argument, the polemicist Clyde Prestowitz, chairman of the Economic Strategy Institute, former Commerce Department deputy trade representative, and a close friend of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, has been giving advice to Mr. Kantor privately on a daily basis. Mr. Prestowitz's pet argument is that Japan's social and economic systems differ from those of Europe and the United States. He argues that, since efforts to use outside influence to westernize Japan's systems would cause severe friction, thus endangering Japan-U.S. relations, the two nations must agree to managed trade. Some time ago, Mr. Prestowitz proposed a "mini Breton Woods conference," as an opportunity for Japan and the United States to discuss and settle these problems. He was convinced that such a conference would be successful, and assumed that Japan would respond with enthusiasm. He even told this writer that the Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] would likely agree to participate, since the ministry would acquire more power with managed trade. Economist Laura Tyson, former professor at the University of California at Berkeley, also belongs to the Japan-is-different camp. She has suggested that the United States deal with Japan in a different way than it does with Europe. In her book Who's Bashing Whom? (Japanese translation Dare ga dare wo tataiteirunoka?), Ms. Tyson describes two types of managed trade: 1) a voluntary import expansion agreement (VIE) similar to the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement, and 2) voluntary export restrictions (VER) similar to Japan's voluntary restrictions on automobile exports to the United States. She indicates that the United States should adopt the first type, which would act to stimulate trade and competition, rather than the second type, which would tend to place constraints on trade and competition. A supplementary document to the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement expressed the hope that, in 1992, the share of foreign-made semiconductors in the Japanese market would rise to 20 percent. Ms. Tyson has simply justified numerical targets in economics terms. President Clinton appointed this offbeat economist chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. The person who holds this position normally acts as a "caretaker of macroeconomics." Since her appointment, Ms. Tyson has spoken out aggressively about Japan-U.S. trade problems, and has actually attended Japan-U.S. trade talks. One must also remember that President Clinton has always leaned toward managed trade. He has expressed his support for managed trade at several Democratic conventions. Moreover, in the economic policy statement he issued when he announced his candidacy for the presidential election in 1992, he proposed not only that the lapsed Super 301 clause, part of a 1988 trade law, be revived, but also that it be made more forceful. That same statement makes special reference to President Clinton's election promise to create jobs, and emphasizes the need to increase exports. It states that 20,000-30,000 jobs are created with every $1 billion increase in exports. From its earliest days, the Clinton administration has demonstrated its intention to seek the inclusion of numerical targets (which derive from the Japan-is-different argument) in its negotiations with Japan. Administrators and information specialists in the U.S. Government started drafting plans for the new negotiations when the Clinton administration took office. During that process, former U.S. Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga and other Japanese of similar stature were consulted. A U.S. Government source reports that their reaction to the draft, which included numerical indicators, was "positive." Could someone on the Japanese side have spoken irresponsibly? When U.S. Government officials began their preparations for the new framework talks with Japan, they took special pains to elucidate the differences between Bush and Clinton trade policy. Since Clinton's harsh criticism of the Bush administration's trade policy had helped him get elected, Clinton's staff didn't dare adopt an approach that bore even the remotest resemblance to Bush administration policy. It was numerical indicators that made the "difference." Clinton's people wanted results. The Bush administration had urged Japan to make domestic structural reforms. There was no expectation that Japan's trade surplus would decrease in the short term. At the press conference held after the talks broke down, Prime Minister Hosokawa said that numerical indicators would work against his deregulation plan. If Japan makes headway with structural reforms, the logic that the Americans are using to justify numerical indicators, which is based on the Japan-is-different theory, will collapse. A Series of Blunders During a briefing for White House correspondents, a U.S. administration official boasted, "Late last night, I heard officials from Japan's Foreign Ministry and from MITI yelling at each other. If Japan's government agencies are that much at odds, then we've won." This incident took place in July 1993, during the Tokyo summit. On that occasion, Prime Minister Miyazawa and President Clinton had agreed on the framework for trade negotiations. The error of the above-mentioned assumption became clear when talks held six months later broke down. The negotiations were doomed from the very start. The main point of contention then was the numerical indicators, which were the reason why the recent negotiations failed. The Japanese side objected to the establishment of numerical targets. But then, it was Hisashi Owada, administrative vice minister for foreign affairs, who ultimately steamrolled MITI opposition. The joint declaration on the framework for the new talks established quantitative and qualitative "objective criteria," and stated that progress on trade problems would be evaluated by these criteria. This was an extremely unpromising start for the negotiations. The Americans had proposed setting specific numerical targets, but these were fiercely opposed by the Japanese, who refused to accept them. An agreement was reached which entailed establishing yardsticks, or "objective criteria," and using those criteria to measure the extent to which trade problems were being resolved. But negotiators from the two nations were ultimately unable to agree on the content of those objective criteria, and the negotiations were marred by "religious disputes." It is difficult to tell whether the Americans were pressing for specific numerical targets, or simply yardsticks (objective criteria). Even some of the U.S. Government representatives acknowledged their failure to make the concepts clear. But the Americans did not attempt to hide their suspicion that Japan would not make efforts to open its markets unless the United States specified targets. Japanese Government officials, on the other hand, were worried that if they agreed to numerical targets and were unable to meet them, the United States would impose sanctions on Japan. After the negotiations got off to a start, a series of blunders was committed by both sides. The errors made by the United States were fatal. As previously indicated, the first error was committed by Clinton administration officials, who were counting on MITI's ultimate acceptance of numerical indicators. But "fundamentalists" at the Foreign Ministry clung steadfastly to the principles of free trade. At times they were more vehemently opposed to the numerical indicators than were the MITI bureaucrats. Furthermore, Japan's public relations campaign, which equated the American demands for numerical indicators with managed trade and protectionism, paid off. Support for Japan's position grew among ASEAN members and in Europe. The odds of Japan accepting the numerical indicators grew slimmer and slimmer. Second, the political situation in Japan had undergone a major upheaval. When the Hosokawa government took office in the summer of 1993, the negotiations actually came to a halt. The Clinton administration had decided to wait and see how Prime Minister Hosokawa's reform plans progressed. Formal negotiations resumed in October. In the meantime, U.S. Trade Representative Kantor, who had been harshly critical of Japan, himself became the target of criticism from some administration officials, and was replaced as chief negotiator for the Japan-U.S. trade talks by Bowman Cutter, deputy assistant to the president for economic policy. At the Japan-U.S. summit held in New York in September, President Clinton flattered Hosokawa, saying that he held the prime minister in high esteem, and mentioning the rapport he felt with him since both men were former governors, and both had been elected because of their commitment to reform. Obviously, Prime Minister Hosokawa read too much into Clinton's words. The fact that Hosokawa dispatched his diplomacy "ace," Akitane Kiuchi, former ambassador to France, to confer with President Clinton and Vice President Gore shortly before the negotiations were to begin, and to explore the possibility of postponing an agreement, belies his overconfidence. The Hosokawa government was totally ignorant of President Clinton's strategy, that is, his desire to demonstrate his leadership abilities by accomplishing his political agenda. Third, the Americans had overestimated the reform-minded Hosokawa. Late last year, a U.S. Government official who is well versed in Japan-U.S. relations, asked me if Administrative Vice Minister for Finance Saito was going to be fired. Some American administrative officials interpreted the resignation of MITI's Industrial Policy Bureau chief Naito as a sign that the Hosokawa government was wresting power from the bureaucrats. They extrapolated further that Vice Minister Saito and Kazuo Ogura, the Foreign Ministry's Economic Bureau chief, might also be forced to resign. Most of this was wishful thinking, for the two men are viewed as tough negotiators, but the rumor spread. A statement made by Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, in which he acknowledged the closed nature of Japan's markets, and another made by Foreign Minister Hata, that might possibly be construed as meaning that he would accept the numerical indicators, buoyed the Americans' hopes. But the truth is that Hosokawa, who has far fewer specialists in government affairs at his disposal than did his predecessor, Kiichi Miyazawa, became increasingly dependent upon the bureaucrats. Furthermore, Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] had cooperated with former Ambassador Armacost in the latter's attempts to solve Japan's "international contribution problem," and had become a valued ally of the United States. But this time Ozawa sided with the Finance Ministry in its tax cut plan, and demonstrated his support for a consumption tax increase. This shift was a painful blow to the Americans, who were opposed to these measures. Toward the end of last year, when it became clear that the negotiations were going to be an uphill battle, the U.S. Government stepped up its attacks on Japan's bureaucrats, and plotted to remove Hosokawa from their clutches. This proved to be a less than brilliant plan, strategically speaking. Increasing Suspicion Japan-U.S. trade negotiations have begun to take on the atmosphere that prevailed during the arms-reduction negotiations between the United States and the USSR. The setting of numerical indicators and the announcement of the intention to keep a close watch to ensure they are met are reminiscent of the Reagan administration's demanding that the Soviet Union drastically reduce its nuclear facilities and allow detailed inspections. Other similarities crop up in the Americans' criticism of the conservatism of Soviet bureaucrats and their hope that Gorbachev and other Soviet politicians would go along with the American policy. Moreover, the Americans are increasingly suspicious that promises spelled out in trade agreements will not be honored. For instance, between 1991 and 1993, after agreements were concluded between the two nations on paper and glass products, not only did the foreign market share not increase, but it fell from 4.3 percent to 4 percent for paper, and from 11 percent to 5.9 percent for glass. Though 33 trade agreements have been signed between the two nations since 1980, Japan's trade surplus has continued to mount, as has the Americans exasperation. The Japanese, faced with the threat of sanctions if they agreed to numerical targets and were unable to meet them, were not prepared to take that risk. An attachment to the Japan-U.S. semiconductor agreement signed by (then) Ambassador to the U.S. Matsunaga merely expresses the hope that the market share for foreign-made semiconductors will rise to 20 percent. Yet Japan was later accused of having reneged on the agreement, and there was talk of imposing sanctions. The fact is that there were some hardliners in the U.S. Government who insisted on including numerical targets in the Japan-U.S. trade agreement, no matter what, and on imposing sanctions if those targets are not met. Furthermore, a bill proposed by Senator Baucus and Representative Matsui, concerning the observance of trade agreements, is now being deliberated in the U.S. Congress. If this bill is passed, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office will have the power to determine whether trade agreements have been adhered to and, if they have not, to impose sanctions by invoking Super 301. The foundation is being laid for a system that would make it difficult for Japan to sign agreements that contain specific targets. According to research on the results of past U.S.-Japan trade agreements, U.S. exports to Japan have increased. Another report, issued by the Congressional Research Service, states that exports to Japan increased by approximately $4.9 billion per year as a result of trade agreements concluded between 1985 and 1990. It states further that if all of Japan's import barriers were removed, an increase in excess of $10 billion per year could be expected. Moreover, research done by the private research organization, the International Economic Research Institute, suggests that if Japan's markets were completely liberalized, U.S. exports to Japan would increase by as much as $8.9-18.2 billion. Reports like these prompt the Japanese to counter that the closed nature of Japan's markets is not the one and only reason for the trade imbalance. However, the U.S. trade deficit with Japan for 1993 reached the monumental figure of $59.3 billion, reflecting a macroeconomic imbalance. Since allowing this one-sided imbalance to continue unchecked is not a wise strategy, Japan will have to come up with some sort of policy, one that produces results. Once the Clinton administration had recorded some successes on the economic front, for example, recovery from the recession and a decline in the unemployment rate, it began to feel vulnerable to attacks for its failure to decrease the trade deficit. It sensed pressure to produce evidence of its efforts to do so, for Congress and for the American people, by introducing numerical targets into negotiations with Japan. During the Cold War, when negotiations stalled, there was always a "referee" who would step in. The referees were the National Security Council, the State Department, and the Pentagon. On many occasions these referees cited the strategic importance of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, and supported Japan by holding the economic branches of the government at bay. But during the recent negotiations, not one high-ranking government official expressed support for Japan. Even Secretary of State Christopher, after he had conferred with Foreign Minister Hata, expressed his dissatisfaction that no progress was being made in the trade negotiations, and dismissed Japan's economic recovery measures, alluding to their "disappointing content." The Unfinished "Japan Paper" Last spring, the Clinton administration decided to do a basic review of Japan-U.S. relations. It instructed the relevant government branches to hold discussions, and to publish the results in a "Japan paper." But at those conferences, the Pentagon did not come out as Japan's protector, as it had in the past. In fact, the tenor of discussions about Japan's defense within the Pentagon has changed. For instance, at one time the introduction of landing craft, scheduled for the next defense budget, might have been welcomed, as they could be expected to contribute to peacekeeping operations. However, during last year's discussions, doubts were expressed about expanding Japan's offensive capabilities. Some U.S. Government officials have voiced, albeit unofficially, their reservations about Japan's use of plutonium. Still others have expressed their concern that, with the decline in the importance of security in the relationship between the two nations, and with the possibility that North Korea possesses nuclear weapons, Japan may also become a nuclear power. However, the "Japan paper" remains unfinished. The United States is still undecided about Japan's strategic role. Thus, the Clinton administration may cause serious disruption of Japan-U.S. relations if it imposes economic sanctions on Japan. Before the Japan-U.S. summit, President Clinton is reported to have assiduously studied suggestions sent to him by his close friend Derek Shearer, former deputy under secretary of commerce, and by Glen Fukushima, director of market development for AT&T. These suggestions assailed the unfortunate U.S. approach to the Japan-U.S. trade negotiations. They also proposed establishment of a Japan office within the White House, which would concentrate on U.S.-Japan problems. President Clinton underlined passages he considered especially relevant and made copies of them, distributing them to the staffs of U.S. Trade Representative Kantor and Secretary of Treasury Bentsen. The President, who for many years has valued Mr. Fukushima's expertise, realized after reading his suggestions, that the negotiations had failed, even before the summit. President Clinton will probably order a review of the Japan-U.S. framework talks. But before that, he is likely to invoke sanctions in order to maintain his image of leadership. Such sanctions may very well be carefully calculated and extremely limited. But if the President fails to make efforts toward mutual understanding between the two leaders, and if he provokes a hostile reaction from the Japanese people, it may be difficult for Japan to agree to negotiations for a new trade framework. In that case, the hostility will increase, and Japan-U.S. relations will be thrown into turmoil.
