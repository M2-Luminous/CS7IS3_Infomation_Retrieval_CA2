He pointed out: It is necessary to give full play to the role of people's congresses so that their work will become more active. After listening to the speeches of Deputies Yan Haiwang, Lu Kejian, Xu Feiqing, (Ni Anmin), (Chen Xiuguo), and (Jin Guosheng), Wang Bingqian said: The people's congress is an organization of the people's power. Our power is granted by the people, and we shoulder an important historical mission. Party committees must lead and support the work of people's congresses. Within the jurisdiction conferred upon them by law, people's congresses must exercise their power boldly, and must carry out legislation and supervision work in an effective manner. The prestige of people's congresses must be established through their own work. Wang Bingqian stressed: People's congresses must give full play to the role of people's deputies, conduct investigations and studies well, promptly reflect the opinions and aspirations of the masses, and solve popular and difficult problems to which the masses are paying close attention. In the meantime, it is necessary to strengthen education on the legal system, as well as the propaganda work of people's congresses themselves, so that people understand and support this work.
