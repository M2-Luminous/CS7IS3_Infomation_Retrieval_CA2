Alekseyev: "Private Property--A Factor No Less Powerful Than State Dictatorship"] [Text] Thus far privatization in Russia has failed What could explain the fact that "radical" economic reforms launched in January 1992, despite a number of positive results, still did not produce the anticipated changes and, on the contrary, certain tendencies appeared that could bring Russia more trouble? The decisive factors, consideration of which may yield an answer to the question that was raised, are the unusual and historically unprecedented complexities of the economic and social situation in Russia, a country that is yet to make a final break with totalitarianism, one which is entirely nationalized and ravaged, where the foundations and culture of "normal" private ownership were wiped out and private property lost its significance as a natural base of economic development and where monopolistic state ownership, authority for the sake of authority, imperial state dictatorship, and a system of compulsory and semicompulsory stimulation of labor by the state was established. "Free" prices and other monetary measures on the whole eliminated state dictatorship from the sphere of prices and trade turnover. On their own they are incapable of transforming the totally nationalized, bureaucratic, prosocialist economy into a free market economy, eliminating state pressure from it (which in many ways has changed its form: from a distributor of resources and goods the state became the distributor of subsidies and credits, which, by the way, requires huge taxes). Radical reorganization of the entire Russian economy may be attained not only through monetary measures and market freedom, but primarily through the revival of private property as a natural basis of economic relations, production, and the entire economy, under conditions of competition, i.e., a factor, which is no less powerful than state dictatorship but one that has an inexhaustible reserve of creative energy, promotes natural motivation of labor and responsibility, while stimulating investments in production. At the same time such a revival of private property capable of taking the place of the main regulator of production in a competitive environment did not occur in Russia. Official privatization, which it would seem should perform that task, was mainly limited to the sphere of trade and structures specializing in the marketing of natural raw material and currency operations abroad. With regard to the rest, however, attention in such "privatization" was focused on a prosocialist partition of a portion of state property among all fellow-citizens with the aid of vouchers (which, alas, intensified parasitical tendencies of "factory socialism") and sale of state property in the interests of the state budget as well as "general auctioning" promoted by the success of the partition of property using vouchers, which to a great degree acquired a formal character and often merely consolidated the status of "red directors," promoting the growth and legalization of our comprador bourgeoisie. It was specifically because of the fact that privatization in Russia did not succeed and the dictatorial state command system was not replaced with another, natural, system of regulation and stimulation in the form of private ownership, that there was a failure in the economy, and formation of a void. It was specifically this failure which sent the parasitic "market" element spinning and churning, directed at quick and speculative profits achieved through the channeling of natural raw material abroad, resale, foreign currency operations, and machinations with vouchers, stocks, and credits. Such a situation, a situation involving failure of the system of economic regulation and labor stimulation, precipitated processes leading to the destruction of the economy, a decline in production and labor productivity along with other alarming phenomena indicating the possibility that Russian society could degenerate into an unfavorable, tragic variant of capitalist development. The alarming facts of our current reality are clearly evident, anyone can see them. Adherents of orthodox communism and a nationalized economy, as well as "proponents of the state" are utilizing these facts in full to substantiate the ideology of "turning back" to a "regulated" market, to a "mixed economy," or, in any case, to the "correction" and "slowing down" of reforms, and an intensification of state regulation in economic life. Unfortunately, under conditions of a disastrous situation, such moods have gained a certain popularity and even the support of some official circles. Even though, there is no doubt that such a policy would merely strengthen state-nomenclature type structures in the economy, increasing the state-capitalist tilt of one of the most unfavorable, dead-end variants of capitalist development. One should assume that the way out of the situation which has been created must be a radically different one. Not "curtailing" or "slowing-down" of reforms but, on the contrary, attribution of a cardinal character to them and extension of reforms, their decisive conduct and involvement of the entire energetic, active population of Russia in that truly reformative process. The key to such large-scale reformative activity is the revival of private property in a competitive atmosphere. Its revival in all of its forms -- individual, family, and private -- collective forms. The very concept of privatization being conducted in Russia must be changed radically on the basis of these positions. It is necessary to be firmly aware that under Russian conditions the revival of private property is impossible if privatization is concentrated on the free distribution of property, on the partition of even a segment of state property with the help of vouchers. By contrast with other countries, where truly private property already existed and privatization with the aid of vouchers merely consolidates and expands its subjective composition, under Russian conditions such a privatization policy only breeds consumer-parasitic moods, an aspiration of becoming a nonworking investor, along with elements of "factory socialism." The direction which is presently coming into being in privatization -- the auctioning of items of state property on a competitive basis, can also hardly be recognized as satisfactory. The optimal path for development of privatization, which revives productive private property and competition -- is the transfer of it to "real owners" and the acquisition of property by them for work. For work, that is for organization and modernization of rational modern production and a growing output of goods (services) in demand on the market. Perhaps the only obligation of the owner, naturally, along with the payment of taxes in such a transfer and such an acquisition, must be the obligation to modernize production and make mandatory investments of his own revenue in production. It is necessary to note that with all of the alarming phenomena of the current period, favorable conditions still exist in Russia, probably uniquely favorable ones, for the economy to start working and take a path of dynamic development. They include the existence of significant material means, resources, and advanced technical and scientific potential in many areas. Naturally, all of these are merely conditions, premises, which, in addition to everything else are being consistently lost, in the current crisis situation, as our economy is being destroyed, (they will not even be required very much in our Homeland if Russia slips into the unfavorable variant of capitalist development, the raw material periphery of the world capitalist system). But the opportunity has not yet been lost and amazing results are still possible if our principal hope is realized -- the power of the Russian spirit and selfless labor. We are all witnesses to how the elimination of the coercive, enslaving burden of the state, and the acquisition of freedom and private property are rapidly releasing labor energy, tumultuous and frenzied -- like everything Russian. When production cooperatives and leased enterprises got the freedom to acquire private property in 1989-1991, the national economic sector formed by them, in the situation created by the disintegration of the entire Soviet economy which had already started, proved to be the only one (the only one!) that manifested economic growth, including a rise in investments in production. It is sufficient to recall the amazing success attained by the Pechora production cooperative, headed by Vladimir Tumanov, as well as the fruitful work done by other vigorous supporters of a realistic cause (Svyatoslav Fedorov, Nikolay Travkin, and others) in order for it to become clear that even at that time our national economy was on its way to resolving the crisis and heading toward a general economic upsurge. Who knows, that may have occurred if the reformist forces would have been firmer and more systematic and if Russia was not overwhelmed by political passions and the merciless struggle for power. This is why it is necessary to have a clear understanding at present as well that revival of private productive property has been called upon to become the decisive ennobling factor, unleashing creative economic energy. A daring and decisive step is required by the government and the president. By those who can and must assume responsibility for the fate of Russia, for making it possible to withdraw from the brink of disaster and begin healthy economic development.
