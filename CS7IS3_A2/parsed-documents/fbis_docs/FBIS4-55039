In his resignation, which was addressed to Finance Minister Florin Georgescu, General Suceava requested "the termination of my employment beginning 15 April, on the basis of Article 29." The recent conflict that broke out between the Ministry of Interior and the General Customs Directorate is gaining momentum. On 25 April Mihai Panzariu, general director of the General Customs Directorate, advised General Suceava that he should hand in his resignation before 1 May, our sources said. "Mihai Panzariu has begun to purge his backyard of spies. As you may know, the relations between the two were not exactly amiable. It seems that now they managed to reveal some irregularities by General Suceava, so that they could offer him this solution as a more elegant way to leave his office," the same sources asserted.
