SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1994 (Pub. L. 103&hyph;211), enacted February 12, 1994, authorized the Secretary to reallocate, for use in award year 1994&hyph;1995 only, any excess funds under the Federal Perkins Loan and the FWS programs from the 1993&hyph;94 award year to assist individuals who suffered financial harm as a result of the January 1994 earthquake in Southern California and other disasters. The Act intended that these funds would be reallocated to institutions for use in award year 1994&hyph;95 to assist students who have been adversely affected by the California earthquake of January 1994 and the Midwest floods of 1993. The Secretary corrects the April 13 notice to include assistance to the victims of the Midwest floods.

Institutions will be informed of the application procedures for obtaining these reallocated funds in a letter issued by the Department to financial aid administrators. All other information in the April 13, 1994 notice remains unchanged. Dated: June 23, 1994. David A. Longanecker, Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education.
