[passage omitted]. The UNITA delegation in Lisbon has denied the attack on Malanje. Carlos Fontoura [UNITA representative in Lisbon] says it has all been fabricated. [Begin recording] [Fontoura] I have to deny categorically any UNITA action to that effect. [passage omitted]. It is obvious that the MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola] is beginning to show a blatant and evident lack of imagination. A few days ago -- when the visit by the Americans, the U.S. congressmen, was being planned -- the day before they invented and publicized a UNITA attack against Malongo, which as you know not even the American company confirmed. Now, the day the Congressmen were due to arrive the MPLA invents all this guerrilla activity, which is no way part of UNITA's objectives.
