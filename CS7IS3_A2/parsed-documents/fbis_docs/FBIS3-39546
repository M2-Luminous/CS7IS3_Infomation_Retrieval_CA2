This is how Cetin summed up the latest situation on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue: "The present stage has finally been reached at a bitter price and 200,000 deaths. The present stage is close, even if not completely the same, to what Turkey has been vociferously proposing for the last two years. All the formalistic initiatives by the West over the last two years have produced no results and it eventually adopted our thesis. To say it openly, the latest NATO decision falls short of our expectations, but still it is of some importance." I asked our foreign minister, whose wholehearted efforts on the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue we have always applauded, if the latest NATO decision is a farce. Cetin replied: "No, it is not, it cannot be. If such a thing happens, let me state openly that NATO will lose all its credibility and reliability. NATO, which enjoys respect, will find itself in a difficult situation in such a case." After taking a deep breath, Cetin added: "Now look, the issue here is definitely one of Christian fundamentalism. This is basically why people have turned a blind eye to this problem for so long. Had the West assumed its present position from the very start vis-a-vis the Serbian leaders, who want to set up a Great Serbian state, all these massacres would not have happened." We asked the foreign minister how the opposition by Britain, Canada, and Greece against intervention was overcome. He replied: "Turkey exerted enormous efforts in this direction. The extraordinary session was convened at our invitation. In addition, it must be noted that the NATO secretary general also made intensive efforts. During the latest meeting, Britain did not put up too much resistance and we managed to overcome the objections from Canada and Greece. They had no pretext left in the name of humanity to put up resistance." Here we immediately asked what Turkey's position would be on a possible intervention. Could Turkey be the leading force in such an intervention? Cetin said: "Could be. Our 16 F-16 planes are waiting in Italy. If need be we could increase this force. If NATO asks, we are ready to undergo any sacrifice to fulfill our historic responsibilities. We are hereby informing the public through you: All our preparations in this regard have been completed. We informed the UN of this in writing." The foreign minister also provided information on the developments that might lead to intervention. He said: "Now there are ten very critical days before us. If, during this ten days, the Serbs do not announce to the world that they have stopped the massacres and pulled back their arms and militia as demanded, then inevitably an intervention, that is, air operations, will take place." It is our greatest wish to see the implementation of these declarations, which please us, albeit a bit too late. This century's drama, which once again brought to our attention the other unseen side of the West, that is, its ugly face, is a great lesson for us. We must give the Turkish Foreign Ministry and its leader Hikmet Cetin the due they deserve. We can say without exaggeration that, even if late, this point has been reached thanks to the persistent efforts by the esteemed Mr. Cetin and our Foreign Ministry. Valuable points have been added to the personal record of Cetin. Even the opposition says that "he is one minister with whom we have established the best of dialogue." To state it openly, the solidarity between [Prime Minister] Ciller, [Deputy Prime Minister] Karayalcin, and the opposition on this issue deserves every praise. Neither should one forget President Suleyman Demirel. We can state without exaggeration that Turkey has done everything it could given the current international situation. Aliyev's Visit and Armenia Taking advantage of the opportunity, we also asked Foreign Minister Cetin about the latest situation on Armenian aggression. He said: "We have declared over and over again: The Armenians must immediately withdraw from the territories they have occupied. Either they will have to withdraw on their own, or they will be made to withdraw; yes, they will be made to withdraw." Is this sentence "they will be made to withdraw" not interesting, coming from Cetin, who is known to the public as a person who keeps his opinions to himself and speaks in diplomatic language? We immediately asked who would force the Armenians out. Would it be Turkey? Cetin hesitated to reply. It was obvious that he was having trouble spelling out certain views. He said: "Let me say this much: Azerbaijan and Turkey are one nation. They have the same ethnic roots. Therefore, Turkey will do all it can." What, for example? Will it send troops? Will it provide arms? At this point I asked him if logistical support was promised to the Azerbaijani President Geydar Aliyev, who is still in Turkey. Cetin merely replied: "No comment." It is clear what this means. Certainly, specific meanings could be drawn when a foreign minister, who knows the international law well, is not saying "no there is no such support," and instead says "no comment." Yes, with the changes in the international situation, a tremendous dynamism is seen in the Foreign Ministry, which we have been often criticizing only recently. And, Cetin's star is shining to the maximum. And, no one should be uneasy at this. After all, our foreign policy is above parties, that is, it is national in character. We advise Cetin to "keep" to his present course.
