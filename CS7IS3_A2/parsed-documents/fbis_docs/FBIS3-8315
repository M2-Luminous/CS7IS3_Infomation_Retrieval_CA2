The meeting was also attended by Mate Granic, deputy prime minister and foreign minister. They discussed the details of the Washington agreement and the course of the Vienna negotiations conducted by the transition committee for the preparation of a final agreement between Croats and Bosnian Muslims on entering a federation as two equal and constituent nations and on setting up a confederal union with the Republic of Croatia. It was said during the talks that the Vienna negotiations are expected to end by 15 March, when the final agreement should be signed. President Tudjman stressed that the agreement is not directed against the third side, but that the Bosnian Serbs are invited to join the negotiations. Lending his support to the Washington agreement, Abdic stressed that he has always advocated close cooperation between the Croat and Muslim nations, and that he opposed the elements in the Muslim leadership which fomented Croat-Muslim clashes. Abdic particularly stressed the importance of President Tudjman's efforts to involve the Serb side in the negotiations in order to restore peace.
