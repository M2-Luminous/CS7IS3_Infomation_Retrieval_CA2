FR940419-0-00065 FR940419-0-00019 25. Small and Minority Business Concerns Two commenters raised concern that the rule conflicts with the EPA Administrator's initiative to provide more work to small and minority owned businesses and with Congressional intent to promote contracting with small business. The commenters asserted that small firms cannot absorb the high costs of maintaining complex conflict of interest systems. Other commenters expressed concern that the LOFC clause will hurt small businesses that need local markets because small businesses do not have the operational breadth that larger firms possess to avoid regions where conflicts may exist. It is essential that we avoid, mitigate, or neutralize conflicts of interest in all EPA contracting. However, we recognize the importance of small and minority owned businesses and strongly support their active participation in our procurement programs. We are currently implementing a Long Term Contracting Strategy for the Superfund program that will enhance the competitive environment and provide greater opportunities for small business participation by creating smaller, regionally based contracts and subcontracting opportunities under these contracts. Small businesses currently participate in the Superfund and other EPA programs primarily as subcontractors. As detailed in our discussion of flow down exemptions, a number of categories of subcontracts are specifically exempt from the requirements of the entire rule and ``non-discretionary technical and engineering services'' subcontract work is exempt from all LOFC clause provisions. This substantially minimizes cost and associated burdens for many small businesses participating in our programs at both the local and national level. Moreover, at any time, a small business operating as either a prime contractor or a subcontractor may request waiver of clause requirements for nondiscretionary work which poses a minimal risk of conflict of interest. EPA does not require any special type of system to identify and report conflicts. Each contractor determines its own procedures for searching and identifying conflicts of interest, and in some cases, it may already have a process in place to identify conflicts in its commercial business. We anticipate that the scope of a company's procedures would be commensurate with the company's size and complexity, and for small businesses any system would be less complex and detailed. 26. Applicability of Rule to Related Organizations Several comments were received concerning the applicability of the rule to affiliates and other related organizations. A few commenters encouraged EPA to publish a uniform policy regarding the disclosure burden of contractors for work performed by parent and affiliate corporations as well as partnerships and other businesses. Most commenters opposed the burden of extending disclosure to conflicts of interest associated with related organizations, and stressed that it may be difficult to obtain information from affiliates regardless of common ownership. The issues regarding applicability of the rule to related organizations are complex. The rule does not specifically address related organizations, and it is not our intent to extend search and certification requirements to related organizations and create unnecessary reporting burdens. However, we do require our contractors to make a good faith effort to report conflicts as they are identified. If an EPA contractor is aware of a potential conflict or has reason to believe a related organization may create a conflict of interest for the contractor, checking with that organization to verify whether a conflict exists would certainly be warranted. If a contractor reports a conflict of interest involving a related organization and includes information which is designated as sensitive or proprietary, the EPA will protect such information from unauthorized disclosure. An opportunity to so mark such information shall be afforded to the submitter of the information. 27. Application of the Rule to Other Units of a contractor's Organization Which Do Not Perform Environmental Work One commenter wanted to know the extent to which the rule applies to other units of a contractor's organization which do not perform environmental work. The commenter further stated that it is unfair to restrict service areas of a firm that are unrelated to environmental consulting work or to the contractor unit working on an EPA contract. This rule applies to the corporation or other legal entity that has entered into a contract with EPA, and makes no distinction between separate divisions or units of the EPA contractor's organization. The fact that a part of the organization does not perform environmental work does not necessarily mean it would not have a conflict of interest. EPA only restricts its contractors from work which poses a significant conflict of interest to the Agency. We require our contractors to identify all potential conflicts of interest and notify the EPA prior to entering into a contract for types of work identified in the LOFC clause as posing a significant risk of conflict. This provides the EPA an opportunity to evaluate such work and prevent conflicts that may jeopardize work performed for EPA or ongoing enforcement actions. 28. Establishment of New Organizational Units To Avoid Conflicts of Interest A comment was received that expressed concern about a contractor establishing new ``units'' with the purpose of allowing the contractor to perform in different program areas where it might otherwise be precluded due to a conflict of interest. The comment included a suggestion that there should be a deterrent to allowing this type of loophole. EPA requires that contractors report to the EPA Contracting Officer all potential conflicts of interest with work performed for EPA. While there may be instances where an organizational conflict of interest may be mitigated effectively, all such potential conflict situations must be reported to the EPA so that the Contracting Officer can make an informed determination based on a careful evaluation of the facts and program and enforcement concerns.
