Examples of Procurement Procedures That Provide for Preference for Section 3 Business Concerns This Section III provides specific procedures that may be followed by recipients and contractors (collectively, referred to as the ``contracting party'') for implementing the section 3 contracting preference for each of the competitive procurement methods authorized in 24 CFR 85.36(d). (1) Small Purchase Procedures. For section 3 covered contracts aggregating no more than $25,000, the methods set forth in this paragraph (1) or the more formal procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this Section III may be utilized. (i) Solicitation. (A) Quotations may be solicited by telephone, letter or other informal procedure provided that the manner of solicitation provides for participation by a reasonable number of competitive sources. At the time of solicitation, the parties must be informed of: _the section 3 covered contract to be awarded with sufficient specificity; _the time within which quotations must be submitted; and _the information that must be submitted with each quotation. (B) If the method described in paragraph (i)(A) is utilized, there must be an attempt to obtain quotations from a minimum of three qualified sources in order to promote competition. Fewer than three quotations are acceptable when the contracting party has attempted, but has been unable, to obtain a sufficient number of competitive quotations. In unusual circumstances, the contracting party may accept the sole quotation received in response to a solicitation provided the price is reasonable. In all cases, the contracting party shall document the circumstances when it has been unable to obtain at least three quotations.
