Participants are to examine a number of draft laws related, inter alia, to preferential taxation of the media. The press' economic situation is a political issue, said Boris Mironov, chairman of the committee, opening the conference. He explained the great importance of the presence of a large number of regional representatives at this "briefing" by the fact that it is precisely the Russian province that becomes the center of economic reforms today. Mironov spoke about obstacles in the way toward adopting a decision on state protectionism of the press. Thus, leaders of the Economics Ministry and the Finance Ministry claim that this document will create "a dangerous precedent." Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma Committee for Information Policy and Communications spoke about the committee's work. He asked to back the committee in adopting a law that forbids any power structures setting up mass information media. This time "the top statesmen" showed unprecedented attention to "the fourth estate." Today, Viktor Chernomyrdin, chairman of the Russian Government, will meet participants in the conference at the White House. This will be his first meeting with representatives of the regional press. Also, Vladimir Shumeyko, Anatoliy Chubays, and Vyacheslav Kostikov are expected to address the conference.
