At 0330, four white police vehicles quietly parked by the village. Hopping out from the first was Yang Shouhua, deputy chief of the Hainan Armed Police Corps. He was followed by Xu Mingzhi and Cheng Zhongli, respectively chief and deputy chief of staff of the third detachment; and Wei Gang, a training section chief. After they consulted with each other for a short while, they motioned the other vehicles, and over 40 awe-inspiring special police force members -- wearing helmets, camouflaged uniforms and bullet-proof vests and armed with submachine guns -- jumped out from the vehicles. What happened in the village? It turned out that six villagers who loathed honest labor -- Chen Pixiong, Zhou Nucai, Liang Jiujin, Liang Piliu, Liang Pisan, and Liang Pier -- had assembled a dozen or so young men, who loved pleasures but loathed labor, and formed themselves into a gang. With such lethal weapons as handguns and submachine guns -- which they purchased, and daggers, and home-made machetes and spears, the gang members made it a regular practice to stop vehicles travelling on the expressway by the village late at night and robbed the passengers of their money and belongings. The ways they committed their crimes were quite ruthless. They also openly and brazenly went into villagers' houses to rob and burglarized them. So far this year they have robbed and stolen money and belongings amounting to more than 200,000 yuan. Determined to annihilate the gang, the Qiongshan Municipal Public Security Bureau had on many occasion sent police to the town to detect the gang's whereabouts. At 2315 on 27 April, the police, with the villagers' assistance, learned that the main culprits and other gang members had returned to the village to rest, and immediately reported the situation to the Hainan Provincial Public Security Department, which in turned informed the Hainan Armed Police Corps, demanding that personnel be sent to the village to destroy the gang and remove a menace of the people. After receiving the information, the Hainan Armed Police Corps immediately met to discuss ways to capture the robbers. It soon decided to select 50 officers and men from the corps' third detachment to encircle and capture the gang. At 0250, four police vehicles with over 50 armed police officers and men proceeded to the town. They arrived at the village at 0330. Knowing that the residences of the ringleaders and other gang members were scattered, the armed police divided themselves into six teams, and they adopted the tactics of closing in various locations secretly and quietly, and acted unexpectedly and quickly. Soon after they closed in on ringleader Liang Pier's house, Wei Gang, chief of the third squad and leader of his six fully armed special force members, kicked the door open and stormed into Liang's room with lightning speed, and yelled: "Hand over your gun or die!" Awakened from his sweet dream and staring at the muzzle, Liang slumped down limply. When Third Detachment Staff Li Long and members of his second special force squad stormed into the room of another ringleader, Liang Pisan, and turned on the light in the room, Liang was still sleeping like a dead pig in his underwear. "Get up, quick!" The officers and men yelled at him. "Hey, what are you guys so upright about!" Liang still thought that it was other gang members calling him. "Open your dog eyes, we are an armed police force!" Upon hearing this, Liang Pisan sat up in bed. His body trembled uncontrollably, and he wetted the sheet.... [ellipses as received] Liang Jiujin was not yet asleep. He sensed the movements outside and he realized something had gone wrong. Hurriedly he put on his clothes, opened the door and tried to flee. "Stop!" shouted Cheng Zhongli, the third detachment deputy chief of staff, at the culprit, when he and his squad swooped down on Liang's residence. In desperation, Liang Jiujin, like a mouse seeing a cat, dashed toward the village entrance. But he was soon tripped on the ground by a strong fighter, then he groaned with excruciating pain. Without firing a single bullet, the armed police officers and men captured each and every gang member by 0410. From their lodges, the armed police found a 45mm handgun, two submachine guns, five long and short muskets, and 18 bullets, as well as the money and other loot that the robbers had robbed, including color television sets, a tractor, and a gold necklace. The armed police had now removed a big menace for the people by completely destroying this gang, which had committed many crimes.
