Why are the United States and the United Nations pressuring Turkey as though there were no other problems in the world? [Sanberk] We ask ourselves the same question. Why? There is no bloodshed in Cyprus. No genocide. No threat. I believe that there is immense pressure on the part of the Greek lobby in the United States. The U.S. Administration has influence in the United Nations. Moreover, the United States believes that there is now an opportunity to solve this problem. The confidence-building measures package is on the table. [Kislali] But this package has not retained its original form. It was altered greatly, in line with the Greek Cypriot stand. [Sanberk] Yes, it was changed significantly. It is not acceptable as it stands today. [Kislali] How do you assess Russia's attitude? Its policy appears to have changed. The Russians began intervening in the Caucasus. Do they not constitute a source of concern? [Sanberk] Yes, I believe so. On one hand, we are following the developments with concern, but on the other hand, we are keeping the communications channels with the highest-level administrators, such as Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, open. These people are exerting great efforts to institute reforms in Russia. This is actually an impossible mission. The Russians are undertaking a military presence in southern Europe for the first time since World War II. [Kislali] Is the fact that they came to Bosnia not an issue as well? [Sanberk] In the wake of NATO's ultimatum to the Serbs in Bosnia, the Russians made a very clever move and transferred 400 troops to Bosnia in order to keep the peace. This military presence naturally accords them a political image as well. They wield great influence over the Serbs there. Considering the situation during Tito's reign, the presence of Russian troops in Bosnia is a very new phenomenon. If we also take Russia's presence in Georgia into consideration and add Ukraine and Bulgaria to the Russian sphere, then Turkey finds itself facing a crescent. [Kislali] Is this a development Turkey should take into consideration? [Sanberk] Given the ambiguity in Europe and Ukraine's situation, I would say yes. Furthermore, the United States is distancing itself, and NATO is not the same as before. Therefore, we are concerned. We also view the future of the Russian Federation as unsure. The Russians also have three categories of problems. Their economic problems are impossible to solve, because they are unable to obtain the necessary funds to support their stability programs and resolve the immense problems. They want to carry out the economic reforms and establish democratic institutions, but this is not easy. They also have the problem of nationalities. Therefore, we are not very optimistic that the Russian Government will succeed in implementing the reforms. [Kislali] What can we expect in Russia? [Sanberk] They must hold elections. Will they turn into a nation-state in the aftermath of an empire or will they pursue a policy of restoring the empire? For the time being, they do not know which borders end where and who should be considered a Russian. Therefore, not only we but countries like Estonia and Lithuania are also concerned about Russia. As a matter of fact, Germany is also concerned about Russia's future moves. [Kislali] What is this concern based on? [Sanberk] An empire cannot be a democratic state, and a nondemocratic country cannot implement reforms. Under the current circumstances, not all the support given to Yeltsin is going toward democracy, although this was the main reason for the support. [Kislali] Turkey's view is probably being conveyed to our Western allies, for example to the United States. Their views are different, are they not? [Sanberk] Yes, our views are conveyed to them. Developments are taking place in U.S. foreign policy. We discussed this with Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott last year. Many things have happened since then. During the crisis, the vulnerability of the Russian parliamentary system was seen. [Kislali] And if you look at the situation from our viewpoint? [Sanberk] From our viewpoint, a chaotic Russia would be to our disadvantage. Like a vacuum around us. What we want to do is to help Russia's democratization and economic reforms. However, we have economic problems too. Despite that, we extended a loan of $1.2 billion to Russia. Of that, they have used $700 million. Our volume of trade is $1.5 billion. There are Turkish contractors there, both in the Russian Federation and in other republics. [Kislali] What are the latest contracting figures? [Sanberk] We have investments of $2.5 billion in Russia, $500 million in Azerbaijan, $430 million in Kazakhstan, $440 million in Uzbekistan, $180 million in Kyrgyzstan, and $187 million in Turkestan, even though we do not have political relations with it. Turkmenistan is the most important of all; we have investments worth $1.2 billion there. These figures make up 7 percent of the world's construction investments. [Kislali] Are these activities very important for Turkey? [Sanberk] Of course, because the contractors use Turkish workers in these projects. They establish solidarity with the peoples of those countries. Our total investments in the Russian Federation and the Central Asian republics exceed $5 billion. [Kislali] Where does the Black Sea Economic Cooperation project stand? [Sanberk] It is not as ambitious about forming an organization as the Common Market or the European Free Trade Association. For the obstacles to be overcome, the states must cooperate. Efforts must be made to facilitate investments among the member countries. Trade must be made easier. Medium-size entrepreneurs must be encouraged. The necessary institutions have been set up. The chairman must be Russian. We are waiting for that. It will take time. [passage omitted] [Kislali] How do the U.S. and NATO policies toward Bosnia affect Turkey? [Sanberk] They cause in us a lack of confidence in the future. We do not know how long this post-Cold War period will last and how it will end. Also, when other confrontations will arise -- and they probably will -- what will happen to the principles we tried to protect together during the Cold War? Will the world become chaotic? Despite that, we are approaching the developments realistically. We offer our cooperation to our European and American allies.
