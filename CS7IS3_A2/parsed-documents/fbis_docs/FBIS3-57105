It Will Not be Very Simple for Yeltsin and Kozyrev To Continue Their Course"] [Text] The Russian Federation foreign minister does not tire of reiterating that Russia's foreign policy is that of the president. This postulate, however, does not appear all that self- evident now that Duma committees have been formed. At least four of them -- on international affairs, CIS affairs, and geopolitical questions -- may, and more probable than not, will, insist on at least having their opinion be considered. The latter committee will go the longest way of all. At least because its head and one of his deputies -- Viktor Ustinov and Mikhail Sidorov -- are representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, and this party, perhaps, did not indicate any agreement on a single question with the Yeltsin-Kozyrev foreign political course. It is maintained that the very creation of the committee on geopolitical questions is a payback to the Liberal Democratic Party for the foreign affairs committee chaired by Vladimir Lukin, former Russian Federation ambassador to the United States. But he too has a Liberal Democratic "shadow foreign minister" for his deputy, Aleksey Mitrofanov. Lukin, however, is known for his strained relations with Kozyrev which may undoubtedly negatively rub off on the committee's reactions to the actions of the minister who, as Kozyrev himself maintains, is strictly following the president's policy. But Russian parliaments traditionally do not do what the president says and the Duma has no special grounds to alter the ingrained habit. The committee for security is led by Viktor Ilyukhin, a Communist prosecutor, who was going to take Mikhail Gorbachev to court, hence one should not expect any special cooperation. All the more so because the committee chairman will, one would think, find support from one of his deputies, Nina Krivelskaya, representing this same Liberal Democratic Party of Russia. There are no representatives of the Russian Federation Communist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia among the leaders of the fourth committee, for CIS affairs. But they are undoubtedly to be found among its members. Indeed, relations with the "near abroad" are of real interest for these parties, and their view on these relations once again diverge from those of Yeltsin and Kozyrev. Thus, all the prerequisites are there for a more clearly defined standoff between the Duma and the president, and his foreign minister, in virtually all areas of foreign policy. The parliamentary committee will surely approach geopolitical questions from neo-imperial positions, something that its chairman's deputies, Yuliy Gusman of Russia's Choice and Aleksey Piskunov of New Regional Policy, would hardly countervail. One does not have to explain the way the Communists see Russia's security, and this approach means opposing all disarmament processes and initiatives. One should also remember that Ilyukhin was going to take Gorbachev to court for the disintegration of the USSR; consequently he has a corresponding attitude to the CIS and Russia's partners that augurs nothing good. It may hamper all efforts by Zatulin's committee. Kozyrev has always been accused of pro-Americanism. The same can easily be ascribed to Lukin for his ambassadorial past. Demagogues have never passed up such a chance, and I do not have to remind you whose ranks are chock full of them. Apparently, no foreign policy question is going to be perused solely by one certain committee. Each committee will try to have its say on a matter, which would spark differences between them. It would be sensible for Yeltsin and Kozyrev to play on these differences if only they pay attention to the voice of parliament at all. There is a third option -- to adjust the Russian foreign policy course taking into account parliamentarians' opinions. But then it may radically alter the course itself. That would have very serious consequences both for Russia and the world.
