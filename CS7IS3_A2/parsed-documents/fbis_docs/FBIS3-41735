Specialists equate those who have lice with carriers of infection. Because no one knows the moment and hour that, for example, an epidemic of dreaded, in the memory of the older generation, typhus will spread together with these lice. Typhus strikes the heart and central nervous system, and there were in the past quite a few cases of patient death. Experts of the Russian Ministry of Health emphasize in particular that it is very difficult to detect everyone with pediculosis. While 136,222 people were recorded in the first 5 months of 1993 (which is slightly less than last year on a monthly basis), this is no reason to rejoice:in what places are adults and children the focus of attention in this respect? Obviously, in hospitals, children's institutions, hostels and summer camps. But many hospitals are shut down in the summer for repairs. Students have gone home. And the number of camps where children can improve their health is rapidly declining.... So that this figure of 136,000 plus people could be considered the result of screening a sample. Mikhail Narkevich, Russian Ministry of Health expert, believes that ``The cause does not lie only in dirt itself. In the course of civilian unrest, major migrations and roaming, not only the lifestyle but also the emotional status of people changes. Stress, apathy, nervousness and lack of self-confidence pave the way for infections in general. And for pediculosis too. The present ``surge'' started before the cost of soap and of washing at a bath house rose. And the insects have been found in many apartments with all the amenities, with rows of shampoos and hot water. Pharmacies are being supplied very poorly with louse-control agents.'' There is another real threat that has arisen in the last few days, cholera in Tadjikistan. It arrived there from Pakistan, with tourists. With the present increase in migration and enormous flux of refugees, there is the possibility of cholera ``arriving'' in Russian cities too. It is transmitted through dirty water, insufficiently pure food and dirty hands. The saddest thing of all is that, in general, the means of salvation are simple. As for pedi..., that is to say, pardon me, lice, we postwar children were spared by kerosene. It is simple and effective.
