On Saturday he addressed the sitting of the forum Towards New Accord in Moscow. Representatives of 17 parties and 30 public organizations and movements from former Soviet republics except Turkmenistan participated in the sitting. According to Zyuganov, "dictatorship is inevitable" in the case that "neither replacement of the course, nor refusal from political revenge, nor formation of a government of national confidence take place in the near term and priority trends in the development of the agrarian industrial complex, military industrial complex, education, science, and culture are not determined." The sitting discussed problems and prospects of economic and political unification of the former Soviet republics. As said President of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Arkadiy Volskiy, it would be necessary to Moscow to invest 10,000 trillion rubles in order "to transfer to self-subsistence economy" that is to manage without economic cooperation with the former Soviet republics. The volume of the inter-republican trade was 21 percent of the USSR GNP, reported former USSR premier Nikolay Ryzhkov. At the same time he said that out of 15 Soviet republics only Russia and Turkmenistan had favorable trade balance. "Beginning with 1917 Russia always gave more than it received," Ryzhkov declared. He warned about the danger "of ignoring and silencing" of the issue on the borders within the former Soviet Union and reported there were 70 points on its territory "which can trigger the issue on the borders." In Ryzhkov's opinion, "the CIS appeared to be lacking vital capacity and has not justified its tasks." A future voluntary union, he said, should be open not only for former Soviet republics but for other countries of Europe and Asia which will express their wish to join it.
