Dr. Zakariya al-Agha stressed that the Palestinians are able to manage the Gaza Strip's affairs less than 48 hours after the Israeli forces withdraw from there. Al-Agha pointed out that most Palestinian civil agencies, especially the police, education, and health are now in place and that specialized Palestinian cadres from within and abroad will run these agencies upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces. Al-Agha condemned remarks attributed to an Israeli military commander and published in an Israeli newspaper to the effect that the Israeli forces will not be able to withdraw before 13 April. Al-Agha said: Despite the fact that I am not a military man, I believe that the Israeli forces can withdraw within one month. They have now about two-and-a half-months until that date and they can implement withdrawal during this period without any obstacles. Al-Agha expressed his displeasure over a possible delay in the withdrawal date, because exceeding the date set for this purpose will represent a grave and unsound indication by the Israelis, who now have adequate time for withdrawing. Al-Agha denied rumors on the existence of differences within Fatah in the Gaza Strip. He said that Fatah is gaining strength daily and is becoming more cohesive and resolute and that its members are aware of their current historic responsibility. Al-Agha expressed his complete pleasure at the democratic dialogue conducted by the engineers from Fatah and Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] which resulted in forming a joint board of management, because this epitomizes the Palestinian people's spirit of cooperation, democracy, and great responsibility. He added: This is a living example that it is possible to form a Palestinian government from among the Palestinian forces participating in the arena. He emphasized that the Palestinian leadership calls on every Palestinian to join the coming authority. Al-Agha underscored the need to hold elections at their scheduled date so that the people will choose their representatives in a democratic and fair manner in the first Palestinian national authority in the Palestinian people's history.
