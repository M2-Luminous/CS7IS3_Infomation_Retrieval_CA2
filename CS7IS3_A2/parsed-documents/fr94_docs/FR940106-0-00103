FR940106-0-00103 FR940106-0-00021 (iii) Alternative to criteria for each specific step. Instead of complying with the specific criteria for each of the steps in the second and succeeding years, a facility may include in its prior year's attestation, in addition to the actions taken under Steps One through Five, that it shall reduce the number of alien (H&hyph;1 and H&hyph;1A visaholders) nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date of attestation by at least 10 percent, without reducing the quality or quantity of services provided. If this goal is achieved (as demonstrated by documentation maintained by the facility and made available for inspection, and indicated in its subsequent year's attestation), the facility's subsequent year's attestation may simply include the Form ETA 9029, an explanation demonstrating that this goal has been achieved and an attestation that it shall again reduce the number of alien nurses it utilizes within 1 year from the date of attestation by at least 10 percent. This alternative is designed to permit a facility to achieve the objectives of the Act, without subjecting the facility to detailed requirements and criteria as to the specific means of achieving that objective. The first, second, and succeeding years shall be consecutive. (2) Alternative II: subject to approved annual State plan. As an alternative to attesting to the timely and significant steps set forth in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, the facility may attest that it ``is subject to an approved State plan for the recruitment and retention of nurses.'' The contents of the annual State plan are described in more detail in ยง XXX .315. For an individual facility to meet the requirements of this paragraph (g)(2), the annual State plan shall provide for the taking of timely and significant steps by that facility, and the facility shall maintain appropriate documentation with respect to those steps. See ยง XXX .350(b). To qualify for this Alternative II, the annual State plan shall have been approved prior to the date the facility submits its attestation to ETA for filing. (h) The fifth attestation element: No strike or lockout; no intention or design to influence bargaining representative election. The facility shall attest that ``there is not a strike or lockout in the course of a labor dispute, and the employment of such an alien is not intended or designated to influence an election for a bargaining representative for registered nurses of the facility.'' Labor disputes for purposes for this attestation element relate only to those involving nurses providing nursing services; other health service occupations are not included. This attestation element applies to strikes and lockouts and elections of bargaining representatives at both the facility employing the nurse and, in the case of nursing contractors, at the worksite facility. (1) Notice of strike or lockout. In order to remain in compliance with the no strike or lockout portion of this attestation element, if a strike or lockout of nurses at the facility occurs during the 1 year's validity of the attestation, the facility, within 3 days of the occurrence of the strike or lockout, shall submit to the ETA National Office, by U.S. mail or private carrier, written notice of the strike or lockout. (2) ETA notice to INS. Upon receiving from a facility a notice described in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, ETA shall examine the documentation, and may consult with the union at the facility or other appropriate entities. If ETA determines that the strike or lockout is covered under 8 CFR 214.2(h)(17), INS's Effect of strike regulation for ``H'' visaholders, ETA shall certify to INS, in the manner set forth in that regulation, that a strike or other labor dispute involving a work stoppage of nurses is in progress at the facility. (i) The sixth attestation element: notice of filing. The facility shall attest that at the time of filing of the petition for registered nurses under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of the Act, notice of filing has been provided by the facility to the bargaining representative of the registered nurses at the facility or, where there is no such bargaining representative, notice of the filing has been provided to registered nurses at the facility through posting in conspicuous locations. The requirement applies to providing notice of filing both for attestations submitted to ETA and for visa petitions filed with INS. (1) Notification of bargaining representative. No later than the date the attestation is mailed to DOL to be considered for filing, the facility shall notify the bargaining representative (if any) for nurses at the facility that the attestation is being submitted to DOL, and shall state in that notice that the attestation is available at the facility (explaining how it can be inspected or obtained) and at the national office of ETA for review by interested parties. No later than the date the facility transmits a visa petition for H&hyph;1A nurses to INS, the facility shall notify the bargaining representative (if any) for nurses at the facility that the visa petition is being submitted to INS, and shall state in that notice that the attestation and visa petition are available at the facility (explaining how they can be inspected or obtained) and at the national office of ETA for review by interested parties. Notices under this paragraph (i)(1) shall include the following statement: ``Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the attestation or failure to comply with the terms of the attestation may be filed with any office of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor.''
