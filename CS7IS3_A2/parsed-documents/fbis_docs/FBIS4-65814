For the second time since December, the INSEE's growth forecasts for the second half of the year have been adjusted upwards. The INSEE, which had predicted "a gradual reactivation" and a .5-percent increase in business in the first semester, now believes that "the French economy is on its way to recovery," and is counting on a .9-percent increase of GDP. "Against a background of a substantial increase in expected demand and in exports, recovery would seem to be supported by a growth of stocks, a slight reactivation of productive investments, and the housing sector's dynamism," the INSEE stated. In such conditions, even if there is zero growth in the second semester, which would be highly unlikely, GDP will increase by 1.3 percent in 1994. This figure will probably be surpassed. Last Thursday, Economics Minister Edmond Alphandery considered it "highly probable" that this summer the government will adjust its 1.4-percent forecast for 1994 upwards. Two new factors are underpinning this more favorable prognosis. To begin with, a confirmation. The improvement in manufacturers' expectations since the fall resulted in an increase in manufacturing output. Even on the pessimistic assumption of industrial production stagnating in March, it would still have risen by 2.4 percent in the first quarter, thus invalidating the INSEE's December forecasts (0.1 percent). The second factor is a piece of good news: The labor market has stabilized more rapidly than expected. Paid employment in the non-agricultural business sector increased by 0.1 percent in the first quarter thanks to a significant hiring increase in the tertiary, particularly services, sector. In addition, the loss of industrial jobs was less serious than expected (down 0.5 percent). Overall, "the rise of unemployment during the first semester should be smaller than predicted (0.5 percent) in December's statement," the INSEE anticipated. Recovery of Industrial Investments Confirmed Why is recovery apparently more vigorous? To begin with, the international environment is continuing to improve. The locomotive effect of North American growth and the expansion of Asian markets (excluding Japan) on the European economies has become more tangible than in 1993. But, above all, "as regards demand expectations, it is fairly established that things seem to be getting better in Europe," according to Eric Chaney, one of the authors of the INSEE's statement, who highlighted the fact that most of the trade carried out by European Union countries was carried out within Europe itself. One of the factors which was working against recovery, business stocking behavior, now seems to have taken a favorable turn. The improvement in demand expectations is encouraging manufacturers to slow down stock depletion, which in itself is enough to contribute positively to growth. The slight increase in the price of intermediate products (up 0.2 percent in the first quarter) for the first time since 1992, highlights this progress. The recovery of industrial investment, which this year should rise by 1 to 2 percent after an 11-percent drop, is being confirmed. In addition, these forecasts are more likely to be adjusted upward than downward: Demand expectations, which largely determine investment behavior, have been rising since the autumn of 1993. Uncertainty in Financial Markets Finally, "the improvement in the labor market that has been noted since early in the year is gradually reestablishing confidence among households, whose consumption may prove more dynamic in the second quarter than in the first," the INSEE stated. The only shadow in the picture is cast by the uncertainties besetting the financial markets. The rise in long-term interest rates in most of the industrialized countries, including France, as well as the acute volatility experienced in the financial markets remain a reason for concern and could indirectly affect economic activity, particularly in the real estate markets.
