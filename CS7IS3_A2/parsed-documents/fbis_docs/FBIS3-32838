During an assessment of Peruvian trade policy, GATT highlighted the reduction of tariffs in general as a result of the government's goal of tariffs reaching 15 percent by January 1995; the elimination of price controls, subsidies, quantitative and exchange rate restrictions; and the policy of state intervention. The report states, however, that the private sector's reaction to the changes is limited due to the high levels of interest rates and taxes, sectoral competition, infrastructure deficiencies, overevaluation of the exchange rate, and terrorism.
