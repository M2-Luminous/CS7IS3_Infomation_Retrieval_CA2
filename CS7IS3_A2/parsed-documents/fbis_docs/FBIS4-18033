Perhaps because their convictions changed or perhaps because they introduced their "own" holidays. But as they say, if they do not want to take part in organized events themselves, they should not prevent others from doing so. Especially as by their inept activity they have brought millions of workers, employees, peasants, and intellectuals to an impoverished existence, deprived many of them of work, and now also want to deprive them of the opportunity at least to communicate occasionally. And this is being done in violation of the present very far from perfect Russian Federation Constitution, which they themselves signed and which they frenziedly urged working people to adopt and which they swore to observe. Article 31 of the Russian Federation Constitution clearly says: "Citizens o the Russian Federation have the right to assemble peacefully, without weapons, to hold gatherings, meetings, demonstrations, processions, and pickets." The same thing is said in article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights approved and proclaimed by the UN General Assembly 10 December 1948. Our executive power leadership does not tire of repeating that it respects international law and that it is a component of the Russian legal system. But words are often at odds with specific actions. It has become a rule for far-fetched pretexts to be used to forbid applicants to hold processions at all or to determine a route which can only be called an insult to citizens and their rights. After the end of the notification and conciliation stage and immediately before the relevant date through the mass media and radio and television representatives of the city hall and other state services put various forms of psychological pressure on the organizers of and future participants in particular events staged by the opposition. And in addition to everything else even before the start of the meeting and procession large detachments supplied with bulletproof waistcoats, helmets, shields, rubber truncheons, and often weapons as well and detachments of the special militia and other militia subunits are brought in to the venues. Then various types of vehicles close nearly all adjacent streets and avenues. In general terms the meeting's participants are "surrounded" on all sides. After the proclaimed "peace initiatives" allegedly aimed at civil accord in society, a hope appeared that there would be an improvement in the attitude toward the above-mentioned topic. But unfortunately everything is continuing according to the usual scenario. Again the city hall representatives have started haggling with representatives of the parties and movements over assigning a venue and the means for holding events to mark May Day. Again psychological pressure is beginning on those who are intending to take part in them. In particular on 14 April VECHERNYAYA MOSKVA published in a small note information to the effect that joint exercises by militia and special militia subunits involving a total of 1,500 men had been held on the territory of the "Luzhniki" sports complex under conditions as close as possible to combat conditions. They were rehearsing operations in the event of the outbreak of mass riots and all this was linked directly with the approaching May Day. An even more alarming report was heard on that day on radio to the effect that it is intended to bring large special militia detachments from various regions into the capital in the next few days, allegedly to fight crime. This report cannot fail to perturb Muscovites because many of them still have fresh in their memory the illegal actions of the out of town special militia members when, armed "to the teeth," they subjected unarmed and defenseless citizens to fierce beatings during the September-October events in Moscow. If the question of sending the regional special militia to Moscow has already been resolved then a number of questions arise. From where will the special militia subunits come, how many will there be, how long will they stay, and where and against whom will they act? If it is to render aid to the Moscow militia in the struggle against crime then why are they being transferred on the threshold of the May Day holidays? Does that mean that previously the crime situation in the city was better than it is now, or is it that things are going well in the struggle against crime in the regions from which it is intended to send them to Moscow? I suggest that the State Duma on the basis of the committees for security and legislation create a special commission which would monitor the political events in Moscow, the activity of the special militia, and other militia subunits. First of all it is essential to prevent their use by the authorities against the people's masses. Unfortunately we have grown accustomed to creating commissions after the event, that is when blood has already been shed, the public has already been aroused, and no culprits can be found. The actual participants in the May Day events must display heightened vigilance and through their efforts ensure proper order and discipline during a possible procession. If provocateurs do appear it is essential to establish their identity and hand them over to the militia, finding out afterward what steps have been taken with regard to them. It would be useful if those who have them were to take cameras and video cameras with them so that they can film everything that happens and if necessary make use of what they have filmed. Peace to May Day and a good mood for all Russia's citizens!
