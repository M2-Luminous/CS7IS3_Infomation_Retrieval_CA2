FBIS4-10990 "drlat077_a_94006" FBIS-LAT-94-077 Daily Report 21 Apr 1994 CARIBBEAN Cuba Foreign Ministry Adviser Views Emigre Conference Foreign Ministry Adviser Views Emigre Conference FL2004175394 FL2004175394 BFN [Editorial Report] Cuba Vision Network in Spanish at 0030 GMT on 20 April features its regularly scheduled 30-minute Open Agenda program with host Antonio Resillez and guest Rene Mujica, adviser to the foreign minister, on "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference. The program begins with a video of Antonio Aja Diaz, deputy director of the Political Alternatives Study Center of Havana University, who points out that the United States is the main destination of Cuban emigration, approximately 1.0439 million Cuban immigrants; followed by 15,000 in Spain; 13,000 in Venezuela; 4,000 in Mexico; and much smaller numbers in other countries worldwide. Aja points out that Cuban immigration experienced a significant increase in 1959, and that the main destination for two centuries has been the United States. Mujica begins by stating that a little more than 200 people are expected to attend the Havana conference. The agenda includes several subjects to familiarize participants with the current Cuban circumstances and to discuss issues of interest to emigres. He adds that Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly of the People's Government, will discuss the Cuban People's Government system; Abel Prieto, president of the National Union of Cuban Writers and Artists, will discuss Cuban culture and national identity; Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina will discuss current ties and prospects of ties between Cuba and the emigre community; and finally, Carlos Lage, secretary of the Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers, will discuss Cuba's current economic situation and prospects. Mujica adds that the number of participants "is not significant, many people have asked to participate." He adds that it is important to stress that the participants come from approximately 40 countries, are from diverse fields and social conditions, and will pay their way. Mujica goes on to say that the goal of the conference is: "to identify a common ground to work toward the establishment of normal ties with the emigre community. The meeting will become a forum to exchange opinions, and to discuss possible solutions, and difficulties. It will not be a negotiation from which accords could result." Mujica adds the meeting will be austere but that several dozen comrades -- the minimum necessary -- from diverse Cuban institutions and sectors directly related to immigration will also attend the conference. Prompted by Resillez, Mujica stresses that the participants are not sympathizers with the Cuban Revolution -- a false claim by the foreign media. Regarding foreign media claims that the conference's ulterior motive is economic, Mujica adds: "That is another false claim made to distort the true goals of this initiative by the Cuban Government. There is no hidden agenda. This initiative is being handled in a clear, open manner. There are no ulterior motives. "The foreign media purposely exaggerate certain opinions on the significance, or economic impact which might result from ties with the emigres. Every human relation or endeavor has, of course, an economic aspect but this is in no way the motive of our initiative, nor is this economic aspect a significant prospect for Cuba's future." A video segment with Ingrid Estevez, from Havana's Socio-Political Studies Center, stresses that polls conducted in 1993 and 1994 reveal that the current Cuban opinion on the emigres is "more mature"; for example: 40 percent of the people polled believed the emigres condemned the blockade; 79 percent agree that emigres could use and pay for Cuban medical services; 83 percent agree with normalizing ties; 52 percent wish to visit relatives in the United States. Another poll conducted earlier this year shows that 84 percent supports "The Nation and the Emigre Community" conference. Mujica points out that the conference ought to show the way to normalize ties with the emigres and adds: "We hope contacts will increase and there will be a program of contacts with the emigres, and our institutions, relatives, etc., through diverse channels of communication". Resillez asks if there are signs that the U.S. Government is somehow participating in the effort to improve the emigre's ties with Cuba, since the majority of emigres reside in the United States. Mujica answers: "No, really none. This is absolutely a Cuban initiative. There is no participation from any government or foreign element in its development. The answer is definitively no." He adds: "I do not know of any statement or official position from U.S. authorities regarding this conference. Governments do not have to have a position on everything happening in this world, particularly, if their interests are not affected as we hope is the case." Mujica points out that reporters are not invited to the conference in order to facilitate the frankness and openness of the discussions and that the media will be able to report on the opening and closing ceremonies, and will receive daily reports via an official spokesman. In closing Mujica stresses: "We know this is a highly interesting and sensitive subject for our people. We have made every effort to keep the people informed about it and we will continue to do so to see that our people are fully informed."
