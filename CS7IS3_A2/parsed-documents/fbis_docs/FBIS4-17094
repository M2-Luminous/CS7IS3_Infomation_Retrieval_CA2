A couple of hours after the statement on the situation in Bosnia by A. Kozyrev, the boss, and on the fact that he is an optimist, a directly opposite statement followed from his loyal deputy, V. Churkin. The president's special emissary, who had recently become a real favorite of Belgrade (what a defender of the Serbs!), quite unexpectedly condemned the Serb side in Bosnia harshly and discourteously. Moreover, he announced that the time had come for Russia to end all discussions with the Bosnian Serbs. According to him, they are using the Russian policy as a screen for their own purposes, and they must understand that Russia is a great state, not a banana republic. And so on, and so forth. Here there are differences with his ideological leader -- not in nuances but on a whole number of fundamental positions. What is this? Does the right hand not know what the left hand is doing? The outraged self-esteem of the emissary, who did not achieve success in his latest shuttle trip to the former Yugoslavia? Or is it a hitherto unknown theatrical presentation for an estimable public? In actual fact, everything had evidently been rehearsed and staged in advance. First Kozyrev's nighttime peacemaking visit to Belgrade for a positive check mark in the Russian Duma's register. Then.... "Several questions arise," today's VECERNJE NOVOSTI writes. "Will Kozyrev wish to `cool down' his deputy to some extent? Were Churkin's words fulfilling the function of pressuring the Serb side? Maybe this is an announcement of future exacerbation with the Serbs?" In general, the recent moves by Moscow diplomacy create a strange impression, to put it mildly. Somehow a doubt involuntarily steals in: Is the opinion, widely publicized by Moscow, that Russia has returned to the Balkans correct? One more thing -- this is from a headline in POLITIKA: "Whose side is Russia on?"
