This implies that in two weeks, when the period specified by the Algerian Ruling Council expires, the Armed Forces may directly assume power. Political observers say that the Algerian defense minister's threatening remarks, even if they are put into practice, will not have a very significant effect on the country's political scene. Since the Boumedienne coup d'etat in the sixties, the Algerian Armed Forces have held the reins of power and even now are the power behind the Algerian Ruling Council. The threat that the Armed Forces may enter the fray directly will change little in the circumstances. And the Algerian Armed Forces have a very (?defensive) position in the crisis in the country and cannot become a very active force in resolving the Algerian crisis. The Algerian Armed Forces are not a homogeneous body and are politically polarized between the government and the Islamists and are thus plagued by an overt dichotomy of loyalties. This issue, which has spilled out of the country, and the imposition of conditions by international powers on the Algerian Ruling Council, undermining its position, could be the real reason behind the remarks by the Algerian defense minister. In other words, his allegations seem to be more propaganda, aimed at projecting the impression that the Algerian Armed Forces enjoy a unified capability that can enable them to assume power in the country. Some political observers believe that the defense minister's recent remarks relate to the resumption of the negotiations between the government and the opposing factions on delegating power and on the length of the tenure of the interim government. These talks, which began months ago, have failed to achieve any outcome. The Algerian Government has not extended an invitation to the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) and by providing privileges to other factions, it seeks to elicit support for the current illegal government and thus forge a united front and an extensive coalition of non-Islamic factions. Thus, it is striving to replace the Ruling Council with a strong non-Islamic coalition. The threatening remarks of the Algerian defense minister a few days before negotiations between the government and the opposing factions resume may aim to motivate the opposition to accept the government's wishes. By not including the FIS, the key player in Algeria, which enjoys legitimacy and a popular base, these talks are doomed to fail even before they begin. The only development that has taken place with regard to these talks is that by exposing the government's weakness and a significant tilt in the balance between the government and the Islamists, the non-Islamic factions are not ready to gamble away their future. The most important faction participating in the talks between the government and the opposition, the Socialist Front, recently announced its abstention from these talks and other factions are in the midst of deciding whether they should participate in the upcoming talks. This has placed the Algerian Ruling Council in a major political quandary, because it has invested much to achieve even half-baked legitimacy by seeking to elicit the support of the other secular factions. This hope is likely to become chagrin. If the Ruling Council is defeated on this path, it's only choice will be to extend its tenure for a third time, without recourse to the will of the people, or to think more intelligently and delegate power to those who are popularly elected.
