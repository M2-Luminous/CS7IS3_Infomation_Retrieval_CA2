The National Civilian Police (PNC) and the National Police, which is currently being phased out, will provide security for the elections, which are scheduled to begin at 0700 and end at 1700. PNC Director Jose Maria Monterrey said some 4,000 policemen will guard the national polling places in a joint effort with the National Police. The PNC, a new corps that emerged as a result of the 1992 peace agreements ending a 12-year war, currently covers only seven of the country's 14 departments. The PNC will be at the service of the TSE in all remote regions and will be equipped with modern radio equipment, Monterrey announced. For his part, National Police Director Samuel Dolores Cuellar said that for the last time -- since it is supposed to be phased out in September -- the National Police will have 4,193 policemen posted at 148 polling places throughout the country. The police chief added that the National Police will provide protection in the capital and in the principal cities of Santa Ana, San Miguel, Ahuachapan, Sonsonate, and La Libertad Departments. The Armed Forces will have the sole duty of assisting the TSE in the immediate transfer of vote count certificates or election officials aboard helicopters. Party officials and observers will always be present at such times. For their part, the political parties, with the participation of the UN Observers for El Salvador (Onusal), have signed documents and commitments wherein they appeal to their party rank and file to observe the necessary prudence and to avoid acts of violence as electoral tension increases. Six parties and a three-party alliance will participate in the presidential elections. The alliance, however, will not participate as such in the legislative and municipal elections. The elections are for the presidency of the Republic, 84 deputy seats, and municipal councilmen positions in 262 municipalities. The parties with the best chances are the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA), the leftist presidential coalition [Democratic Convergence-Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front-National Revolutionary Movement Coalition] and Christian Democracy, which has been relegated to third place. Other rightist parties are the National Coalition (PCN), the Authentic Christian Movement (MAC), the Unity Movement, and the National Solidarity Movement, all of which have slim chances.
