FR940513-0-00152 FR940513-0-00034 D. Disclosures for General Service Incandescent Reflector Lamps In the NPR, the Commission stated that incandescent reflector lamps would be within the category of general service incandescent lamps under the Commission's proposed labeling rules. 166 As such, the rule amendments would have required manufacturers of these products to disclose design voltage (if other than 120), wattage, light output (expressed in lumens), life (expressed in hours), a supplemental disclosure (either lumens per watt or operating cost), and number of bulbs in the package (if more than one). 167 ACEEE's proposal, as outlined by the Commission in the NPR, would also apply equally to reflector and nonreflector general service incandescent lamps. In contrast, as discussed in the NPR, NEMA recommended that general service incandescent reflector lamps be subject to disclosure requirements that would be substantially different from those required for other general service incandescent lamps. Specifically, NEMA recommended requiring, for incandescent reflector lamps, the same disclosure it proposed for general service fluorescent lamps ( i.e., disclosure only of the encircled capital letter ``E,'' as the Rule presently requires for fluorescent lamp ballasts, 16 CFR 305.11(d)). This would designate that the product meets the energy conservation standards established in EPCA. 168 NEMA suggested that the designation be indicated in the manufacturer's catalogs and other printed material, and that the encircled ``E'' be etched on the products themselves. 169 166 58 FR at 60151. 167 Id. at 60154&hyph;55. 168 42 U.S.C.A. 6295(i)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1993). 169 58 FR at 60152&hyph;53. 1. Disclosures on Packaging and in Catalogs Fourteen of the participants commented on what type of disclosures the Commission should require for general service incandescent reflector lamps. Five comments supported limiting the required disclosures for these lamps to an encircled ``E,'' as NEMA suggested. 170 Six supported a requirement to disclose the basic elements and efficiency index proposed by the Commission. 171 Three favored a requirement to disclose the encircled ``E,'' but with additional limited disclosures. 172 170 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 29, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 28; IES, GG&hyph;6, 2; GE, G&hyph;2, 6, (Ans.), 1, 2; Philips, G&hyph;5, 2; Supreme (Supp.), G&hyph;13, 1. 171 LBL, GG&hyph;7, 1; MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 1&hyph;2; MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 1; OR DOE, GG&hyph;13, 2&hyph;7, 7&hyph;8; WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 2; Angelo, G&hyph;1, 2. The basic elements are: Voltage (if other than 120), wattage, light output (expressed in lumens), laboratory life (in hours), and number of bulbs in the package (if more than one). 172 Osram, G&hyph;4, 2, (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 4; ACEEE, GG&hyph;1, 3, (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2; LRC, GG&hyph;15, 3, (Tr.), 312. Those supporting an encircled ``E'' disclosure for general service incandescent reflector lamps argued that the minimum efficiency standards added to EPCA by EPA 92 for these lamps 173 would eliminate all but the efficient models, 174 leaving purchasers with little choice among the remaining models in terms of energy efficiency. 175 They also contended that, because the products are purchased for the specialized purpose of directing a focused beam of light onto an area or object, purchasers are primarily interested in the pattern (or spread) and the intensity of the beam. 176 NEMA and Philips, moreover, maintained that manufacturers are already disclosing the elements that are relevant to purchasers of these lamps_wattage, voltage, life, beam intensity and beam spread. 177 NEMA added that the Commission can rely on marketing pressures to compel manufacturers to continue making disclosures of pertinent lighting characteristics without a mandate. 178 These comments concluded that the Commission does not have to require most of the elements proposed for other general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps for purchasers to be able to select a general service incandescent reflector lamp. 173 42 U.S.C.A. 6295(i)(1)(A) (West Supp. 1993). 174 NEMA (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 28; Philips (Supp.), G&hyph;12, 2. 175 Osram (Supp.), G&hyph;11, 3. 176 GE, G&hyph;2, 3, 6, (Ans,), 2, 9, (Tr.), 301, 304; NEMA, G&hyph;3, 19&hyph;21, 30; Osram (Tr.), 295 (``When you purchase a reflector incandescent lamp, you are interested in how it concentrates the light on the particular object or task that you bought the lamp to illuminate. And that typically is characterized *␣*␣* in terms of beam spread and beam performance.''); IES, GG&hyph;6, 2. 177 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 29&hyph;30, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 29; Philips, G&hyph;5, 2 (Philips limited its remarks to beam characteristics). 178 NEMA, G&hyph;3, 31. Three comments supporting disclosure of all the basic elements for general service incandescent reflector lamps did not agree that the EPCA standards would eliminate variation among the efficiencies of these products. 179 LBL contended that the variation is actually likely to increase in the future. 180 The supporting comments generally stated that purchasers should be provided with information that will enable them to distinguish between the lamps that meet the standards and those that exceed them. 181 One comment also suggested requiring the disclosure of beam spread for these products. 182 179 Angelo (Supp.), G&hyph;8, 2 (``To presume, as NEMA does, that halogen PAR lamps, which already meet the standards, will simply capture the entire market, belittles the attempts of others to meet the efficiency standards with less expensive technology.''); ACEEE (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2 (``*␣*␣* the ``circle E'' alone does not reflect the substantial variations in efficacy among incandescent reflector products that exceed [EPA 92] efficiency standards.'') LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 3 (``While the minimum efficacy required by [EPA 92] for incandescent reflector lamps in effect mandates halogen reflector lamps or better, there are more efficacious options on the market, such as halogen infrared and compact fluorescent reflector lamps. Future technology may bring even more lamps with higher efficiencies.''). 180 LBL (Supp.), GG&hyph;22, 3. 181 Angelo, G&hyph;1, 2; ACEEE (Supp.), GG&hyph;21, 2; LBL, GG&hyph;7, 1; MN DPS, GG&hyph;9, 1&hyph;2; MO DNR, GG&hyph;10, 1; WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 2. 182 WA SEO, GG&hyph;18, 3.
