BBO is the only optics material that can convert visible wavelengths to the short wavelengths in the ultraviolet region. Using the CZ method to grow crystals of the low temperature or _b_ phase, which has this non-linear optics effect, had been considered nearly impossible, but NEC purified CZ starting materials, controlled the temperature, controlled the crystal orientation, etc., to obtain crystals with the same or higher quality than with previous methods but at rates 20-30 times faster. In the future the price is expected to drop to about one-third the present price after mass production technology for making larger crystals is set up. In the CZ method for pulling BBO crystals, crystallization begins in the high temperature _a_ phase if the temperature is merely lowered. NEC developed the basic technology for crystallization beginning with the low temperature phase in 1989, and NEC engineers made several modifications to achieve practical application of the CZ method based on their development. As a result they obtained BBO crystals 50 long and 15-16 in diameter. For the time being they will offer these crystals at the price of their least expensive line of previous BBO crystals. In the future, with the establishment of mass production technology such as larger crucibles, NEC expects to lower the price to about one-third the present price. Associated with this crystal pulling technology they are using, NEC engineers have made inexpensive, high-quality starting material by sintering _b_ phase powder obtained by chemical precipitation, established a technique for _b_ phase seed crystals that do not change phase even when they come in direct contact with the melt, and established a technique to control the melt temperature so that the melt crystallizes at the _b_ phase from the onset. The engineers have also devices a method to control melt convection so that crystal orientation remains consistent during the forming process. BBO was originally developed in China, and currently several companies in the U.S. and China manufacture it by the flux method and sell it. Japan depends on imports from China for its whole supply. The flux method enables crystals to be grown at the low temperature _b_ phase by introducing a sodium carbide flux into the melt. However, this method not only introduces impurities such as sodium, but crystal growth is a slow 1 per day, which keeps the cost high. However, BBO crystals produced by the CZ method are high quality because there is no flux in the melt, and their optical properties such as loss of absorption and conversion efficiency are equal to or better than crystals obtained by the flux method. Moreover, their threshold value for destruction by laser is about 30% greater than crystals produced by the flux method, and they are not easily destroyed even when exposed to high-output lasers. BBO can convert the wavelengths of YAG and argon lasers to one-half and one-fourth, and they can be easily used in compact UV light generators. We can expect that the capability of growing high-quality BBO single crystals at low cost will spur the development of laser UV light generators.
