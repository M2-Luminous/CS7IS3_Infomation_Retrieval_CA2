FR941207-1-00008 FR941207-1-00003 The Commander, Eighth Coast Guard District, will evaluate all communications received and determine a course of final action on this proposal. The proposed regulation may be changed in the light of comments received. Drafting Information The drafters of this regulation are Mr. John Wachter, project officer, and LT Elisa Holland, project attorney. Background and Purpose The Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development has requested the new regulation because vehicular traffic crossing the bridge during the proposed closure periods has increased dramatically during recent years and severe congestion occurs during peak traffic hours. The proposed regulation would allow for the uninterrupted flow of vehicular traffic, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation. Discussion of Proposed Rules The Louisiana State Route 1 vertical lift span bridge across the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, mile 35.6, at Larose, Lafourche Parish, Louisiana, has 35 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the closed to navigation position and 73 feet vertical clearance above mean high water in the open to navigation position. The horizontal clearance is 125 feet. Navigation on the waterway consists of tugs with tows, fishing vessels, sailing vessels, oil field work boats and recreational craft. Data provided by LDOTD show that from June 1993 through May 1994, the number of vessels that passed the bridge during the proposed closure period from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. average 1.3 vessels per day. The number of vessels that passed the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure averaged 1.4 vessels per day. Data show that approximately 658 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. closure period and approximately 1,247 vehicles cross the bridge during the proposed 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. closure period. Regulatory Evaluation This proposal is not a significant regulatory action under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential cost and benefits under section 6(a)(3) of that order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that order. It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) (44 FR 11040; February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this proposal to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10e of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. Small Entities Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq. ), the Coast Guard must consider whether this proposal if adopted, will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. Since the proposed rule also considers the needs of local commercial fishing vessels, the economic impact is expected to be minimal. Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Collection of Information This proposal contains no collection-of-information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ). Federalism Implications This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the proposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. Environment The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under paragraph 2.B.2. of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A ``Categorical Exclusion Determination'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES . List of Subjects in 33 CFR Part 117 Bridges. For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard proposes to amend Part 117 of Title 33, Code of Federal Regulations, as follows: PART 117_DRAWBRIDGE OPERATION REGULATIONS 1. The authority citation from Part 117 continues to read as follows: Authority: 33 U.S.C. 499; 49 CFR 1.46; 33 CFR 1.05&hyph;1(g). 2. Section 117.451 is amended by revising paragraph (c) to read as follows: §117.451 Gulf Intracoastal Waterway. *␣*␣*␣*␣* (c) The draw of the SR1 bridge, mile 35.6, at Larose, shall open on signal; except that, from 7 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. and from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday except Federal holidays, the draw need not be opened for the passage of vessels. *␣*␣*␣*␣* Dated: November 21, 1994.
