[Kwasniewski] I continue to be effective. [Kaszuba] By losing to Prime Minister Pawlak? [Kwasniewski] And what do you think I lost to him? [Kaszuba] You lost influence over the cabinet, as well as [former Finance Minister] Marek Borowski. [Kwasniewski] So you think Pawlak won by letting Borowski go? [Kaszuba] No, I do not, but you lost in a double way. [Kwasniewski] It is not the case that when you have a coalition arrangement, some can win at the expense of others. A coalition arrangement is a system of "joint vessels," it is a concept which is either implemented together, or not. Borowski's resignation constitutes a weakening of the cabinet and it is also a bad message being sent to the public, both in Poland and around the world: In Poland the message is: They are arguing. The message around the world is: A man whose economic ideas were beginning to be widely accepted, leaves under strange circumstances. And that is more of a mistake by the prime minister--it is he who is in charge of the team--than it is mine because I made efforts for Borowski to stay. It is wrong to look at this from the point of who wanted to spite whom. I do not evaluate my efficiency by looking at disputes with Pawlak, Walesa, or anybody else. The efficiency, both mine and the government's, will first of all be measured by [Sejm] approval of the budget in its current form. That budget is hard to accept, but it is rational. Secondly, the efficiency will be measured by the government's presentation over the next few months of its strategies of action regarding the economy, social policies, and international affairs. Third of all, that efficiency will be measured by the world's acceptance of the unique phenomenon of a Democratic Left Alliance-Polish Peasant Party [SLD-PSL] cabinet. And fourth of all, it will be measured by the coalition's consistent behavior, one which would not mean wasting time on fruitless disputes. If these things happen, over the coming weeks or months, then it will turn out I am effective. And it does not make sense to speak in terms of who won over whom. I said from the very beginning that there is no formula of a prime minister without portfolio--one makes decisions and bears responsibility, while the other is the chief of the parliamentary faction. That is why reports on my political death are premature, just as reports about my enormous power and influence were unjustified. [Kaszuba] You have accused the prime minister of having breached the coalition agreement. But the agreement is not any kind of legal document, but a gentlemen's agreement. If there is someone to commit a breach of such an agreement, then you simply refuse to speak to that person anymore. [Kwasniewski] Of course, the Constitution's importance is superior in that regard, but there are different kinds of agreements outside of the Constitution's scope, and every one of these agreements has its own significance. Once we decide to begin breaching these agreements, then we will be constantly dealing will courts and attorneys. The coalition agreement is not a gentlemen's agreement but a very significant document which constitutes this cabinet's basis. The agreement must be respected, and if there are problems with implementing any of its provisions, then there must be a system of early warning, for negotiating, renegotiating, and so forth. [Kaszuba] And what if one of the parties commits a breach of the agreement? [Kwasniewski] Then a few harsh words must be exchanged, some principles must be established, and then one must wait and see what will happen next. Since the situation is new and not everyone has matured enough to go through it, we must wait and see what will happen over the next few weeks. [Kaszuba] Dark clouds have been gathering over SLD for some time now. Immediately after the coalition conflict, a conflict with the president began, which came about in a not very reasonable manner, to put it mildly, also by votes of SLD Sejm deputies. You are responsible for the SLD Deputies' Club. [Kwasniewski] I would not speak of dark clouds, even though some centers of power have initiated measures against the winners of the most recent elections; that is to say, against us. I warned my colleagues many times that after the pleasant part, problems would begin since many groups will not just let us get away with our victory. This applies to the right wing, which failed to get into parliament, and to "Solidarity" which is largely responsible for what happened recently. It would be hard to rely on special consideration on the part of the president. There is the parliamentary opposition which, by definition, cannot favor what we do. And also within PSL itself, as we can recall from the previous term, the positions on SLD were diversified: Some did not hesitate to be in contact with us, whereas some others were looking for support inside the church or in the right-wing camp. The fact that we are being attacked today, is nothing strange. But society can quite clearly see how straightforward the game really is: When "Solidarity" attacks us during a demonstration but at the same time they try to act with restraint toward PSL, then that has political significance. When the president notes that an overwhelming part of our deputies' club voted against his initiative, and at the same time he fails to mention that the PSL Deputies Club was also very predominantly against, then that is also a kind of game. For some politicians who lost, the main task is to set SLD aside again, and to achieve that, they divide the coalition into two parts: Those in PSL with whom they could possibly talk, and those in SLD who must be rejected. This is the reaction to our victory, a slightly delayed reaction. [Kaszuba] You are talking about everyone who dislikes SLD, whereas I was asking about the president. [Kwasniewski] I do not hide the fact that it was a mistake to vote against his initiatives. We did not devote enough time to the issue during a session of the deputies' club; if it were not for that, then a motion for submitting [the presidential initiatives] to the [appropriate Sejm] commission, would have been approved (even though that would not have to mean the end of the issue). Both the President's Office and the president himself were not active enough on that, either. [Kaszuba] The president admitted that he had not expected this kind of response from the Sejm deputies, which he called arrogance. [Kwasniewski] But on the other hand, he must take into account that when one reads the provisions suggested by him relative to a constitutional referendum, it clearly follows from those provisions that a dissolution of the Sejm and the Senate is a result not only of a lost referendum but also--and Article 2 provides that--at the point in time when the referendum's results are announced. True, this could be regarded as a perverse joke by [presidential aide] Minister Falandysz, but many a Sejm deputy thought that the net result of the president's initiative will be that the Sejm's term of office will terminate at the point when the new constitution is adopted. In a way, I can sympathize with the position of those Sejm deputies who thought that. But that does not change the fact that I accept part of the responsibility. This was not a fortunate vote--I voted in favor but the opposite view prevailed. But that is just one side of the coin. The other side is the escalation of events. The Sejm is being spoken of in terms of being disavowed, in terms of being unrepresentative. Some adjectives are being used that we have not heard for a long time: decommunization, file-checking [lustracja], and speaking about Stalin, the idol, which I regard as a very poor joke. The president withdrew his representatives [from the National Assembly's Constitutional Commission], which in my view is not permissible under the current legal system. And finally, a proposal was made--which is completely deprived of any legal basis--that the president will prepare a constitution somewhere on the side. It is not possible to do that. But I perceive the most recent statements coming from the president as a willingness to alleviate the dispute, and I think it is the right thing to do. If there is anything I would expect from the Polish Republic's president, it is that we will be able to act peacefully in 1994, and that we will regard 1994 as a year of hard work, not one of conflicts, election campaigns, and infighting. That would be a beneficial thing for the president, for the cabinet, for the entire state, and for all of us. I am proposing that the year be devoted to talks within the commission and to discussing the Constitution without much publicity or tension. Both the cabinet and the president would each do with their own thing. Poland deserves this kind of year of tranquility. [passage omitted] [Kaszuba] Looking back at the last four months and also taking into account SLD's situation today, do you not think it was a political mistake for you not to be included in the government? [Kwasniewski] No, I do not. [Kaszuba] Do you exclude such a possibility [of joining the cabinet] now that SLD is having problems finding a deputy prime minister? Consider the following scenario: You become a deputy prime minister, Marek Borowski becomes your chief adviser, while the Finance Ministry is under the control of someone who performs the role of the Republic's main accountant. [Kwasniewski] That is not the issue. Not all the problems which we have to solve, lie within governmental structures. These problems also have their parliamentary dimension, an extraparliamentary one, and so forth. Once a decision is made that the chief of the runner-up party in the elections takes control of the government, the presence of a leader of the winning party would be an unnatural thing. That would be a weird situation. I limited my expectations to parliamentary actions and to chairing the Social Democracy of the Polish Republic. That was a completely natural and effective arrangement, with Borowski's participation. [Kaszuba] But is it not strange that while a leader of the winning party remains on the fringes of the government, he tries to influence it, and he participates in conflicts which he wins in some cases but loses in others? [Kwasniewski] I do not win any conflicts; I am just trying to do my job--that is, to assure support for this cabinet in the kind of deputies' club where it is not easy to do so. Compared with other countries, that is not a peculiar situation. [Kaszuba] Perhaps the reason for that is that you can no longer leave the deputies' club since none of the members of parliament, who do not perform state functions, would be able to tame the club? [Kwasniewski] No. [Kaszuba] Despite assurances that the situation both within and around SLD is quite normal, my perception is that it is extremely complicated. Perhaps you took too many responsibilities upon yourself? [Kwasniewski] I am just party chairman, the chairman of the deputies' club, and the [Constitutional] Commission chief. How can one compare that with the responsibilities which Prime Minister Pawlak fulfills and bears so well--prime minister, chairman of the faction, and party chairman? That is much more difficult. You [journalists] have adopted the tactic of fault-finding. And there is indeed some fault but not where you are looking for it. [Kaszuba] What do you mean? [Kwasniewski] The government is going through its first true test, that is the budget. Over the next few months, the government must propose three very major programs which must gain support from the coalition and from society at large. These are: A program of economic strategies, a program of reforms in social policies, and a step-by-step program for joining the European Union. Some of the work has not progressed very much and that is the main problem. [Kaszuba] Are you not afraid of the possible results of the first test you mentioned? The deputies' club has announced that voting discipline will be enforced, but the Sejm deputies, especially those from the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement, may not stand the discipline. If this budget becomes law, SLD can face serious internal problems, and if it is not, then we all can face serious problems. [Kwasniewski] That is why one must choose the lesser problems. First of all, the budget must be maintained--one must understand that. I will reject arguments like: We know there is no money, but the money must be found anyway. Secondly, there is the political dimension: The deputies' club must understand that the parliamentary arrangement has established a coalition which set up the best government it could, and that government in turn prepared the best budget it could. It is a duty of this coalition to support a budget prepared by the coalition's own government. Whoever refuses to understand that, must draw conclusions. These may be: Either: I was wrong, I give up my Sejm seat--that would be the most honest attitude--or: I was wrong but I will wait for the moment, and I will not take part in the club's proceedings. There is also a third possible position: Even if I have doubts, I will always decide in favor of the coalition and the government. Otherwise, the public will have no idea of what we are up to. These principles will be adopted prior to the vote and they will be observed to the full extent. A third issue is that the public must be told that this is not a budget of dreams but one of economic realities; strategic programs must also be proposed. I have been dealing with politics long enough to know that a government that wants to verify its popularity everyday, must lose, whereas a government which simply does its job and then faces elections at the appropriate time--such a government wins. [Kaszuba] When talking about positions which you expect SLD Sejm deputies to take during the budget vote, you did not mention one of them, which may in fact prevail: Namely, that failure by the Sejm to adopt the budget will mean the Sejm's dissolution, whereas a majority of deputies in that club have practically no chance of being reelected for the next term. [Kwasniewski] That is also a valid argument. It is not the main one, but it does make some sense nevertheless.
