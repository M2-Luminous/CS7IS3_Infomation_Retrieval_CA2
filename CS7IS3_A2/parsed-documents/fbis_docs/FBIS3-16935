This was stated by Andrey Vavilov, Russian Federation deputy finance minister. Whereas in 1992-1993 military spending accounted for around 5 percent of GDP, this year it will represent 5.03 percent, A. Vavilov said. Pointing to the need to cut defense spending in the light of Russia's foreign policy commitments, the deputy minister admitted that circumstances do not permit this process to begin. According to A. Vavilov, the Russian troop withdrawal from distant and nearby foreign countries in particular and provision for these servicemen will require very considerable expenditure.
