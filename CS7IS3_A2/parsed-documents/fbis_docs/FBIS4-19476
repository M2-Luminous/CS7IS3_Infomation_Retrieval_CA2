Have you started to enroll these students in the Army? They claim that they are being treated unfairly compared with other university students. [Golhan] We are given the freedom to act within the law. Nowhere does it say that the military service of these students must be deferred. Those students who are not registered in universities where attendance is mandatory do not have the right to have their military service deferred. During the first years of the Open University, however, the National Defense Ministry granted it the same rights as other universities as a privilege, because there was no need for more soldiers. It was the right thing to do. In time, however, our sources shrank. There was a shortage in the number of soldiers. The number of absentee conscripts reached almost 250,000. When the public heard of this situation, some 30,000 youths enrolled in the Army. As of February this year, the deficit figure is below 210,000. Now, we do not want to call up our youths in the Open University while the conscription absentees are showing up to enroll. However, I want to tell you about a survey we conducted. Some 82,000 Open University students had to repeat classes twice. We cannot have that. We did not call them up this term, but we may do so in August or November by calling up those who had to repeat classes more than others. The Open University is not perturbed by students having to repeat classes, because that is its source of revenue. At this stage, we have not called up these students, except for those who came voluntarily. [Ersanel] Do you find this way of calling up students democratic? Will you call all of them up eventually? [Golhan] We are a constitutional state, a state of law. I cannot do otherwise. I hope that we will not have to lean on the students too much and that the shortage will be covered by the absentees' showing up. We need 30,000-40,000 enrollments every conscription period. We cannot take any more anyway. Even if all the 82,000 come, we cannot take them. We do not have the place to put them. The number of conscripts we need now are coming to us. In fact, even if all the absentee conscripts show up, we cannot take them. [Ersanel] Are you considering new measures such as extending the length of military service, payment instead of military service, or extending the scope of discharge? [Golhan] These issues will continue to remain on the agenda for some time. At this stage, however, we are not considering extending the length of military service. I do not know what the conditions will be in the future. We are not considering payment instead of military service at this stage, but we might in the future. It is a matter of time. Let me say one thing: We will eliminate the noncommissioned officers in time. [Ersanel] Is there a change in Turkey's defense concept? [Golhan] Our neighbors are involved in an arms race. They are also trying to get hold of, find, and acquire nuclear weapons. Therefore, we must keep the Turkish Armed Forces at a certain level of power. We hear criticism to our right and to our left. We maintain the same priorities in our defense concept. Our neighbors to the south -- let me not say who they are -- are in the race for nuclear arms. At the moment, they do not have nuclear arms, but they have long-range missiles that can hit Ankara. We must take our measures. [Ersanel] How? [Golhan] We must not lag behind them; that is all I can say. If those who covet our land know that we lack the necessary weaponry, they may become aggressive. Let me say this: Turkey is the most powerful military force in the region, except for the missile issue. Unlike other countries, we do not violate UN resolutions. [Ersanel] Germany displayed a harsh stand in connection with the weapons it gives to Turkey being used in the southeast. How do you view this? [Golhan] The problem is this: We bought some weapons from Russia. They are very similar to the German weapons. Foreign press members who were in the southeast confused the two. They said that the weapons were German-made and made a big noise about it. We received a letter from the German defense minister today in which he thanks us. We are going to buy weapons from Germany on the basis of our defense industry cooperation. He says he will be of assistance. Foreign Minister Kinkel's message is along the same lines. There are many PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] members in Germany. They are friendly with the press, and they have money. It is they who spread the rumor that Turkey is using these weapons. Of course, we must not forget that there will be elections in Germany soon. First, they alleged that we were using the weapons against the Kurdish people in the region. Then they said we should not use them against the PKK. What else do they want? Are there only German weapons in the world? I can use my U.S.-made or Russian-made weapons. [Ersanel] The United States has been talking recently, especially in meetings held in Turkey, about a "political solution" to the Kurdish problem. You participated in those meetings. You held your most recent contact with the Americans in connection with this issue last Thursday. What is this "political solution" mentioned by the United States and, in a way, by the West? [Golhan] Look, until two years ago, we heard the HEP [People's Labor Party] and then the DEP [Democracy Party] deputies talk about a "political and democratic solution." What is this solution? They said there cannot be a solution with military force. All right, what is the solution? They do not say. Behind this solution implied by our friends and certain circles is a separate and independent Kurdish state. The idea of a federation lies behind this political solution. That is the meaning. The Kurds have free elections, free trade, the right to settle and work anywhere in the country. What other rights do they want? These are the rights I have, too. Do people who speak Kurdish have a problem? [Ersanel] Earlier, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Oxman also talked about a political solution. So, is what the U.S. officials mean no different from what you are saying? [Golhan] Yes, what they say is no different from what I am saying. Charles Freeman, assistant U.S. secretary of defense, came to me on Thursday and said: "The PKK is certainly a terrorist organization." He said: "Europe will also realize this one day." [Ersanel] Did he say what he means by a political solution? [Golhan] No. The aim of the political solution is a federation. Let me tell you that frankly.
