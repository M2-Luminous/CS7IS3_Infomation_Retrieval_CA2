Sayfulin; from the "Vesti" newscast] [Text] The prime ministers of Russia and Kazakhstan held a working meeting today. They discussed issues concerning bilateral economic cooperation, dual citizenship, and the use of the Baykonur cosmodrome. It has become known that there will be no obstacles for the citizens of Kazakhstan to receive temporary citizenship in Russia and to change it when they return to Kazakhstan. As for Baykonur, it can be handed over to Russia after signing a lease treaty. The price remains the only point issue. In addition, the prime minister of Kazakhstan said it that was also necessary to resolve ecological problems when using the cosmodrome. Ecological compensation should be defined. As of today, the financing of Baykonur remains the main issue. As for its technical safety, one should not worry about this. Accommodation for families of Russian officers and servicing personnel on Kazakhstan territory will also not pose a problem. [Begin Tereshchenko recording] The programs that are to be implemented on Baykonur demand large investments. Presently, there are not enough of them either from Russia or Kazakhstan. [end recording]
