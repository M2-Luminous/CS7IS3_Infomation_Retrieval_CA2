FR940802-0-00058 FR940802-0-00008 VII. Public Participation In its NPRM for this rule, EPA requested comment on all aspects of the proposal. In addition, EPA specifically invited public comment on the following issues: (1) EPA's statutory authority to promulgate this rule; (2) the extent to which renewable oxygenates would be used in reformulated gasoline absent the proposal; (3) the economic, energy, and crude oil import benefits to the nation resulting from the proposal; (4) any other approaches which could be used to achieve the same objectives; (5) the likelihood that the renewable oxygenate requirement would be met with domestically produced oxygenates absent a requirement to this effect, whether such a requirement would be desirable and legally permissible, and any other suggested approaches to ensure the domestic employment benefits of this program; (6) the climate change aspects of the proposal; (7) the definition of renewable oxygenates; (8) the need for performance-based standards for renewable oxygenates based on fossil energy impact or greenhouse gas emissions; (9) health effects data regarding renewable oxygenates whose use may be encouraged as a result of the program; (10) the appropriate level for the renewable oxygenate requirement, the feasibility of the requirement, lead-time requirements, the need for a phase-in period, and any other supply-related issues; (11) the need and justification for a year-round program in lieu of a summer-only program; (12) the allowance for year-round averaging of renewable oxygenate content; (13) the applicability of the program only to producers of reformulated gasoline rather than including downstream blenders; (14) the enforcement-related provisions; (15) the impact of the program on the already-promulgated reformulated gasoline program, and (16) a petition process to include additional renewable oxygenates. During the comment period and at the January 1994 public hearing, EPA received comments and testimony on various aspects of the proposal from numerous parties such as environmental organizations, states, environmental regulatory associations, corn growers, and farmers, as well as the petroleum, ethanol, and oxygenated fuels industries. The Agency has diligently reviewed and considered all written and oral comments on the renewable oxygenate proposal. For those readers interested in reviewing the comments related to the renewable oxygenate proposal for reformulated gasoline, all comments received by the Agency are located in the EPA Air Docket, Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49 (See `` ADDRESSES ''). All significant comments were considered in revising the provisions in the proposal and/or are responded to in the Regulatory Impact Analysis and Response to Comments document contained in Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;49. VIII. Compliance With Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) of 1980 requires federal agencies to examine the effects of regulations and to identify significant adverse impacts of federal regulations on a substantial number of small entities. Because the RFA does not provide concrete definitions of ``small entity,'' ``significant impact,'' or ``substantial number,'' EPA has established guidelines setting the standards to be used in evaluating impacts on small businesses 28 . For purposes of the renewable oxygenate requirement for reformulated gasoline, a small entity is any business which is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field as defined by SBA regulations under section 3 of the Small Business Act. 28 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Memorandum to Assistant Administrators, ``Compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' EPA Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, 1984. In addition, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Memorandum to Assistant Administrators, ``Agency's Revised Guidelines for Implementing the Regulatory Flexibility Act,'' Office of Policy, Planning, and Evaluation, 1992. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The renewable oxygenate program will secure a market for oxygenate producers while simultaneously allowing refiners flexibility for small refiners to comply with the program's requirements. In addition, EPA decided against applying the renewable oxygenate requirement to downstream oxygenate blenders (except as discussed below), many of which are small entities. As discussed in the proposal, this would have required each blender to maintain at least two sources of oxygenate, one renewable and one not. Such an approach would have proven either uneconomical or to involve significant transaction costs related to averaging and trading. However, today's program will require additional reporting requirements of blenders (beyond the reformulated gasoline requirements). The renewable oxygenate program requires that blenders maintain records on two additional RBOB categories: any renewable oxygenate and renewable ethers. The additional reporting requirements, however, are economically insignificant and will not unduly burden small entities such as blenders.
