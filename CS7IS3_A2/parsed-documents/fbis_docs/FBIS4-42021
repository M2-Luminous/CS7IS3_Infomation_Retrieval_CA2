He said at a news conference in Kiev that quite a few people had voted for him even though he had no access to speak of to state-owned mass media. IF Note: According to the Central Election Commission [CEC], in the first round 9,944,474 people, or 37.72 percent, voted for Leonid Kravchuk and 8,244,844 (31,27 pct) for Leonid Kuchma. They are followed by Aleksandr Moroz (3,437,816, or 13.04 pct), Vladimir Lanovoy (2,455,830, or 9.32 pct), Valeriy Babich (630,392, or 2.39 pct), Ivan Plyushch (341,173, or 1.29 pct) and Petr Talanchuk (142,996, or 0.54 pct). The CEC Chairman Ivan Yemets officially announced Tuesday that runoff elections would be held in which the voters would have a choice between Kravchuk and Kuchma. The exact date will be announced on 30 June. It is expected to be 10 July. Kuchma thought that the large support given him, Moroz and Lanovoy showed that the people wanted change. He advocated evolutionary reform of the economy and expressed his willingness to cooperate with leading economists, in particular Vladimir Lanovoy and Viktor Pinzenik. He confirmed his view that the CIS had to be a common economic space and emphasized, however, that he objected to Ukraine's entry of the ruble zone and to a military alliance in the CIS framework. He made it clear that he wanted only an economic union. Kuchma said that he had found during his election campaign there was no problem of Crimea but Crimea did not trust the Kiev authorities. He said that if he is elected he would do his best to work constructively with parliament and never engage in a tug-of-war for power. In a protest he filed with the Central Election Commission and the Supreme Soviet Presidium Kuchma said that the state-owned mass media had promoted only the case of Leonid Kravchuk in the whole month of June 1994. In particular, even on the election day they urged people to vote for him. This was a flagrant violation of electoral legislation. The supporters of parliament Chairman Aleksandr Moroz will vote for Kuchma in the second round of elections and those who voted for Vasiliy Lanovoy in the first round, for Kravchuk, said Viktor Pinzenik, chairman of the Reform Support Fund. He told INTERFAX that numerous voters would not report to the polling stations at all in the second round. For his part, parliamentary Legislation and Court and Legal System Reform Committee Chairman Sergey Sobolev thought that the supporters of both Moroz and Lanovoy would vote for Kravchuk while Vladimir Grinyov, co-chairman of the Inter-Regional Reform Bloc, believed that every fourth supporter of Lanovoy and three out of every four supporters of Moroz would vote for Kuchma. He assumed that in the second round the turnout would be much lower. Anton Buteyko, head of the president's foreign policy service, thought that the citizens who had voted for Moroz and Lanovoy in the first round would vote for the man who had been president. Sergey Dovgan, chairman of the Peasants Party, thought that 100 percent of Moroz's supporters would vote for Kuchma while Lanovoy's electorate would split down the middle. IF Note: The runoff election will be won by the candidate who wins more than his rival provided that more votes are cast for than against him. In the first round of presidential elections the difference between Kravchuk and Kuchma was 6.5 percent.
