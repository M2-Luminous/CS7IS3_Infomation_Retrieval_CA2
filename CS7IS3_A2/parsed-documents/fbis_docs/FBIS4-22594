However, even during the two years in which negotiations were underway and the republic insisted on its "special position, special status," the leadership had an opportunity to pursue its own economic policy, which could be somewhat different from that of Russia. How fully did the government of Tatarstan take advantage of this opportunity to conduct reforms? Did it not restrict itself to social programs and support for rural areas from the budget, failing to provide conditions for transformations in the agrarian sector? Ravil Muratov, deputy prime minister of the Republic of Tatarstan, answers this and other questions in an interview by an INTERFAX correspondent. [Fazullina] The advantages of the policy of a "soft" entry into a market economy, which Tatarstan has opted for, are obvious. The government has succeeded in somewhat cushioning the shock of a cataclysmic price liberalization and halting a drop in production in the agrarian sector. However, both the programs of targeted social protection and financial infusions for the rural areas were effected at the expense of the budget and oil exports. The current nonpayment crisis, the tax burden, and a decline in world prices for oil call into doubt these traditional sources of financing for the republic. What lies ahead for the economy of Tatarstan? [Muratov] Unfortunately, the government has actually let go of long-term programs while it has focused its attention on social programs and supported the rural areas, i.e. it has fought to survive in an elementary fashion. Independent exports of oil have indeed helped to somewhat contain a complete collapse in the economy. However, relative stability is merely a launching pad for the beginning of reforms, first of all of the financial and tax systems and in the agrarian sector. We were among the first to put into circulation bills of exchange that were to mitigate the nonpayment crisis and the absence of centralized credit resources. However, the extensive use of bills of exchange was hampered by banks, primarily the National Bank: It is more advantageous for it to deal with ringing cash rather than bills of exchange, and to collect a high percentage of profits for the Central Bank of Russia. Enterprises did not receive bills of exchange well, either. We wasted time and an opportunity. Russian banks are introducing bills of exchange now; we must say that they are doing far better than we are. We are beginning to plainly fall behind some regions which develop their programs. Our enterprises are bogged down in the quagmire of nonpayments, but they are persistently clinging to the old pattern for settlements. The government has been forced to allocate billions from the budget for Nizhnekamskneftekhim Joint-Stock Company to pay its debts to Tatneft. However, one enterprise carries on the technological sequence of the other. It is possible to make arrangements with the oilmen for settlements after the finished products of petrochemistry are sold! Alas, each of them prefers to be awash in his own debts. The government embarks on quite costly social programs, which in and of itself is a favorable fact. However, one gets the impression that we do not quite care about forming real sources of funding for them, primarily the budget. Who is going to pay taxes? Enterprises that are indebted to one another? Entrepreneurs who are smothered by the tax press to such a degree that it is time to wind down production? Kolkhozes and sovkhozes that draw subsidies and are unprofitable for the most part? We are wasting the time and the opportunity of conducting reforms with smaller losses. Our rural areas are still unaffected by transformations. The government continues to invest billions in the rural areas by supporting unprofitable farms, whereas it should implement land reform, introduce private ownership of land, as is laid down in the Constitution, and transfer it to those who will be able to operate profitably. However, here [lines missing as received] owner-operated farming. As a result, meat sold by private traders at markets costs as much as state meat in the stores. In the future, it is going to get still worse. Not billions, but rather trillions, of rubles will be needed in the fall when we have to pay for finished products. What kind of budget can bear this? We should encourage those who want to and are capable of managing efficiently rather than support the bankrupt at the expense of the taxpayer. [Fazullina] What stood in the way of the government developing a program for the support of private business in both the rural and urban areas? At present, Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast has no more rights and powers than Tatarstan, but it is precisely its format of agrarian reform that is being proposed as a model. Governor Boris Nemtsov did not seek special powers in the conduct of foreign economic operations; nonetheless, the West is now prepared to invest capital in the economy of the oblast, including the development of small business.... [Muratov] Perhaps it was our conservatism, deliberation, the desire to take a close look at Russian reforms and to avoid mistakes. However, at the same time we allowed our own mistakes to occur by failing to develop a concept of economic development. We talked a lot about supporting small- and medium-size businesses, having failed to take any practical steps at the same time. As early as one year ago, the need was obvious to provide conditions and a system of preferences for the priority development of the business infrastructure--banks, leasing, marketing, and brokerage companies. At present, many small- and medium-size banks are on the brink of bankruptcy, despite the high rates of interest on credit. Can we count on production developing under such circumstances? Can we expect a surge of entrepreneurship as we set excessively high taxes? Can we count on the prompt emergence of a class of medium-size entrepreneurs if in our republic, merchants and businessmen are virtually on a par with criminal elements in public consciousness? The government is not the only one to contribute its share of conservatism. Alas, our parliament is not particularly radical either, as it passes a law forbidding the managers of enterprises to engage in entrepreneurship or proposes to close down commercial stands. And what about the primary accumulation of capital? As far as our independence in foreign economic operations is concerned, so far it has, unfortunately, existed on paper for the most part; we are yet to defend real rights. I will give examples. Recently, exclusive rights to transport and export oil through the port of Odessa were assigned to the Russian company Koneks by a directive of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy of the Russian Federation, notwithstanding the fact that agreements signed with both Russia and Ukraine provide for the free and unhindered movement of freight, including oil, through the territories of both countries, and that Tatarstan has the right to independently engage in foreign economic activities. They are trying to dictate their terms to us nonetheless. Export and import duties are established by the Russian Government. What real guarantees of the repatriation of capital can we give to foreign investors under the circumstances? Moreover, even government programs are being frustrated because of an increase in customs duties; we cannot import telecommunications equipment. I would not like to paint an excessively gloomy picture, but assertions about prosperity in Tatarstan are still far from the truth, even if our indicators are somewhat better than those of our neighbors. We should not give in to the illusion of a better tomorrow if we are virtually standing in place at present. The treaty has been signed; the agreements have been concluded. At present, it is very important to take full advantage of the rights granted to us and to ensure unconditional compliance with all agreements.
