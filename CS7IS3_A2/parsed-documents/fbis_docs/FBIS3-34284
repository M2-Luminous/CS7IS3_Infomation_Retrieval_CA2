FBIS3-34284 "drnes025_n_94013" FBIS-NES-94-025 Document Type:Daily Report 7 Feb 1994 LEBANON Lebanese Forces Denounce Arrests, `Political Repression' NC0202111494 (Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon in Arabic 0545 GMT 2 Feb 94 NC0202111494 (Clandestine) Radio Free Lebanon Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] The repeated detentions of scores of Lebanese Forces [LF] personnel and officials on flimsy grounds and excuses harms the national accord, violates the laws and the Constitution, and disrupts social peace. Because of this and LF's eagerness to place a number of facts before Lebanese officials and the public, the LF would like to ask the state what has become of the accord and understanding agreement. Is the agreement to end the war and begin a new chapter still valid or is there a decision to disregard it? If a decision has been made to retreat on the accord and understanding agreement, who made this decision and in whose interest? The LF reminds everybody that the war in Lebanon is over and that the Lebanese, who have paid dearly for this war, have the right to be treated accordingly by their own state. The state should help them speed up the move toward the peace era instead of giving the impression that it is responsible for continuing the atmosphere of tension, fear, and the painful legacy of the past. The LF would like to ask about the fate of the general amnesty law and wonders if there is a need to create incidents that are mostly fabricated, unsubstantiated, twisted, and erroneously interpreted to serve narrow and cheap political goals? The LF would like to ask the state if what is being applied is a policy of reconciliation or a settling of accounts and the use of brute force? The Lebanese have a right to know from the state who is responsible for undermining the accord and understanding agreement and what are the measures adopted to straighten things out. The LF emphasizes that the way it is being treated reflects a policy that smacks more of political repression than an exercise of authority against a political current that enjoys broad public support. Under this policy, unjust and unreasonable methods are being used, taking advantage of its institutions and agencies. The LF, which has long been calling for the need to turn the page on the past and proceed to build a future, renews the call to renounce negative, malicious, and narrow-minded policies and the settling of accounts and to rise above factional and narrow interests. It calls on the Lebanese state to realize its role and responsibilities in this regard by helping all Lebanese to pursue a positive line instead of acting in a negative manner that runs contrary to laws, charters, constitutions, and norms.
