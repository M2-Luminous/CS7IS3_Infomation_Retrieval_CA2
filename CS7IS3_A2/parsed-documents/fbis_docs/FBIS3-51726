Amorim: "Brazil, Mercosur, and International Commerce"] [Text] We are currently at the doorsteps of a new Mercosur [Common Market of the South] presidential summit, which will meet at a crucial moment for the consolidation of our common market. The occasion seems appropriate to make an analysis of the most recent events that in one way or another affect international trade and Brazil's insertion in the world economic system. Three facts seem particularly important, although in different degrees, from the viewpoint of Brazil's foreign trade: 1) The U.S. Congress' approval of NAFTA and the fact that the agreement became effective on 1 January, 2) the conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT talks after seven years of negotiations, and 3) the negotiations to establish Mercosur, particularly in the area of a common external tariff system. To this we may add President Itamar Franco's proposal during the last Rio Group presidential summit to create a South American Free Trade Area (ALCSA) that would be built around Mercosur and also include, within a 10-year period, Amazon Initiative and Andean Group member countries and Chile. During the 1970's and 1980's we witnessed the consolidation of regionalization processes and the global character of international economic relations resulting from the growing need to reorganize the world economy, widen production scales, broaden markets, and contemplate the new preponderance of technical innovations. In Brazil, these trends coincide with the exhaustion of the imports substitution model and the deterioration of the state financial crisis. The answer to these changes, implemented rather brusquely by the previous government, was to unilaterally liberalize the foreign trade system and reduce the state's presence in economic activities. In the multilateral area, Brazil began to get increasingly involved in the Uruguay round of GATT talks. At the regional level, this emphasis was noticeable in Brazil's increasing economic integration with Argentina and the subsequent incorporation of Paraguay and Uruguay through Mercosur. The implementation of NAFTA shows the U.S.' willingness to liberalize -- even though with limitations -- international trade. Although the discussion involving "trade creation" versus "trade deviation" is complex and not easily given to categorical evaluation, NAFTA should have a positive impact on international trade similar to the impact resulting from the establishment of the European common market. NAFTA's repercussions on Latin America are still subject to different views, but the fact that the impetus of the most protectionist U.S. groups has been contained is encouraging. The implementation of GATT agreements by which developing countries grant Brazil an average tariff reduction of 38 percent will contribute, without a doubt, to ameliorating the effects of eventual trade deviations resulting from the tariff preferences granted Mexico through NAFTA. But that is not the only reason why the implementation of GATT agreements are particularly important for Brazil. The reinforcement of the multilateral trade system is essential to make international economic relations predictable and reduce the margin for sudden implementation of protectionist surges and unilateral decisions by our biggest trade partners. Because of the profile of Brazil's trade structure, which spreads almost evenly throughout all regions of the world, the strengthening of the multilateral system is of great importance to sustaining our internal economic reforms and shoring up efforts to achieve a more competitive insertion in the world economy. In this context, Brazil's interest in a strengthened multilateral trade system should encourage its efforts to consolidate Mercosur and establish a South American Free Trade Area. The liberalization process within Mercosur member countries continues to progress as anticipated. It has resulted in a strong positive impact on trade exchange, which has more than doubled between the four member countries since the signing of the Asuncion Treaty in 1991. Today nearly 13 percent of Brazilian foreign trade involves our three partners (Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay). Brazilian exports to Mercosur countries have almost tripled from 1990 to 1993. The association between companies also has increased and contacts at all levels of society are becoming more frequent, generating the conditions for a true integration. Naturally, this exponential growth of trade flows has created some specific difficulties, which in the case of the proliferation of safeguards and anti-dumping measures can cause serious damage to our trade. They are not unsurmountable differences that cannot be ironed out with a frank and friendly dialogue between the four partners, however. The difficulties encountered in defining a common external tariff system for some products such as digitized capital goods show the need for intense negotiations in the coming months. Our partners should perceive that even though the common market's advantages benefit all, the consolidation of that common market presupposes the preservation of absolute preference margins for some category of products for which it is important to have an integrated market. This is the case of products that still cannot compete on an equal footing with those produced by highly developed countries. Between the goal of promoting the country's competitive insertion in the world economy and renouncing our own industrial growth to sacrificing entire areas, particularly areas involving technologically developed products, there is a distance that cannot be ignored. The Mercosur plan is essentially open and not exclusive. We should be prepared to be, at the right time, in a good negotiating position to talk with other regional groups in this hemisphere or outside it about broadened schemes of trade liberalization. It is essential, therefore, to strengthen the regional base of our insertion into the world by consolidating Mercosur and decisively encouraging the South American Free Trade Area.
