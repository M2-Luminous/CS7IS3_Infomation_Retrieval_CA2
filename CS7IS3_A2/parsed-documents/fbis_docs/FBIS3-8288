The accusation comes at a time when the activity of these services in this breakaway Yugoslav republic, which has recently been made public by Kucan, is being traced back to Jansa's ministry. Commenting on Kucan's statement that para-intelligence services and spies are keeping under surveillance leading Slovenian state officials, prominent citizens and individual reporters and are prepared to liquidate them if necessary, Jansa told LJUBLJANSKI DNEVNIK that the president "probably has in mind the various detective agencies ruled" by members of the State Security Service from the Communist times, "most of whom he knows personally." The agents were officially subordinated to Kucan while he was Slovenia's communist leader, "and are today probably unofficially" subordinated to him, averred Jansa. The defence minister for the first time mentioned that he has received "numerous threats of physical liquidation," but did not elaborate. "Liquidation threats should be taken seriously, especially after the murder of Ivan Kramberger," killed in the finale of the 1992 presidential campaign, said Jansa. The quarrel between Kucan and Jansa, who have traded accusations also in a scandal involving arms smuggling for the interests of Bosnian Moslems, has been joined by the leadership of the United List, the second most influential parliamentary party, which has announced its intention to demand the resignation or recall of Jansa in the ruling coalition next week, on the grounds that "he is unfit for this position of authority."
