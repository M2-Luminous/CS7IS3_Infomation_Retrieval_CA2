One of the hijackers, a man who was injured when police captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed with an imitation pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed woman with him was seized unhurt. The Saudia airline company stated that some 140 Ethiopian passengers who had been freed before police ended the hijack bid were flown Wednesday to Addis Ababa on a special flight. Press reports Wednesday said that the hijackers were illegal immigrants and added that they had a third accomplice who managed to merge with other passengers, but a police spokesman said this was "speculation." [passage omitted] Most of the passengers were Ethiopian Muslims who had been on pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca and whose Saudi visas had expired, diplomatic sources said. A number of them had tried illegally to remain in Saudi Arabia but had been expelled, the sources added. Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya Ofato Alew told AFP that embassy staff had played no part in the negotiations and were not officially informed of the affair. [passage omitted]
