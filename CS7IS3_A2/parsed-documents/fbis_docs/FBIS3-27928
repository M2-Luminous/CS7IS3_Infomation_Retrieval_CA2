This schedule was disclosed by the prime minister at a 31 January meeting of leaders of the government and ruling coalition parties. During the meeting, the prime minister expressed his eagerness to settle the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks which have continued to run into rough sailing, saying, "I intend to make the utmost effort to settle the talks." As for the issue of tax cuts which the United Sates has sought persistently as a means to expand Japan's domestic demand, both the government and the ruling coalition parties will decide on a rough outline for reforming the current tax system by 2 February and the government will announce a new package of stimulus measures on 3 February. These quick moves by the government and the ruling coalition parties reveal their intentions to take steps which could fulfill U.S. expectations of Japan in the macroeconomics field including tax cuts amid a stalemate in the Japan-U.S. negotiations on the microeconomic field including automobile and auto parts. At a meeting with the prime minister at his official residence on 23 January shortly after the rejection of a package of political reform bills in the House of Councilors, U.S. Treasury Secretary Bentsen said in a soft tone: "The income tax reduction is important from the point of expanding Japan's domestic demand. If the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks make little headway prior to the Japan-U.S. summit talks, there would be various moves in the United States to take legal actions." During the meeting, Treasury Secretary Bentsen made one request after another, while mentioning the U.S. Government's expectations on the prime minister. The prime minister undoubtedly felt keenly a grim mood and moves in the United States toward reviving the Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. Speaking at a 26 January news conference, he said, "Mr.Bentsen told me about tough requests." At noon on 31 January, the prime minister spoke by telephone with President Clinton. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura said, "I cannot give details of what leaders of the two countries talked on the telephone." In this way, the telephone conversation between the prime minister and President Clinton has not been made public. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura, however, said, "The President manifested U.S. expectations on Japan for Japan-U.S. economic framework talks and stimulus measures." The President is believed to have made requests for tax cuts and other issues. With the Japan-U.S. summit talks 10 days away, the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks remain deadlocked. While the prime minister has expressed his intention to display his political leadership in order to settle the talks, pessimism is voiced within the government that the settlement of negotiations on automobile and auto parts would be deferred until later. At the present stage, the United States is responding favorably to the prime ministers' policy for changes. Although changes in Japan, which the United States has sought, are things that Japan should do for its own sake, it is not easy for the prime minister to coordinate views of people in the government and the ruling coalition parties. It can be said that the prime minister is sandwiched between the U.S. expectations on Japan and his task of coordinating the views at home.
