The worst fighting is taking place in the Obrecevo region and along the Drina river, between Vitkovici and Foca, where the Muslim units are trying to recapture the positions that they lost. In addition to using all the available arms, the Muslims are also using chemical agents produced in the goldsmithing plant in Vitkovici. The Serbian military sources claim that these agents are produced with the most primitive technology. The Serbian fighters who crushed the strong Muslim offensive from Gorazde, involving some 10,000 well-armed Alija's [Izetbegovic] soldiers, are continuing to rout the Muslim forces from the torched Serbian villages on the right bank of the Drina.
