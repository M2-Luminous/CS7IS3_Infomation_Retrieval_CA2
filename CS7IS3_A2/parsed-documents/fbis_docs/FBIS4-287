FBIS4-287 "drafr067_c_94020" FBIS-AFR-94-067 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA South African Press Review for 7 Apr South African Press Review for 7 Apr MB0704135994 MB0704135994 BFN [Editorial Report] THE CITIZEN State of Emergency To `Clamp' IFP -- Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 4 April in its page-6 editorial finds "something quite cynical" about the imposition of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal. The government previously refused to impose an emergency "because it did not want to frighten off foreign investors. It resorted, instead, to the declaration temporarily of unrest areas. Another reason was that the African National Congress was totally opposed to an emergency, which in the past had been used by the government to suppress its revolutionary activities." Now the ANC is in favor of a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal because "it wishes to see a clamp placed on the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] as a preliminary to toppling Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the last strong Black opponent of the ANC." BUSINESS DAY Two Options for Poll in kwaZulu/Natal -- Referring to the unrest in kwaZulu/Natal and the Independent Electoral Commission report that an election in that province is impossible under the prevailing conditions, Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in English on 7 April mentions two options to resolve this problem. The politicians "can rely on emergency measures to achieve within a couple of days what is needed." But the editorial warns "there are limits to what brute force can achieve." Or the politicians can "begin now looking for a political deal -- starting at tomorrow's four-leader summit." Nevertheless, "it is much too late to finalise a deal before the election. What is required is a preliminary agreement that offers sufficient guarantees to Buthelezi and the electoral process respectively. If agreement is not reached the election must nevertheless go ahead as fully as possible. Only if an agreement is reached can a delay or, preferably, a commitment to repeat the Natal poll, be countenanced." SOWETAN `Brinkmanship' in Natal/kwaZulu -- Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 7 April in a page-8 editorial believes "brinkmanship has been a major feature of pre-election politics." "Perhaps the most serious place where the game is being played is the kwaZulu-Natal area. The situation is so grave that it has already crossed the fine line into becoming a matter of life and death. The type of destruction -- in one case involving the grotesque slaying of a family of 10 -- is becoming routine and highly unacceptable. The question whether the elections must be held or not is part of this disconcerting problem concentrating our minds. The dangers for and against the elections especially in Natal-kwaZulu are extremely high and can be costly." CITY PRESS Natal State of Emergency Welcome -- Johannesburg CITY PRESS in English on 3 April in a page-14 editorial finds it "strange" that there are political parties "who have found it necessary to fault State President F. W. de Klerk's decision to declare a state of emergency in kwaZulu/Natal." "Given the frightening escalation of violence in this region -- particularly in the last two weeks -- what was the government expected to do?" CITY PRESS believes that "as long as the security forces act impartially, drastic measures are the only recourse left for the government if the violence is to be contained." BEELD IFP `Blackmail' To Postpone Election -- Johannesburg BEELD in Afrikaans of 31 March states in a page-12 editorial that the 53 people killed due to the unrest during a Zulu march through the center of Johannesburg "have apparently not shocked IFP leader Mr. Mangosuthu Buthelezi to his political senses. Instead, he has declared that it will now be a fight to the finish between the ANC and the Zulu nation." "One can only remind him that he does not speak for the Zulu nation. He only represents a political faction -- possibly a minority. But that is neither here nor there. What is most worrying is that Mr. Buthelezi says the fight to the finish will take place unless the election is postoned. Surely this is naked blackmail. He expects the country to choose between the election and anarchy. The statements by the IFP that free campaigning will be permitteed in Natal is only lip service. To many observers it has long been clear that the IFP is not an honest boycotter of the election, but an active destroyer." The IFP must realise that "if it speaks of the final solution, the government and the rest of South Africa also have final plans ready. And this will not cost only 53 lives...The election cannot be postoned, so those who want to drive the country to a final struggle must know that it will lead to a tremendous counterreaction. Can anyone reconcile that with a Christian conscience?" ANC Above Law in Weapons Search -- In his column on page 13 of the same issue of BEELD, columnist Lood writes: "Reports that the police were unable to search the ANC headquarters in Shell House on Tuesday on account of political intervention are disturbing. On Monday the ANC admitted in a written statement that ANC security personnel had fired on a group of marchers and killed or injured people. It may not have been necessary, as reported, to commandeer 400 policemen for the search, but when people break the law or are responsible for somebody's death, the least that can be expected is that a thorough search be made -- even inside the ANC headquarters, if necessary. Nothing and no one ought to be above the law."
