Touching on the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms development, Ozawa said: "In Japan, no regulations on crisis management in an emergency are stipulated in any laws, including the constitution. If something unexpected should take place, administrative work will completely fail to function." Thus, he stressed his idea that the government should improve its crisis management system legally by taking such measures as legislation of an emergency bill. Citing as an allegory, Ozawa pointed out: "Suppose all the cabinet members were killed by bombs dropped on the prime minister's official residence during a cabinet meeting, the succeeding prime minister could only be elected if the Diet was in session. However, there are no regulations whatsoever as to what should be done if the Diet was in recess." Then, he added: "An emergency could possibly arise even in a natural disaster."
