In remarks to the MENA correspondent in Tunis, Dr. 'Ashrawi said that she will not accept any position in the National Authority, although Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat has picked her up to be a member of the Council and offered her the information portfolio. She explained that this is because she has obligations to an independent Palestinian body working for Palestinian citizens' rights, which chose her to be its chairman. Dr. 'Ashrawi pointed out that despite her refusal to join the Council, she attended meetings held by the Council in the past two days because she had been invited to them. She also wanted to participate in drafting the Palestinian National Authority's program so that it would be adequate, comprehensive, democratic, just, and allow for accountability to and revision by the legislative bodies, she added. She hoped that all articles of the Palestinian National Authority's program would be implemented and adhered to by every one.
