International public opinion, he said, which can recognize justice, will judge this move. The KKE [Greek Communist Party] described the Turkish court's decision to dissolve the Democratic Party and remove 13 deputies from office as illegal and an escalation of the persecution of the Kurdish people. The Coalition of the Left and Progress protested the Turkish move as a brutal violation of basic democratic freedoms. It also stressed that geopolitical expediencies lead the powerful countries to take hypocritical stances.
