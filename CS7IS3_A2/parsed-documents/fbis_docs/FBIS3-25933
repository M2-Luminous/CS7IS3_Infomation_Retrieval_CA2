According to local officials, there are now more than 4,200 farmers' markets in rural Hubei. It is estimated that about 10 billion yuan of commodities are traded there in a year. The market network in rural areas of the province is formed with farmers' markets as the basis, and with specialized and wholesale markets of various kinds as the backbone. Markets of essential production factors have also begun to emerge. In Jingzhou Prefecture, dubbed a "grain and cotton storehouse," farmers used to have great difficulty in selling their farm products. But now, to the relief of local farmers, various kinds of grain wholesale markets, involving 20,000 individual traders, are doing brisk businesses of farm products through major grain and edible oil wholesale markets in the seats of 11 counties and cities, and 41 wholesale offices across 28 provinces, with one billion kg of grain, edible oil and related products being marketed a year. Many farmers have become prosperous through farmers' markets. For instance, the beancurd market at Shipai township, Zhongxiang city has got famous. The existence of the market not only enriches the vegetable baskets of local residents, but also helps to increase the income of nearby farmers. Now 50 percent of farmers from rural areas not far from the beancurd market are engaged in production and marketing of bean products. Their annual per capita income has reached 1,000 yuan. The quick development of various specialized markets and wholesale markets has played a positive role in the overall economic development of different localities, said the officials. The provincial government has been working out more rules and regulations to guide markets of various kinds in the province to develop healthily.
