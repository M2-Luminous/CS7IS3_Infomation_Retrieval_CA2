With the intensification of clashes between the Mexican Armed Forces and the rebel Zapatist National Liberation Army (EZLN) near dozens of civilian towns, thousands of residents are without basic services and have fled their homes to save their lives. Almost 1,000 peasants and Indians have been caught in the middle of the Air Force bombardment of the mountainous San Cristobal de las Casas area and in the midst of crossfires that have destroyed homes and crops. In response to complaints by civilians, the Mexican Army has reiterated that its forces have not attacked civilian towns and pledged not to do so. The government, church, and civilian organizations are setting up shelters for the Indians and peasants who have fled their homes because of the bombings. Thus far two shelters have been established in towns far from San Cristobal de las Casas and near neighboring Tabasco State, where civilians seeking help will be temporarily housed and their safety against rebel attacks guaranteed. It is expected that between today and tomorrow another two shelters will be opened. Additionally, corn, beans, rice, sugar, oil, powdered milk, and soup concentrate are being distributed among the most severely affected civilians. State-owned Mexican Petroleum expects to send approximately 20 tons of supplies to the area between today and tomorrow. Hundreds of EZLN members have focused on occupying small towns in southern Chiapas to threaten the authorities and proclaim fragile victories over the soldiers; in the process, they have cut off sewage services and the supply of gas, power, and potable water. Dozens of tanker trucks have been sent from Mexico City with 50,000 liters of potable water to prevent the spread of gastrointestinal diseases among the civilian population. As a result of the shortage of domestic gas, the operation of a mobile plant has been authorized in the war zone to normalize the supply of fuel and to avoid further problems for the civilian population. Meanwhile, the Institute of Social Security and Services for Government Workers (ISSSTE) has sent ambulances, several tons of surgical equipment, analgesics, antidiarrhetics, plasma expanders, and first aid material. It is expected that the ISSSTE and other medical institutions will continue to send medicine, vaccines against typhoid fever and tetanus, oral serum, antibiotics, and other first aid material. Meanwhile, the National Defense Secretariat (SDN) reiterated today in a press communique that the Armed Forces have not staged any attacks whatsoever on civilian targets. "The SDN has paid special attention to the protection of the civilian population and respect for human rights during the course of the operations under way in the area," the communique asserts. The communique also states that during combat on Thursday one soldier was killed and eight were seriously wounded. The SDN has officially announced that almost 100 people have been killed in the clashes, including soldiers, rebels and civilians, but Red Cross reports indicate that the bodies of at least 190 rebels have been picked up from the streets.
