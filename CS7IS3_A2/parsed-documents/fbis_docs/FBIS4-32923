"Robbery was not the motive for the crime because none of his personal possessions were taken. He was attacked by three men," Elsie Monge, president of the Ecumenical Human Rights Committee (CEDHU), told EFE. Garbarz attended the annual meeting of the Ecuadoran chapter of the AI in Cuenca last week. He was visiting Quito at the time of the attack. Last night Garbarz flew to London where the AI headquarters are located. Elsie Monge said that "while in Cuenca and Quito, the AI official addressed the issues of detained and missing people, difficulties in recognizing the status of refugees, and systematic torture in Ecuador." According to statements made by Garbarz, on Sunday he was attacked by three well-dressed and armed men who stepped out of a vehicle "and began hitting and insulting me without any explanation, inflicting multiple wounds and contusions, and leaving me lying unconscious on the street." A communique issued by some 20 Ecuadoran human rights and church organizations stresses that "this attack is an attempt to stop the work being done to denounce the violations being committed in Ecuador and to frighten human rights organizations because of these organization's actions in the defense of the victims of institutional violence."
