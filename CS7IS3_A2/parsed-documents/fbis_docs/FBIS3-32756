Lage Davila arrived in Santa Fe de Bogota on Wednesday when he held his first meeting with President Cesar Gaviria, Foreign Minister Nohemi Sanin, and other senior officials of Colombia's economic sector. Today he referred to the statement by a lieutenant of Pablo Escobar who pointed to Castro as an alleged participant in the drug trafficking of the Medellin cocaine cartel's gunned-down capo. Lage said that the discovery of Escobar's secret documents and tapes, which were confiscated by the authorities following his death in Medellin on 2 December and in which Raul Castro is accused of being an accomplice of drug trafficking, "is an offense to Cuba." Escobar's secret documents were revealed on Monday by the QAP television newscast. QAP aired a cassette in which Escobar's lieutenant, known as David, accused the Cuban president's brother of being an accomplice by having cooperated in covering up drug-trafficking operations. Lage Davila reiterated today that Raul Castro "enjoys great prestige and affection from the Cuban people" and he indicated that such accusations might be the work of "manipulation by the enemies of the revolution" who have tried to implicate the island in the scourge of drug trafficking. He emphasized that "the Cuban revolution has maintained unyielding ethical and moral values throughout its history. Neither drug trafficking nor corruption, that is why we do not have the least concern with that," he stressed. During his visit to Santa Fe de Bogota, the Cuban Council of State vice president also held meetings with Agriculture Minister Jose Ocampo and directors of the National Planning Department. Today, he will hold meetings with Foreign Trade Minister Juan Manuel Santos, Health Minister Juan Luis Londono, and Economic Development Minister Mauricio Cardenas. At the Colombian Foreign Ministry, he will analyze the documents on the composition of the joint Colombian-Cuban commission, the creation of which will be signed in Havana between 16 and 18 February. Lage Davila, who returns to Cuba tonight, explained that with the opening to foreign capital, there are no restrictions on investment, especially in areas in which infrastructure already exists and good results can be obtained in the short term. He stressed that in Colombia's specific case, tourism and the pharmaceutical industry open doors to new sectors susceptible to awakening interest among Colombian-Cuban businessmen. Regarding Cuba's foreign debt to Colombia, he said it will be canceled gradually with Cuban pharmaceutical exports. He said Cuba is looking toward the Caribbean and Latin America, where it is seeking to diversify the offer of Cuban products. He also said his country is ready for more difficult moments as a result of the U.S. blockade. Cuba and Colombia renewed diplomatic relations in October after a more than 12-year suspension. The Colombian Government of then President Julio Cesar Turbay Ayala had broken relations after it was reported that the Cuban Government was lending training and support to the Colombian guerrillas.
