The further defection of leading grassroots CP members such as mayors and management committee chairmen has laid waste plans by the CP and AVF to exploit their control over 80 rural towns to hinder change and disrupt the elections. The 36-member CP parliamentary caucus has been decimated by the decision by nine of its members to fight an election under the Freedom Front banner. Its numbers are likely to dwindle further with the resignation from active politics after the election of seven members who are getting old or disillusioned with politics. [passage omitted] Those likely to retire include frontbench finance spokesman Cas Uys, Willie van der Merwe, Piet de la Rey and Daan Du Plessis. In addition to the MPs, General Viljoen also persuaded more than 150 leading grassroots members of the CP to join him in contesting the elections. They include mayors, councillors and businessmen who were the backbone of the CP in terms of orgnaisation and raising funds. [passage omitted]
