The repayments of the debt are to last 30 years. They will not exceed $400 million a year. During the first five years, the repayments will be lower and will increase after 2009, when the servicing of debts owed to governments of creditor countries assembled in the Paris Club is to come to an end. The agreement embraces all of the constituent parts of the debt: long- and medium-term credits, outstanding interest, and the short-term revolving credit. [Correspondent Krystyna Koziol] The agreement with the London Club on a reduction of our debt, negotiated by Poland during the night, is a very important event for Poland, said Prime Minister Waldemar Pawlak at a news conference devoted to this matter and held at the Office of the Council of Ministers. Several governments worked to achieve this success, as well as many politicians and experts, added the prime minister. He stressed that the agreement with the London Club brought to an end the restructuring process of our foreign debt. This event, said the prime minister, will have a significant influence on our economic situation. Acting Finance Minister Henryk Chmielak stressed that, in negotiations with our creditors associated in the London Club, we achieved the goals we had set ourselves: We had lowered the costs of servicing of our debt, adjusting them to our capabilities. And the second important goal achieved was a reduction of our debt, comparable to that granted us by the Paris Club. The results of the negotiated agreement, emphasized Minister Chmielak, are fully satisfactory. With this agreement, we have achieved a full normalization of our financial relations with the West. This is a sign for Western investors that investing in Poland is growing more attractive. Deputy Finance Minister Krzysztof Krowacki, government plenipotentiary in talks with banks, underlined that the repayments of the debt were to take 30 years and would not exceed $400 million per year. In many regards, said Minister Krowacki, the main negotiator of the agreement, we have obtained better conditions than those we received from the Paris Club. The agreement that this reduction would also apply to outstanding interest is without precedent, he added. And one more thing: Until now, because of our debt to the London Club, our daily interest grew to the tune of $2 million. From 20 March, on the basis of the agreement, this growth will decrease by 45 percent.
