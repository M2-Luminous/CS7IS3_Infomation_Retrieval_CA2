Considering past experience of such events, they were amazingly calm and businesslike. According to Anatoliy Chubays' report, the major results of check privatization were the creation of a major stratum of private owners (around 40 million) and a stock market, as well as a new -- to us, that is -- investment institution: investment funds, of which there are now more than 650. He spent a further hour answering numerous deputies' questions, practically none of them aggressive or angry, surprisingly enough. Now were there any quesitons of this kind during the discussion of the results. The tranquil atmosphere in the hall was surprising also because the substantial file of materials prepared for the hearings, weighing in at 1.5 kg, included some explosive findings by deputies' groups, accusing the Committee for the Management of State Property of all manner of mortal sins. For instance, the "Russian Way" ["Rossiyskiy Put"] deputies' group, headed by I. Anichkin and S. Baburin, finds that the current privatization "contains the roots of a speculative, mafia, criminal economy," "robs working people, contains the roots of a civil war and possible return to totalitarianism," and so on. While Mr. Zhirinovskiy, on behalf of the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia], in his typically forthright manner, simply prposed that an audit be carried out and that criminal actions be taken against the privatizers. But these charges were totally absent from the speeches at the hearings, indeed there was no political debate at all -- according to one deputy, the discussion was not about "political economy and not about economic policy." But the hearings have not ended and will be continued next week. Maybe the aggressively minded section of the corps of deputies intends to try to obstruct privatization then. Evidently believing there was no possibility of a political scandal, some deputies started to drift away as soon as the discussion began. By the end of the hearings you had the chronic disease of the former parliament -- only around one-fourth of those who had originally assembled were still present. I put the following question to Anatoliy Chubays after the parliamentary hearings: How do you explain the entirely good-natured and calm tone of the speeches today? "Perhaps it is a good thing that today's discussion was not at the level of hysterics and hurling of vouchers," Anatoliy Borisevich replied. Incidentally, a whole series of speeches, perhaps not very shrill or flashy, was substantive and contained rather significant new elements. There were speakers today who are participating responsibly in privatization. What, for example, does the check fund indicate? "We want to be actively engaged in long-term investments and we cannot do that for one reason or another." Look, a structure has emerged, which demands that deputies make it possible to engage in long-term investments -- it is an entirely new situation in the real Russian market. There were plenty of moments of this kind. Let us pray that the second part of the discussion is as substantive and without any hysterics... "And are they to be expected, do you think?" "Well, those who were preparing certain recommendations have not gone away. I think they will come to the next hearings revitalized. I am well aware that serious preparations are still going on. Nothing happened, because the atmosphere in the hall was wrong. Certain young deputies simply lacked the experience of political intrigues. I expect there will be statements by political parties about what I have lovingly stashed away in my own briefcase, about my responsibility for the disintegration of Russia, and so on. Let us draw any conclusions about how aggressive parliament is when the hearings are over..."
