He told this to Interfax at the end of the talks he conducted in Beijing as a member of a Russian Government delegation that accompanied Premier Viktor Chernomyrdin in his official visit to China. Kokoshin explained that the systems of arms available in China today had been patterned on Soviet weapon designs. He reported that a contract to sell 26 SU-27 war planes to China was already being implemented. He described SU-27 as a "good machine, which will apparently be in service until 2020-2025, under conditions of essential modernization." He added that there were plans to equip this fighter plane with new on-board arms. He said that his negotiating partner in Beijing was General Liu Huangquing, a vice-chairman of China's Central Military Council. In Kokoshin's assessment, "military cooperation has been going well with close contacts between border military districts and extensive delegation exchanges." He revealed that the Chinese defense minister is to visit Moscow soon. Chinese servicemen are expected at Russian military academies, and Russian Army officers are to undergo training in China.
