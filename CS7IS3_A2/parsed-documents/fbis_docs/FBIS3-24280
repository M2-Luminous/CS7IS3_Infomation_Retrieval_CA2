The reason for this is worth seeking in Vladimir Resin's work history, which is associated with work in Ukraine, Armenia, the Arctic and Siberia. And in the fact that Moscow's builders have always been in the public eye, using the most advanced technologies of civil construction. Some consider Resin, who has spent nearly 30 years on erecting new buildings, to be a person who is one of Russia's 10 most influential people, while others try to discern in him the features of a "moss-covered" conservative party member. But, both critics and well-wishers agree on one thing -- the chief Moscow builder possesses a high level of professionalism. How is a professional supposed to work under the conditions of economic instability? How are Moscow builders living today? Vladimir Resin reflects on this in a conversation with a TRUD correspondent. [Ursov] Vladimir Iosifovich, in my opinion, you could easily be retrained as a specialist on the history of domestic construction. [Resin] I think is is a bit early to make me into a chronical-writing patriarch. If only because I firmly believe that the history and the best traditions of Russian and Moscow builders are far from finished, even though we are experiencing times which are not the best. I began as a mining foreman in Ukraine and worked at large industrial construction projects in the Arctic and in many other regions, until I was transferred in 1965 to Moscow, my native city. So I had plenty of opportunities to study construction under the administrative-command system. Then builders were always the last in line. Considered valuable were the skill to "dislodge" resources from Gosplan [State Planning Committee], a loud voice and the ability to "berate" subordinates at a work-progress meeting. But there was also another thing: participation in the construction of the most complicated technological complexes forged the highest level of professionalism, while working under the most difficult conditions taught them to find a common language with people and to organize them, managing collectives which were extremely complex in their composition. It is likely that this is why we, figuratively speaking, the "directors of the sixties," easily converse with one another, understanding our conversation partner's meaning at once. And conversely: I stumble on some misunderstanding while communicating with undoubtedly gifted economists-theoreticians. But it is correct to say that construction is an industry which is geared to the maximum extent to the market and, after all, we "produce" an end product -- industrial projects and housing, which is one of the most important components of human existence. This is why I can say that it has become both harder and easier for the builders to work under the market. Harder because, previously, the customers courted the builders as one would a fastidious fiancee. We had a specific selection -- those for whom we would build and those who would have to wait. But now it is we who "seduce" the customer -- provided he pays cash. But, after all, the opportunities to earn a living have emerged! Here is an example: in Moscow, the turnover of personnel in contracting organizations has been reduced to almost zero. Very first-rate specialists, 75,000 people, who were divided into cooperatives at first and who have now returned to the normal construction subdivisions. People have begun to value a job and, consequently, construction quality has risen and labor productivity is increasing. Incidentally, the so-called problem of "limiters," thanks to whom Moscow was built, disappeared. I am, after all, also a unique kind of "limiter," just like many of the highest leaders. We managed to retain in Moscow skilled contract collectives. Thanks to this, it was possible to avoid a calamitous drop in production volumes, as happened, for example, in machine building. [Ursov] These words should be heard by the hundreds of thousands of ordinary Muscovites who are not burdened by surpluses of money. I have repeatedly encountered opinions which go something like this: "so, under the communists, construction and development flourished, but these democrats are building nothing and just speculating with finished buildings." And, in point of fact, nothing like large-scale construction projects has been noted in Moscow. [Resin] Perhaps the mass media are at fault in this matter? After all, this is how it was previously: when a housing area was built, there were reports in the central and Moscow newspapers. Now, however, journalists very frequently, in my opinion, prefer to write about chopped-off heads. Or about financial frauds. The themes, of course, are also not without interest. But I follow the rule: it is better to be a conservative in one's youth than a radical in one's old age. And it is more interesting to me to read about a working person, about how, all the same, the country is growing richer and how, for example, the market is helping to increase the exchanges of new housing. [Ursov] And just what do you mean? [Resin] Of course, if a comparison is made with 1984, the scope of construction in Moscow has been curtailed somewhat. But, in the period of the last 3 years, we have been steadily delivering to the city's inhabitants 3 million square meters of housing each year. This, take note, is a record in Russia. Everywhere, the pace of social and housing construction has fallen sharply. In St. Petersburg, in particular, it has been curtailed by a factor of 2 or 3. But Moscow is building. Look, the entire center is being renovated. Gertsen, Ogarev and Myasnitskaya streets are covered with scaffolding. Here are the figures: the overall volume of contract work in 1993 amounted to 910 billion rubles. This is 100.2 percent of the 1992 amount in comparable prices and labor productivity has increased by 5 percent. We have built 26 schools, 30 kindergartens, 12 polyclinics, 4 hospitals and 25 police stations -- all the figures exceed the 1992 level. Among the unique "piecework" construction projects are Victory Monument on Poklonnaya Gora, the Palace of Justice, the "Palace Hotel," the theater on Pokrovka and a museum for private collections. But a new ZIL cardan-shaft plant? And a dozen other large industrial construction projects? All these are here. The skepticism of the people can be understood: still fresh in their memories are the promises of the numerous radical democrats who were elected to the Moscow council on slogans which were bolshevistic-utopian, so to speak: for everyone -- free housing, which we will take away from the party members, etc. The worst sort of unprofessionalism is when it is in power. Currently, we must "shovel out" the promises of that first "Gorbachevian" wave of "democrats," which, as I see it, gave the impetus to the processes of the unjustified destruction of the administrative [management] system. [Ursov] The figures you have cited are unquestionably gratifying. Especially with respect to housing construction. I am just afraid that they will gladden only those few people who are capable of laying out more than 10,000 dollars for an apartment. [Resin] We will try to investigate. Previously, the state budget in one form or another basically paid for housing construction. How many, where and what apartments were to be built was decided on a centralized basis, although Moscow had a lot of freedom in the selection of priorities. Now, a redistribution of funds has occurred: the federal and local budgets are no longer so all-encompassing and powerful and an enormous amount of financial and credit resources is concentrated in non-state banks and commercial structures. It is clear that they are inclined to use these funds at their own discretion and it will not be possible to "dislodge" them with a stick for the construction of municipal housing. What possibilities does the Moscow government have, however slim, for moving ahead, so that the people who have entrusted their futures to the Moscow leaders to a great extent do not become disappointed in them? We are selling at auction 1.5 million "squares" of housing and the obtained funds are going for free apartments. We are transferring the long-term leasing rights to private residences in the center on the condition that they be renovated based on the principle: half of the housing goes to home-building businessmen and half goes into the municipal fund. Based on the same criteria, we are granting the right to construct new housing. In my opinion, if some entrepreneurs manage to accumulate enough money, then they can look after the remaining, larger part of society, ordinary workers, engineers and pensioners, thanks to whose labor the main portion of public wealth has been and is being created. Especially since the smart entrepreneurs understand this and are doing it willingly. The people waiting on the lists are receiving a million square meters of housing annually as a consequence of this policy of the Moscow authorities. And this is approximately 12,000-15,000 apartments. This is not socialist leveling; rather, this is a normal approach for our country, where collectivist principles, compassion for one's neighbor and the feeling of a human community are traditionally strong.
