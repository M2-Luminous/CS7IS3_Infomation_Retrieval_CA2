FR940325-0-00111 FR940325-0-00017 Friday March 25, 1994 Part IV Department of Education 34 CFR Part 219 Assistance for School Expenditures and Construction in Cases of Certain Disasters; Final Rule and Notice Federal Register ␣/␣Vol. 59, No. 58␣/␣Friday, March 25, 1994␣/␣Rules and Regulations DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 34 CFR Part 219 RIN 1810&hyph;AA71 Assistance for School Expenditures and Construction in Cases of Certain Disasters AGENCY: Department of Education. ACTION: Final regulations. SUMMARY: The Secretary amends the regulations governing the Impact Aid disaster assistance program. These final regulations are needed to extend the deadline for local educational agencies (LEAs) affected by a specific Presidentially-declared disaster to apply for funds, through their State educational agencies (SEAs), beyond the usual 90-day period after publication of a Presidential disaster declaration or amendment to a declaration. EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations take effect either May 9, 1994 or later if the Congress takes certain adjournments. If you want to know the effective date of these regulations, call or write the Department of Education contact person. A document announcing the effective date will be published in the Federal Register . FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Frank Delia, Impact Aid Programs, U.S. Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20202&hyph;6244. Telephone: (202) 260&hyph;3893. Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the TDD number at (202) 205&hyph;5516. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Under the current statutory and regulatory provisions of Public Law 81&hyph;874 (the Impact Aid statute), the Secretary provides section 7(a) assistance to eligible LEAs that have increased operating costs or reduced revenue as a result of a Presidentially-declared disaster. Under §219.21 of the current regulations, an LEA must submit its application for section 7(a) disaster assistance to its SEA and ensure that the SEA certifies and transmits the application to the Secretary of Education. The application must be transmitted by the SEA on or before 90 days after the publication of a notice in the Federal Register that the President has declared a major disaster and that the county in which the LEA is located is eligible for public assistance. In certain disasters, such as the midwestern floods of 1993, a number of areas are affected over a span of several weeks or months, with multiple counties in several States being declared eligible for public assistance at different times. This results in multiple declarations of disaster, multiple dates for the submission of applications, and possible confusion about the applicable deadlines, even within a given State. Consequently, certain LEAs and SEAs may be unable to determine accurately the appropriate deadline and fail to file timely applications with the Department. In recognition of the possible confusion that disasters of this type may cause, the Secretary amends the regulations to allow for additional time for filing or other ways to set the deadlines in particular disasters. All other statutory and regulatory criteria regarding section 7(a) disaster assistance remain in effect.
