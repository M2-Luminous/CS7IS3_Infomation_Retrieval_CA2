What were its principal objectives and what results have been achieved? [Roveri] The principal objective was that of enabling the national manufacturing industry and services sector to dispose of new technologies necessary for the development of broadband communications and consequently of competing in this sector at international level, by taking into account the development of the country and the strategic choices at European level. Second, to promote the training, in a highly innovative environment, of highly qualified technical personnel by having researchers from various fields and disciplines participate in a wide-ranging program. The results achieved on both fronts have been satisfactory. [RICERCA & INNOVAZIONE] In your opinion what are the advantages of passing from N-ISDN (narrowband-integratd services digital network) to B-ISDN (broadband-integrated services digital network)? [Roveri] Broadband ISDN definitely has more potential compared to Narrowband ISDN: switching communications for high-speed video and data links (over 100 Mbit/sec), data communications without connections to connect local area networks (LAN) and high-speed workstations, multimedia voice, image, and data communications, and point-multipoint calls in interactive and distributed communications services. As for the ATM (asynchronous tranfer mode), it will be possible to use this both as an interface for access to B-ISDN and in the internal network section. ATM is the final result of 10 years of studies into new ways of transferring information, with B-ISDN viewed as a universal transport structure that is independent of any particular type of communication offered. [RICERCA & INNOVAZIONE] Professor Roveri, which are the new horizons in the world of telecommunications? [Roveri] The 1990's will surely be characterized by an accentuated internationalization of political, economic, and social relations that will lead to an increase in user needs. The producers will try to conquer new markets by offering goods and services of increasingly higher quality but at ever more competitive prices. I think that the future of telecommunications is directed toward the creation of a "personalized," reality that meets the needs of the single person rather than the mass. A sharp rise in the demand for mobile sevices can be foreseen, services that guarantee that "ubiquity" that permits the user to maintain his own personalization whatever the terminal. This means that the user-terminal relationship, which is still intrinsic in the current land radio mobile service, will be broken. The supply of such services requires a closer interaction between fixed network infrastructures and primarily with the intelligent network: One can imagine a scene where all the terminals will be mobile, without wires, and connected via radio to an antenna positioned nearby, which in turn is in contact via optical fibers with a telecommunications center where the signals will be processed. [RICERCA & INNOVAZIONE] What therefore, are the new research needs of this sector? [Roveri] The hypothesis of a CNR [National Research Council] Targeted Project for Personalized Communications comes under the framework of a series of specific research programs currently being defined. The study of the research topics on personalized communications can permit, at a national level, an important participation in research acitivities at international level. In particular, at European level, these topics will form an important objective in the EC's Fourth Framwork Program, which is currently being drawn up. This indicates that even within the framework of strategies directed toward ensuring national industry a competitive role in the sector, the country will draw obvious advantages from undertaking a research project that focuses on personalized communications. But at the same time it highlights the need for a decision to be made as soon as possible.
