According to statistics, Tibet approved 41 co-operation projects with other parts of China and overseas countries and regions last year, introducing more than 100 million yuan (about 11.5 million U.S. dollars) in contractual investment. Officials said that the projects are mainly in the sectors of communications, transportation, light industry, textiles, machinery, electronics, commerce and trade. Last year, Tibet also received a total of 40 million U.S. dollars in loans from the United Nations, foreign governments and civilian organizations for some 30 of its development projects. The autonomous region's foreign trade hit a record 100 million U.S. dollars-worth in 1993. The officials said that Tibet has in recent years set up a group of showcase enterprises in coastal areas, such as Hainan Province and Tianjin and Shenzhen cities, in a bid to get aboard the country's bandwagon of economic take-off. The region has meanwhile launched a campaign to open up and expand economic and trade relations with neighboring countries. It has promulgated a set of policies to attract and regulate foreign investment. Starting in 1992, investors from Hong Kong, the United States, Japan, Germany, Nepal and Malaysia have flocked to this once- neglected but promising region in southwest China. The officials said that some of the projects have gone into production and begun showing profits, while others are still under construction. They said that more than 20 of China's provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have established economic ties with Tibet, pouring in more than 100 million yuan (about 11.5 million U.S. dollars) every year. In addition, they have set up economic entities in Tibet. Experts say that the ever-increasing ties between Tibet and the rest of the country as well as the outside world has in part eased a decades-long fund shortage and introduced technology, management and information, which, in turn, have pumped vigor into the Tibetan economy.
