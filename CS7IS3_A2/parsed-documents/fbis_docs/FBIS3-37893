Ryabchikov: "Parties Prepared To Help President"] [Text] President Yuriy Meshkov dedicated last Saturday to talks with leaders of officially registered parties. During the course of the discussions, they clarified their positions and their attitudes toward the president's program for transformations in the republic, and they explained what help they needed. The leaders of the parties, including the PEVK [expansion unknown] and Ukrainian parties, declared their readiness to contribute to the implementation of the economic reforms. "The meeting took place in a constructive setting," said the deputy chairman of the Agrarian Party, Mikhail Frolov. "We are in favor of social justice for the peasantry and granting them the benefits necessary for the advancement of agriculture. The president's views coincide with ours here." "We came to the meeting with a package of proposals," said the chairman of the Party of Social Guarantees, Yefim Fiks, "and in turn we received a proposal from the president to prepare draft edicts for them." Participants in the meeting spoke of the need to adopt a joint statement of all political forces of the republic in support of the president's actions. Commenting on the results of the talks, the president's adviser for communications with parties and public organizations, Sergey Nikulin, noted that Yuriy Meshkov asked the participants in the meetings to prepare proposals for candidates for vacancies in all structures of state power. The consolidation, Nikulin thinks, will make it possible to create a powerful bloc supporting the president's policy in the new parliament. This will be a parliament of a new quality, he emphasized.
