The Mexican Army's attack was launched from the region of Maria Auxiliadora hill, approximately 8 km southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas, where clashes between the Armed Forces and rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) have concentrated. The new military operation in the zone, which began shortly after 0700 local (1300 GMT), was confirmed by residents to Mexican and foreign journalists who traveled to the area despite the defense ministry's recommendations to the media yesterday -- to abstain from entering the combat zone, for security reasons. Six Mexican journalists were almost killed yesterday when machinegun fire from Mexican Air Force aircraft hit near the station wagon in which they traveled toward Maria Auxiliadora hill. There is still no information if the Army's bombardments and machinegun fire in the region have resulted in casualties. However, San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz said he had received information about the disappearance of various Indians who live in the zone. Clashes in the mountain zone south of San Cristobal de las Casas began on Tuesday, when fighter airplanes launched the first attack on Maria Auxiliadora hill to evict groups of rebels that withdrew to the mountain after leaving various towns they seized on Saturday.
