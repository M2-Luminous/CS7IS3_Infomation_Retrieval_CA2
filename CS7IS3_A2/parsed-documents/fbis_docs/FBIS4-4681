[Kumano] It is not good to evaluate deregulation efforts by focusing only on the number of regulations. In some cases, the number increases. For example, although the Gas Industry Law was recently revised to liberalize the industry, the number of regulations on the gas industry increased as a result. We have to promote deregulation while reviewing all systems and structures which have supported this nation since the end of the war. MITI has taken a broader view of this issue. A Role for the Market [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Since the Meiji era, Japan has pushed an industrial policy. But because the policy has almost completed its role, some people are arguing that MITI is no longer necessary. [Kumano] It is a matter of course that the framework of industrial policy changes with the times. The administration's role is to meet the needs of areas that it takes charge of or to anticipate these needs. Our major tasks include deciding what industries should do at a time when systems and structures are being reviewed, and rectifying price gaps between Japan and other countries. The market mechanism forms the basis of industrial activities. It is very important that the mechanism functions. The government sometimes creates a big demand or forecasts the demand. Some people say it is undesirable for the government to forecast demand, but I do not think so. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] MITI still has two divisions in charge of administering iron and steel. Don't you think that the significance of the existence of bureaus that directly supervise industries, including the Basic Industries Bureau and the Machinery and Information Industries Bureau, is decreasing? [Kumano] MITI has constantly reviewed its structure. What I want to stress is that no government office in the world covers broader areas than does MITI. On macroeconomic policies, the Ministry of Finance [MOF] is in charge of finance, while the Economic Planning Agency is responsible for coordinating all policies. Meanwhile, MITI is asked to speak from its position of covering broad areas. I think that this structure is capable of contributing to the Japanese economy. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] I think that some government offices will become obsolete when the roles of the market increase. [Kumano] The areas supervised by MITI introduced the market mechanism at an early point. I am confident that I am the best market theorist in Kasumigaseki. However, market theory is not 100-percent correct. Somebody has to assume the task of operating markets. I think that politicians and bureaucrats, who work under politicians, should assume the task. Reduction Not Necessary [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Don't you think that government offices tend to become larger because they have a less-developed sense of costs compared to the private sector? [Kumano] While administrative service is provided using the market mechanism, it is always exposed to the criticism of the mass media. We should prevent government offices from becoming larger. But, I do not think that they are getting larger. For example, there is only one division in charge of the auto industry, and it is composed of only 10 or so officials. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] But they will not become smaller, will they? [Kumano] If government offices are doing unnecessary things, we will have to review them. We always accept criticism of ourselves. We need to reflect on our actions. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Do you not think it is necessary for MITI to become smaller to some extent? [Kumano] I think it is unnecessary at the moment. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Some people call MITI the second MOF because it takes the same stand as the MOF on macroeconomic policies. [Kumano] The truth is that the MOF has been influenced by MITI's opinion and that the two have coordinated their views through arguments. When the two ministries confront each other, you call it a negative effect caused by a vertical administrative system. And when the two cooperate through arguments, you call MITI the second MOF. It is regrettable. At present, macroeconomic measures are very important. From a short-term point of view, they undoubtedly boosted the economy for the last two to three years. From a mid- and long-term point of view, macroeconomic measures are necessary to effectively use Japan's high ratio of savings in the process of the nation's moving toward an aging society. There is currently an imbalance between savings and investment, and this is the cause of the current accounts surplus. Japan has to invest its high savings in housing, research institutes, and the information infrastructure. To do so, the government needs to either go into debt or to increase taxes. It is impossible to do so only with debt. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What you have explained resembles the idea advocated by the MOF of emphasizing a financial equilibrium. [Kumano] No, it does not. We have not said that the investment should be made solely with taxes, but we have proposed increasing the government's debt. We have not agreed with the MOF on everything. We are thinking of what we should do to carry out (our policies). It is unpleasant to be called the second MOF when we make realistic arguments. I am doing my job with confidence and based on economic theory and the belief that we can better our society. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] Is it also MITI's duty to check on the MOF? [Kumano] Yes, we are checking on them. It would be problematic if the MOF did not take action [to cause an economic recovery]. But in actuality, they are taking action. If anything, they are taking the initiative in some ways. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] U.S. President Bill Clinton recently criticized both MITI and the MOF by name. [Kumano] The President called Japan a big-export but a no-import nation. This is very regrettable because his remark ignores the facts. Final Decisions Should Be Made by Politicians [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] How do you draw a line between bureaucrats and politicians in policymaking? [Kumano] It is difficult to draw the line because there are various kinds of policies. But in principle, final decisions should be made by politicians. It is absolutely impossible for bureaucrats to do what ministers are opposed to. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of the so-called [Shinseito (Japan Renewal Party) Chief Secretary Ichiro] Ozawa plan, which includes the idea of establishing a parliamentary councilor post? [Kumano] I do not know whether news reports on Ozawa's plan are accurate. At any rate, I think it is good to discuss various things, including Ozawa's plan. [NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN] What do you think of politicians taking part in bureaucrats' personnel management? [Kumano] It is true that ministers have the right of personnel management. But the neutrality of the administration is also important. I cannot say absolutely that their participation is not good.
