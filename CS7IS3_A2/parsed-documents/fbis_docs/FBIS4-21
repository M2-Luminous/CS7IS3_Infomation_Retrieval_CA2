The media lays the blame for much of this unrest on the national education system and entrenched French adherence to "fixed and outdated ideas" of social fairness. Economic journalist Delphine Gerard comments in the Paris business daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on 30 March that following the turmoil over the CIP (which some opponents dubbed a Youth SMIC), the government again faces controversy over implementing provisions of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's Five-Year Employment law. A government decree proposal currently being reviewed on changing the rules for the 40-hour work week has been rejected by the labor unions and may provoke more social unrest in the weeks to come. This rejection, combined with the reservations of employers, is a new "hard blow" for the government, Gerard maintains, and the government may have to again do an "about face" as it did in the CIP controversy. In fact, Labor Minister Michel Giraud has already indicated that he could not pass the law "by force." According to Gerard, labor unions and employers are reticent to support such an ambitious" bill, which provides companies flexibility in managing work schedules, for various reasons. Workers Force (FO) indicated that "it will fight against the law since it flies in the face of 50 years of the Labor Code." The General Confederation of Labor (CGT) denounced the bill for its "destruction and aggravation" of working and living conditions. The proposed decree states that companies which work in "successive teams" will be exempt from current work week rules. The exemption will allow service industries such as banking, retail, and insurance to maintain flexibility in managing work hours. The law would allow these companies to remain open six days a week and at night. Moreover, the decree stipulates a number of individual guarantees: * A minimal daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours. * A weekly rest period of 35 consecutive hours. * Maintenance of two consecutive days off, one of which would be Sunday, in industries where this already exists. * A 48-hour rest period per week for all workers, replacing the initial formula of two nonconsecutive days off. According to the decree, the new guarantees will partially enact into domestic law the Community directive of 23 November 1993 on the management of work time. Editor-in-chief Philippe Labarde, writing in LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES on 23 March, blames the strong reactions against the CIP on problems in the national education system, the government's failure to address them, and French society's refusing to give up its ideas of social fairness. The CIP, Labarde states, was simply the "final straw" which highlighted the unemployment problem French youth face today. While it has been largely accepted that unskilled youth must submit to free market labor laws, it has suddenly become evident to those with diplomas--those who have completed the national education courses--that their "good conduct" has led them to an impasse. Labarde describes this as a rude awakening for this group which points out the inequities of the national education system. While the goals of this system come from laudable sentiments??raising the ?? level of education in France--the system itself failed to verify whether there were jobs available which corresponded to the education received. For not having done this elementary analysis, France now finds itself in crisis and its youth suffering and saying so. Labarde argues it is useless to point fingers at the guilty, since the guilt is collective. In any event, for France to get out of this profound" economic crisis will be difficult, Labarde concludes. He warns that for anyone to use the crisis politically would be demagoguery or to use it economically in the name of "who knows what free-market philosophy" would be dangerous. Labarde continues discussing the crisis over youth unemployment in the 24 March LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, claiming that French society is grid-locked over the issue. He notes that conservative Prime Minister Edouard Balladur and Socialist former Prime Minister Michel Rocard have both said so. The two also agree with Labarde that the guilt is collective. The French, besides believing themselves more intelligent than others, have a "deranged egoism" which leads them, in the worst of cases, to always demand more, and in the best of cases to ferociously defend what they have acquired, whether it is social or other benefits. Labarde characterizes the French as "sad people who merit being condemned for being piggish over their archaic SMIC (minimum wage), their luxurious lodgings, their scandalous paid vacations, not to mention their decidedly too generous social welfare benefits." He adds that what is worse is that the moral and economic lessons which "the French do not know how to discuss" do not change their behavior. They hunker down on what they have, even more so in periods of crisis. Despite this "detestable gridlock," Labarde points out that the French are an "elite" which the world envies. The nation may not be hunkering down over social benefits but over the fixed and out-dated ideas of social fairness behind them. It is these same ideas which have formed policies that had hitherto been successful. Labarde concludes that it would be hard to imagine how to explain that the policies which brought success are now bringing about the opposite.

On the other hand, 68 percent believe that Europe can maintain its competitiveness. Those who are pessimistic on competitiveness say the greatest challenge comes from the emerging economies such as Taiwan, Korea, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with their surplus underpaid workforce and dynamic growth. The United States and Japan are not perceived as a threat to European competitiveness. The poll was conducted in January-February 1994 among British, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, and Belgian businessmen and managers. (AB) "Has the Single Market brought any benefits?"

The private sector was "hardly capable" of creating new jobs in most of the countries during the same period. Although employment increased by a good 10 million workers, or 8 percent, during the years covered by the report, nearly 97 percent of that increase was accounted for by public-sector employment. Germany, for example, created 2.5 million jobs but two-thirds of these were in the public sector. In France, Belgium, Italy, and especially Spain, the number of public-sector jobs actually increased more than net overall employment. These figures present a sharp contrast to employment developments during the same period in the United States and Japan, where proportionally more new jobs were created, most of which were in the private sector. The ERT report cautions that "many of these not very productive jobs in the (EU's) public sector could be lost again in the medium term under the pressure of empty coffers and high public debts." (JS) (Berlin DIE WELT in German 19 Mar 94 p 16) FRANCE REACTION TO U.S. UNFAIR TRADE LIST--According to Georges Potriquet, writing in the economic section of LE FIGARO, France is unlikely to refute its inclusion in the list published by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor naming those countries which do not have open markets. While Potriquet notes that the importance of the list should not be ignored, he points out that since France is currently a partner with the United States in trying to include a social clause in the final version of the GATT agreement, the government will most likely allow any counter charges to be handled at the EU Community level. Potriquet reports that the EU has already announced that by the end of the month it will publish "a report on trade barriers erected by the United States against EU products." (DiI) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 2, 3 Apr 94 p I) EDITORIAL ON BENTSEN, CHANGE IN INTERNATIONAL GOALS--Washington correspondent Jacqueline Grapin, writing in LE FIGARO, points to recent speeches by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen as proof that the United States no longer uses its presence in international financial organizations as a "means of philanthropy, hiding its entrepreneurial spirit behind humanitarian rhetoric," but now openly uses its membership in them to increase its economic influence in the world. Members of Congress demand that the administration be accountable to the electorate, Grapin notes, and in their view the future unit of account will be the creation of employment in the United States. To respond to this pressure, the U.S. administration has taken numerous steps to make the most of its large influence in international financial organizations, such as at the World Bank where the United States has increased the size of its commercial section in the office of the Bank's U.S. administrator. Grapin notes that it is well known that U.S. companies often are told of new bids for large projects linked to World Bank programs before the projects are even reviewed by the Bank's administrative council. Evidently, Grapin writes, the new goals of the current U.S. administration are to act for the good of "America Inc." and should make Europeans "stop and think" and should prod them into "mobilizing." Grapin argues that final proof of such a change in U.S. goals can be found in recent speeches by Bentsen and she quotes these speeches extensively. In particular, while she points out that Bentsen is not responsible for U.S. diplomacy but for defending the financial interests of the United States, she contends that Bentsen "spoke the truth" when he requested funds from Congress for multilateral financial institutions. Grapin cites Bentsen as saying before the foreign affairs section of the House budget committee that the "clear lesson" for the United States is that the money the United States sends abroad through international financial organizations comes back to the United States in multiples through exports and new jobs for Americans. Furthermore, Grapin quoted Bentsen as stating that U.S. goals for multilateral banks in 1994 were to increase U.S. exports, reduce U.S. budgetary costs, and to reinforce U.S. interests in strategic regions. Grapin adds that in Honolulu before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference, Bentsen gave further warning to Europeans when he said, "Our most important trading partners are those in the Pacific region." (DiI) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 30 Mar 94 p XI) BALLADUR SUPPORT FOR SWEDISH MATRA SALE REPORTED--According to a report in Sweden's daily SVENSKA DAGBLADET cited by Paris daily LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur sent a letter on 2 March to Sweden's Prime Minister Carl Bildt in which he "pleaded in favor" of a Swedish purchase of the French Mica missiles manufactured by Matra. The Swedish response was reportedly "cold" and "gloomy." The Swedish daily, generally well informed according to LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES, said that the letter pointed out the industrial advantages of a Mica order, which would allow Matra to collaborate with two Swedish companies--Saab Missiles and Ericsson Radar Electronics--to supply the Mica electronic guidance systems. However, some unnamed Swedish military sources stated that the U.S. and British Aerospace missiles, competitors for the order, have the advantage of being "tested" in the Persian Gulf War. (DiI) (Paris LA TRIBUNE DESFOSSES in French 28 Mar 94 p 10) SOCIALIST PARTY DETAILS ECONOMIC PLATFORM--The national council of the Socialist Party (PS) met on 30 March and from that meeting came details of its economic platform for the European Parliament elections this summer. The following are the planks of the platform: * Make unemployment a priority. The PS wants a large EU loan of 1,300 billion francs (Fr) over five years to finance large public works projects and neighborhood renovations. * Establish job stimulation policies in industries protected from competition. EU member states should collectively reduce work weeks to avoid competition. * Review taxes in terms of their effects on employment. The PS contends that taxes "should burden capital and not only labor." The PS wants minimum tax rates on company and real estate revenues to avoid the tax competition practiced in the EU. The PS would like the principle of Community preference to be maintained for countries or zones which practice national preference. The party also wants aide to EU industry to be encouraged. * Additionally, the PS wants a large public service sector, guaranteed norms on minimum wages and maximum work hours, and the creation of a statute on European rights assuring real participation of wage earners in decisionmaking. (DiI) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 31 Mar 94 p 2) FEARS OF LOSING BOSNIA CONTRACTS EXPRESSED--Marie-France Calle reports in LES ECHOS that the French Government, which wants to improve chances for French companies to garner reconstruction contracts after the war ends in Bosnia, are sending specialists from French industry--under uniform--as part of the military reservists called up to manage the transition from military to civilian business in Sarajevo. Three have already departed for Sarajevo: an engineer from the construction company Spie Batignolles, an official from the National Railroad Company (SNCF), and another from the General Directorate of Civilian Aviation. Additionally, the French ambassador to Sarajevo is asking for a French economic expansion office to be quickly established in that city. These actions are in response to French fears that they will be at a disadvantage in relation to Britain and the United States--seen as poised to win again the lion's share of postwar reconstruction contracts as they did in the Persian Gulf War--when it comes time to rebuild Saraj evo. Noting the importance of Sarajevo as a starting point for developing the rest of the country, Calle contends that while the French were the main UN force in Sarajevo and "have paid with their blood," it is the "Anglo-Saxons who are the more pragmatic." The United States--not content with distributing humanitarian aid--has sent gas, water, and electricity specialists to the area. The French view these specialists as clearing a path for U.S. companies in the postwar reconstruction. Despite reassurances from Rob Rowe, director of projects for the International Rescue Committee, that "everyone will have their chance" to bid on contracts, the French believe there is worse Anglo-Saxon influence to come, according to Calle. On 4 March, the Security Council of the United Nations passed a resolution to send a joint committee, made up of U.S. and British experts, to Sarajevo. The committee is to evaluate the financial needs for the reconstruction of that city. Calle point out that seeing this joint committee leave for Sarajevo "made French blood curdle." However, nobody could explain why France had voted for the resolution without thinking of calling on its own experts. "The Americans and the English are evaluating the needs and when money comes, they will be well placed" to pursue contracts, stated an unnamed French source in Sarajevo. Calle adds that although the French Government is trying to improve France's position in postwar civilian management, French experience in this field comes from Algeria and Vietnam and is tarnished by overtones of colonialism. (DiI) (Paris LES ECHOS in French 24 Mar 94 p 6) COFACE TO GO PRIVATE--Jean-Pierre Robin, writing in the economic supplement of LE FIGARO, reports that the government-owned export credit insurer Coface will automatically become privatized when the majority of its stockholders are sold to the private sector. This "derivative" type of privatization will take place when the large government-owned insurance company UAP, which owns 20 percent of Coface, is sold in May. Besides UAP, Coface has some of France's largest companies as shareholders, including the French Foreign Trade Bank (BFCE) which owns 20 percent and the Societe Generale, Credit Lyonnais, and BNP banks. The Council of State, consulted to see if the 1993 privatization law applied to Coface, has responded favorably. However, Robin claims that despite the privatization of Coface, the company will still have problems because of its relationship to the government. Coface President Yves Cosse details three possible problems which may plague the company. First, because of its function as guarantor for government-backed foreign credit, there will always have to be "transparency" between the government and the company, which will justify government oversight. Secondly, government officials will always be concerned about changes in Co face ownership and may want to keep a "golden share" of the company to retain some influence. Finally, the directors of Coface will have the double obligation to gain the confidence of the shareholders and of the Economy Ministry. (DiI) (Paris LE FIGARO Le Fig-Eco supplement in French 31 Mar 94 p IV) BUSINESS CONFIDENT IN RECOVERY--According to a report published by the National Institute of Economic Statistics (INSEE) on 29 March, business leaders in most industries are "resolutely optimistic" about the prospects of increased industrial activity. Queried at the beginning of March, these business leaders' positive responses were sharply in the majority when asked how they viewed industrial activity in the months to come. As for their own prospects, on which businessmen are traditionally cautious, they too were more positive. For the first time in months there was a five- point positive response compared with the four-point negative response during the two preceding months. In times of economic prosperity there is usually a 20-point positive response. However, other than the automobile industry, the only industries right now that are benefitting from a real recovery are intermediate goods such as steel, chemicals, and plastics. Other industries are still having a hard time improving their businesses, especially the equipment manufacturing industry, which Jean-Louis de Fommervault of the Mechanical Engineering Industry Federation sees as in a state of stabilization with investment near zero and production delays of at least six months per machine. Fommervault predicts that a recovery for this industry is "not guaranteed for 1994." (Dil) (In hardcopy version of the Economic Review, there is a graph of the above monthly industrial poll.) GERMANY G-7 JOBS SUMMIT VIEWED AS INEFFECTIVE--A commentary by Erwin Single in the Berlin TAGESZEITUNG criticizes the March G-7 Jobs Summit in Detroit as unproductive. According to Single, the measures discussed at the summit--lower wages, technology promotion, lower interest rates, social welfare cutbacks, training, flexibility, and deregulation--are ridiculed by labor market experts. Single refutes the U.S. claim to have created five times more jobs than the Europeans over the last two decades, arguing that many of these jobs involve unstable, low-paying, part-time work. He asserts that the only result of the summit was the confirmation that "in the future, there will be no common strategy by the industrial nations against mass unemployment." (WS) (Berlin DIE TAGESZEITUNG in German 17 Mar 94 p 10) RUSSIA PRESSES FOR SPECIAL EXPORT CREDIT TERMS--A 555-million- German-mark (DM) sale of railway cars to Russia in 1994 faces cancellation if the German Government does not approve special terms for the accompanying Hermes export credit guarantees. Russia wants to be excused from the required 15-percent down payment and wants to receive the first three years of credit interest-free. However, these same terms applied to business with CIS countries prior to 1 January 1994 and consequently Hermes deficits on business with the CIS grew to DM4.5 billion. Berlin-based Deutsche Waggonbau (DWA), the potential railcar manufacturer, stands to lose some 50 percent of its sales volume if the contract falls through. There would also be severe ramifications for the company's suppliers in Saxony- Anhalt, which employ some 8,000 workers. DWA managers, along with land and regional politicians, are attempting to persuade the Federal Government to grant the requested exemption. (CW) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 24 Mar 94 p 17) BELARUS BUSINESS POTENTIAL, PROBLEMS PROBED--A trade mission from North Rhine-Westphalia negotiating in Minsk cited numerous hindrances to potentially profitable business operations in Belarus. The Belarus Government has blocked access to foreign currency accounts--possibly even for firms with partial foreign ownership- -and has banned foreign ownership of land. It has also launched a hotel and convention center project which would compete with a proposed German-backed trade center in Minsk. According to the German delegation, the shaky financial status of Belarus's companies has further impeded trade, necessitating DM30O million in Hermes export credit insurance in 1994, in addition to barter arrangements. Belarus's political instability, its lack of natural resources, and the nuclear contamination of its agricultural products were cited as additional disincentives to investment. On the other hand, the high skill level of the Belarus workforce has preserved modern optical, precision measuring, and laser industries while German entrepreneurs have reported successes in retail trade and the machine tool industry. (CW) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 24 Mar 94 p 12) CZECH SKODA FIRM BUYS THURINGIAN COMPANY--The Pilsen-based Skoda company, a machine tool and assembly line maker, has bought the Trust Agency's largest holding in Thuringia, the metal stamping press maker Umformtechnik Erfurt. Skoda, with annual sales of DM8O0 million, is among the Czech Republic's largest companies, and is the first Czech firm to establish activity in eastern Germany. Upon Czech Government approval of the purchase, project financing will be provided by a bank consortium, by investment money, and credit guarantees from the Thuringian Land government, and through a 5- percent holding by the newly formed Thuringian Industrial Participation Company. Negotiations are under way to bring in additional investors from the CIS, North America, and the Far East. (CW) (Duesseldorf HANDELSBLATT in German 28 Mar 94 p 13) PRIVATIZATION OF HEAVY MACHINERY COMPLEX NEAR COMPLETION--The Leipzig-based Takraf company, the successor to the former GDR's heavy machinery production combine, will complete privatization by mid-year, according to Klaus von Dohnanyi, chairman of the firm's board of supervisors. The combine's 61 production sites, which produce harbor cranes, elevators, factory assembly lines, open-cast mining equipment, and general machinery, presented the Trust Agency with one of its most difficult privatization problems. Agency Vice President Hero Brahms asserts that Takraf "is also a model case of how a number of competitive, mid-sized units have been created from the break-up and restructuring of a former GDR combine." Of the 33 firms belonging to the combine, only three are left without new owners, and only three had to be shut down. New owners have guaranteed investment of about DM256 million, supplementing the roughly DM100 million raised by the Trust Agency. In contrast to other combines, Takraf was essentially solvent and was able to meet preexisting obligations.

In the talks between Greek Minister of Defense Yerasimos Arsenis and the Cypriot leadership it was decided that Greek defense industry experience and know-how will be fully taken advantage of. A large number of heavy- load trucks are being ordered from the Greek Vehicle Industry (ELVO), which is also interested in selling Cyprus more of its acclaimed Leonidhas tanks. Since the new defense agreement emphasizes air defenses, Greek companies may be able to sell medium- range missiles in Cyprus as well as being able to convert some stationary units to mobile units. They also envision jointly developing in Greece and in Cyprus the integrated Artemis-30 weapons system. Finally, the agreement may allow the Greek Weapons Industry (EVO) to sell portable weapons there. The joint defense agreement forecasts expenditures of 170 million Cypriot liras in the next two to three years in addition to the 227 million liras in regular 1994 budget defense allocations.

Some 44.9 percent of the companies surveyed do not plan to make any investments while 32 percent will, 19.8 percent did not know, and 3.3 percent did not answer. Reduced investments and rates of return that generally do not exceed the inflation rate will affect employment. Of the 250 firms surveyed, only 15 percent expected to hire more workers, while 64.6 percent said they would maintain the present number of workers, 13.3 percent envisioned a reduction of their work force, 3.8 percent did not know, and 3.3 percent did not answer.

Barucci particularly called for the German Bundesbank to continue to do so, saying that its monetary policy, which is crucial for Europe, has up to now been conducted in a flexible way. Barucci said that the Bundesbank should not be too concerned about the effects of lower rates on inflation and exchange rates, especially since inflation seems to be under control, and added that a limited devaluation of European currencies should not cause much of a problem. He also said that Italy strongly opposes "protectionist trends," pointing out that they would not solve structural unemployment in Europe and would instead provoke trade retaliation. (AB) (Milan CORRIERE DELLA SERA in Italian 15 Mar 94 p 19) NEW JAPANESE AUTO IMPORT QUOTA CRITICIZED--An article in LA STAMPA characterizes the Italians as particularly critical of the new Japanese automobile import quota established during the last round of negotiations between the EU Commission and the Japanese Foreign Trade Ministry. The article notes that Italy will have to increase its share of Japanese auto imports by 21 percent in 1994- -from 38,000 to 47,000 automobiles. Although the total increase for the whole EU is only 0.4 percent--from 980,000 to 984,000--countries with lower quotas for automobile imports such as Italy, Spain, France, and Portugal will have to absorb larger percentages of overall imports to bring them closer to the 10-percent average for the EU. An unnamed EU Commission spokesman explained that Italy's quota of Japanese imports is currently fixed at a low 4.5 percent, therefore it must absorb the largest increase. The article adds that in February Foreign Trade Minister Paolo Baratta wrote to the EU Commission asking that Italy's quota remain the same and he is still waiting for a final decision.
