FBIS3-39876 "drweu036_j_94002" FBIS-WEU-94-036 Document Type:Daily Report 23 Feb 1994 ITALY & VATICAN CITY _o_Dailies View Parties, Elections 94P20382A 94P20382A Article Type:CSO [Editorial Report] Commentaries and editorials in several Italian dailies have discussed the merit of the various coalitions running in the parliamentary elections, which will be held on 27-28 March. Press views have ranged across the political spectrum, but most dailies have been critical of the decision by television magnate Silvio Berlusconi to enter the race with a new party, Forza Italia. CORRIERE DELLA SERA Opts for Center In a 30 January front-page editorial in the Milan daily CORRIERE DELLA SERA, editor in chief Paolo Mieli supported centrist forces in the election against "those who...preach the need to break up the center and the formation of two opposing blocs" on the right and the left. Mieli wrote that what is needed now is for the parties to express "clear policy lines," especially toward the economy and institutional reform. The voters expect the centrists, especially the Italian Popular Party (PPI), to explain clearly whether they will go into opposition or try to form a government coalition should they--as is more than likely--not receive a majority of seats in the election. The moderate wing of the left, particularly the Democratic Alliance and some factions of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), should also clearly state whether it will include the PPI in any government it would form after an election victory, Mieli continued. The government options offered to the electorate should be transparent, and those parties which have formed alliances for the elections should remain together after the election and agree on a choice for prime minister, Mieli concluded. Writer, journalist, and television commentator Arrigo Levi's commentary in the 29 January CORRIERE DELLA SERA rejects the polarization of the political spectrum into left and right blocs. The many politicians and commentators who advocate such a division claim that it is the best way to prevent the government from falling into the hands of communists, reactionaries, or separatists, Levi wrote. However, a two-bloc election would not provide a political home for the many voters of the center who want change but also wish to preserve what was good about the old system. According to Levi, such voters would be forced to support "unacceptable" partners in both blocs--ex-fascists, neocommunists, opportunists such as Forza Italia, dogmatists such as the Rete, or groups with "obscure intentions" for Italy such as the Northern League. After the elections, Levi predicted, both blocs will lose their cohesion because of the incompatibility of the component groups. The effectiveness of the new government will, consequently, be impaired. Levi asks why a center bloc, small but politically homogeneous, should not participate in the race. In an election that Levi views as part of a larger political transition, some "moderate and progressive" parties would do better to run on their own rather than as part of heterogeneous coalitions. Regular CORRIERE DELLA SERA commentator Angelo Panebianco noted in the 27 January edition that Silvio Berlusconi's entry into the political arena was a gift for the leftist coalition because Berlusconi provides the left with a "boogey man" to attack during the electoral campaign. In addition, Berlusconi's entry fragments the liberal-moderate forces, including the PPI, already weakened by the refusal of Northern League leader Umberto Bossi to join forces with it. Finally, the entry into politics of television magnate Berlusconi has rallied the journalists of the state-owned RAI television networks behind the PDS, causing intense controversy over public television's political objectivity. Commentator Ernesto Galli Della Loggia observed that Berlusconi's decision to enter politics to defend the moderate forces is an indication of the confusion reigning among those who identify with those forces. Berlusconi "thinks he is the doctor when in fact he is the disease," Galli Della Loggia wrote in CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 26 January. LA REPUBBLICA Favors Left Alberto Cavallari, former editor for CORRIERE DELLA SERA and currently a regular contributor to the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA, has suggested that he saw "nostalgia" developing among conservative parties "for 1948 "--a time when the left was attacked by the right to prevent a change in the government. In the 3 February LA REPUBBLICA, Cavallari characterized the current political situation as the formation of a "cartel" by eight leftist parties followed by the formation of an opposing coaltion by eight rightist parties in response. If the center's objective is the same as that of the right--that is, to destroy the left--then the center, Cavallari maintained, inevitably becomes a part of the right. In fact, what unites the eight rightist parties is a 1948-style anticommunism. These parties act as if nothing changed in 1989 and as if the Italian left is a variant of Soviet communism. Cavallari asked rhetorically whether it would not be better to "utilize" the crisis created by the decline of the Socialist and Christian Democratic parties, and of international communism, to try a system that allows for alternating governments, instead of returning to the old center-right, center-left alliances which have governed Italy since 1947. In a 27 January LA REPUBBLICA commentary, Ermanno Gorrieri, former Christian Democrat and currently an official of the newly founded leftist Social Christian movement (part of the Progressive Alliance headed by the PDS) thanked Northern League leader Umberto Bossi for the latter's rejection of an electoral pact with the PPI. Had the PPI joined the center-right coalition, the drift to the right of many PPI members would have been "a disaster," Gorrieri maintained. He characterized the PPI's intention to form a centrist coalition in opposition to both the right and the left as "worrisome." This decision, intended to safeguard the Catholic presence in politics, in fact weakens the center. Under the new electoral system, parties will be forced to form alliances to survive, Gorrieri wrote. The PPI's insistence on running alone condemns it to a smaller representation in Parliament. While many believe that the PPI needs to be in the opposition for a while, Gorrieri asks whether lay Catholics should give up their responsibility to help face the upcoming challenges. That is why the Social Christian movement was created: to organize left-leaning Catholics within the Progressive Alliance. Gorrieri concludes by claiming the Social Christians have gathered significant numbers of PPI members who do not support PPI chairman Mino Martinazzoli or former Christian Democrat Mario Segni. In a 24 January front-page editorial criticizing Berlusconi's entry into politics, LA REPUBBLICA editor in chief Eugenio Scalfari also criticizes Segni for trying to bridge the ideological distance between his Pact for Italy and the PPI on the one hand, and the Northern League and Forza Italia on the other. Segni did not understand that the ideologies of the two groups are too far apart, Scalfari wrote. He is still trying to align the Pact not only with the League and Forza Italia, but also with the National Alliance. According to Scalfari, the latter three parties are planning for a League election victory in the North and a National Alliance victory in the South, with Forza Italia as the "glue" holding the group together. Scalfari warns that this is a strong alliance with the means to manipulate public opinion. LA STAMPA Critical of PDS Editor in chief Ezio Mauro asked for "clarity" from the leftist Progressive Alliance in a 2 February editorial in the Turin LA STAMPA. Commenting on the formation of the Alliance the previous day, Mauro wrote that in Italy it is easier to call oneself progressive than conservative and the leftist alliance's choice of the word "progressive" allows for a broader and less exacting definition than the concept of "the left." The word "progressive" makes no distinctions within the alliance and can also appeal to voters from the center. It is a label that avoids having to account for the past actions of socialism and communism, Mauro wrote. Italy needs a left, but only a European, western, and noncommunist left, Mauro argued. Thus it is important that the left explain which of the old policies it is willing to give up and which it is continuing to promote. However, it has instead refused to identify with its history because that would limit the number of potential electoral allies. This failure by the left to address its history has allowed Berlusconi to tag it as "communist," Mauro maintained. The various groups within the Progressive Alliance should confront each other, knowing that there will be disagreement--and the PDS, as the leading party in the Alliance, should decide in which direction it is heading and who the Alliance candidates for prime minister and other government posts will be if it wins the elections, Mauro advised. University professor Gianni Vattimo, in a 30 January LA STAMPA commentary, criticized the PDS's belief that after the elections it can form a governing coalition with the PPI. Such an arrangement would destroy any hope of a radical renewal of the Italian political system, Vattimo wrote, and would be nothing more than a return to the old corrupt political schemes. Vattimo wrote that the PDS's two leaders, Achille Occhetto and Massimo D'Alema, pretend not to understand that the PPI's Martinazzoli is saying very clearly he does not want to ally with them. While the PDS promises a postelection "governability" derived from an alliance with the PPI, it is going ahead with plans to form an election alliance with Communist Renewal and the Rete--parties which, Vattimo wrote, are to function as election allies but are supposed to disappear when the time comes to form the PDS-PPI government coalition. Citizen enthusiasm in Italy's "Second Republic" will wane if the left and Martinazzoli's center lose their separate identities, Vattimo concluded. IL MESSAGERO Favors PPI Running Alone Giulio Anselmi predicted that despite all forecasts to the contrary, Italy will not be able to adapt to a bipolar political system. Anselmi, editor in chief of the Rome daily IL MESSAGGERO, maintained in a 30 January commentary that the PPI has emerged as the third bloc in Italian politics. Berlusconi, who is using his influence to bring the League and the National Alliance together, is opposing the PPI, and Anselmi wonders which of the two groups will fight the PDS for control of the country. Berlusconi says he is the only true anticommunist in the race, because after the elections Martinazzoli will offer his support to the probable leftist winner, Anselmi wrote. However, by refusing to present himself as "anti-anything" and clearly distinguishing himself from the National Alliance, the League, and the PDS, Martinazzoli is the only candidate to have retained some credibility, according to Anselmi. Martinazzoli has the support of the pope and the Church in their call for Catholics to remain united, preferably in one party. Amselmi wrote that Martinazzoli deserves credit for having resisted the temptation to transform the PPI into something totally different from the old Christian Democratic Party (DC) and for having weathered the breaking away of the party's right wing. His PPI offers the moderate voter a choice other than the left or the right. In comparing the rightist and leftist coalitions, commentator Angelo Bolaffi noted that League chief Bossi's plan to pose as the only true anti-PDS force has been spoiled by the similar line taken by the National Alliance and Forza Italia. The bickering that took place among the leftist coalition partners for the placement of candidates is being duplicated in the rightist coalition, but the discord on the right is worse because of the great divergence in the political ideologies of the League and the National Alliance. Efforts at forming a coalition could backfire, forcing League and National Alliance voters against each other to the benefit of Berlusconi, who would once again show his exceptional business ability in "speculating" with the votes of others, Bolaffi concluded (LA STAMPA 1 February). IL SOLE--24 ORE Defends Berlusconi The Milan financial daily IL SOLE--24 ORE was the only monitored newspaper to defend Berlusconi's decision to enter politics. An unsigned editorial on 29 January states that while the benefits of having a media millionaire like Berlusconi enter politics is debatable, Berlusconi's person and program should not be "criminalized." Berlusconi's opponents, the editorial continues, should remember that just a few years ago the League was ridiculed in much of the press for the crudeness of its language and leader. After the last elections, however, it became clear how deeply entrenched the League was in society. Berlusconi is introducing a liberal culture which has never taken hold in Italian politics, the editorial maintained. Although the League has also been expounding liberalism, it has been accepted only in the North. Segni's waverings and the distancing of many Catholics from his policies is leading many voters to see Berlusconi as someone who can open a debate on issues of interest to people both in the North and the South, such as lowering taxes, easing fiscal regulations, improving the administrative system, and safeguarding public security. Other parties, especially the leftist parties, should express clear opinions on these issues, the editorial concludes.
