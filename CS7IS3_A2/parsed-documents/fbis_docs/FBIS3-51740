The document, which will be valid for three years, was signed by Cuban Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina and Hidipo Hamutenya, Namibian trade and industry minister. According to the agreement, the contracting parties will make all payments in freely convertible currency and in accordance with the laws of both states. However, the signatories may adopt other forms of payment to promote the rapid development of commercial ties, the document said. Robaina and Hamutenya agreed that this bilateral accord will create new ways to identify other areas of cooperation. The Havana and Windhoek Foreign Ministries last Wednesday signed another agreement to eliminate visa requirements for the citizens of both nations. Robaina today concludes a three-day visit to Namibia, the last leg of a two-week tour of Africa, which also took him to Ghana, Angola, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. Before leaving for his country, the Cuban foreign relations minister will speak to Namibian President Sam Nujoma, to whom he will present a message from President Fidel Castro.
