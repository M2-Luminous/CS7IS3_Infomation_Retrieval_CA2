Is there irrefutable evidence of this involvement, given that Iraq says that the prisoners are teachers? [Tahir] I can -- regrettably -- confirm to you that Iraq is implicated and a partner in this war against our people. Iraq is involved directly through its military experts and soldiers who are fighting alongside northern forces. A number of them have been captured, and Iraq could not deny this. The war is -- beyond any doubt -- basically run by Iraqi experts, and 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih considers himself a new Saddam, or as brother President 'Ali Salim al-Bid described him, "a little Saddam." We have irrefutable evidence of Jordan's implication in the war alongside 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and against our people in the Democratic Republic of Yemen [DRY]. Sudan too is participating directly or indirectly in this war, proceeding from the close relations between Sudan and North Yemen, where parties, fundamentalist groups, and influential military leaders are in control of power. And you know that Afghan jihad elements are fighting alongside northern forces on a number of fronts. As for the Iraqi prisoners issue, it merits interest and a pause for consideration. Let us explain the scenario and the contradictory statements made by both North Yemen and Iraq. Initially, Sanaa and Baghdad categorically denied Iraq's participation in the war. When Iraqi prisoners, who were captured on the Shabwah-Hadhramaut military axis, appeared on television, Sanaa claimed that they were nurses who had been arrested at al-Hutah hospital in Lahij Governorate to be used as prisoners. As not even children or madmen would believe this story, Baghdad had to admit the presence of Iraqi military personnel contracted privately to join the Yemeni Army. So one of them bore witness to that. [Shatarah] The northern Air Force's resumption of activities in the fighting has probably dashed your hopes that the early southern air strikes neutralized the northern Air Force. [Tahir] Actually the northern Air Force's role has been limited, not completely paralyzed. Not only because of the crushing air strikes our Air Force launched against military airports in Sanaa, al-Hudaydah, and Ta'izz -- which destroyed a large number of aircraft as well as these airports, and thus paralyzed the effectiveness of the northern Air Force -- but also because the combat preparedness of the northern Air Force was very limited. But it was the Iraqi and Jordanian aid and expertise which -- to some extent -- have restored the effectiveness of the northern Air Force recently. Nevertheless, all the air raids launched by the aircraft of the military regime in Sanaa have so far failed to inflict any damage on military targets, that is with the exception of the damage to the fuel tanks in the Aden refinery and the damage to a part of the electrothermal station, water tanks, and the homes of peaceful citizens. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] The northern leadership accused you of signing an arms deal with North Korea which includes tanks, artillery, and Sukhoy aircraft. What truth is there in this? [Tahir] That accusation is absolutely baseless. And you can refer to the statement made by the official spokesman for the North Korean Foreign Ministry, who categorically denied that accusation. All the accusations Sanaa is leveling at us are designed for the media and to divert attention from the military aid and arms deals it has obtained and is obtaining from a number of states, including Iraq and Iran. [Shatarah] How did northern forces manage to reach the approaches of Aden? And do you expect the city to be captured by the northerners? [Tahir] First, I repeat that the military regime in Sanaa prepared and planned for this war very early, while we were not prepared. Nor did we expect such an all-out war. Second, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his advisers planned to occupy all the south. His forces attacked all border areas between the two parts [of Yemen]. He had thought that the situation would be settled within two or three days at the most. You remember the various statements he and his ministers made about settling the situation within 24, 48, or 72 hours. But the hours, days, and weeks have elapsed and nothing has happened. It means that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's forces reached the approaches of Aden on after they suffered huge losses in both lives and equipment. But the military strategic aims of the war have failed completely. They have been broken on the rock of the steadfastness of our forces, which are defending bravely and steadfastly. The attack on Aden has failed, and northern forces have failed to advance as a result of our forces' steadfastness and death defiance. In search of another shelter, the military regime in Sanaa is haphazardly and barbarously bombarding residential areas in Aden Governorates and vital economic installations by artillery, rockets, and aircraft. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] You said in a local newspaper that there is internal treason. Can you specify it? And why did it happen? [Tahir] It is very natural for infiltrations to happen here and there, as everyone considered themselves people of one state, and they dealt with one another innocently. Besides, 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has been pursuing the divide-and-rule principle. He has earnestly tried to create and fuel further splits and disputes in a bid to influence the internal front. At any rate, those who joined the ranks of the military regime in Sanaa can be counted on the fingers of one hand and they have had no serious effect on the combat position of our forces, who have very bravely fought a brutal aggression in an all-out war which was planned and prepared for long ago. [Shatarah] In your capacity as DRY defense minister, what are your priorities at the moment? [Tahir] We are still engaged in the war imposed on us by the military regime in Sanaa. When victory has been achieved, God willing, we will begin our first tasks, first and foremost rebuilding and reorganizing our Armed Forces on modern scientific foundations so as to fulfill the requirements of the defense of our country and its national sovereignty. [passage omitted] [Shatarah] Why is the south insisting on bringing international observers to supervise the cease-fire? [Tahir] We have bitter experience with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and his military regime with regard to promises, treaties, and agreements. We signed more than 100 agreements with him, none of which has been implemented. The most recent is the Pledge and Accord Document signed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, on 20 February. It was circumvented on the day it was signed. The regime in Sanaa suffers from a split personality with regard to words and actions. So we cannot rely on any agreement with 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, because he has lost all credibility and respects no pledge or agreement. There is another reason: we are now an independent state and the war is between two states, and it is natural for us to refer our issue to the international organization. [Shatarah] What measures will you take if Sanaa continues to attack vital installations in Aden or if it storms the city and rejects international initiatives? [Tahir] Sanaa is still attacking vital economic installations in Aden and residential areas, just as it attacked villages and cities during its occupation. We will not be able to stand with our hands tied if it continues its actions, which contravene the rules of war and human rights. As for storming Aden, it is impossible. And if Sanaa continues to rejects all international initiative, it is going to pay a very high price.
