Purify to homogeneity 30&hyph;50 milligrams of CR&hyph;1 from Pichia pastoris conditioned medium. 3. Provide the purified recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein. 4. Utilize the purified recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein to generate mouse anti-CR&hyph;1 monoclonal antibodies. 5. Screen anti-CR&hyph;1 monoclonal antibodies for specificity, reactivity, and sensitivity toward recombinant CR&hyph;1 protein. 6. Ascertain whether monoclonal anti-CR&hyph;1 antibodies can detect native CR&hyph;1 protein in CR&hyph;1 positive human colorectal or embryonal carcinoma cells by radioimmunoprecipitation analysis and by ELISA. 7. Determine whether anti-CR&hyph;1 antibodies can be used for ICC on formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissues known for CR&hyph;1 expression. 8. Provide funds to support associated CRADA-related research expenses including supplies, reagents, travel, and training. Criteria for choosing the collaborating company will include: 1. Ability to obtain background license to relevant patent rights. 2. Experience in producing and purifying recombinant proteins, particularly growth factors or cytokines. 3. Experience in generating and screening monoclonal antibodies. 4. Willingness to cooperate with the NCI in the collection and evaluation of data. 5. Willingness to cost share in laboratory studies. 6. An agreement to be bound by the DHHS rules involving the use of human and animal subjects, and human tissue. 7. Provisions for equitable distribution of patent rights to any inventions. Generally the rights of ownership are retained by the organization which is the employer of the inventor, with (1) an irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to the Government (when a company employee is the sole inventor) or (2) an exclusive or nonexclusive license to the company on terms that are appropriate (when the Government employee is the sole inventor).
