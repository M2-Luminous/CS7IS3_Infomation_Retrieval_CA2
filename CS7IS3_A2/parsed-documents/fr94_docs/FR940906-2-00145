Priorities Proposed Priority 1_Personnel Specifically Trained to Deliver Services in Client Assistance Programs Background: The Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;569) made significant changes in rehabilitation service provisions under Title I of the Act. Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and applicants of available benefits under the Act. Section 302 of the Act includes personnel specifically trained to deliver services in CAPs among the personnel that the Rehabilitation Training program must consider in reviewing personnel shortages and training needs. Through the 1992 Survey of Personnel Shortages and Training Needs in Vocational Rehabilitation, CAP directors have reported critical training needs for both CAP administrative and service-delivery personnel. The Secretary has identified a maximum possible project period of 60 months. The Secretary believes that at least 36 months will be necessary to meet the requirements of the priority. The Secretary will be assessing, during the third year of the project period, whether there is a need to provide funding beyond 36 months. Priority The project must_ •Provide training to CAP personnel on an as-needed basis, including_(1) Management training on skills needed for strategic and operational planning and direction of CAP services; and (2) Consumer advocacy training on skills and knowledge needed by CAP staff to assist persons with disabilities to gain access to and to use the services and benefits available under the Rehabilitation Act, particularly new Title I requirements; •Coordinate training efforts with training supported by the Center for Mental Health Services and the Administration on Developmental Disabilities for protection and advocacy on common areas, such as financial management; and •Include both national and regional training seminars in each project year. Proposed Priority 2_Training Rehabilitation and Mental Health Personnel to Provide Improved Rehabilitation Services to Individuals With Mental Illness Background: High turnover rates and inadequate academic preparation of service staff are continuing problems among programs providing rehabilitation services to individuals with severe mental illness (Pratt and Gill, ``Developing Interagency In-Service Training,'' Psychosocial Rehabilitation Journal, Vol. 16, No. 1, July, 1992). Ongoing research has documented the need for competency-based training to promote the recruitment, career development, and retention of personnel who provide support and rehabilitation services to persons with mental illness (``A Comprehensive Study of Human Resource Development Issues_Present and Future_for Personnel Providing Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services,'' Project No. H133G10072, awarded July 1, 1991, by the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research to the International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services). Provision of rehabilitation services to persons with severe mental illness is complicated by the need for staff to interact frequently with professionals in other agencies and disciplines. Cross-training of counselors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, evaluators, and other professionals is essential to effective interagency cooperation. Rehabilitation and related staff must be knowledgeable about key legislation such as the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Social Security Act. Increasingly, rehabilitation services involve persons with severe mental illness making their own choices and family members having a role in rehabilitation programs. Staff require training to be effective in consumer-directed rehabilitation. The Secretary intends to make an award with a project period of up to 36 months.
