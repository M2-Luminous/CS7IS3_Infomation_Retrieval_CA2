Of course, such a mixture of styles is apt to lead to some sort of languor in the ranks of the radicals. However, the censor-like vigilence of the adherents to slogans as clear as the eyes of youth has recently become dull. The main reason for this is the lack of brilliant victories in the lightening-speed reformation of sluggish Mother Russia. It has already turned out like this for us: The slower the harnessing the faster we go. Although one will not speak about the speed of providing food products, let's say, to the Norilsk industrial region or the Taymyr (Dolgana-Nenets) autonomous okrug. The essence of the question being reviewed is such: The navigational delivery of goods and resources, including food, petroleum products and vital necessities required for the population of the above mentioned territories was always clearly worked out in the most general terms by the middle of April. But that was before. It was carried out by the state Norilsk Nickel concern which has all the necessary means for this work. But not today. The Norilsk Mining and Metallurgical Combine, producing half of the world's platinum and tens and hundreds of thousands of tons of nickel, cobalt and other expensive metals on the world market, has itself fallen into the financial abyss. And because of the state they were in, in connection with this as of 1 April accumulation of freight at the transshipment ports had practically not been carried out. The breakdown of navigational deliveries will lead to a sharp worsening of social tensions in the most important region of the extreme North with a population of more than 350,000 people, as well as to significant losses for the country's economy due to a reduction in the amount of valuable and nonferrous metals. The opinions of high members of the Commission regarding the amounts of state financial support for delivering food products and goods to the regions of the extreme North are divided. According to a preliminary agreements it was decided in favor of the following figures: to allocate 500 billion rubles to the combine for freight deliveries for the current quarter and to provide for allocation of funds for the third quarter within the limits of 800 billion rubles. During the break I asked A. Filatov for his impression of the discussion. Anatoliy Vasilyevich diplomatically avoided a direct answer: "The question will be finally resolved on Friday. Let's talk then." Today is Friday. As trusted sources from the government institutions informed us, the question has been practically resolved. It is necessary to feed the peoploe...We congratulate everyone for this.
