[Correspondent Sergey Barabanov] Ten days are left before the Ukrainian presidential elections. Observers note a significant growth in the popularity of the current President Leonid Kravchuk. During his one-day visit to Odessa today, he paid most attention to the economy problem, but also dwelt in some detail on the prospects for the political integration of CIS countries. [Begin Kravchuk recording] Yes, the time will come, yes, there will be integration, yes, there may be political elements in the integration. But if this is begun today, then it would strain the situation to the limit -- both in Russia and outside Russia. I think that certain gentlemen are making haste in putting forward new formulas today. We have to use the potential of the CIS. [end recording] [Barabanov] As is well-known, Kravchuk's main opponent, Leonid Kuchma, holds a different opinion on that point. What the people of Ukraine think we will find out on 26 June.
