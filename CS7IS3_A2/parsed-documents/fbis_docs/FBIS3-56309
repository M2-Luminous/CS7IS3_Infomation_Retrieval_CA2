Two myths, which their supporters consider to be axioms of current European policy, lie at the heart of these recommendations. First, there is the theory that there is a "security vacuum" or "gray zone" in Central Europe, which will almost inevitably become the sphere of Russian expansion. Second, there is the theory that refers to "Russia's return to a nationalist, imperialist policy" as a result of the recent parliamentary elections. Combining the two hypotheses leads to this conclusion: NATO must protect the countries of Central Europe from the inexorable pressure from the East. Accepting the theory of a "security vacuum" means rejecting the very essence of the pan-European process expressed in the Paris Charter and the unity of the democratic nations of Europe. This would be the most major crack in the supporting pillars of European policy, which, despite apparently insurmountable difficulties, has brought about the reunification of Germany and led to the collapse of the 20th century's totalitarian monsters. If I were to make a prediction about the worst case scenario -- the restoration of Russian imperialism -- it would not come from the invasion of the West by "Russian tanks," but from a repetition of the Yugoslav drama in the former USSR. The repercussions of this would be tens of millions of refugees and upheaval in the large industrial complexes, and the threat of tactical nuclear weapons deployment. What could NATO do in this situation to protect its eastern members? Several Chernobyls would be enough to finish off the whole of Europe -- with interest. The "guard on the Bug" would be incapable of protecting anyone. However, this worst case scenario could be provoked by the hasty expansion of NATO. This presents the extremists in Russia with a most convincing argument in favor of restoring the Russian empire, because "it is necessary to defend ourselves" against "pressure from the West." The strategy of the "worst case scenario" is dangerous, therefore, because it contains the detonator of a prophecy that may then fulfill itself. The Russian Factor in European Security Anxiety about a new "threat from the East" can be dispelled -- first and foremost -- by a partnership strategy with democratic Russia, which has embarked upon the policy of establishing a law- governed state and a market economy. Russia's presidential foreign policy has already made evident its orientation toward implementing the country's nation-state interests by means of partnership and not by confrontation with the surrounding world. This orientation is enshrined in the democratic constitution. Russia does not have territorial claims against any state, including the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Russia's new military doctrine orients its armed forces exclusively toward defending the country and its allies and toward peacekeeping operations in harmony with Russia's international commitments. As far as the results of the parliamentary elections are concerned, I am convinced that there is no fertile ground for pro- fascist tendencies in Russia, because Russia placed more sacrifices than any other country on the altar of victory over fascism. The voters cast their ballots not in favor of a "march toward the West," but in favor of a "leap into warmer waters," that is, not for the violent restoration of the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. They voted against the ambitions and arrogance of some reformers, against their inability to explain the aims of reform to the people in simple, ordinary language, and against the shortcomings in social security for the population and in the struggle with crime. Russian democrats have already begun to draw unavoidable conclusions from the sobering lesson of the parliamentary elections. However, this will definitely not take the form of toying with right-wing extremism. We condemn any overt or covert form of extremism, aggressive nationalism, and fascism. The West should now draw some conclusions from this and modify the tone and accent of its dialogue with Russia. The pedantic language in it is inappropriate. It is hard to associate partnership with the submission of proposals that we have to either adopt in full or reject completely, without the right to amend them to suit our interests. Right now Russia needs to feel greater support from outside for the reform line. A precise and detailed strategy for cooperation between Russia and its democratic allies in the West has to be drawn up. We need new strategic concepts and the mechanisms to implement them, mechanisms that would emphatically express the current level of progress in our relations. And most important of all -- it is essential to move forward on the promises Russia received in Tokyo at the meeting with the leading representatives of the seven most industrially advanced nations (G-7) toward multilateral cooperation, that is, to the fulfillment of these promises. Partnership on Behalf of a United Europe In designing the new European architecture, it is important to take into consideration the following criteria: A balanced step-by-step approach toward transforming Europe's security. It is essential to eliminate "shock diplomacy" methods and the policy of faits accomplis. The Russian side favors broad consultations with all the countries involved. The openness of regional organizations and institutions as a guarantee for their successful adaptation to the current European situation. Russia has no right to dictate who can and cannot join NATO. We have the right, however, to assume that the North Atlantic Alliance will take into consideration the specific features of the inevitable long-term transition period and -- since we are talking about the longer-term perspective -- that it will confirm the position contained in its documents declaring NATO to be an organization open to the entry of all democratic states in the Euro- Atlantic region. It is impossible to discount the possibility a priori that Russia will also apply for entry into NATO in the future. The primary task is to guarantee an effective and equal partnership during the period of mutual transformation and adaptation. Providing guarantees for an equal standard of security for each European state. The creation of "first and second class security," "gray zones," "special spheres of influence," "isolated regions," and "cordons sanitaire" in Europe is unacceptable. The preservation of the current principles for European security, which are based on treaties. The removal of territorial claims within the framework of interstate relations in Europe. The main aims of the strategy that we propose, for partnership in the political sphere in the area of security, are as follows: First: Forging North Atlantic cooperation. Transforming the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) into a general regional political organization and the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) into an independent organization for military-political cooperation, but closely associated with the CSCE. It is necessary to orient them toward coordinating the efforts of NATO, the Western European Union, and the Commonwealth of Independent States in the spheres of improving international security and the peace-forming and sincere protection of ethnic rights and of linguistic and other minorities in Europe. I consider the acceptance of the declaration on resistance to aggressive nationalism during the CSCE conference in Rome to be a major step in this direction. It is essential to understand NACC not an "anteroom" to NATO in accordance with the formula "NATO plus," but -- as was intended at the time of its establishment -- as an independent instrument for equal partnership among former adversaries in the interest of building a new Europe. The proposals to expand the NACC by including the European neutral states and to create a compact NACC secretariat are arousing great interest. It is necessary to orient the Council toward developing cooperation in the spheres of security, military planning, conversion, and peace missions. Second: Creating a system of mutually interlinked security guarantees for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The more these states are interlinked, the stronger their relations will be. Perhaps it would be worthwhile to consider -- for example -- creating a kind of "safety net" on the basis of mutually supplementary agreements on security between Germany and Poland and Poland and Russia. Analogous agreements could also be proposed to the other states in the region. Three: I welcome the proposals put forward by my German colleague, K. Kinkel, concerning the signing of an agreement on cooperation and consultations between NATO on the one hand and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, and Ukraine on the other hand. The establishment of a communications channel between NATO and the CIS would also be a positive element. Four: An improvement in the ability of the European states to actively participate in the peace process. At the moment, to be frank, the East and West have not found a solid response to the local conflicts in Yugoslavia and the former USSR. These problems are turning into major problems within the framework of European security. Our partners should give genuine support to the efforts of Russia, which is bearing the main burden of the peace process in the former USSR. The time has come to create a voluntary support fund for the peace process in the CIS. NACC could offer practical assistance (whether by providing finance or preparing staff). Fifth: The non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in Europe. It is wrong to regard the Russian-Ukrainian dispute over strategic missiles as a matter or element of Soviet heritage. It involves preserving the regime of nuclear non-proliferation. The strategy for European partnership must contain strong incentives for adhering to the current nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The economic aspect of partnership forms a special chapter. The gist of it is: During the transition from individual, chronically overdue programs to help incorporate Russia into the international division of labor on an equal and non-discriminatory basis, it is necessary to guarantee Russia access to European markets. The dialogue on the strategy for partnership in Europe is progressing actively. I believe that the NATO summit, by means of its well considered and far-reaching decisions, will make a positive contribution to its development. Russia remains for the members of the North Atlantic Alliance a responsible partner interested in drawing up such a strategy.
