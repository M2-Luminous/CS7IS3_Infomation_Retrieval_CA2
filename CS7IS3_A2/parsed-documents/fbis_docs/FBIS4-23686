The fall of Gitarama, 50 kilometres (30 miles) southwest of the embattled capital Kigali, could not be confirmed by UN officials in Kigali or government forces. The rebel Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) had been battling the army for two weeks for control of Gitarama. "We control 90 percent of the town, including the centre, and the situation will be completely clear this afternoon," Kagame told reporters at Kanombe military camp near Kigali airport. "There was a big fight yesterday and last night it was taken by our forces," Kagame said, adding that the entire town was in rebel hands except for "one or two hills" where beleaguered government forces were still holding out. "We are following government forces as they are moving towards Ruhengeri (a town north-west of Kigali)," Kagame added. Some members of the interim government proclaimed after the April 6 death of president Juvenal Habyarimana fled Gitarama several days ago, UN spokesman Jean-Guy Plante said. UN officials were unaware of the whereabouts of Prime Minister Jean Kambanda. Fierce artillery and small arms battles meanwhile raged in Kigali. According to Kagame, the rebels gained ground. Philippe Gaillard, head of the International Red Cross in Kigali, said two shells presumably fired by the rebels had slammed into the Red Cross hospital compound in a government-held area of Kigali on Sunday. Four or five others landed just outside. Nobody was hurt, and Gaillard said he had lodged protests with both sides. Rebel and army commanders meanwhile resumed UN-brokered truce talks Monday at UN headquarters in Kigali's Amahoro hotel. Brigadier-General Marcel Gatsinzi, representing the army, told reporters he had no information about Gitarama. The rebels control a large section of the road south from Gitarama to the town of Butare and the Burundi border. [passage omitted] UN soldiers meanwhile resumed the evacuation of civilians trapped behind hostile lines in Kigali, but some refused to leave rebel-held areas for places they considered less safe. The UN has moved about 2,000 people from rebel-controlled areas to government-held sectors and vice-versa. But evacuations were suspended last week after a convoy came under fire. The UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda (UNAMIR) decided to continue evacuations Monday after both sides agreed to a four-hour truce to allow the convoys to get through. A convoy of empty trucks set out Monday morning for the Sainte- Famille church, where about 8,000 people are sheltering behind government lines. Another convoy went to the rebel-held Amahoro stadium. Each was to ferry about 150 people to areas the UN considers safer. But none of the 5,000 civilians encamped in squalor at the stadium would go. [passage omitted]
