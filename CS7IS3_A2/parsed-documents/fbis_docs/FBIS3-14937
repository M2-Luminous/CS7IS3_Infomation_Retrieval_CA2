In a statement issued on Monday, the movement leaders urged the State Duma deputies to adopt an amendment to their decision on amnesty to limit the right of those pardoned to conduct political activity and be elected to posts in state bodies of power until the new presidential and parliamentary elections are held in the country. The movement also called on all Russian parties and public organisations seeking to lessen political tension in society to urgently get down to work to set up a popular coalition of reform, which is the only means of saving Russia, as the statement said. However, Valentin Kovalev, deputy chairman of the State Duma, stressed earlier today that under international agreements of which Russia is a party, it has no right to limit political rights of people who have been released by amnesty. "Therefore I believe that people released in connection with the act of political amnesty cannot be limited in their political rights. Otherwise it would contradict the norms of international law," he said. He said that State Duma faction leaders suggested adopting a special act stripping those pardoned of what they have received under amnesty if they continue to destabilise the situation in the country. However, such a document would need clear-cut juridical specifications rather than political interpretations, primarily of the term "destabilisation," Kovalev said.
