They wish to convey a warning that if Israel does not protect the Golan Heights, their movement will turn into an open revolt against Labor and the UKM, and they will consider establishing an independent party. Our correspondent Shula Schmerling reports that the heads of the Third Path, who are members of the Golan kibbutzim, denied reports alleging they had received financial aid from other parties. According to them, all of their financial assets come from domestic sources, but refused to name them.
