FBIS3-5549 "dreas046_d_94004" FBIS-EAS-94-046 Document Type:Daily Report 9 Mar 1994 South Korea Official Says DPRK Delaying Inspection Schedule SK0903021294 Seoul TONG-A ILBO in Korean 9 Feb 94 p 1 SK0903021294 Seoul TONG-A ILBO Language: Korean Article Type:BFN [Text] North Korea, claiming that it has not agreed that the exchange of special envoys between the North and the South should be a precondition for the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, is delaying allowing the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] to extract test material from major nuclear facilities, thus laying a stumbling block. Hearing the report from relevant authorities on the afternoon of 8 March that a stumbling block is laid on IAEA's nuclear inspection now ongoing in North Korea, the government discussed measures for this, and decided to reconfirm that North-South special envoy exchange is the precondition for North Korea-U.S. talks. On 8 March, a high-ranking government official said that "North Korea, contrary to its previous promise, is claiming that the inspection of the core facilities, including 5-megawatt nuclear reactor and a radiochemical laboratory, should be conducted at the end of the schedule, thus making the inspection, including extraction of test material, delayed." This official pointed out that "North Korea, claiming that the North-South special envoy exchange is not a precondition for the third round of North Korea-U.S. high-level talks, threatened that if the United States continually insists on special envoy exchange as the precondition for the talks, North Korea will not allow the inspection of core facilities." The official noted that "the inspection team, changing its original plan, is continuing inspection activities, including replacement of batteries of surveillance cameras installed in the other five nuclear facilities. Whether North Korea will reject the inspection of core facilities to the end or not is a matter that we should continually watch." This government official stressed that "during the recent New York working-level contact with the United States, North Korea agreed that the North-South special envoy exchange must be realized before the third round of talks." Thus, he reconfirmed it is the firm position of the ROK and the United States that the third round of high-level talks will be held only after the special envoy exchange is realized. In particular, the government is going to reconfirm this existing position during forthcoming talks with Robert Galluci, U.S. assistant secretary of state, for readjustment of the positions of the ROK and the United States toward the third round of talks. The official also noted that "as the special envoy exchange is clearly a precondition for the third round of talks, it is not necessary for us to raise a specific demand that the special envoy exchange must be realized before the third round of talks during the working contact with North Korea slated for 9 March." He added that "whether or not North Korea sincerely accepts nuclear inspection as previously promised and respond to special envoy exchange is a matter which North Korea should decide according to necessity for a third round of high-level talks." However, North Korea, in a statement issued in the name of Kang Sok-chu, North Korean vice foreign minister, on 4 March, threatened that if the United States continually maintains that the envoy exchange must be realized before third round of talks, North Korea cannot satisfactorily ensure the inspection by IAEA.
