No one has claimed responsibility for the incident. Police said the explosion came from a cluster of baggage in the crowded waiting area near a food stall on the platform where the Nakhon Si Thammarat- Bangkok express train stood around 12.30 pm. Sutchai Butngam, 40, who kept the food stall, was killed instantly, while Rochem Butem, a young man, and a 17-year-old woman, Amnuai Raksarat, who suffered serious injuries died later at hospital. Eight of those injured were in critical condition last night and some may not survive, according to Maharat Hospital officials. Most of the casualties were passengers or relatives seeing off family members. Provincial Governor Suchan Phongnua expressed outrage at the attack but did not lay blame. "The explosion was an act of terrorism. It intended to kill people -- poor people, women and children," he told reporters at the scene of the blast covered with pools of blood, broken tables and chairs, smashed utensils and scattered food. Suchan quoted eyewitnesses as saying they saw a young man in his mid-20's placing a paper box amid the baggage and casually walking away a few minutes before the explosion. The governor said police bomb experts had yet to identify the explosive device, although an initial report suggested that it was an improvised bomb set off manually by a battery-powered detonator attached to a time-delay circuit. Security was tightened at the airport, bus terminals, wharves, railway stations and government offices throughout the province, he said. Terrorist attacks like yesterday's incident are impossible to prevent, he said, because the perpetrators did not use a time bomb, which can be detected before it goes off. Police Director General Prathin Santipraphop, who arrived here from Bangkok to personally direct the investigation into the case, said he believed the bomb attack was not linked to the separatist movement because the type of bomb used was different. Asked whether the attack was aimed at discrediting the government, Prathin said police investigators would need some time to find out. The national police chief said initial findings suggested that there were at least three people involved in planting the bomb at the railway station. Prathin said yesterday's attack was unpreventable, but acknowledged that police will have to improve their intelligence gathering. Deputy Prime Minister Banyat Banthatthan said he was told by police that the bomb was designed to create the impression that the government is unable to keep peace and order. But he said it was premature to link it to "disempowered element". Deputy Foreign Minister Surin Phitsuwan, also Democrat MP representing Nakhon Si Thammarat, said he was told by an eyewitness that a man apparently lit a fuse to set off the bomb. He said the eyewitness saw smoke rising from the paper box just before the explosion. Surin, who was in Nakhon Si Thammarat yesterday, said it was too early to say whether the blast was in any way linked to the separatist movement in Muslim-dominated provinces. Police and army bomb experts equipped with metal detectors searched the railway station and the train for other bombs but found none. The Nakhon Si Thammarat-Bangkok train eventually departed on schedule at 1:40 pm, but most of the would-be passengers cancelled the journey, fearing for their safety, and had their tickets refunded.
