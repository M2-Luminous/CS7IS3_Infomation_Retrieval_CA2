The first round of the cantonal elections restored a bipolar political landscape, dominated by a remarkably stable right-wing sedimentation. The second round followed suit with republican discipline on the Left, confirming the PS's [Socialist Party] resilience in the various departments. However, the PS will henceforth be flanked by an individualist runaway wing -- whose triumphant symbol is Bernard Tapie -- and, above all, by a confirmed Communist entity gathering discontented voters: The elements of the future reorganization of the Left are now apparent. The governing Right maintains its supremacy, but will have to curtail its conquests. It acknowledges the limitations imposed by the extreme Right, which has strong roots in the country and, if necessary, is capable of playing the role of the redresser of wrongs, even though the National Front [FN] remains condemned to isolation. The country's electoral conservatism is combined with a degree of social unrest which is only superficially contradictory. The 1994 cantonal elections were characterized by loyalty both in the polling booths and in the streets: People have voted and have slung stones at the same time. To what extent did the demonstrations by young people -- who do not have the vote -- cause the mobilization of the Left's voters, or even of extreme right-wing voters? [Prime Minister] Balladur did not wait until this objective -- though not unconditional -- confirmation of confidence by voters to announce a gesture of goodwill toward young people, which will be formalized today. For his part, Mr. Rocard is marking time. Within the opposition, the purpose of the battle is clear: The aim is to take advantage of the gap between political stability and social unrest, in short, to break through this gap. The roles must already be assigned. If President Mitterand -- having failed to survive the collapse of his own system except in his contributions to foreign policy -- has not found his way back into the game, Rocard and Fabius, on the contrary, have found theirs. The former must become something more than just the man of straw of a presidential campaign which is considered to be foredoomed to failure. He is now pressed for time. The European election test might lead to ambiguous results, but it could also prove disastrous for him. Rocard, the leader of the opposition and shadow president, must embody the credit given to a resilient and revived Left. Will he manage to acquire this image? `There Will Be Quite a Stew' Fabius's game is easier to play. It involves asserting himself as the leader of the parliamentary opposition -- if need be, with the prospect of being in that position for a long time, like Mitterand before 1981. He has the necessary talent, style, and will. He did not wait for the second round of the cantonal elections to go on the offensive by requesting that issues of youth employment and the enlargement of Europe be debated and voted on in Parliament. On the Right, the infernal spate of presidential opinion polls was resumed yesterday evening, causing immediate irritation within the majority. The widespread comments on Balladur's and Chirac's respective merits for the success obtained in the first round gave a foretaste of this. The debate was absurd, as if we had never before witnessed a head of government taking adavantage of a satisfactory electoral result! The war between Plic and Ploc [nicknames for Chirac and Balladur] is on everyone's mind, to the extent that by now duos are called Balladur and Chirac. Only hypocrites make believe that they still entertain some doubts. As de Gaulle used to say: "There will be quite a stew." The prime minister tore the mosquito net before the second round by conveniently making use of the coincidence between two events, namely, the cantonal elections and the government's first year in office. Yesterday, he proclaimed his "responsibility." Could he have dreamt of a better occasion at the time of cohabitation? He has also definitely foreshadowed his crossing of the Seine -- this river separating the Elysee [president's palace] from the Matignon [prime minister's office] -- by outlining "the great structural reforms which, beyond 1994, will have to be discussed before the French nation as a whole." It is not just five years of legislature that are now at stake. The question of knowing whether the policy started in 1993 (and prepared, "among others," a few months earlier) will mark the beginning of a new era or will only be an interim policy, is actually quite pointless. Would any candidate from the majority turn his back on this policy -- or should we say this preliminary plan? In constitutional terms, one can only talk of a transitional period. Mr. Balladur is so much aware of this that he had to refer to "the closeness of the presidential elections" among the difficulties faced by his government. Where would the difficulty lie, if he were not himself a candidate? Between now and the elections, the prime minister will have to dispel the suspicions felt by a public opinion and a body politic which are prone to judge the timing and scope of the reforms by reference to his presidential ambitions. At the end of the road, he will have to take the solitary step which, making him abandon the Matignon's warmth for the Elysee's chill, may or may not enable him to play the role of the visionary of France in the year 2000. By his own admission, Mr. Chirac has chosen this very same role for himself. Freed from the constraints of the immediate situation, sparing of electoral comments, he is also outlining the France of the post-1995 era, selecting his ends and means, polishing his statements, already with a foothold in the future. Inflexible in his outlook, lonely as he never before in leading his supporters, he is heading for "that pastoral headland, crowned by clouds," in [Victor] Hugo's words.
