Nurmagambetov stressed that the most difficult period of renewal of the Kazakh Armed Forces was over. The Army has been equipped with personnel, uniform and technical means. Nurmagambetov pointed out that Kazakhstan was the last among the CIS states to place the troops stationed on its own territory under its jurisdiction. Nurmagambetov said that earlier Kazakhstan had stood for a single CIS or Russian-Kazakh Army. He emphasized that several agreements on implementation of the treaty on military cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan would be signed in late May during the Russian governmental delegation's visit to Alma-Ata. Nurmagambetov announced that an agreement on Russia's lending the Sary-Shagan anti-missile training ground in Central Kazakhstan was being worked on. He said Kazakhstan conditioned the lending with education of Kazakh military specialists in Russia. He stressed that Sary-Shagan would not be a Russian military base since there would be no Russian troops. No establishment of any military bases in Kazakhstan was expected, Nurmagambetov stated. The strategic armed forces stationed in Kazakhstan will be withdrawn from it by 2000. The withdrawal has already begun, he added. Nurmagambetov underlined that Kazakhstan had modern military equipment of the Soviet model and did not have to purchase more of it. The equipment is served in Kazakhstan on a plant for the repairing of defense equipment. In future Kazakhstan will buy military equipment only from Russia, Nurmagambetov said.
