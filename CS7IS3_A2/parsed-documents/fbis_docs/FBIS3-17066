In his message to its participants and all virgin land developers, Boris Yeltsin emphasized in particular that the experience of the development of the virgin lands was a convincing testimony of the fact that if efforts are united, success is guaranteed in even the most difficult of undertakings. This experience, Yeltsin thinks, is especially valuable at present. It is only by acting together and closely interacting and cooperating in all spheres that the crisis can be surmounted faster and the difficult problems of the Commonwealth countries resolved, notes the president.
