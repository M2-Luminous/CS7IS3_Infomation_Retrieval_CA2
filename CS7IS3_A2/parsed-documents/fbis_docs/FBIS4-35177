This statement was made following the Clinton administration's recent decision to suspend the visas of all 18 January senators except Serge Gilles, general coordinator of the Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti, who has never participated in the meetings of his colleagues. The U.S. authorities' decision was adopted in an attempt to return those parliamentarians who support the military coupists and who contributed to the installation of the de facto government of Emile Jonassaint to their senses. Senators Bernard Sansaricq, Eddy Dupiton, and Dejean Belizaire, who are well known for their ultranationalism, reacted on 23 June to the U.S. administration's decision to cancel their United States visas.
