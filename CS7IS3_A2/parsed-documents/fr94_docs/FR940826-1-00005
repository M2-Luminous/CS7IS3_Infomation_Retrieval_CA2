FR940826-1-00005 FR940826-1-00001 The fifth proposal, Proposal Five as published in the hearing notice, proposed including the ``add-back'' provision in the Class II price calculation. Retention of the ``add-back'' provision was proposed by the Central Milk Producers Cooperative (CMPC), a federation of milk cooperatives with operations in the Chicago Regional (Order 30) marketing area. Its membership includes: Associated Milk Producers, Inc., Bongards Creameries, Inc., Golden Guernsey Dairy Cooperative, Independent Milk Producers Cooperative, Land O'Lakes, Inc., Manitowoc Milk Producers Cooperative, Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., Midwest Dairymen's Company, Milwaukee Cooperative Milk Producers, National Farmers Organization, Southern Milk Sales, Inc., Wisconsin Dairies Cooperative, Wisconsin Milk Producers Cooperative, Inc., and the Woodstock Progressive Milk Producers Association. Members of CMPC supply milk to bottlers with Class I and Class II utilization in Federal Orders 30, 32, 40, 50, 68, and 79. They also supply milk to primarily ``stand alone'' Class II plants in Federal Orders 30, 33, and 49. Certain CMPC members also operate plants processing Class I and Class II products. Testimony in support of adopting Proposal One, which would replace the Class II price formula with the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30 and be announced by the fifth day of the preceding month, included: a. The proponents MIF/IICA and NMPF; b. Prairie Farms Dairy, a large regional dairy cooperative that processes and distributes a full line of Grade A dairy products, wholly owns 15 dairy plants, manages one plant for Mid-America Dairymen, Inc., and jointly owns 11 plants with other cooperatives; c. The Kroger Company, which operates seven fluid distributing plants regulated under six Federal Orders. Kroger Company also operates two nonpool ice cream manufacturing plants that distribute dairy products in 22 Federal orders; d. Crowley Foods, a major dairy products manufacturer that operates six plants in Federal Orders 1, 2, and 4, four of which are involved in the manufacture of Class II products; and e. Dean Foods Company, which operates 34 fluid milk plants in 17 Federal orders, processing in excess of 4.5 billion pounds of milk per year. Except for supporting the fifth proposal, which would retain the ``add-back'' provision, the CMPC offered testimony in support of replacing the Class II price formula with the basic price formula for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.30, with this price being announced by the fifth day of the preceding month. Testimony offered by the proponent witness for the MIF/IICA cited that price volatility in Federal order markets in the past few years has resulted in the movement of Class II prices in a magnitude and direction too often in the opposite direction of Class I and Class III prices. The witness indicated that these more volatile and opposite-moving price relationships have acted to severely limit Class II processors in their ability to sell products on a forward contract basis and have caused confusion to their customers who possess a relatively limited knowledge of milk procurement and pricing. This witness maintains that for efficient marketing and efficient pricing of milk, both Class I and Class II prices should be reflecting movements in the M&hyph;W price at the same time, in the same magnitude, and in the same direction. The MIF/IICA proponent witness offered testimony that revisited a proposal that they submitted at the National Hearing in the fall of 1990 to change the method for establishing advance notice of the price paid for Class II milk under Federal orders. At that hearing, the proposal offered was to establish a Class II price by using the M&hyph;W price for the second preceding month plus a fixed differential of $0.15, explaining that the rationale for establishing a 15-cent differential was based on a comparison of the Class II price with the basic formula price over the decade of the 1980's. The proponent witness observed that for the 10-year period of 1980 through 1990 the Class II price averaged about $0.15 above the M&hyph;W price. The witness also testified that because of the Food Security Act of 1985, and the subsequent 1990 Farm Bill, the groundwork was laid for basing milk prices on market forces more than had been done in the past. The MIF/IICA witness contends that the result has been more volatile milk pricing which has rendered the current Class II price formula ineffective in tracking the Class I price, and that the spread between the Class II and the M&hyph;W price has increased from its longer-term average. The proponent witness testified that the Class II price has on average approximated the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus 30 cents. It is on this basis that, according to the proponent witness, they are endorsing a Class II price based on the basic formula price for the second preceding month plus a 30-cent fixed differential. They maintain that this approach has the advantage of being easily understood and is revenue-neutral when compared to the current Class II price computation. They noted that it also allows for the announcement of the Class II price for the month to be made a full ten days earlier than under the current Class II pricing and announcement structure. From an economic point of view, the MIF/IICA proponent witness stressed that while revising the price computation for determining the Class II price is certainly needed, it is imperative not to have a Class II price which would increase the probability of reducing an already declining market for Class II product sales. Because the Class II price has averaged nearly 30 cents above the basic formula price for the second preceding month over the past six years, the witness asserted that the level of the Class II price for raw milk to both processors and producers would be maintained. The witness offered and cited Federal order statistics that supported their position that Class II product sales are steady-to-declining. The witness said this underscores the economic need to maintain the cost of Class II milk at its current level relative to the basic formula price. Lastly, the MIF/IICA proponent witness testified that the changing cost structure of milk components under Federal orders reinforces their position of a fixed 30-cent differential added to the second preceding month's basic formula price in determining the Class II milk price. The witness noted that since 1990, the butter price has been reduced under the Federal price support program while the cost of nonfat dry milk has risen. Noting also that the butterfat differential computation was changed in mid-1990, these two developments have significantly increased the cost structure for Class II products, particularly for lower to nonfat Class II products.
