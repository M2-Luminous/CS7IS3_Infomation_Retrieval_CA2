It has gone ahead in spite of months of criticism by the opposition who boycotted the elections leading up to the conference and say they distrust the intentions of the ruling military council, led by General Sani Abacha. From Lagos, Sola Odunfa reports. [Begin recording] [Odunfa] Virtually all the delegates attended the short opening ceremony in a serene but colorful atmosphere. Gen. Abacha's address to the delegates was a review of Nigeria's recent political history and arguments for and against both the presidential and parliamentary systems of government. He urged the conference to find and recommend a system which would guarantee the nation's stability by accommodating all shades of political opinions and ensuring the full participation of all parts of the country. He repeated his earlier statements that his government was on what he described as a rescue mission and that its life span would be determined by the decisions of the conference. While he was speaking in Abuja, the union of petroleum workers was issuing an ultimatum in Lagos. Addressing a news conference at the headquarters of the Nigerian Labor Congress [NLC], the petroleum workers union, Nupeng [National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers], gave the military government up to this weekend to restore all democratic political structures which were abolished last November and to install the winner of the last presidential election believed to be Chief Moshood Abiola who is now in detention awaiting trial for alleged treason. The union said that if the government did not meet the deadline, it would call all its members out on strike from next Monday [4 July], thereby paralyzing the petroleum industry, including fuel supplies. I asked Mr. Frank Kokori, the union secretary, why the petroleum workers were acting in isolation of all other 41 unions in the Labor Congress. [Kokori] I am acting on behalf of Nupeng. Nupeng is an industrial trade union, so there is no question of isolation. Other (?people) could come in sympathy with us. [Odunfa] When you say other progressive unions may join you, which are these unions? [Kokori] Well, I will not mention them. Those of you who have been following the media reports for some time now, you....[pauses] People are talking about 13 unions. People are talking about 10 big unions. You go and make your research. You will know the big unions I am talking about. [Odunfa] Why do you choose to act alone, why not in concert with other unions under the umbrella of the NLC? [Kokori] We are thinking that in situations like these, you do not just follow conservatives blindly. In situations like these, in revolutions all over the world which you know, there must be a vanguard that will galvanize the people. Nupeng today remains the only viable vanguard in this country that could sustain such a revolution. But I assure you, other progressive forces will join henceforth from today. [end recording] To get the Nigerian Government's view of events, Robin White called up Alhaji Aminu Saleh, the head of the civil service, in Abuja, and he asked him if the constitutional conference had got off to a good start. [Begin recording] [Saleh] The conference started very well. The attendance was beyond what we expected. The enthusiasm of Nigerians to see that some element of democracy is coming up is so encouraging to those of us in government and outside government. [White] You said the attendance was better than you expected. What kind of turnout were you expecting? [Saleh] We were expecting that the turnout would be only those that were elected and their supporters, family, friends, etc, but the generality of people are very anxious and they turned up, the turnout was very, very encouraging. [White] Did you see any people there who might be considered to be supporters of Chief Abiola? [Saleh] Could we say that this is a matter which is more regarded as matters arising. The Nigerians have passed beyond this. [White] They have passed beyond Abiola? [Saleh] They have passed beyond Abiola with the start of the conference. [White] But you think all Nigerians have forgotten him? [Saleh] Well, there may be one or two supporters, but when you are working in a democracy and you have the majority going one way, you assume that the majority carries the vote. [White] Could I ask you where Chief Abiola is now? [Saleh] Chief Abiola is in the hands of the police, and he is well, safe, and he will be brought before court. [White] But where exactly is he? [Saleh] He is within Nigeria. [White] Is he in Lagos, or is he in Abuja? [Saleh] He is within Nigeria in the hands of the police. [White] Why are you not prepared to say exactly where he is? [Saleh] Well, he is in the hands of the police. I am the secretary to the government. I would not be able to know the movement of every Nigerian. [White] But surely, you must know where he is? [Saleh] I know where he is, and I say he is within the four walls of the country. [White] Are you not prepared to say where he is because if you did, there might be big demonstrations around the police station where he is being held? [Saleh] There will be no demonstrations in Nigeria. As I said, Nigerians now go on to another agenda. [White] But, surely, he still has massive support in some areas of Nigeria? [Saleh] Of course, yes, he is a son of the soil. Not everybody will say no, but definitely, the majority of people now want to move forward. [White] Do you yourself believe that this Abacha government really intends to hand over to civilian rule? [Saleh] I am part of the government. I am the secretary to the government and we say... [pauses] Two days ago, I was addressing the press representatives and I say we are going to act according to what we say, and that is what we are doing now. [White] I wonder if Gen. Abacha might be a little worried about a coup attempt against him? He went round last week warning the soldiers. [Saleh] Gen. Abacha is the commander in chief, and it implies that he has a responsibility not only to the civilian community but also to the Armed Forces community, so for him as a commander in chief to go and see the people he commands is only normal. [White] But why was it necessary to warn them? [Saleh] Well, I do not know what to say about this except to say it is the normal regimental [word indistinct] to warn your officers and your junior officers to be on the alert and to behave in a military way. [White] Do you think anybody might be plotting at this time? [Saleh] I think Nigerians are more concerned with the progress of their country, to move forward rather than going back. [White] What about junior officers? Do you think some junior officers might be brewing something? [Saleh] Well, the junior officers, I believe, are with their senior officers and what I know from all information is that everybody is only interested to see that things go forward. [White] So you think you are over the hill now, and things are going to get back to an even keel? [Saleh] I have been in government before for 35 years. I worked with every person who was head of the Nigerian government, from Azikiwe to Babangida. I worked with Shonekan as minister of finance. When I am talking about governments, I know what I am talking about. [White] And you think this government is doing well? [Saleh] The government is doing far beyond what people expect, except that they do not talk too much, they work more. [White] How do you rate Abacha compared with the other people you have worked with in the past? [Saleh] Abacha (?listens) very well, and he is very decisive. [end recording]
