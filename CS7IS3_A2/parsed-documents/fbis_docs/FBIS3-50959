The report contains a list attributed to the Attorney General's Office [PGR] that includes priests, legislators, teachers, and PRD [Party of the Democratic Revolution] figures are among the rebel leaders. Attorney General Jorge Carpizo today sent a letter to EXCELSIOR editor Regino Diaz Redondo stating that the PGR has not provided that information. It is obvious, Carpizo indicated in his letter, that the document does exist, but it has not come from the PGR. The official added that as far as he an the PGR are concerned, having a series of rumors and false statements attributed to them constitutes the most serious blow that could be dealt. Carpizo said the rumors are intended to destroy what has been built through much toil and that they harm the foundation for dispensing justice.
