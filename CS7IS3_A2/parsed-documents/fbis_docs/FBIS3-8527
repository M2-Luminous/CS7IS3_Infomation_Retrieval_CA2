The U.N. Human Rights Commission has adopted a special resolution alleging, in the absence of any valid explanation and evidence, that the Albanian minority in Kosovo-Metohija is being subjected to a brutal policy, summary arrests and even mass executions. However, Yugoslav authorities deny the truth of this, insisting that there have never been any mass executions of ethnic Albanians in the province, and that only those ethnic Albanians have been arrested who have been actively involved in the movement to detach Kosovo-Metohija from Serbia and Yugoslavia. In combating the separatist movement, Yugoslav authorities have acted in strict accordance with the law and have taken no action that would not have been taken by any other state in similar circumstances. A strong separatist movement has been active in Kosovo-Metohija for decades, striving for the province's violent secession from Yugoslavia and annexation to neighbouring Albania. The Russian representative to the U.N. Human Rights Commission moved that the resolution should not be put to the vote, explaining that individual positions included in the resolution had been incorporated, albeit in a milder form, in an already adopted omnibus resolution on former Yugoslavia. The motion was supported by most Western countries, except Germany and some Nordic states, but the resolution was nevertheless voted in place, having been upheld by the Moslem countries which make up an overwhelming majority in the commission. Most ethnic Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija are Moslems, and neighbouring Albania is a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
