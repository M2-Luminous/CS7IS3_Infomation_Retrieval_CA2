[Lugo] Good evening. [Garrido] As we have heard, 1994 will be a year of challenges for the farmers and for our country in general. What are the main goals of ANAP for 1994? [Lugo] With the Agriculture Ministry and the Sugar Industry Ministry, ANAP plans to contribute to the sugarcane harvest. The farmers and cooperatives will do what they must do. We will also contribute to the food plan by exploiting, to a maximum, the production capacity of the cooperative and farming sectors. [Garrido] In other words, in 1994 the ANAP will not abandon its production potential. [Lugo] No. We cannot do that because we know the people need the products we grow and produce. As the weather improves, and once we can get more money, we will continue to increase production. We are also working along other well established guidelines aimed at consolidating the cooperative movement. Today, more than ever, we must consolidate our cooperatives. We must do this, especially now that the country has created the Basic Cooperative Production Units [UBPC]. We currently have 1,118 cooperatives; of these 1,008 are profitable. We have approximately 172 cooperatives that are not reporting profits, and we are going to work with these cooperatives to consolidate the cooperative movement and ensure that it truly becomes an example of efficiency and production. This is one of our main guidelines. We are also working on consolidating the credit and services cooperatives. We want these cooperatives to grow strong. We want these cooperatives to have some money. The sugarcane workers are now being allowed to purchase their own tractors, forklifts, and carts. This enables them to do their own harvesting, their own cutting and lifting. We believe this is something we must work on because it is important. [Garrido] What about idle land and the economic aspect? [Lugo] In addition to the agreement that created the UBPC, the Central Committee is encouraging groups of comrades to join and form new UBPC's to work land that is idle. The agreement also states that the state will give land that is good for growing tobacco to those comrades who wish to work the land and grow tobacco. Hundreds of comrades in the tobacco growing provinces are joining the movement. They are now producing tobacco and products to feed themselves. [Garrido] This year marks the 35th anniversary of the creation of the agrarian reform law. Will the ANAP be discussing the economic measures with its farmers? [Lugo] Yes. On 23 January we will hold our first meeting with farmers and cooperative members from all over the country. We are going to discuss the economic measures the country should adopt. I have no doubt that farmers, the men and women who have always participated in the country's great tasks and missions, will discuss the measures and suggest those that should be adopted. On this 35th anniversary of the agrarian reform law, I believe it is our duty to participate in these discussions just as our working sector is doing.
