FBIS3-50312 "dreeu018__a94011" FBIS-EEU-94-018-A Document Type:Daily Report 27 January 1994 ANNEX Hungary Minister Proposes Dissolving Extremist Parties AU2701115394 Budapest MTI in English 1118 GMT 27 Jan 94 AU2701115394 Budapest MTI Language: English Article Type:BFN [Text] Budapest, 27 January (MTI) -- Secret Service Chief Minister Without Portfolio Tibor Fuzessy sent a letter to Chief Public Prosecutor Kalman Gyorgyi, asking him to contact the court for the dissolution of the Party of Hungarian Socialist Workers [magyar Szocialist Munkasok Partja, MSZMP] and the World National Popular Rule Party (VNP), the daily NEPSZABADSAG reported on Thursday [27 January]. The MSZMP split from the former state party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, when it changed its name to Workers Party at the proposal of Chairman Gyula Thurmer. The extreme-left MSZMP commemorated the anniversary of the Russian revolution on November 7, 1993. At the celebration, which was broadcast on television, five-pointed red stars were displayed in contravention of the law banning the use of extremist symbols, the letter says, adding that the party defines the 1956 Hungarian revolution a "counter-revolution." Concerning investigations into the activity of the VNP, Fuzessy does not exclude the possibility, according to NEPSZABADSAG, that the party will undertake preparations to seize power by force, and that its activity will be found to amount to instigation against the community. Fuzessy confirmed the information as basically correct in an interview by the newspaper. Under the 1989 Association Law, the Prosecutor's Office can initiate court proceedings against law-breaking political parties. A party may be dissolved if it commits or incites a crime, or violates the rights of others. Independent experts estimate VNP membership as barely more than 100.
