In a statement by the president of the Security Council, the Council "strongly urges" the DPRK only to proceed with the discharge operations at its 5-megawatt reactor in a manner which preserves the technical possibility of fuel measurements as required by the IAEA. In a letter dated May 27 to the U.N. secretary-general, the IAEA said if the discharge operation at the 5-megawatt reactor continues at the same rate, the IAEA's opportunity to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in accordance with IAEA standards will be lost within days. The Security Council said it is "gravely concerned" by the IAEA's assessment. The Security Council also asked the IAEA director-general to maintain IAEA inspectors in the DPRK to monitor activities at the 5-megawatt reactor. During the Security Council consultation before the adoption of the president's statement, China's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Li Zhaoxing urged the IAEA and DPRK to make further consultations on the technical measures for monitoring the discharge of nuclear fuel rods and reach agreement as early as possible so as to ensure the continuation of nuclear safeguard monitoring. Li reiterated China's view that the final way to solve this nuclear issue is by dialogues and negotiations between the related parties through channels that have been established, and all efforts by the international community should contribute to this goal.
