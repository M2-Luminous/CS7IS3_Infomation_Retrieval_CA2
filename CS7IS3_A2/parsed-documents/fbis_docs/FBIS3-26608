After the announcement from Washington, sources in the shipping industry, which is widely considered to be a barometer of international trade, said big orders from U.S. buyers may not start coming in before the U.S. government works out final clarification regarding tariffs on Vietnamese-made goods. However, some local firms maintaining production lines in Vietnam which had been indirectly exporting Vietnamese-made goods to the United States by relabeling them in third countries will see their costs significantly reduced as a result of the U.S. policy shift. International shipping lines are getting ready to handle an increasing amount of business from transfers of Vietnamese cargo to U.S.-bound ships. "We expect a lot of exports (to the U.S.) now," said one official at Evergreen Marine Corp's Taipei office." "This is good news for the shipping industry." The lifting of the embargo "will certainly pioneer a lot of good opportunities in the shipping industry for all merchants," he said. According to the Evergreen official, firms in Vietman wanting to ship to U.S. ports will be able to do so right away because Evergreen already operates feeder services from Haiphong to Kaohsiung and from Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon) to Singapore, where cargos can now be easily transferred to U.S.-bound ships. "The service was already there, so we can transfer to U.S.-bound ships immediately," he said. Most other international shippers also have similar Vietnam services, with the notable exception being U.S.-owned lines, which are expected to get new routes to Vietnamese ports going as soon as possible. The potential for increased exports between Vietnam and the United States "is very big," the Evergreen official said. "Just like it has been in the mainland." However, conditions at poorly maintained port facilities in Vietnam are far from ideal and it may take some time before necessary improvements can be made to them, he noted. Another official working at a major foreign shipping carrier's Taipei office said he doesn't expect a sudden rush in U.S.-Vietnam shipping "because it will still take some time" for U.S. companies to work out deals with Vietnamese exporters and sign contracts. Authorities in the United States still need to make some important decisions regarding tariffs on imported goods from Vietnam, he said, so American importers will probably wait to see if Vietnam gets the United States' most-favored-nation trade status or other special trade privileges before making any large orders. It could take about nine months to one year before-direct U.S.-Vietnam trade really starts to develop, he said. Meanwhile, "trade between Vietnam and its Asian neighbors is already flourishing" so the lifting of the embargo probably won't have much of an effect on outbound shipments there, at least for the short term, he said. However, American shippers which now can book loads in Vietnam might experience an increase in inter-Asian business, he said. According to ROC [Republic of China] government estimates, Taiwan is Vietnam's No. 1 source of foreign investment capital, with more than US$1.5 billion invested to date, mostly in low-end, labor-intensive production lines based in the southern part of the country. Many of these investments were made by local entrepreneurs in the hopes that the U.S. would soon lift its embargo against its former war-time enemy.
