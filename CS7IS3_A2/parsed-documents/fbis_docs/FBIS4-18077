In order to promote economic development, the top income and corporate tax rates are to be standardized and brought below 45 percent in a three-stage tax reform. This is urgently necessary in international competition, the minister told DPA on Wednesday [30 March]. Moreover, those taxes that are independent of yield, such as the trade capital tax and the property tax, have to be reduced. The Social Democratic Party of Germany, however, confirmed its intention to increasingly burden "major property" by a land tax, a property tax, and an inheritance tax. In 1993 the top income and corporate tax rates were further split. They are currently 45 percent for corporations, such as stock corporations, and 47 percent for trade or business income from partnerships, while the tax on private income, which also includes income from leasing and renting, is still 53 percent. According to Rexrodt, the planned tax cuts still have to be coordinated within the FDP and the coalition. However, "from the economic minister's point of view, 1996 is the date when the top rates have to be cut," including the taxation of private income. However, the financial situation has to be taken into account. Therefore, a reform in several stages as in the 1980's is required. This also includes increasing the fiscal subsistence minimum, for which the Constitutional Court has called. The question of when the solidarity surcharge can be removed also depends on the financial situation and the economic development in eastern Germany, he said. [passage omitted]
