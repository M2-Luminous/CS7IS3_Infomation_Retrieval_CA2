Ambassador Albright will brief the Slovene leadership with the conclusions of the NATO summit that will take place on 10 and 11 January. This will primarily involve NATO's security cooperation with Central and East European countries and the so-called partnership for peace. In Kucan's opinion this issue is very important for Slovenia, which is a small country with rather limited possibilities for investment into armament. However, other issues that will supposedly be discussed are also interesting for Slovenia, for example, the issues concerning the functioning of the United Nations, part of which are humanitarian aid, implementation of measures, work of the war crimes tribunal, and expansion of the UN Security Council. Milan Kucan also believes that the talks with Madeleine Albright in Slovenia will also be an opportunity to discuss relations between the states, as Ms. Albright is a good connoisseur of the situation in Slovenia and in the region.
