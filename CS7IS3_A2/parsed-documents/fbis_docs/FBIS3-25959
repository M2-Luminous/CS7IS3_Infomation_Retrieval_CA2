At that time, the State Foreign Exchange Administration will publish average foreign exchange prices based on the banks' transaction prices; that is, a floating exchange rate system with controls worthy of the name will begin, an authoritative figure disclosed. According to this figure, at present, the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Transaction Center is making basic preparations for work in this area; and related state departments will make the final examination and decision and give approval. The designated banks would be members [as published] and have the right to conduct foreign exchange transaction operations. Some foreign-funded banks might also become members and carry out such operations should their applications be approved. In addition, they might entrust members to carry out operations in this area. Since 1 January this year, the dual-track foreign exchange prices have been merged; generally speaking, however, no floating rates have been seen in the mainland foreign exchange market as of today. The explanation by this authoritative figure on this point was: The merger is still at the initial stage, and in a transition period at that; hence the plan has not been implemented to the full. The State Foreign Exchange Administration continues to use the right to fix the average prices based on the foreign exchange quotations provided by the 18 foreign exchange regulation centers across China, that is, the previous foreign exchange transaction order is being maintained. After 1 April, the designated banks will start foreign exchange transaction operations, and then a floating exchange rate system with controls worthy of the name will have been founded; at that time, some minute fluctuations in foreign exchange quotations might surface. The authoritative figure especially emphasized that no major fluctuations would arise. The authoritative figure said that with banks starting to conduct foreign exchange transaction operations, the existing foreign exchange regulation centers across China would face two sorts of conversion: First, the dozen or so major local foreign exchange centers would become branches of the national foreign exchange transaction center; and second, some of the foreign exchange regulation centers would be converted to economic companies, that is economic companies in the main providing foreign exchange information.
