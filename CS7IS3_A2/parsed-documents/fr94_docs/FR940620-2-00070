FR940620-2-00070 FR940620-2-00043 [Release No. 34&hyph;34199; File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;04] Self-Regulatory Organizations; The Depository Trust Company; Order Granting Accelerated Approval of a Proposed Rule Change to Implement the Interactive Capabilities and the Electronic Mail Features of the Enhanced Institutional Delivery System June 10, 1994. On April 13, 1994, The Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;04) under Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 to implement the interactive capabilities and the electronic mail features of the enhanced Institutional Delivery (``ID'') system. 2 Notice of the proposal was published in the Federal Register on May 13, 1994. 3 The Commission received three comment letters supporting implementation of DTC's proposal. 4 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78(b)(1) (1988). 2 The Commission recently approved the overall concept of the enhanced ID system. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33466 (January 12, 1994), 59 FR 3139 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;93&hyph;07]. The approval order sets forth a description and discussion of the enhancements being made to the ID system and requires DTC to submit for each principal new feature the finalized rules and procedures in a proposed rule change filing under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. The Commission also recently noticed the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced ID system. For a description and discussion of the standing instruction database feature, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33679 (February 24, 1994), 59 FR 10444 [File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;01]. 3 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34018 (May 5, 1994), 59 FR 25133. 4 Letters from John Zupan, Chairperson, Bank Depository User Group, to Secretary, Commission (April 28, 1994), from George J. Minnig, Chairman, Securities Operations Division, Regulatory & Clearance Committee of the Securities Industry Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 29, 1994), and from Lawrence Morillo, Senior Vice President, Pershing, Division of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (May 12, 1994). I. Description The proposed rule change enables ID system users to use the ID system interactively. Specifically, this enhancement allows for the interactive receipt of trade input and affirmations and for the interactive distribution of confirmations and certain trade reports. It provides users with the capability of accomplishing all ID system processing within a single business day. ID system users have the option to continue to use the ID system in a batch mode. The proposal also implements two optional electronic mail features. 5 These features enable ID system users to send and receive ``notification of order execution'' and ``institution instruction'' messages. A notification of order execution can be sent by a broker-dealer to communicate the details of an order execution to an institution. If the institution accepts the notification of order execution, the institution can send the broker-dealer an institution instruction containing information ( e.g. the allocation of shares in a block trade) which is needed by the broker-dealer in order to enter trade data into the ID system for the preparation of confirmations. Currently, broker-dealers and institutions make telephone calls, send facsimile transmissions, or utilize the services of a private electronic trade confirmation vendor to communicate this information. 5 The filing which proposed the overall enhanced ID concept discussed three electronic mail features ( i.e., ``notification of order execution,'' ``institution instruction,'' and ``institution request for cancellation/correction''). The cancellation/correction feature is not ready for implementation at this time and therefore is not a subject of this approval order. When DTC is prepared to implement the cancellation/correction feature or any other new electronic mail feature, it should submit a proposed rule change filing under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. II. Discussion Section 17A(b)(3)(F) 6 of the Act requires that the rules of a clearing agency, such as DTC, be designed to promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. As discussed below, the Commission believes that DTC's proposed rule change is consistent with this obligation. 6 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1(b)(3)(F) (1988). The Commission believes that the electronic mail features will enable ID system users to eliminate their reliance on telephone calls or facsimile transmissions when communicating information such as the details of order executions or allocations for block trades. The Commission believes that transmitting this information electronically is more efficient and accurate than the methods currently used and, therefore, will promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of institutional transactions. The Commission also believes that the interactive capability is essential to the industry's conversion to a three business day settlement cycle, which will be the standard settlement time for most broker-dealer trades beginning June 1, 1995. 7 Because interactive capability will enables ID system users to confirm and affirm institutional transactions in one business day, it should facilitate users' ability to settle their transactions on the third day after the trade. 7 For a detailed description and discussion of the conversion to a three business day settlement cycle, see Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33023 (October 13, 1993), 58 FR 52891 [File No. S7&hyph;5&hyph;93] (adopting Commission Rule 15c6&hyph;1). DTC has requested that the Commission find good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of the filing. The Commission finds good cause for so approving the proposed rule change because the electronic mail features and specifically the interactive capability are critical to converting to a three business day settlement cycle and should be implemented as soon as possible to provide ID system users with time to become accustomed to the new features before June 1, 1995. III. Conclusion On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act, and in particular with the requirements of Section 17A of the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder. It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act, 8 that the proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;DTC&hyph;94&hyph;04) be, and hereby is, approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 9 9 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12) (1993). Margaret J. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
