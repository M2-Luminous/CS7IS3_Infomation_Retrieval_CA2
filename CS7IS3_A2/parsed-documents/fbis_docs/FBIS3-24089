Roshchina: "Mayor of Vladivostok Seeks Revenge, Creates Own Party"] [Text] "Party," it is a word, of course, spoken emphatically. However, in this case it may simply represent a public organization of V. Cherepkov supporters which opposes the kray's "corrupt Communist groups" in power headed by Ye. Nazdratenko. All of the new organization's verbal and written efforts indicate that the latter is so. The decision by "Cherepkovians" to form the new group was made at the last meeting held between the mayor and the community in the "Gray House" on January 15th. After lengthy debate those gathered elected a presidium of active members and approved a name for the organization, "Assotsiatsiya izbirateley [Association of Voters]." The name, in the opinion of those who spoke, reflects the organization's democratic atmosphere and its open membership not only for the citizens of Vladivostok, but for those in the kray, and in any other political party or association. The primary task of the organization at present is to strive to win in the upcoming elections to the kray Duma. In doing so, the group hopes to gain a significant number, if not a majority of seats so as to present a serious legislative counterbalance to the kray executive power. We have lost some elections, stated V. Cherepkov, and won some too, like Zhirinovskiy and Nazdratenko. We cannot waste time. Today candidates were selected from other representative bodies that will finance the elections for them. They are already being instructed on how to present themselves in public and how to appeal to the voters. Therefore, we must act in an organized fashion, not haphazardly. As far as financing for the new organization is concerned, Cherepkov noted that an account already exists, into which money is being deposited in his support. He said that it is his desire to transfer the account over to the Assotsiatsiya izbirateley [Association of Voters]. Judging by all appearances, the organization's first step will be to submit a whole package of demands to various authorities, starting with the President and ending with the local SMIP [mass information and propaganda media]. From the president the organization is demanding the reinstatement of its former representative in the kray, V. Butov; from SMIP, the publication of a list of people who prepared the order leading to Butov's removal. The association is also demanding two hours a week of radio broadcast time from the Primorskaya teleradiokompaniya, and one hour a week of television time: like the governor, the mayor also wants his own "Mayor's Hour." A demand was also made to put PKTV back on the air, and yes, this time without specifying to whom the demand was being addressed. While on its crusade to capture the mass media, it has not been beyond the association to utilize the services of even KRASNOYE ZNAMYA, which is not well liked by the organization. The mayor stated, for example, that "if we are not allotted at least one release a week for publishing our association's material, it will be necessary to pose the question of cutting off KRASNOYE ZNAMYA's financing at the taxpayers' expense." Cherepkov also mentioned intentions to create yet another new newspaper (apparently at the expense the city administration), which will tentatively be called "Golos naroda [Voice of the People]," and will reflect the opinions of the voters. For those who are curious: the association's meetings, which V. Cherepkov's will participate in - and for whom they will simultaneously serve as meetings with the community - will be conducted on Saturdays at 14:00 hours in the city administration building.
