This was stated at a press conference in Moscow today by that country's ambassador in Russia, Yusuf Abdullayev. The statement was made in light of an accusation made against Uzbekistan by the Afghan president, whose representative recently visited Moscow. In particular, it was alleged that the Uzbek side was interfering in the internal Afghan conflict by supplying weapons to the forces of that country's rebel Prime Minister Golboddin Hekmatyar and his allies. The Uzbek diplomat rejected such an accusation and emphasized that what happened in Afghanistan was the internal affair of the Afghan people. At the same time, the ambassador confirmed that in accordance with agreements Uzbekistan was indeed rendering aid to the northern regions of Afghanistan. This aid, however, was purely civilian in character. Last year electric power to a value of $14 million was supplied and about 100 joint Uzbek-Afghan enterprises were set up. This was reported by ITAR-TASS.
