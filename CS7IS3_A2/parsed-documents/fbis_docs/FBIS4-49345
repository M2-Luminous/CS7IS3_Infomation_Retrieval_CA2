Professor Xu Liangying, who for many people personifies the ideals of science and democracy first evoked during the 1919 May 4 Movement, said two police officers had been placed at the entrance to his apartment building yesterday morning, preventing him from leaving. In Tiananmen Square, authorities hosted official functions to stop dissidents from holding pro-democracy activities at the scene of the June 4, 1989, massacre. In an early morning ceremony on the square's windy expanse, 10,000 youths, including middle school pupils, police cadets and workers, pledged allegiance to the party's Communist Youth League. They stood in formation behind leaders holding large red flags, and thrust their right fists into the air as they vowed to struggle for communism. Van-loads of plainclothes and uniformed police were posted on and around the square all day. In a telephone interview yesterday, Professor Xu said: "It is very important that there be free and open discussion of science and democracy on this anniversary, but it is obvious they don't want me to talk about it." After being allowed a certain amount of freedom over the past few weeks, Professor Xu said it was ironic that the authorities should choose the 75th anniversary of a patriotic movement to restrict his movements once again. "They clearly still think it is a very sensitive date," he said. The Government used the anniversary to urge the country's youth to uphold "the fine tradition of the May 4 Movement" and shoulder the "historic mission" to bring China into the 21st century. The official party newspaper, the People's Daily [RENMIN RIBAO], said the fundamental goal of that mission was to stress the study of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping's theories on developing socialism with Chinese characteristics and adherence to the party's basic line. Professor Xu, however, found the connection between Deng Xiaoping's theories and the spirit of May 4 a little hard to swallow. "That's ridiculous," he said. "What has Deng got to do with May 4?" Students at Beijing University, one of the most active colleges during the May 4 Movement, were equally doubtful. "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion," an economics research student at the university said of the editorial. Reading Mr Deng's works was useful in understanding modern society and the economy, he said, but there was no need to study the patriarch's theories religiously. This year's anniversary celebrations have been kept relatively low key by the authorities in order to prevent China's youth from getting too carried away with the spirit of the May 4 Movement. But most students at Beijing University were not in a particularly festive mood anyway. There was no way for students to enjoy anniversary activities not sanctioned by the school authorities even if they wanted to, another student said. Likewise, he said, it would be virtually impossible for students in Beijing to be able to mark the fifth anniversary of the June 4 massacre. Despite being downplayed by the authorities, most students interviewed at Beijing University yesterday said the May 4 Movement was still of significance for today's younger generation. The spirit, idealism and patriotism of May 4 was still evident, it was just expressed in different ways, they said. The ideals of "science and democracy" were still held by many students although the development of the legal system was equally important, the economics research student said. Most students, however, were more concerned with developing their own potential. [passage omitted]
