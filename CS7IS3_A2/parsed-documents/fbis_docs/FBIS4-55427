The date of the interview, which took place in the Croatian resort town of Makarska, is not given. The topics discussed are solely of an economic character. In the introduction, the author observes that prior to his appointment, Valentic was director general of the INA petrochemical plant, and that, over the 14 months in office, he managed to stabilize the economy of Croatia and launch its fundamental transformation. Privatization has started and, albeit with some problems, the banks are being financially consolidated. "For seven months now, Croatia has recorded zero growth in consumer prices and, according to the prime minister, the annual rate of inflation will not exceed 10 percent. Foreign currency reserves increased from zero to $1.6 billion, and are expected to reach $2 billion before the year is over. The prime minister does not consider the country's foreign debt amounting to $2.8 billion to be a significant problem, especially if tourism can be brought up to its former level. Valentic regards this year's season to be a test of the Croation economy." While "this year's tourism revenues are expected to exceed 2 billion German marks [DM], they should reach the prewar level -- i.e., DM6 billion -- within a few years." Asked about the protection of foreign investment, Valentic said that "the government provides all the guarantees including the transfer of earnings abroad." He emphasized the internal convertibility that will also apply to the new monetary unit, the kuna, which will replace the dinar on 30 May. Replying to a question regarding the restrictions choking down business activities, Valentic said: "In order to reduce the inflation of 50 percent per month to 10 percent per year, we had to adopt radical measures. Rather than artificial, these measures are based exclusively on the economic basis. It is a combination of anti-inlationary steps in the monetary, fiscal, and wage spheres." Valentic also emphasized that a tax reform was launched -- the tax legislation is harmonized with the European standard, and the rates will be gradually reduced. Furthermore, according to him, "the orientation of the Croatian economic policy is clear and, I believe, correct, and we do not intend to change it." The fact that "so far, the country managed to bear the burden of the conflict without any financial assistance from abroad," is explained by the prime minister by "the existence of small farms working 3 million hectares of land and producing double the amount of food Croatia consumes." Additional help is provided by Croatia's own oil and gas covering 20 percent of the total consumption, and the source of foreign currency in the form of 3 million Croats living abroad, who are responsible for an inflow of DM3 billion per year. Of course, the demand for capital is much higher and, according to Valentic, "Croatia has a moral right to foreign assistance." The first foreign credit in the amount of $138 million should be obtained from the World Bank in June, and additional credits of between $400 and $500 million from the IMF should follow before the end of the year. Refugees are a great financial burden, but a large part of the original 600,000 people already returned to their homes. The prime minister considers the return of the territory occupied by Serbs a necessary condition for solving this problem and normalization of the situation. "The principle of inviolability of the border must be the golden principle," he said.
