FBIS4-9927 "drlat065_o_94001" FBIS-LAT-94-065 Daily Report 4 Apr 1994 Colombia Prosecutor Office Concerned Over U.S. `Sanction' Prosecutor Office Concerned Over U.S. `Sanction' PA0404184794 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 in Spanish 1730 GMT 4 Apr 94 PA0404184794 Santa Fe de Bogota Inravision Television Cadena 1 Spanish BFN [From "National Newscast"] [Text] The Prosecutor General's Office is concerned. The United States is definitely not sending evidence on drug traffickers to Colombian authorities. Although there was no official announcement, the truth is that, in practice, the sanction is being applied. The Prosecutor General's Office has not received a single piece of evidence against Colombian drug traffickers from the United States for the past two months. The last evidence received was against Julio Fabio Dinol and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela for drug trafficking. According to Francisco Jose Cintura, the acting prosecutor, the refusal to send information on drug traffickers is worrisome because the evidence sent by the United States has been overwhelming and has served to convict 17 individuals. [Begin Cintura recording] The cooperation of the U.S. Justice Department has been important in consolidating several cases, including those of the Ochoa brothers, Gonzalo Mejia Sanin, and 17 individuals whose extradition was pending when the National Constitutional Assembly banned extraditions. The U.S. Government should carefully examine the decision because such a negative decision can only benefit drug traffickers. [end recording] Particularly in the cases against the Ochoa brothers, the United States sent accusations of cocaine trafficking and the testimony of U.S. drug traffickers who incriminated them. In addition, it sent recordings of telephone conversations intercepted by the DEA as evidence against certain Cali Cartel members. Although there is concern over the announcement by DEA Investigations Director Robert Nieves to suspend the exchange of evidence to Colombia, the Prosecutor General's Office not only cooperates with the United States but also exchanges evidence with Russia, Italy, Mexico, and Peru.
