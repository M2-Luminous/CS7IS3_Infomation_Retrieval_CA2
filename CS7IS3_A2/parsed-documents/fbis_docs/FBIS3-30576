Intensive mortar, cannon and tank fire was opened on the region of Smiljcici, Kasici (west of Benkovac) and on the villages in the Novigrad hinterland. The attacks wounded one Serb soldier, and inflicted considerable material damage on civilian targets, thus forcing the Serb troops to respond. The Croatian forces also staged provocative attacks on the Skradin hinterland, the Drnis front and the area of Plasko in Lika while, in the other parts of the front, the warring sides observed the ceasefire. The Croatians launched offensive actions despite the Christmas ceasefire, which was agreed late last year and extended on two occasions. It remains in force until February 28. The republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.) was proclaimed a U.N. protected area (UNPA) and, under the Vance plan, 14,000 U.N. peacekeepers were sent there in early 1992. The plan called for an end to the fighting between Croatian army and the local Serbs. R.S.K. was proclaimed by the local Serbs in territories where they are in the majority in response to Croatia's forcible secession from the former Yugoslav federation.
