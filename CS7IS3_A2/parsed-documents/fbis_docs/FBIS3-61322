The Reforms Must Be Started All Over Again"] [Text] Prospects Why, actually, is there the widespread opinion that democracy failed in the December elections? There is no doubt that the results of the elections were unexpected and many people were simply shocked. It is also true that we are still a long way from true democracy and recognized political pluralism. But even under these, to put it mildly, extraordinary conditions, after the bloody crisis in October and two months of actual authoritarianism, democracy immediately produced its results as soon as the valve of the election points was opened up for it. These results come from the working of a feedback mechanism between the people and the state leaders. This is one of the fundamental and indispensable functions of democracy and it is manifested most distinctly through general elections. Here again we should not console ourselves with illusions. The loss by the government party, Russia's Choice (whose presumptuous name now sounds rather amusing), and the immense shortage of democratic and centrist blocs along with the solid success of the nationalists and communists cannot be explained away by random or attendant factors. Essentially the Russian people gave the strictest warning to the ruling circles that they must not continue to rule in this way. The social organism is sending a strong and painful signal to the effect that it is seriously ill and the course of treatment of the past two years has not brought improvement but has severely exacerbated the disease. But this pain itself is both dangerous and salutary at the same time. It is dangerous because if the previous policy is continued the pain will increase and ultimately destroy the organism; it will cause irreversible degeneration and then death. It is salutary because if the signal is taken seriously and the course of treatment is correctly altered there will be every possibility of averting tragedy. In the situation that has developed, both a negligent attitude toward the results of the elections and gloomy fatalism or panic are equally destructive. And it is not that "the people are always right"--history provides many examples of nationwide self-destruction, including through fascism, imperialism, and militarism. It is simply that the people are what they are and any program of reform must be adapted to this particular country with all of its specific features. The reverse will not work: the people cannot be selected to fit the program. No theoretically ideal reform is worth its salt if it works for distant England or even nearby Poland but is rejected by Russia and opens up access to power for extremists. Nobody except the people themselves can carry out a reform in Russia, and if an immense and ever increasing part of the society lets the ship of reform pass them by, ultimately it will be overturned and everything will sink to the bottom: advanced and backward, right and wrong. The main truth of the current moment is that the majority who voted for Zhirinovskiy are not so stupid and naive as to believe his easy promises and give themselves over to cheap demagogy. They voted that way out of a feeling of protest against what is happening in the country and also because they did not see any clear and attractive alternative. Herein also lies the key to the solution to the problem, the path to the rescue of the democratic reforms. In his speech on 22 December President Yeltsin noted that the elections to the Duma showed that the administration is "falling short of its task." I am afraid that the president was being too kind to himself and his subordinates. In the current situation this is very alarming. We have had enough of protecting the president from criticism, from truthful information about the real state of affairs, from nondepartmental assessments of the prospects for economic and social development, from what people are saying about him and his government. To offend and anger the president is less dangerous now than to indulge the complacency which has already manifested itself so fatally during the election campaign. The bitter truth is that the preceding state of the reforms was a failure, and cosmetic patching up, personnel reshuffling, and administrative leapfrog will not rectify the situation. We must no longer speak about "continuing the course of the reforms" but about radically revising both the methods of development of the policy and the policy itself. Over a period of two years industry has declined by 40 percent, and more in consumer goods production than in defense and heavy industry. Actual consumption decreased by 40-60 percent. Some 30 percent of the population ended up on the brink of disaster. The structure of the economy changed even more in the "Soviet" direction--in favor of the extraction branches. The same thing pertains to exports. The national currency is "working" only in the sense of its being exchanged for freely convertible currency, and nobody uses it for savings or investments. Just an enumeration of the various aspects of the unprecedented collapse, degeneration, and uncontrolled behavior that have appeared in all areas of our life would take up too much space, and quite enough has been written and said about this. It is important not to console ourselves with illusions, as though these are temporary difficulties and it is impossible to carry out such great transformations without them. The previous policy has completely exhausted itself and we are left with a delicate balance between hyperinflation and hyperunemployment, and its continuation will ultimately lead to both of the above at the same time. I will not resort to the assessments of nongovernmental economists such as Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Nikolay Petrakov, Oleg Bogomolov, or Stanislav Shatalin--they too are sufficiently well known. I will turn to the statements of Yegor Gaydar, who even after the elections stated once again that the government's main goal is to put an end to inflation through a balanced budget so as to provide for savings and investments and thus bring about economic growth. And it was literally right at this point that he admitted that demonopolization and privatization were not working and it was not without irony that he called for everyone who has solutions to these problems to support the government. How can that be? After all, without demonopolization and real privatization the mechanism for investments, competition, and economic growth will never begin to work. To find the practical solutions the first deputy prime minister is asking for would indeed be extremely difficult. But without them how can we count on any economic growth (except in the sphere of trade and speculation) even with decontrolled prices? After all, now 87 percent of Russian enterprises either belong to the state or controlling blocks of shares in them are in the hands of bureaucrats. The mechanism for self-perpetuating inflation is implanted in the very basis of the "liberalized" Soviet economy, which has obtained as a result of a two-year attraction to monetarism. It was revealed by an adviser and advocate of the government program, Yevgeniy Yasin: If we produce money--prices will increase because there will be more money; if we do not produce money--prices will increase because production will decline and there will be fewer goods. If there is no solution to the key problems of demonopolization and privatization so far, we must search for them with redoubled energy and for the time being abandon all hope of a deficit-free budget and "financial stabilization." Free prices and full store shelves that are accessible to the minority, exchanges, commercials, vouchers, and shares--all these are merely the wrappings, an imitation of a market economy without the internal motive mechanisms. It will never work just as the Papuan plane will not fly (after the war natives of Papua went out into the meadows and began to build a facsimile of an aircraft out of branches in the hope that the kindly Americans would fly to them again and bring them cigarettes and chocolate). If, having gone through the cycles of the fight against inflation, we turn the financial screws even tighter, abolish subsidies, and no longer provide wages and cut state social programs (as Boris Fedorov suggests) the economy will simply grind to a halt and tens of millions of people will be left without a means of existence. Then who will handle the accumulations? And what will they invest in even if there is zero inflation? And what kind of political stability can one hope for by 1996 with this kind of situation? After all, ultimately a market economy is not a goal in itself. Democracy is impossible without it, but a market economy in and of itself by no means guarantees democracy and progress. Both Bangladesh and Somalia have market economies too, but they have neither democracy nor prosperity. Nor should one forget that Hitler's Germany was based on a market economy and it lived in harmony with concentration camps, Gestapo terror, and an all-out suicidal war. The price and costs of reform are not as important as the final goal--70 years on a path to a "bright future" should have taught everyone this. What we need now is not switching of offices but the creation under the president of a broad independent committee of leading experts so as, in the first place, to clarify on the basis of complete information the real state of affairs resulting from these two years of reformism and to tell the whole truth, regardless of how bitter it may be. And, in the second place, to suggest ways of getting out of the crisis irrespective of dogma and the personal affiliations of officials, tailoring them to the objective conditions of the Russian economy and sociopolitical situation. This path must be followed based on the broadest possible coalition of all democratic forces of the society and above all the parliamentary factions. In this connection we may speak about the unity of democratic forces. Anatoliy Chubays and many Russia's Choicers after him hastened to lay the blame for the results of the elections on other democratic blocs which supposedly fragmented the reformer front. But that is nothing but an attempt to shift the blame. If all these parties were to form a bloc with Russia's Choice they would have simply divided up among themselves the same electorate that voted for Choice. And their own followers either would not have participated in the elections at all or some of them would have voted for Communists, increasing their representation in parliament even more. The main mistake of the democrats who did not belong to Russia's Choice was that they were unable to join together and were unable to provide a democratic alternative to the course of the government and Russia's Choice that was clear-cut and attractive to everyone who was not against reforms and democracy in principle but would not accept what had been done in the country during the past two years. If this had happened the democratic opposition would have had many more positions, and the Communists and nationalists would have had fewer. Extensive unification of democratic forces, and above all in parliament, is more necessary now than ever before. But not on the basis of collective suicide, automatically following Gaydar down a blind alley, but on the basis of a radical revision of it. And it would be desirable, of course, together with Choice..., the government and the president, if they were to draw the correct conclusions in the December elections. The question of the new constitution is closely linked to this. Specifically, it would be a great mistake to rely, as Vladimir Shumeyko and certain other figures close to the president are now suggesting, on the authority of the executive power enlarged in the constitution and the curtailed rights of parliament. The main problem is that the Basic Law appeared on earth with grave inherent flaws. They were brought about by the secrecy of its development, the open pressure of free discussion, and the relaxed procedure for adoption, which allowed the constitution to pass with the support of only a few more than one-fourth of the voters. An easy victory does not cost much, and the objective achieved at this price may quite well turn out to be illusory. A constitution that has not undergone the difficult test of the broadest public discussion, which does not fully reflect the balance of forces and the consensus of the main political forces in the country, which has not received the endorsement of the real majority of the voters--is not likely to really become the basic law of life of our immense state. Either the constitution will be transformed into an object of political confrontation from the very beginning or it will be simply ignored by all parties and will motivate them to search for nonconstitutional forms of struggle. With a continuation of the previous policy, even if there are partial adjustments, the sociopolitical balance of forces will inexorably change in the direction against the president and lead to his isolation, and no written prerogatives will help him retain control of the situation. (Thus all of the extreme provisions turned out to be ephemeral for Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991.) But with a radical change in policy and the formation of a broad coalition in support of democracy and the new course of the reforms the domination of the president and the executive structures will be simply superfluous and excessively burdensome for them since it would impede efficient division of labor and responsibility among the branches of power. Another extremely serious illusion is that conducting the reforms requires maximum concentration of power in the president and the executive organs. Proponents of "enlightened authoritarianism"--from Andranik Migranyan to Valeriy Novodvorskiy--are defending this idea especially actively now in light of the results of the election and the adoption of the new constitution. Well, we will have no problems with authoritarianism, we are used to that. The only question is how to ensure enlightenment. Possibly during the times of Petr I, who adorns the emblem of Russia's Choice, there was no other way than to "write edicts with the knout." Probably even in our day there is no other way in a number of Asian countries. But for a nation that is basically European such a path holds no promise. Political oppression beats down the people's economic activity as well, and for market reforms, as distinct from Petr's or Stalin's, it is above all necessary to have lively participation, enterprisingness, self-expression, and self-respect of the largest possible proportion of the population. The state must merely direct them into a civilized, legal channel. Hopes placed in the personal qualities of Boris Yeltsin, who will not abuse power, are completely naive, and not simply because man is mortal and his character can deteriorate, as the president himself recently admitted in an exchange with Eldar Ryazanov. The problem is much deeper. Authoritarianism gives the leader only the illusion of a free hand. But in fact by releasing him from restrictions imposed by the parliament, the courts, the press, and public opinion, at the same time it makes him a slave to the bureaucratic complex and a victim of intrigue and bickering among favorites for positions closer to the throne. They are the ones who stand to gain from authoritarianism, and not the leader-reformer. As distinct from democratic freedoms and a system of checks and balances, a bureaucracy works unimpeded to refine the art of selecting information. It skillfully leads the leader to the decisions it needs, interprets their practical implications according to its own will, and does not allow the possibility of monitoring execution or obtaining an objective assessment of the results. An example of this--the long-awaited edict on the land--has already been provided during the short period of the presidential monopoly. They hastened to adopt it before the legislators could get in their way and it immediately turned into its opposite, strengthening even more the rural nomenklatura's power and possibilities of getting rich. True freedom--within the framework of constitutional authority, of course--is provided to the leader only by a democratic environment that presents alternative sources of information and the possibility, in conjunction with the legislative and judicial powers, of controlling the bureaucracy. But this kind of system will not tolerate arbitrariness on the part of the president and will force him to engage in constant political work to ensure parliamentary support for his policy, and it will place high demands on the reputation of his subordinates to preserve the reputation of the entire administration. It is understandable that democracy does not work according to the ideal plan anywhere. It certainly does not provide a guarantee against mistakes, and sometimes serious ones. The point is this: the absence of democracy, regardless of the personality of the leaders, guarantees mistakes and the impossibility of correcting them promptly and, ultimately, the failure of the policy and the state. This pertains fully to the current Russian reforms as well. In an authoritarian system the leader will very soon be forced to serve the interests of the nomenklatura and above all its power structures. Otherwise they will simply remove him or make him ineffective. Both Khrushchev and Gorbachev learned this through experience. On this plane, the fact that the Third Army, in spite of an order to vote for Choice..., voted for the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] is as alarming as it is explicable. With respect to the army, President Yeltsin committed one of the most serious of his mistakes, and it was of a dual nature. On the one hand, in two years nothing was done to establish effective political control over the army. On the other hand--the military were drawn into internal political conflicts against their will, which reached its culmination in October. Both of these are dangerous individually, and together--even more so. After the elimination of the army political organs the armed forces were essentially left on their own. In order to survive under the conditions that have developed in recent years they needed radical reform. But no state department anywhere is ever able to reform itself. The more so one like the military: with its rigid hierarchy, deep traditions, enormous departmental structure, and the existing economy. Without strong and purposeful political leadership the reform of the army was clearly doomed. It did not succeed, and as a result even the concept of "military reform" disappeared from the recently adopted military doctrine. The army ended up in an extremely difficult condition: the state did not have the funds to reduce and reorganize it and there was no money to maintain it at its present size. Hence the growing dissatisfaction among the military because of the failure to solve numerous problems, of which the shortage of housing, the failure to pay salaries, and the shortages in recruitment are only the most critical. Political control of the army cannot be based on good relations between the president and the minister of defense. Personal factors are too fragile and changeable a basis for such a complex and important matter. Real political control over the army is possible only under two conditions: the existence of a civilian ministry of defense with its own apparatus and the active role of parliament in all aspects of defense policy. These are indispensable conditions for a democratic structure. There are democratic countries that have no armed forces at all, but there is no country with an army that does not have the two aforementioned conditions for civilian control. And, conversely, in all authoritarian regimes the military is in charge of the ministry of defense and frequently combines this post with the presidency. It is not without reason the Soviet leaders too (Stalin, Brezhnev) loved to amuse themselves with high military ranks and luxurious uniforms. All this is no accident and it is certainly not a matter of the intellectual and psychological peculiarities of the military. The essence is that institutionally the most intelligent and peace-loving military leader in the post of minister of defense will always be a representative of the army in the government. And the most narrow-minded and rigid civilian person will always be a representative of the president in the army and a proponent of his policy. The minister is also the intermediary between the military and the parliament, which raises difficult questions and checks on efficient expenditure of allocations. The new constitution and military doctrine have established practically complete elimination of parliament from military affairs. All control has legally been placed in the hands of the president, but this is merely on paper. In fact he remains one on one with a giant military establishment and himself is dependent on it. This "feedback" is so great that the army is drawn into internal political conflicts in an inadmissible way and has actually been made the arbitrator in their resolution. Indeed, during the October events the armed forces against their will had to choose for themselves which president and minister of defense to obey. And then they had to perform functions that are not appropriate for the army, which dealt a stronger blow to the prestige and moral condition of the army than August 1991 did. Even worse is that these functions have now been officially assigned to the army according to the new military doctrine, as though we do not have enough internal forces, specialized subdivisions, and OMON's [Special Purpose Militia Detachments]. Voting for the LDPR is not only a sign of protest against the terrible disintegration in the armed forces. And it is not only a response to Zhirinovskiy's military-patriotic advances. To an enormous degree it is also an expression of an attitude toward the October events, a strict warning to the head of state. And no purges or punishments will help here. They will alienate the military even more and place them in opposition to the political leadership. We need an in-depth reinterpretation of the policy of the Russian leadership in the military sphere and a radical change in the mechanism for political control of the army and the decisionmaking system. Regardless of what the level and composition of the armed forces may be, the army must be fully provided with everything necessary to carry out its tasks, occupy a worthy position in society, be under effective civilian control, and be completely removed from deciding issues of internal politics. Today everything is proceeding in precisely the opposite direction. If things continue this way, the army will decide that it can remove and install presidents. (And here Russia has the great traditions of the Streltsy, the Preobrazhensk units, and the Semenovites.) Relying on force is a double-edged sword and it is far from being as obedient a weapon as it might seem. The power game is a game in which democracy will always be defeated. In this game President Yeltsin will find stronger and more perfidious rivals, and they will not be linked to the turbulent history of 1991-1993. Democratic reforms in both the economy and politics may be carried out only within the framework of a rule-of-law state, on the basis of a balance of interests of all nonextremist groups of the society. Force creates only the illusion of a rapid and radical solution to problems. In fact force cannot solve a single problem of democratic construction; it only exacerbates problems and produces diametrically opposite results.
