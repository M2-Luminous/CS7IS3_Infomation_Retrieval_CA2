Their candidacies have been discussed in the factions and in a certain sense they reflected the parliament's multilevel composition. And complex composition. When the five sat down at the table the auditorium guffawed loudly -- the central seat was taken by Vasil Durdinets, who heads the centrists' faction. To the right was Aleksandr Moroz, leader of the socialists and a presidential candidate. On the left was Vitaliy Masol, first premier of the independent Ukraine, who was "swallowed up" by the students' hunger strike. To his left was Petr Simonenko, leader of the Ukrainian Communists, who gained 86 seats out of 350 in the parliament and represent the most powerful faction. And next to them was Vyacheslav Chornovil, the eternal opposition member and romantic knight of anticommunism. The People's Rukh which he heads received about 30 seats and in the present situation could seriously influence the adoption of important decisions. The word faction is a new one in the Ukrainian dictionary of party work. The old Supreme Rada was quite homogenous. At the new elections the candidates ran not on party lists but under party slogans and now in the first hours of its work the session has raised the tough question of identifying allegiances. The more than 100 deputies who are reluctant to join anyone and, like Kipling's cat, prefer to "walk by themselves" are of some inconvenience to the members of all five factions. Without particularly consulting with them they are trying to unite them into a mixed group whose status and rights are not completely clear to anyone. One of the most curious documents in the first package of documents proposed to the deputies is the guideline list of the most important issues for examination at the first session. There are 124 of them. They include acute, socially painful questions of privatization, price formation, the use of nuclear energy and radiation energy, the credit and monetary system, and others. The rayon to which the village of Shumlyany in Ternopol Oblast will belong is probably also a very important question for the village's inhabitants but without curbing corruption and crime, without checking inflation and creating an effective system for all branches of power, Ukraine will simply cease to exist as an independent state. The 124 questions include a report by Leonid Kravchuk on the political and socioeconomic situation, a Ukrainian Government report, the formation of the government, and many other truly fateful questions. Like, for instance, the point on additions to the law on the demarcation of powers between the organs of state power of Ukraine and the Republic of Crimea, they contain only a hint of their acute nature. Yet the Crimean pickets arrived before anyone at the Mariyinskyy Palace and were the last to leave. But in contrast to the Sevastopol inhabitants with their red flags and portraits of Lenin and Stalin, to whom we are accustomed, these stood with yellow and blue banners and demanded that the Ukrainian Parliament protect Crimea's Ukrainian population from psychological terrorism. The demand of a deputation of Crimean public and political organizations that the question of the situation in Crimea be included on the agenda for the first session was distributed among the deputies and journalists. Otherwise, the petition-bearers threaten, they are prepared to declare a long-term hunger strike in front of the Supreme Council, to appeal to the world public and Ukrainian people for support, to urge the people to civil disobedience, and to create in Crimea an alternative representative organ of Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars, claiming that all responsibility "for the further development of events in Crimea will rest with the Ukrainian Supreme Council." The deputies' outward lack of haste and boring meticulousness on questions of standing orders and procedural details are not concealing the tension behind the scenes. One of the main issues of the first session is the election of a chairman and his deputies. In the opinion of analysts Aleksandr Moroz, Vasil Durdinets, and Ivan Plyushch, who is still in the shadows, have the greatest chances of becoming speaker. The very important question of holding presidential and local council elections or, as Leonid Kravchuk insists, of putting them off until later, is also so far outside the picture.
