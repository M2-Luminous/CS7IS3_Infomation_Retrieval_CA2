FBIS4-61451 "drsov088_f_94008" FBIS-SOV-94-088 Daily Report 29 Apr 1994 National Affairs Official Releases Data Regarding Drop in Production, Wages Official Releases Data Regarding Drop in Production, Wages WS0505115494 Kiev KIYEVSKIYE NOVOSTI in Russian 29 Apr 94 pp 1, 2 WS0505115494 Kiev KIYEVSKIYE NOVOSTI Russian BFN [Report by Valeriy Popovkin, chief of the department dealing with shaping socioeconomic strategy: "Ukrainian Economy: Are All Resources Exhausted"] [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] During the first quarter of 1994, in comparison with the same period last year, the national income was reduced by 36 percent, the industrial output by more than 38 percent (machine building industry by 47 percent; chemical industry by 45 percent; light industry by 100 percent: ready made garments by 60 percent, and shoes by 66 percent). The general production of consumer goods fell by some 40 percent, while nonfoodstuff goods by 45 percent. Production of essential products of the black metallurgy shrunk by 30-70 percent. Let us not forget that over 1993 it fell by 20-40 percent. We can see how the entire sector -- producing essential products for the machine building industry -- that is the basis for the technological progress is dying. The development of transport is unthinkable without metal products. Cuts in production in the fuel-energetic sector is continuing. Coal extraction fell by 16 percent, production in the oil processing industry -- by 45-60 percent. The production of electrical energy decreased by 17 percent. In our opinion, skyrocketing prices were and continue to be the key reason for this critical situation. They limit the demand and opportunities of trading in products. Despite the catastrophic reduction in production, the warehouses and trading facilities continue to amass huge amounts of unsold products. For example, this especially concerns the production of furniture and tiles, 70 percent of which are not in demand. Given the reduction in the volume of crediting within the framework of the governmental antiinflation program, mutual debts of enterprises considerably increased. Only over January-February 1994, the general volume of debts between enterprises and organizations of Ukraine increased by one third and exceeded 300 trillion karbovanetses. The mutual nonpayments of debts increased by 2.6 times. A specific proportion of loss making enterprises increased from 16 to 24 percent. Despite the stable prices on imported energy resources, the increase in wholesale prices in industry (by 54 percent since the beginning of the year ), prices for construction and installation work (in 2.3 times by the fourth quarter of 1993), and retail prices is continuing. The emission of money is in full swing. The crisis in the investment sector is deepening. The production of the most important types of building materials fell to 40-70 percent, capital investments and costs of construction and installation work was reduced by 37-38 percent, and the volume of contractor work -- by almost a half. The Ukrainian transportation system is experiencing a total crisis. Due to a reduction in production and extremely high transportation tariffs, cargo shipments by vehicles was reduced by 55 percent and by railroads -- by 65 percent. In comparison with the first quarter of 1993, the volume of retail turnover fell almost twice. Figures representing cuts in average wages in the state sector of the national economy look extremely absurd. Notably, the highest wage was registered in the banking and social insurance sector -- it exceeded the average wage three times and was 3.2-times higher than the wage of a researcher. People, who produce material and spiritual values, have been totally excluded from priority compensations. Motives for conscientious work have been wrecked. However, very soon we will not have anything that could be redistributed. The situation demands the adoption of extraordinary measures, first and foremost, regarding a decrease in prices to liberalize the consumers' demand, the lessening of the role of the state in the regulation of prices for essential goods to raise work motivation, correct and stabilize the national currency rate, and liberalize the taxation policy. Apparently, the government is convinced that both the national resources and people's patience are inexhaustible.
