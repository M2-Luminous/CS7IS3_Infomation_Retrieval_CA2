Nouhak Phoumsavan, president of the LPDR. The official visit to the LPDR by H.E. the SLORC chairman and his party takes place after an exchange of a series of visits by the delegations at various levels from the two countries, for instance the friendship visit to the Union of Myanmar by H.E. Prime Minister Khamtai Siphandon in late February 1992, which ended in glorious success, thus becoming an important step in the development and strengthening of the relations of friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, this visit -- the first foreign visit by H.E. Gen. Than Shwe in his capacity as SLORC chairman of the Union of Myanmar -- is regarded as a great honor for the LPDR. It is also an event of great significance in the history of the long-standing fine relations of friendship and good neighborliness between Laos and Myanmar. The visit will enable the peoples of the two countries to understand one another more profoundly, thereby contributing to further enhancing the relations of friendship and cooperation in various fields between the two countries; to more fruitfully benefitting the Lao and Myanmar peoples; and to building peace, stability, and cooperation for development in Southeast Asia and the world. Laos and Myanmar have maintained fine and friendly relations over a long period of time. Our two peoples admire and respect one another and sincerely aspire to further strengthen our mutual cooperation and ties. In recent years, an exchange of visits by high-level delegations of the two countries has successively been conducted, acting as an important factor for gradually enhancing relations and cooperation in various fields. The peoples of Laos and Myanmar living along our common border regularly visit one another. Cross-border trade is also increasingly flourishing. The close brotherly relations have been distinctively displayed in the recent speedy demarcation of the common border between the two countries. An agreement will be signed on this during the visit. This important event will become an excellent model for all nations who are trying to solve historical border problems. On this occasion, we, the Lao people, would like to express our sincere thanks to the people of Myanmar for rendering material and moral assistance to us in combating natural calamities in recent years. We wish the Myanmar people more glorious achievements and prosperity in developing and building their own country. We wish the SLORC chairman and his delegation brilliant success in paying this friendship visit to Laos, thereby contributing to making more fruitful the existing traditional fine relations of friendship and cooperation between Laos and Myanmar and bringing more practical benefits to the two peoples in the future.
