FR940613-1-00055 FR940613-1-00006 E. Actions Taken to Protect Human Health and the Environment Because of the special position and role played by bona fide holders, as has been recognized by Congress in creating the statutory exemption from corrective action liability, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to include within the scope of protected UST or UST system activities certain lender actions which protect human health and the environment. EPA believes that there are a number of activities in which a holder may engage after foreclosure which can contribute to the protection of human health and the environment and in which the holder may engage and still meet the terms of the proposed rule's exemption from regulatory requirements. Such activities include: Release response and corrective action for UST systems, permanent or temporary closure of an UST or UST system, tank upgrades or replacements, environmental investigations, maintenance of corrosion protection, and release reporting. The Agency believes that protection of human health and the environment can be advanced by allowing a holder to participate in activities associated with environmental compliance either prior to or following foreclosure on an UST or UST system. Environmental compliance activities are generally considered to be integral to the daily operations of an UST or UST system, and a person who participates in those activities would typically be considered an operator. However, a reasonable holder may also undertake such activities in the course of maintaining its indicia of ownership in the tank to protect its security interest. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is appropriate to propose that environmental compliance activities, if undertaken by a holder, will nevertheless allow the holder to take advantage of the proposed exemption from regulatory requirements. The Agency is not proposing that these activities be required of a holder as a condition for obtaining the security interest exemption as an UST owner, but that holders be able to participate in these activities without losing the protection of the proposed exemption. Prior to foreclosure, therefore, and where the holder is otherwise permitted, 5 a holder may require the borrower to comply, or itself undertake to ensure compliance, with the subtitle I regulations applicable to the tank owner and operator (typically, the borrower), without being deemed an ``operator'' under the provisions of this proposed rule. EPA believes that a holder who is ensuring that a tank is operated as specified in 40 CFR part 280 (even if the holder is itself performing the activities authorized or required by part 280) is acting both to preserve the collateral (and therefore acting consistent with its capacity as a security interest holder) and to protect human health and the environment. It is appropriate for a holder to intervene in such circumstances in which human health and the environment are threatened by an UST owner or operator's improper management or operation of its tank(s). However, undertaking activities that bring the tank(s) into compliance (i.e., regulatory compliance actions such as tank testing, leak detection, upgrading, etc.) will not exempt a holder from complying with the UST corrective action regulatory requirements if the holder is otherwise involved in the day-to-day operation of the tank(s). All other acts of operation undertaken by a holder (such as filling the tank(s) with product, selling and/or dispensing tank product, performing overall management functions, etc.) are not shielded activities under this proposed rule because by doing so the holder displaces the borrower as the primary operator of the tank(s). 5 For example, where the lender is permitted pursuant to the loan document or under applicable state laws. Furthermore, following foreclosure, where the holder chooses to take advantage of the conditional exemption from the corrective action regulations by emptying and removing the tank from operation, as specified above, the Agency proposes that the holder may_without losing the protection of the proposed rule_undertake cleanup activities consistent with the corrective action requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart F at or in connection with the UST or UST system. EPA specifically requests comments on this aspect of today's proposal. IV. Financial Responsibility Requirements RCRA section 9003(d), as implemented by EPA at 40 CFR part 280, subpart H_Financial Responsibility, requires owners or operators of petroleum USTs to demonstrate financial responsibility for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental UST releases. As discussed earlier under Section III. A of this proposal, EPA is defining, for purposes of its Subtitle I corrective action and technical requirements, the term ``owner'' to mean that a holder who maintains ownership rights in an UST or UST system primarily to protect a security interest does not rise to level of a full ``owner,'' and therefore is not subject to compliance with those regulatory requirements. As described earlier, this proposed revision of EPA's corrective action regulatory program is consistent with the Subtitle I statutory security interest exemption. Similarly, the Agency believes that a holder is not subject to the financial responsibility requirements as an UST owner. The Agency is also proposing to exempt a holder as an UST operator from the financial responsibility requirements. Before a holder takes possession of an UST or UST system, a holder is not considered an UST operator, for purposes of EPA's technical and financial responsibility regulations, if it is acting merely as a holder and is not in control of the daily operation of the UST or UST system. Therefore, a holder typically is not subject to the UST financial responsibility requirements of 40 CFR part 280, subpart H as an operator prior to foreclosure. EPA is today proposing that a holder be exempted from corrective action as an operator after foreclosure if it ensures that its tanks no longer store petroleum and it complies with the temporary or permanent closure requirements specified in this rule. (See Section III. D. 2 of this preamble). In these situations, where the tanks are empty and pose little threat of release, it would serve no useful purpose to require a holder to demonstrate compliance with the financial responsibility requirements for corrective action. Therefore, the Agency is proposing to exempt holders who satisfy all the other requirements in this proposed rule from demonstrating Subtitle I financial responsibility for UST corrective action.
