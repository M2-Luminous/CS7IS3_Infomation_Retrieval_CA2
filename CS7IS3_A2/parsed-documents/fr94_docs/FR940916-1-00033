The existing FAR guidance on government property has undergone numerous revisions over the years to respond to concerns voiced by Congress, the GAO, the DoDIG, OMB, military audit agencies, and industry. The focus has been on storage of property; property accountability and reporting; storage of excess property; allowability of profits; contractor access to the DoD Supply System; property rollover from contract to contract; and so on. It is now appropriate to review these policies and procedures in the aggregate and to determine what improvements can be made in managing government property. Nancy L. Ladd, Director, Defense Acquisition Regulations Council. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;22958 Filed 9&hyph;15&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 5000&hyph;04&hyph;M
