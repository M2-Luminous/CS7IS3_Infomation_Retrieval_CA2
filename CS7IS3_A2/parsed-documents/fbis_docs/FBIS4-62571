Will Serbs and Muslims Accept Initiative by Russia, United States, and European Union?"] [Text] The Geneva meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, the United States, and five European Union [EU] countries at the end of last week enabled the "great powers" to overcome for the first time in a long time the differences in their approaches to the Balkan crisis and come up with a joint initiative on the settlement on the conflict in Bosnia. The Russian and West European diplomats' main achievement was the change in Washington's stance: Overcoming their original skepticism, the Americans accepted the initiative proposed by the EU and backed by Moscow on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In accordance with it, 49 percent of the republic's territory will pass to the Serbs and 51 percent to the Muslims and Croats. The most difficult question now is how to implement the plan. Both the Serbs and the Bosnian Government have their own views of the territorial rearrangement of the republic, and neither side is in a hurry to support the "51-49 option." The leaders of the Muslim-Croat federation are insisting on the transfer of 58 percent of the territory to them. As for the Serbs, at present they control more than 70 percent of Bosnia and, naturally, they do not have a burning desire to return the captured territory to their enemies. Will Moscow, Washington, and the EU be able to make both sides consider their opinion? There will be no big problem with the Muslims and Croats, apparently. In claiming 58 percent of the teritory they were presumably well aware that this proposal would not be seriously considered either by the Serbs or by the international mediators. The Bosnian Government is following the classic rules of haggling: First name an unacceptable price, and then gradually lower it. Unlike their enemies, the Serbs will have to make not imaginary but very real concessions and surrender more than 20 percent of the territory they control. According to the Geneva meeting participants' plan, the compensation for this would be the gradual lifting of the sanctions imposed on Yugoslavia. The question is: Will this compensation be sufficient from the Serbs' viewpoint. For Slobodan Milosevic and the other Belgrade leaders the prospect of emerging from isolation and averting the looming economic catastrophe is certainly attractive. But many Bosnian Serb leaders are radically inclined: Radovan Karadzic's latest pronouncements about the unacceptability of significant territorial concessions do not breed optimism. The Geneva talks did not clear up what is perhaps the most delicate aspect: Will the "great powers'" diplomatic initiative be backed up by military arguments in the event of either side's refusing to implement it. The United States, Russia, and the European Union evidently have yet to agree on the severity of their present and future joint actions. If they do not do so, the "51-49" option could be just an empty declaration, as has happened with innumerable peace plans put forward by the United Nations, the CSCE, and international mediators in the two years of the Bosnian war.
