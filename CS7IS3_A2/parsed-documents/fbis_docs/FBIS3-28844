Forty-seven years ago on this day, leaders of our national races were able to sign the Panglong agreement, the national unity and solidarity accord. The Panglong agreement, the result of national unity, became a source of strength for the anti-imperialist and national liberation struggle. [passage omitted] Even now neocolonialists and their dependents are still making attempts using various tactics to manipulate and interfere in our internal affairs and to cause the disintegration of national unity. In such a situation, our national brethren must be vigilant in countering the neocolonialist threat. It is evident to all that the State Law and Order Restoration Council [SLORC], since the time it assumed responsibility, has been giving priority to the affairs of the national races while upholding the three main national causes: non-disintegration of the union, non-disintegration of national solidarity, and perpetuation of sovereignty. In drawing up the new constitution, leading to a new democratic state, the national convention has also been able to formulate the basic principles which guarantee the unity and consolidation of the national races. It is also to be noted that the basic principles that guarantee the welfare of the national races are included in the 104 basic principles laid down by the national convention, which are to be framed in the new constitution. [passage omitted] As all the national races know, the SLORC, with a view to forging a firm, solid national unity, has been extending an invitation to the armed groups in the jungle. It is the right time for the armed groups in the jungle to give up their armed struggle -- which is impeding the development of their own people --return to the legal fold with dignity, and work vigorously for the welfare of the union and their own people. [passage omitted] I would hereby like to hope that all the national races will be able to work for the welfare of the union more extensively from the beginning of this significant and noble occasion of the 47th anniversary of union day, while upholding the four objectives of the union day: to ensure the perpetuation of the union, to keep all the national races ever united, to involve all the national races in striving for the emergence of the state constitution, and to bring about the national development and the emergence of a peaceful, prosperous and modern nation.
