It goes without saying that the Korean peninsula is the main target of the reactionary Radio "Free Asia," which will broadcast "news and commentaries helpful to the national interests of the United States." This is another move of the anti-socialist, anti-DPRK campaign of the United States. It shows they are executing in real earnest their "peaceful transition" strategy to disunite the DPRK ideologically from within. This is an intolerable challenge to the DPRK. It is self-evident that the U.S. scheme to start "Free Asia" broadcasting is aimed at sending the wind of "liberalization" into our country and thus instilling bourgeois ideology into the minds of the Korean people and undermining the Korean-style socialist system centred on the popular masses. The U.S. attempt to undermine the DPRK ideologically and culturally by false propaganda through "Free Asia" is as stupid as trying to move a rock with a mouthful of blowing. The Korean people firmly equipped with the chuche idea will never lend an ear to the bourgeois propaganda that does not appeal to their sentiments. The United States must clearly know the ideological will of the Korean people and stop the futile attempt to start the broadcasting of "Free Asia."
