Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Viking Gas Transmission Company (Viking) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, revised tariff sheets listed on Appendix A to the filing, to be effective February 1, 1994. Viking states that the purpose of this filing is to make several miscellaneous tariff modifications to reflect the acquisition of Viking's stock by Northern States Power Company and changes in personnel, addresses and telephone numbers occasioned by that acquisition. In addition, Viking proposes to: (1) Change the time for commencement of the gas day from 8 a.m. to 12:00 noon; (2) establish a minimum delivery threshold for the installation of electronic measurement equipment; (3) delete the PGA clause from its tariff, as no longer required; (4) eliminate references to Order No. 497 that are no longer appropriate in view of the Commission's recent finding that Viking is currently not subject to Order No. 497 (see East Tennessee Natural Gas Co., et al., Dockets Nos. MG91&hyph;4&hyph;001 et al., 65 FERC Paragraph 61,389 (December 23, 1993), mimeo at 39&hyph;40); (5) delete a reference to common operating personnel with Viking's former affiliate, Minnesota Intrastate Transmission System; (6) change the governing law in its pro-forma service agreements from Texas to Minnesota; and (7) revise the index of shippers to reflect contract modifications occasioned by implementation of Order No. 636. Finally, Viking has modified its tariff to correct several miscellaneous typographical errors. Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.
