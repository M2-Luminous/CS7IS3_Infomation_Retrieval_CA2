Expression that must be modern and democratic. Abdelhamid Benzine, a militant from the beginning and now editor of ALGER REPUBLICAIN, was kind enough to give us his impressions regarding that established fact. [Oukazi] Could you talk to us about the current situation in the national press? [Benzine] The media landscape has become very diversified in recent years. And what amazes me today is the publications that have recently come into being while others that were already in existence are suffering from a lack of funds and experiencing big problems with the printing and distribution companies. As far as ethics are concerned, things have progressed considerably. I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to all the martyrs: all the colleagues who have been killed and those struggling against death. As far as we are concerned, I would like to point out that we still have not heard from our reporter who was kidnapped several days ago. That being said, the press, generally speaking, is the prime expression of democracy. Terrorist harassment is engaged in precisely in order to halt that expression. We should point out that today's press is playing a prime role beyond the limits of its true role because of the political vacuum elsewhere. Party activity has recently been reduced to faxes published by the press. [Oukazi] Today's press is caught in the cross fire between a government that is watching for it to make the slightest false move and the criminal assaults by barbaric terrorism. How do you see the situation in those terms? [Benzine] The state is decaying, and the government is not homogeneous. As regards journalists, they have practically ceased to be what used to be called the fourth estate. They are playing the prime role in self-defense; they are in the vanguard. That being said, we must not generalize. There are journalists who are democratic republicans and bearers of modernity, and they are fighting for a democratic people's republic of Algeria--for respect for every individual and collective freedom--and then there are opportunistic journalists who are marketing men much more than they are fighters. One cannot cheat and say that information is neutral and objective. We all engage in ideology whether we realize it or not. [Oukazi] How do you see the struggle that journalists must engage in today? [Benzine] First of all, they must organize themselves. It will also be necessary to combat elitism. It is necessary to improve information and training. I am against corporatism. For example, I would not be in an organization that had fundamentalist journalists. I am in favor of an organization that respects the Constitution, the republic, and democracy and does not work for the implementation of shari'ah and then "an Islamic regime." Things must be clear. Moreover, I am in favor of dialogue among the democratic forces and not with fascism. Fundamentalism is nothing but a variation on archaic fascism, because fascism under Mussolini or Hitler was modern. For its part, fundamentalism is worse than that. So journalists must organize among themselves to improve their profession, information, and its guiding principles. At the same time, they must become integrated with a much more vast movement that must be republican, democratic, and oriented toward social progress. It is also necessary that there be solidarity among them. In all modesty, and also without false modesty, journalists must take their place in the fight to safeguard the country. I also believe that what has been done so far is better than nothing but that we are far from hitting the mark. Above all, it will be necessary for young people, who are more in tune with the times and more dynamic, to become imbued with this fight. [Oukazi] How do you see the country's future? [Benzine] There are two ways of looking at the future. One is a little narrow and, I would say, selfish, since it consists of seeing things from the standpoint of one's own life. Obviously, things are disturbing. The future two, three, or four years from now will be very hard. It is up to all patriots to fight to overcome the crisis. Since that is a matter of individual conscience, we must have no illusions, but we are still going to have a rough time of it. But from the longer perspective of history, I am optimistic. You know, just before the outbreak of the revolution in 1954, circumstances were different, but the crisis was just as serious. There were 22 people who had no support in society but who were aware that underneath the ashes were the embers that would burst into flame. Today I am convinced that the martyrs for freedom will not have died in vain. I am totally confident of that even though I know that nothing is inevitable in history. This is not optimism, but I am convinced that Algeria will emerge from this crisis and be stronger because of this experience. It is a matter of building a better world. We must be realistic, look at things calmly, and struggle. We must not give in to fascism. Sometimes we win and sometimes we lose because the struggle does not proceed in a straight line. But we must lead people to the certainty that the future belongs to the forces of progress.
