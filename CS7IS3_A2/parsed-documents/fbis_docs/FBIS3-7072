Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada issued a statement calling the assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio an "unfortunate incident" and offered condolences. The statement said if the incident was an act of political terrorism, it is a challenge to Mexico's democracy and all the more regrettable as Japan has been supporting Latin American nations' efforts to become democratic. Colosio was shot in the head and the abdomen around 5 P.M. shortly after finishing a campaign speech in a poor area of Tijuana. He died later in the evening. Colosio, 44, was the candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in presidential elections scheduled for August.
