Amalia Pando prepared the following report: [Begin recording] [Pando] Coca producers staged a massive ambush of 80 Umopar [Mobile Police Unit for Rural Areas] and Direco [Coca Reduction Directorate] agents and (chaqueadores) in Entre Rios between 0300 and 0600 on 5 March. As a result, one person was killed, 18 wounded, five individuals were taken hostage, and two jeeps and three pickup trucks were dynamited and set on fire. This is how Interior Minister German Quiroga reported what happened in Chapare: [Quiroga] We discovered two maceration pits in this area [pointing at map]. Our instructions in these cases are to destroy 1,300 square meters of coca plantations, that is, 10 percent of an hectare, more or less. Nearly 1,000 peasants stood by while we destroyed that coca. They accepted the destruction of the crops around the two pits, which they could clearly see. When Direco and Umopar forces started back to their vehicles parked on the road, they encountered a first group of peasants -- about 1,000 of them -- who were told that the people who were leaving were those who destroyed the maceration pits and the coca crops around them. The peasants opened the way and let them pass. But after walking another 250 meters, they encountered a second group of peasants -- also about 1,000 strong -- who blocked their way out. When the officials tried to withdraw they realized that the first group was behind them. Therefore, what happened here was an ambush. Between 2,000 and 2,500 peasants ambushed Umopar agents, Direco forces, and the coca cutters [macheteros] who came with them. They were all ambushed by the 2,000 peasants. Among them, nearly 500 were (chacas) and (boleros). (Chacas) are people who trade coca leaf while (boleros) collect cocaine paste. Nearly 25 percent of these 2,000 individuals were not peasants; they were not from the area. This was noticeable because of the way they dressed. They wore shorts, dark glasses, stripped garments, etc. The peasant leader then gave the order to attack. [Unidentified reporter] How large was the government force that was attacked? [Quiroga] Approximately 80 individuals, including soldiers and those waiting in the vehicles. As a result of the confrontation that followed the attack ordered by the peasant leaders, eight Umopar agents were wounded, including an officer who is in serious condition and is being treated at (Huayanini) Hospital in Santa Cruz. Ten Direco officers also were wounded. One of the prosecutors who followed the operation -- all operations are controlled by prosecutors under the Special Antinarcotics Force's charter -- also was wounded. He was speared in the abdomen and taken by helicopter to Cochabamba. In all, 18 people were injured during the confrontation and one individual died. He was a Direco employee. The peasants took three hostages. They are still being kept hostage at this minute. Two other Direco officials disappeared and their whereabouts are unknown. [Pando] Minister Quiroga said no one was injured among the peasants because Umopar forces did not use their weapons. The exception was a peasant who lost a hand trying to place a dynamite stick under a truck. Quiroga said the five vehicles waiting to pick up the coca cutters were dynamited, and that on the afternoon of 5 March another crowd set Direco offices in Ivirgazama on fire. Quiroga added that Umopar was able to disconnect a bomb made up of three small barrels filled with explosives. Regarding the identification of the machete holder who died in the ambush, Quiroga said his name is not known because the body remains in the hands of the peasants, adding that one of the hostages who managed to escape saw him. Quiroga said no one has been arrested so far, adding, however, that those responsible for the 5 March ambush and attacks will be arrested and placed at the disposal of the courts. Quiroga insisted that the government is ready to talk with Chapare leaders and is waiting for the confirmation of a meeting arranged with them in principle for 9 March. [end recording]
