ITAR-TASS learnt from the press service of the Pacific Fleet that such orders were given on Wednesday by fleet Commander Georgiy Gurinov. This extraordinary measure was prompted by the heinous murder of Major A. Tedeyev, officer-on-duty at a military unit, in Vladivostok on Tuesday. The terrorist act was committed by unidentified people at night. Several days before this accident, a group also of unidentified people attempted to capture one of the fleet's munitions depot. In the opinion of the Pacific Fleet commander, only extreme measures can now stop brazen criminals.
