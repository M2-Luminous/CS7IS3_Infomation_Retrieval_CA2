His confession on 50 type-written pages is published by the DIENA newspaper on Saturday. It is mostly devoted to a story on the years of his studies at school and Institute as well as of work in medicine and as foreign minister since October 1992. Andrejevs gave "agreement to supply limited information on his profession" to "a recruiter" in 1963 when he was chief republican anesthesiologist. The confession is written in the form of an open letter to voters, friends and legislators. Parliament suspended Andrejevs' mandate after his name, as well as the names of other lawmakers, were found in the catalogue of KGB agents. Addressing the Sejm, Andrejevs asked it to vote for preserving of annulling his mandate [as received]. He also noted that the Sejm should express its attitude to the post he holds: To leave him in the ministerial chair or to express no-confidence. The letter's author did not recognise himself guilty and noted that, to his mind, "appropriate political forces in Russia and, possibly in Latvia, did not wish his participation in the signing ceremony of the intergovernment treaties in Moscow. His negative attitude to the agreement on Russian war pensioners "did not pass unnoticed by enemies in Latvia and in the neighbourhood." According to Andrejevs' opinion, this is one of the reasons for making public five names of lawmakers. He said it is an absurdity that former leading statesmen whose privileged position had precluded, at that time, a possibility of their registration at KGB files, "can again, with impunity, occupy top political posts and not only in the Sejm" and seal the fate of other "suspects."
