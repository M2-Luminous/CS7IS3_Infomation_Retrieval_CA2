The Yemeni news agency, SABA', was informed by those sources that there are soldiers involved in the fighting within the ranks of units of the al-Ahmar mercenary gang, in coordination with the governments of the countries they belong to. The sources said that among these countries is Sudan, which is ruled by General 'Umar al-Bashir. Accordingly, Sudanese airports have been made available as assembly points for the military aircraft of 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the gang of the al-Ahmar clan to take off from and carry out military operations against al-Hudaydah Airport. These sources connected the position taken by 'Ali Abdallah Salih before the [word indistinct] parliament toward the call by the Arab League for the fighting in Yemen to stop, a stance that was the same as Sudan's, which considered the call by the Arab League as interference in Yemen's internal affairs. The sources went on to say that 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih is currently facing internal problems in Sanaa, arising from the losses incurred by his armed forces and their defeat due to the blows they received from the heroic armed forces representing national accord, unity, and democracy.
