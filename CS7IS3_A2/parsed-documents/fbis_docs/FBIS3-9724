He said this immediately after he learnt that Czech President had ordered the cessation of criminal proceedings for defamation of the president of the republic. [passage omitted] "I fundamentally disagree with the cessation of criminal proceedings for the opinion expressed in evaluation of Vaclav Havel's political activities after November 17, 1989 (the day when the anti-communist "velvet" revolution began in Czechoslovakia)," Cibulka told CTK. "Unlike communist criminals, StB [communist-era secret police] officers, judges, prosecutors, prison guards, and exponents of communist nomenclatura, who still remain unpunished and rule firmly over us, there is nothing I could be blamed for," Cibulka stressed. He added he wanted to use the trial to "accuse the communist-velvet oligarchy, headed by Vaclav Havel, of covering numerous crimes," noting that "those covering criminals are criminals themselves."
