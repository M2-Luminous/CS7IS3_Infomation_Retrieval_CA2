Last year the city approved 2,800 people with a higher education record, to study overseas, 1063 less than in 1992 and 2031 less than in 1991 while the 44 higher learning institutions in the capital last year registered 11,000 foreign students to study in the capital 3,000 more than in 1992 and 7,000 more than in 1991. Relevant personnel held that the above two sets of figures indicated the speeding up of reform and opening to the outside world as well as economic development in the country where an environment favourable for putting to good use intellectual talents is now forming. Young people no longer need to go abroad to study as there are many ways for them to gain training and with the stability of society and rapid development of education, the country has attracted a large number of foreign students to study there with Beijing alone having 11 000 such students from 127 countries and regions, 1,199 of them being non-paying students on scholarships and the rest self-supporting.
