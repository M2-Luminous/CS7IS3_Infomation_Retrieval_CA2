Bill Clinton can return home to boast of the complete success of his mission to the Vatican. The pope, standing up to welcome him without once leaning on his cane, was the first to impart some solemnity and at the same time cordiality to the meeting. Ambassador Flynn went rather too far by talking in terms of a "family meeting." But perhaps partly because of the symbolic scenario, because of the festive atmosphere that prevailed within the Vatican -- yesterday was the feast of Corpus Domini and offices were closed -- the U.S. President's visit ultimately acquired the status of a major event. But it was nevertheless an image operation. Clinton will not be able to do the same as his predecessor, Bush. Bush came to the Vatican in November 1991, in the wake of the dispute with the Vatican over the Gulf War. But then, just 24 hours after his audience, during his visit to Spain, he announced the U.S. involvement in the Balkans, thus responding positively to the pope's pressing request to him the previous day. Clinton, however, cannot do this. Their stances remained far apart on the main issue of their conversation -- the document on population and development being drafted for the Cairo conference. John Paul II reaffirmed the Vatican's criticisms of the plan, considering it lacking a clear ethical vision and judging it the prelude to an indiscriminate international legalization of abortion. Hence the appeal, as in Denver, to the "responsibility" of a great nation, which "originally and through the course of its history has always advocated the ethical values that lie at the root of any civilization." Clinton argued his own case. He cited the pledges made during his presidential campaign (when, however, he rejected the primitive pro-life stance) to correct the orientations of the 1984 Mexico City conference. He spoke about "safe, legal, and rare" abortion -- but only as a solution to the tragedy of the millions of women who die every year as a result of abortions performed with no guarantees of safety. He spoke about "access" to contraception, but only in order to curb population growth within the context of impoverished areas suffering environmental decline. Their stances remain distant. "And I do not think that the pope will change his mind," a White House spokesman said. But -- and this is the novelty -- Clinton apparently promised some changes to the Cairo document, at least in its language, an attenuation of some excessively peremptory statements. And as early as yesterday he provided some useful explanations: For instance, that, unlike China, he definitely does not regard abortion as a method of birth control. So the final result was an unprecedented joint commitment to a policy to promote a "responsible growth" of the population (demanded by the United States) and at the same time to reaffirm the "central role" of the family (a Vatican demand). This is certainly a very significant result. It joins the many points of agreement on the international situation, and especially the anxiety over the serious restrictions of religious freedom in Asia (China and Vietnam), the Islamic states' role in the future of the world, and the definition of the status of Jerusalem. So though in Mexico City in 1984 Reagan's United States was the Vatican's number-one ally over the population issue, Clinton's United States could now be so on the front of peace and international justice.
