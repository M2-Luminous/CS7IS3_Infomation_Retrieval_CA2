Karmi'el Mayor 'Adi Eldar has emerged victorious in the struggle to head the union. Eldar belongs to the Labor party. He won with a small margin of votes over his predecessor, Likud activist Maxim Levi. The third candidate, Eli Landau from Herzliyya, garnered 23 votes, later claiming that by drawing votes away from Maxim Levi he had influenced the results. Construction and Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eli'ezer, who directed Eldar's election campaign, said that it was the Arab vote that had proved decisive. The voting turnout was 100 percent. 'Adi Eldar, the elected chairman, praised Maxim Levi for exhibiting fair play. He said that he would enact changes in the Union of Local Authorities in Israel, noting that from now on all local council heads and mayors in Israel would work together.
