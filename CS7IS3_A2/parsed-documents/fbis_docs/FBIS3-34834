He said that the Cairo agreement of 9 February helped to make today's negotiations positive. In statements he made to correspondents at the conclusion of the second negotiating session today, Dr. Sha'th said that they discussed the tasks, number, and deployment of the Palestinian police in the areas from which the Israeli forces will withdraw. Sha'th refused to specify the size of the Palestinian force that the Palestinian delegation is asking to be deployed in Gaza and Jericho, noting that the Palestinian delegation had submitted a number of questions to the Israeli delegation and it is waiting for answers to them. The Israeli delegation also submitted a number of questions and is waiting to receive the answers to them. Official Palestinian sources said that these questions pertain to the types of weapons that will be supplied to the police forces, the [words indistinct] in the various areas, and everything pertaining to the maintenance of security in the Palestinian self-rule areas of Gaza and Jericho. Dr. Sha'th emphasized the need to reach agreement on the structure and number of the Palestinian police force, because there are many issues that must be dealt with. He noted that the entry of the Palestinian police into the Palestinian self-rule areas must precede the Israeli withdrawal and not come after it in order not to create a security vacuum in these areas. The head of the Palestinian delegation said that they also discussed issues pertaining to Palestinian-Israeli coordination and cooperation in the security sphere. Sha'th added that the two delegations have began drafting the general agreement that will be signed by Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin in Cairo. He affirmed that no specific problems emerged during today's two sessions, and that there was general progress. Regarding the issue of the Palestinian detainees, Sha'th said that this issue was not discussed today because not all the members of the Palestinian delegation were present. He indicated that it will be discussed at tomorrow's session. Asked about a timetable for the release of the Palestinian detainees from Israeli prisons, Sha'th emphasized that a final agreement will not be signed before a timetable is prepared for the release of all the detainees, including those who belong to Hamas. The head of the Palestinian delegation explained that all the detainees will be released in stages until next July. [passage omitted] Sha'th said that the final size of the Jericho area will be discussed at the next meeting between 'Arafat and Rabin, noting that the Palestinians expressed reservations regarding the maps pertaining to the Jericho area when they were signed in Cairo. The head of the Palestinian delegation added that an era of peace has begun, and all the problems pertaining to Israel's security fears must end, because when war ends, peace must begin. [passage omitted] Sha'th expressed the hope that the negotiations will be concluded during the month of Ramadan, noting that the delay that occurred in the past two weeks was political and not procedural. Asked whether the negotiations will be held in Cairo or Taba next week, Sha'th said that they have not discussed this issue yet. It has been learned that the Palestinian delegation wants the meetings to be held alternatively in Taba and Cairo while the Israeli delegation wants the negotiations to take place either in Taba or Alexandria, but not in Cairo.
