Other Matters Environmental Impact A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implements section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA). This Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20410. Executive Order 12866 This rule was reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Planning and Review, issued by the President on September 30, 1993. Any changes made in this rule as a result of that review are clearly identified in the docket file, which is available for public inspection in the office of the Department's Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW, Washington, DC. Impact on Small Entities The Secretary, in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), has reviewed this proposed rule before publication and, by approving it, certifies that the proposed rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The proposed rule would implement section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, which requires the Secretary of HUD to further define the term ``significant facilities and services specifically designed to meet the physical or social needs of older persons.'' The Department anticipates that the proposed rule will have an impact on some small housing providers. However, the number of small housing providers affected is not considered to be so great as to constitute a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12612, Federalism The General Counsel, as the Designated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, has determined that this proposed rule would not have substantial, direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on their relationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. The Fair Housing Act, and section 919 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 direct HUD to provide further guidance on the meaning significant facilities and services so that States, local governments, and housing providers will have a better understanding of what housing is exempt from the Fair Housing Act's prohibition against discrimination on the basis of familial status. Regulatory Agenda This proposed rule was listed as sequence 1662 in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda, published on April 25, 1994 (59 FR 20424, 20464) under Executive Order 12866 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.
