The United States and Israel will set up working groups of experts to discuss the details of the Israeli aid request, it was reported in talks held during Secretary of State Warren Christopher's recent visit to Israel. The granting of the U.S. aid to Israel will require special legislation in congress. The Israeli aid request has two components: 1. The storing of more than $1.5 billion worth of arms and ammunition in emergency storehouses in Israel. The equipment will belong to the U.S. Armed Forces and will be guarded by them, but will be put at the service of the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] during wartime. 2. Providing the IDF with sophisticated arms and intelligence, some of it state-of-the-art, so far not supplied to Israel. In addition, Israel wants U.S. aid to remain at the present level of $3 billion for some time. The secretary of state will arrive mid-month for another round of shuttle diplomacy between Jerusalem and Damascus. Israel wants clarifications about the Syrian peace proposal Christopher delivered a week ago. Senior political sources said that Israel's request for clarifications mainly concerns the security arrangements on the Golan and issues relating to the implementation of the arrangement in stages. They said that Israel rejects the Syrian demand for "symmetrical" security arrangements, and addresses questions to Syria on that issue. Israel also wants to know what the Syrians mean when they talk about normalization within the framework of a peace settlement. Political sources in Israel said yesterday they believe that the chances of an imminent resumption of the Washington peace talks are very low and that the negotiations with Syria will be focused on Christopher's shuttle diplomacy in the near future. Nevertheless, it is still unclear how long the secretary of state will have to invest in active mediation between Jerusalem and Damascus, and it appears that the formula for continued negotiations will be decided only after Christopher's upcoming visit and according to the progress that will be achieved in it.
