According to him, in the present circumstances "Viktor Chernomyrdin will have to justify himself and defend what Gaydar did over the past two years." In Baburin's opinion, expressed in an interview with Interfax on Monday, Gaydar's step was prompted by Russia's Choice in view of the 1996 presidential elections, "in order to distance themselves from the current economic situation, lay all the blame on Chernomyrdin and his technocrats, and force the entire opposition to start defending Russia's government in connection with Russia's Choice's attack on it."
