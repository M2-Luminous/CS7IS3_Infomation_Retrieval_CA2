Ostankino will shortly be showing a recording of this conversation but, given the interest in what is happening in Ukraine today, I would like to tell you in brief, as a participant in the discussion, about the main ideas voiced by the Ukrainian president. The Crimea Problem When asked by one of my colleagues whether the problem of the Crimea should not be resolved, given its complexity, by creating the institution of joint Russian-Ukrainian possession of the Crimea, the president countered with another question: What might such an institution mean, and is it at all feasible? Kravchuk remarked after giving not entirely clear explanations that this idea (or proposal) should come from the Crimean leadership but, in the opinion of the Ukrainian president, it would be naive to expect that kind of movement on their part. Today we are rather talking about the opposite: The Crimean authorities are first trying to obtain recognition for their state and then to join Russia. The upshot is that the idea of joint possession could turn into a situation where Russia would have 95 percent of the Crimea and Ukraine would have the remaining 5 percent, to which the latter would naturally not agree. A normal "civilized" solution is only possible within the framework of the existing Ukrainian Constitution. The Possibility of a Federal System in Ukraine L. Kravchuk was cagey on this issue. He cited the example of the United States and commented that a considerable amount of time is needed to create a federal state, particularly if it is born of of a unitary state like Ukraine. It is primarily necessary to formalize the legal basis for this process and, even with a highly professional parliament, this would take several years. Kravchuk thinks that for the formation of a federal state on German lines the conditions must be ripe. The danger of haste here is too great; it could jeopardize the existing Ukrainian state. The Origins of the Economic Crisis The president disagreed with the conclusion drawn by one of the participants in the meeting that the Ukrainian economy is terminally sick. Although he did not deny that the slump in production and the decline in the standard of living are continuing. Certainly, Kravchuk remarked, plenty of mistakes have been made in the course of reforms, but nevertheless he sees the main reason for the crisis as being the fact that Russia was too quick in making Ukraine pay for power sources at world prices (incidentally, these resources represent over half of Ukrainian imports). A particularly dramatic situation developed late last year when prices of oil and gas rose 10,000-fold in a short time (the president repeated this figure three times and then added that no economy would withstand that kind of ordeal). Even had we implemented reforms in an ideal fashion, Kravchuk summed up this part of the conversation, the "energy factor," that is an outside factor, would have nonetheless brought about a critical situation. Back to the Crimean Problem "The leadership of Ukraine and myself as president will never agree to the use of strong-arm methods to resolve the question of the Crimea," Leonid Kravchuk said firmly, in the spirit of, one might say, an official statement. "That would be a great calamity both for Russia and Ukraine, but calamity would above all befall our Ukrainian home." We expect the same attitude to the problem, our interlocutor remarked, from the Russian leadership and particularly from Crimea, although there is no confidence about this. The president said that he takes an extremely negative view of the appearance in the Crimea of Cossacks from Russia, which he sees as an attempt to lend the conflict the nature of the "Dniester scenario" and with which the Ukrainian side resolutely disagrees. Three Main Desires When asked which objectives he would be satisfied to see attained as a politician and state leader, Leonid Kravchuk said that he would consider his mission accomplished if progress occurs in the following areas. First, in stopping the slump in production and achieving albeit slight growth. Second, in consolidating and rendering irreversible friendly partnership relations between Ukraine and Russia. Every day, the president remarked, I repeat like "Our Father": War between our countries is inconceivable and, no matter what extremists on both sides do, we must not permit a tragedy; our peoples, our children, and grandchildren will not forgive us, nor will history. And finally the president's last wish is to reinforce in the national consciousness the sense of dignity and escape, as he said, from the "remnants of slave mentality" inculcated over the centuries by the empire -- first the Russian and then the Soviet empire. The Coming Presidential Elections Our discussion took place a few hours before the Ukrainian parliament decided that presidential elections will nonetheless go ahead 26 June. There is every indication that Kravchuk was prepared for that decision although the day before he asked the Supreme Rada to postpone the elections until later. Our interlocutor is prepared to take part in the presidential election race. He was diplomatic about the chances of the contenders, including his own. Nevertheless, he did conjecture that there will be no victor in the first round and that a second round will have to be held. A poll of voters conducted recently in a number of oblasts showed that 27 and 20 percent are willing to vote for Kravchuk and Kuchma respectively, while the other candidates are lagging considerably behind. However, Kravchuk warned that these figures should not be overestimated: The situation can change in a day. Although, the president summed up, there is every indication that he and Kuchma will have a showdown during the second round. Our interlocutor refrained from predicting the final presidential election result.
