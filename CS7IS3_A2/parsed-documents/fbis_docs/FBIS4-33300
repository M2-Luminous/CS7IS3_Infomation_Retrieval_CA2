Measures similar to the almost total trade embargo were rejected by Malval last year when they had the support of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was deposed in September 1991 in a coup d'etat led by General Raoul Cedras. [passage omitted] Last December, Malval distanced himself from Aristide due to conflicting opinions concerning negotiations with the coupist military, which in September 1991 forced the constitutional president into exile. [passage omitted] During an interview on Radio Metropole, Malval said Cedras, chief of the Armed Forces, is responsible for the crisis in Haiti, a country subject to an almost total embargo imposed by the United Nations on 21 May. [passage omitted] Legislators, who support the coupists, appointed Judge Emile Jonassaint as the "provisional president" on 11 May, despite a UN warning to the military to restore institutional order or face an embargo.
