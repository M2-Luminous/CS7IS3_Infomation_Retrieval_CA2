Russians no longer consider NATO to be hostile. Every third out of the 1,000 respondents described NATO as an neutral organization as regards Russian security. A total of 27 per cent are not against Russia's possible joining of NATO, and almost one half of them favor Russian involvement in NATO's Partnership for Peace program. The recent NATO air strikes in former Yugoslavia have somehow shattered the Muscovites' calm attitude to NATO. The number of Moscow residents believing that NATO is a neutral organization decreased as compared to the January poll. Two thirds of the respondents do not think the air-strike decision was correct.
