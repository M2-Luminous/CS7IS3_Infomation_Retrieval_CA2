It will be attended by representatives from the CSCE and by the Russian president's special envoy," Moldovan President Mircea Snegur told the newspaper ZEMLYA I LYUDI. "But already before that meeting," he stressed, "all the barriers, obstructing economic relations between the left-hand and right-hand banks of the Dniester will be eliminated." According to Snegur, customs barriers and other control services of the two sides will be abolished and traffic will be reopened across the presently blocked bridges." The president again stressed that the Moldovan parliament would soon discuss the question of granting a special legal status to towns and villages with a compact Gagauz population. "After all," he noted, "nobody is encroaching upon the integrity of the state. They merely want autonomy within Moldova. Gagauz representatives had themselves stated that they could not imagine their existence outside the Republic. The point is to decentralise the government, to transfer some of its functions to the local administration, and to give broader opportunities for developing the market relations." The Moldovan leader noted that "if the Republic shuts up in its purely national shell, it will not get any support from the civilised world. Moldova's prestige on the international arena will depend on how it observes human rights, on the state of inter-ethnic relations within the country."
