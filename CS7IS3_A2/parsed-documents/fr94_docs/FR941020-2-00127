FR941020-2-00127 FR941020-2-00078 [Release No. 34&hyph;34840; File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;12] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Order Approving Proposed Rule Change by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Relating to Underwriting Assessment for Brokers, Dealers, and Municipal Securities Dealers October 13, 1994. On August 15, 1994, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``Board'' or ``MSRB'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') a proposed rule change (File No. SR&hyph;MSRB&hyph;94&hyph;12), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 , and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder. The MSRB filed the proposed rule change to preclude brokers, dealers and municipal dealers from passing through rule A&hyph;13 fees to issuers. The Commission published notice of the proposal in the Federal Register on September 1, 1994. 2 The Commission has reviewed the comments it received in response to the notice. 3 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission is approving the proposed rule change. 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1). 2 Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34601 (August 25, 1994), 59 FR 45318. 3 Letter from Robert E. Aherne, First Vice President and General Counsel, Merrill Lynch, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC (September 29, 1994); Letter from Catherine L. Spain, Director, Federal Liaison Center, Government Finance Officers Association, to Jonathan Katz, Secretary, SEC (September 21, 1994). I. Description The proposal amends MSRB rule A&hyph;13 on Underwriting Assessments for Brokers, Dealers and Municipal Securities Dealers. The proposal will preclude brokers, dealers and municipal securities dealers (``dealers'') from charging or otherwise passing through rule A&hyph;13 fees to issuers. The proposal will become effective 30 days after publication of the approval order in the Federal Register . Rule A&hyph;13 requires each dealer to pay to the Board a fee based upon the dealer's participation in ``primary offerings'' of municipal securities (``rule A&hyph;13 fees''). 4 In addition to rule A&hyph;13 fees, the Board charges an initial fee of $100 and an annual fee of $100 under rules A&hyph;12 and A&hyph;14, respectively, but rule A&hyph;13 fees provide the bulk of Board revenues. The amount of rule A&hyph;13 fees owed is based upon the par value of the dealer's participation in primary offerings. 5 No obligation to pay a rule A&hyph;13 fee is generated by participation in the following types of primary offerings: (i) those composed exclusively of securities less than nine months in maturity; (ii) offerings under $1 million in par value; and (iii) ``limited placement'' offerings, as described in subsection (c)(1) of Exchange Act Rule 15c2&hyph;12. 6 4 As used in rule A&hyph;13, ``primary offering'' is defined as in Exchange Act Rule 15c2&hyph;12 on municipal securities disclosure. Thus, a dealer's obligation under rule A&hyph;13 is triggered by its participation in the offering of municipal securities by or on behalf of an issuer, whether the dealer is purchasing the securities directly ( i.e. , is acting as underwriter) or is acting as an agent in placing the securities with investors. The obligation of a dealer to deliver an official statement to the Board under Board rule G&hyph;36 also is based upon the dealer's participation in a ``primary offering.'' The MSRB believes that consistent use of the concept of ``primary offering'' in rules A&hyph;13 and G&hyph;36 has created substantial administrative efficiencies for the Board by allowing A&hyph;13 fee invoicing to be accomplished in an automated manner with data collected under rule G&hyph;36. 5 Currently, the assessment under rule A&hyph;13 is $.03 per $1,000 par value for offerings containing securities two years or more in maturity. If the longest maturity in an offering is over nine months but less than two years, the assessment is $.01 per $1,000 par value of the issue. For purposes of calculating the assessment, a put option date is treated the same as a maturity date, e.g. , a primary offering of a security with a put option of one year would generate an assessment at the $.01 rate. 6 ``Limited placement'' offerings are those that are sold to no more than 35 persons each of whom the underwriter reasonably believes (i) has such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the prospective investment and (ii) is not purchasing for more than one account or with a view to distributing the securities.
