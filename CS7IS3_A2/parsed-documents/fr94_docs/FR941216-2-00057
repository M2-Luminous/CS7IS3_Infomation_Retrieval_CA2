FR941216-2-00057 FR941216-2-00037 K N Interstate states that it is faced with capacity constraints on its pipeline system downstream of Casper. K N Interstate further states that based on the results of an open season, shippers have indicated an interest in additional capacity, in the amount of 83,500 Mcf per day. K N Interstate maintains that, in addition, the development of new gas supplies from sources west of Casper support the need for additional pipeline capacity out of the area. K N Interstate submits that it can solve the capacity constraint downstream of Casper and move incremental volumes of gas as they are developed by selecting a pipe sized larger than that which would be necessary to move only the unprocessed gas stream east of Casper and adding a new compressor unit at an existing compressor station. K N Interstate maintains that such a configuration will result in increased system reliability, flexibility and redundancy. K N Interstate states that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to close its Casper Processing Plant and move the gas currently being processed at Casper to the Douglas Processing Plant. In addition, K N Interstate states that the proposed facilities will enable K N Interstate to transport incremental volumes of up to 47,500 Mcf per day from the west end of its transmission pipeline system. K N Interstate further states that it will charge the firm transportation rates that result from its current rate proceeding for transportation of gas through the proposed facilities.
