He added emphatically: "Judging from the way the economy looks now, unemployment will peak around February or March. We must not create a governmental vacuum now by dissolving the Diet. We must think of a way to avoid such a situation." "That is one of the reasons why I say the bill to prevent corruption must be acted on first," he said. Murayama's remarks made it clear that he wants the ruling and opposition parties to reach agreement.
