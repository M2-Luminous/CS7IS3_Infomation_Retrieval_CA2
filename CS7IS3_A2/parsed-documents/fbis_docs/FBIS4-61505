Our country will do everything it can to make that a reality", Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt told St. Petersburg Mayor Anatoliy Sobchak on Thursday. Not everything is going smoothly as concerns the creation of a favorable economic and political climate between the Baltic states, the Swedish premier said, but progress has been noted. Mutual understanding has increased and fewer sharp attacks are being made on each other. Bildt and Sobchak agreed that Swedish businessmen would be more active on the St. Petersburg economic scene if the criminal situation in that city was not so dangerous. They both were of the opinion that Sweden and St. Petersburg must coordinate the efforts of their law-enforcement bodies. Bildt even proposed that the leaders of all the Baltic countries discuss the idea of creating a regional coordination centre for the fight against crime. "We are very worried by the growing influx of narcotics into our country from abroad and by the appearance of illegal immigrants, which encourage the growth of crime", he announced. The Swedish premier also appealed for more political cooperation. "all kinds of different party and public organisations should take part in the political dialogue, including communists and nationalists, which we have as well", he said.
