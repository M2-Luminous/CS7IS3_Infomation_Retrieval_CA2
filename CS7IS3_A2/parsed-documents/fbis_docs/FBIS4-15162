It provides for the launching of four new reactors, relaunching the second generating unit at the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which caught fire in 1991, and completing the nuclear fuel cycle. The directive caused disquiet among Ukraine's Ministry for Protection of the Population from the Chernobyl Aftermath, the Health Ministry, the Environmental Protection Ministry, and the State Committee for Safety Inspection in Atomic Energy, who have demanded that the directive be canceled and further work be done on it. On 5 April, a news conference was held to announce the institution of a public committee uniting the Ukrainian Supreme Council's Standing Committee for Matters of the Chernobyl Accident, the National Commission for the Protection of the Population against Radiation under the Ukrainian Supreme Council, Ukraine's Greenpeace, the Green Party of Ukraine, and the Ukrainian Peace Council. An appeal to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk was signed, demanding the invalidation of this directive, which, in the view of lawyers, breaks the law, violates the human right to ecological, radiation, and nuclear safety, and does not comply with the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Interviewed by a UNIAN correspondent, Serhyy Kurakin, representative of the Ukrainian Greens Party, said the priority development of nuclear power engineering, as recorded in this directive, would mean greater capital investment in the industry without yielding the desired result.
