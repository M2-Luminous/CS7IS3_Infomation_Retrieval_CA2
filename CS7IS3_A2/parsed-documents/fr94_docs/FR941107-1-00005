FR941107-1-00005 FR941107-1-00002 This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983). Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments to 7 CFR part 1413 set forth in this proposed rule do not contain information collections that require clearance by the OMB under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. 35. Request for Public Comment Comments are requested with respect to this proposed rule and such comments shall be considered in developing the final rule. Background In accordance with section 103(h)(5) of the 1949 Act, an ARP may be established for the 1995 crop of ELS cotton if it is determined that the total supply of ELS cotton, in the absence of an ARP, will be excessive, taking into account the need for an adequate carry-over to maintain reasonable and stable prices and to meet a national emergency. Land diversion payments also may be made to producers of ELS cotton, whether or not an ARP for ELS cotton is in effect, if needed to assist in adjusting the total national acreage of ELS cotton to desirable goals. A paid land diversion has not been considered because, given the existing supply/use situation, it is not needed. If an ARP is announced, the reduction shall be achieved by applying a uniform percentage reduction (including a zero percentage reduction) to the ELS crop acreage base for each ELS cotton-producing farm. Producers who knowingly produce ELS cotton in excess of the permitted acreage for the farm are ineligible for CCC ELS cotton price support loans and payments with respect to that farm. Based on 1995 supply/use estimates as of September 1994, four options are considered. However, because of changes in the 1995 supply/use situation that may develop between now and the announcement date for the acreage reduction percentage, the actual percentage may be different from the options discussed in this proposed rule. The 1995 ARP options considered are: Option 1. 10-percent acreage reduction percentage. Option 2. 15-percent acreage reduction percentage. Option 3. 20-percent acreage reduction percentage. Option 4. 25-percent acreage reduction percentage. The estimated impacts of the ARP options are shown in the following table.
