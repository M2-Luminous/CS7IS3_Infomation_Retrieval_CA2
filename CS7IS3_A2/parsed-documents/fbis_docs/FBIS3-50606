The Union is seeking the six-month delay because of marked imbalances between the Argentine and Brazilian economies. "If protective measures are not taken," it warns, "Argentine productive activity will be totally replaced by Brazilian imports." Seven Asymmetries Argentine manufacturers point to at least seven areas in which there are cost differences compared with their Brazilian counterparts. These are the so-called "asymmetries," the euphemism used to avoid mention of something even more formidable: the advantages which Brazil extends to all manufacturers to help them penetrate the Argentine market. The Argentine Industrial Union's missive spells out a few, while avoiding the mention of a source of irritation to Minister Domingo Cavallo: Nowhere is any reference made to the gap between the Argentine rate of exchange and the constant devaluation in Brazil. It merits only passing mention even though it is the favorite argument used by Itamar Franco's government to counter demands made by Argentine industry. The UIA cites the following Brazilian economic factors that affect Argentine manufacturers: 1) the enormous difference in the cost of electric power, which the UIA believes has resulted from the failure to amortize government investments in the hydroelectric plants that generate over 90 percent of all electricity used in Brazil; 2) the extremely high rate of tax evasion, which Brazilian authorities put at a minimum of 55 percent; 3) competition between Brazil's states to attract investments by granting high tax exemptions to investment and production projects; 4) the lag in real wages; 5) financial benefits for exporters that charge the daily exchange rate while paying for consumable expenditures, services, raw materials, and personnel at the old rate; 6) the existence of subsidies in certain cases where raw materials are supplied by government-owned enterprises; and 7) long-term financing for sales of capital goods at very low interest rates. For the first time, the association of Argentine businessmen has demanded officially that the government temporarily suspend all of the central issues of the integration treaty with Brazil. The drastic and unusual request is included in a document in which the Argentine Industrial Union warns of a grave danger to the entire Argentine economy. It emphasizes that if special safeguards are not put in place, "productive activity will be totally replaced by Brazilian imports" in many manufacturing sectors. Brandishing these dramatic arguments based on the manifest economic imbalances of Brazil and the productive disadvantages of our own national industry, the manufacturers are urgently demanding drastic measures to check the wave of Brazilian imports. In other words, they are asking for time and do so in the following terms: "It is imperative that we draft necessary amendments or extend the transitional period provided for in the treaty, which essentially grants sufficient time so that our main Mercosur partner may make indispensable adjustments in order to coordinate its macroeconomic policies with the remaining countries." The demands are included in a letter which the Argentine Industrial Union has sent to the head of the Ministry of Economy. The five-page letter is dated 18 November and spells out the negative effects suffered by Argentine business. Jorge Blanco Villegas delivered the letter to Minister Domingo Cavallo in person. It states textually that: "It is our view that the deep-rooted asymmetries currently existing between Argentina and Brazil and which are commercially favorable to the latter will increase immediately, aggravating the problems and harm suffered by many Argentine industries." The manufacturers therefore ask that "play be halted" throughout the process of integration with Brazil. They are specifically asking for a general postponement lasting approximately six months. They do so straightforwardly: "We propose to set a period ending on 30 June 1994 (rather than 31 December) in order to enable the countries involved to draw up new schedules for the Mercosur commercial liberalization and special lists." In case any doubt should remain, they continue: "We also propose the date of 30 June 1994 for determining the common foreign tariff and new guidelines for sectorial agreements." The following are among the urgent measures requested by the manufacturers' association: 1) temporary suspension of the commercial liberalization schedule, meaning that the deadline of the end of December would be removed; 2) temporary suspension of the reduction in the list of exceptions so that the 20 percent set for the end of this year would not take effect; 3) modification of the Las Lenas schedule to permit a fairer and more appropriate drafting of the common foreign tariff; and 4) a modification of current guidelines for sectorial agreements. The manufacturers' association issued its strong demand in order to mediate the internal dispute raging in the government over Argentina's position vis-a-vis Brazil. The Foreign Ministry intends to implement the agreement to the letter. Such is the gist of the position taken by Minister Guido Di Tella and Secretary Hector Gambarotta. In contrast, the Ministry of Economy is more sympathetic to problems caused by the invasion of imports because it throws the convertibility plan off balance. In the letter, which is signed by top-ranking officials Jorge Blanco Villegas and Eduardo Faena, the Industrial Union paints a dark picture of the effects which integration will have on production if the government fails to take protective measures. Those effects include the following: Brazil's imports are replacing efficiently made local products. Small and medium-size industries have curtailed their productive capacity because of the wave of imports. Other manufacturing sectors have postponed and abandoned reconversion programs because of the commercial advantages of complementing sales with the same products imported from Brazil. Tempted by temporary marketing advantages, some industrial sectors are totally replacing their production with imports, maintaining their share of the market and profits while gaining the added advantage of simplifying business. All these difficulties stem from the unequal process of bilateral trade. Manufactured goods make up 90 percent of all purchases from Brazil. Argentina's exports of manufactured products comprise only about half (47 percent) of all goods sold and include agricultural products. The UIA therefore emphasizes that the problems and ill effects suffered by many industrial sectors will be complicated as of 1 January and become even worse if no changes are made by the beginning of 1995. The manufacturers argue that there is little time left and that a decision is urgent. They do not want to condemn Argentina to the role of supplying fuel and grain.
