FR941004-1-00076 FR941004-1-00018 3. Comprehensive Child and Family Services Plan (CFSP) We propose to consolidate into one five-year plan (rather than two plans, one of which currently is due on a one, two, or three-year cycle) all requirements applicable to the two service programs under title IV&hyph;B. These two programs are administered by the same agency, generally serve the same populations, contain similar (in some instances identical) planning requirements, and are a part of the child and family services continuum. (See §1357.15) 4. Description of Other Services Included in the CFSP Because services under the Independent Living Program and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act are also a part of the child and family services continuum, we propose that the CFSP describe the services provided under these funding sources and that the State explain how these funds are coordinated with and integrated into the services continuum. (See §1357.15 (a), (n) and (o)) 5. Joint Planning and Approval of the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report We have proposed an ongoing joint planning partnership to implement the statutory requirement that the CFSP may not be approved unless it was jointly developed by ACF and the State (or the Indian tribe). Both the CFSP and the Annual Progress and Services Report must be jointly developed and approved in order for a grantee to receive funding. (See §1357.10(c) and §1357.15(b)) 6. Content of the CFSP In designing their family preservation and family support services programs, States and Indian tribes may select the services to be provided, the target populations, and the geographic areas where services will be provided. We have not required specific ``core'' services, model service approaches, client eligibility criteria, or methods for the selection of priority populations or geographic areas. In addition to the statutory requirement for goals, measures of progress toward the goals, and annual services reports, we propose to require that the CFSP include: •A vision statement (§1357.15(g)); •Measurable objectives to implement goals (§1357.15(i)); and •Brief descriptions of how family preservation and support services in the CFSP are or will be linked to other services in the child and family services continuum; how the title IV&hyph;B services will help meet the permanency planning requirements in the Act; how the child and family services continuum is designed to meet the service principles; and how the services in the continuum will be coordinated with other public services and service systems. (See §1357.15 (o), (p), and (q)) 7. Planning Processes We have proposed flexibility but also included minimum specific requirements to implement the statutory provisions for consultation and coordination of services. (See §1357.15 (l) and (m)) In addition, we have proposed that the State and the Indian tribe, as appropriate, collect existing or available information as the basis for planning, priority setting, targeting of services, funding decisions, and measuring progress toward the goals and objectives. (See §1357.15(k)) 8. Requirements for Indian Tribes Taking into account the resources, needs, and circumstances of Indian tribes, we have waived some and modified other programmatic and fiscal requirements for Indian tribes. (See §1357.15 and §1357.50(f))
