He said that Sudan is confronting these schemes with firmness and that it possesses the power to abort them. Asked by AL-MUHARRIR on the latest developments in the issue of Hala'ib between Egypt and Sudan, Abu-Salih said he has met with his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa and agreed on continuing the dialogue regarding this problem as well as on overcoming the obstacles in bilateral relations. He added: We are working together to establish distinguished Egyptian-Sudanese relations because they are strategic relations. These special relations, he added, should be an example and the cornerstone for strong Arab relations. The Sudanese foreign minister noted that the two countries reached agreement to resume the meetings of the Hala'ib committee. He said that Presidents Mubarak and al-Bashir charged him and 'Amr Musa with discussing all aspects of bilateral relations, reviewing the various problems, and defining ways to tackle them. He said that Khartoum will receive the Egyptian foreign minister soon to discuss the unresolved problems. [AL-MUHARRIR] Have you noticed any positive response from Cairo to overcome these differences? [Abu-Salih] We refused to announce the contents of these differences through the media and agreed to discuss them quietly at the negotiating table and during the joint bilateral meetings. We found a positive response, seriousness, and a desire to tackle all these issues. This will be achieved through expediting some meetings and holding talks under the chairmanship of both ministers. [AL-MUHARRIR] Are you optimistic over the normalization of bilateral relations? [Abu-Salih] Yes. We have been optimistic for a long time. Bilateral relations only need reinforcement of confidence and rebuilding of bridges. [AL-MUHARRIR] What is your assessment of the current Sudanese- Arab relations? [Abu-Salih] I would like to stress that Sudan's main concern is to develop and strengthen relations with the Arab brothers. This is a firm strategy from which we will not deviate. Proceeding from this, we support all initiatives aimed at achieving strong and stable relations among the Arab countries. We also work toward bypassing the current state of fragmentation. [AL-MUHARRIR] Once again, who is behind the plot aimed at encroaching on the unity of Sudan, particularly in the South? [Abu-Salih] As I said, some western countries are playing the Southern card in an attempt to divide Sudan. Our people, however, supported by our Arab brothers, will foil these schemes which are not only aimed against Sudan but against pan-Arab security. This constitutes a threat to the entire nation. We reject any encroachment on our sovereignty or territorial integrity no matter what the price. [AL-MUHARRIR] What are these foreign quarters exactly? [Abu-Salih] America and Britain are not far from what is happening. Many symposiums are being held in these two countries whose main concern is the situation in southern Sudan. They claim that the people there must be granted the right to self- determination. We absolutely reject this because in the South there are armed rebels who represent only the minority. Our task is to hold dialogue with them although they do not represent the South.
