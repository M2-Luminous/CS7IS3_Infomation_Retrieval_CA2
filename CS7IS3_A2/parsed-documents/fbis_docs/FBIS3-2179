In the course of their talks, the two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the situation in Afghanistan. Qian expressed the hope that the Afghan groups will be able to overcome their differences through negotiations and consultation. Velayati particularly stressed that Afghanistan's neighboring countries should play a role in solving Afghanistan's problems. Referring to the international situation, Qian said that the fact that the world is made up of countries that have different political and social systems, pursue different ways of achieving economic progress, and have different religious and cultural traditions is tangible proof that the world is not homogeneous. Different countries should respect each other, live in tranquillity and peace, and refrain from imposing their social systems and ideology on others. Velayati said that Iran wants the states of the region to enhance their cooperation, manage regional affairs by themselves, and oppose hegemonist intervention and the policy of coercion.
