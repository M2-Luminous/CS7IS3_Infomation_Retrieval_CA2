FBIS4-37425 "drnes119_s_94011" FBIS-NES-94-119 Daily Report 21 Jun 1994 Iran Bomb Explodes in Crowded Shrine in Mashhad Bomb Explodes in Crowded Shrine in Mashhad MKO Denies Involvement NC2106075494 (Clandestine) Voice of Mojahed in Persian 0600 GMT 21 Jun 94 NC2106075494 (Clandestine) Voice of Mojahed Persian BFN [Text] The Mojahedin-e Khalq Organization [MKO] vehemently condemned the bomb explosion on Monday morning in Mashhad and announced: The Khomeyni regime's linking this criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian Resistance is an absolute lie. The MKO office in Paris issued a statement declaring this stance, saying: An MKO spokesman vehemently condemned the explosion at the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, in the holy city of Mashhad and has said that the Khomeyni regime's linking such a criminal act to the Mojahedin and the Iranian Resistance is an absolute lie and its objective is merely to tarnish the image of the just and extensive resistance of the people of Iran against the religious and terrorist dictatorship of the clerics. This spokesman added: The Iranian Resistance would never resort to such criminal actions which would desecrate the sanctity of the infallible imams, and would cause such an extensive loss of life and [word indistinct] among the innocent people. This filthy and criminal action is only in the interest of the clerical regime. On numerous occasions in the past, the regime has planted bombs and resorted to such acts, including hurling a grenade at the French Embassy and the Air France office in Tehran, ascribing these acts to the MKO. We now draw your attention to the interview by the leader of the Iranian Resistance, brother mojahed Mas'ud Rajavi, on the atrocity perpetrated on Monday by the misanthropic clerics in the hallowed precincts of the shrine of Imam Reza, peace be upon him. Mas'ud Rajavi, leader of the Iranian Resistance, condemned the heinous atrocity of an explosion in the sacred precincts of Imam Reza's shrine in Mashhad by the terrorist dictatorship of the clerics on 'Ashura [tenth day of Moharram] which resulted in martyring and wounding a large number of innocent pilgrims and damage to the tomb of Imam Reza, peace be upon him, and he conveyed his condolences to the people of Iran. He described it as a profane, antihuman, and anti-Islamic crime on the part of the ruling tyrannical Yazidi [Yazid was Umayyad Caliph in Damascus, and considered a heretic] clerics. The leader of the Iranian Resistance stressed that the objective of the Khomeyni regime in staging the explosion in the holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine, linking it to the MKO, is nothing but a precursor to a series of terrorist acts in the future against the Iranian Resistance which in the past have included the aerial attack on the National Liberation Army bases, explosions in offices and bases of the Iranian Resistance, and the assassinations of Resistance activists abroad. Some days ago, the Khomeyni regime disseminated consummate lies, claiming that the MKO had launched an attack on the Ilam border, western Iran, in which some persons had been killed and wounded. Rajavi added: The criminal clerics are entrenched in a deep political and economic crisis and are unable to combat the proliferating dissatisfaction and increasing resistance by the Iranian people. They do not find any recourse but to embark on such inauspicious and bestial crimes and in the holy precincts of the Imam Reza shrine at that. This is an unprecedented crime which no other dictator has resorted to before. Rajavi stressed: The cruel clerics have--since the heroic uprising by the people of Mashhad--[words indistinct] continued to seek revenge and harassed the people of Khorasan Province and the pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Reza. He continued: The Khomeyni regime is seeking to justify its next crime and thus to arouse the religious sentiments of the people and to tarnish the face of the MKO, who--because of their deep devotion to Islam, the religion of mercy and liberation--enjoy greater credibility among the Iranian people. They therefore chose the day of 'Ashura, the site of the holy shrine of Imam Reza, and the anniversary of 30 Khordad--the day when the MKO uprising against the regime was initiated--for perpetrating this crime. The statement issued immediately by Khamene'i, the leader of the clerical regime, linking this explosion to the MKO, and the threatening propaganda by the regime, based on vengeance against the MKO, are part of this previously formulated scenario. While recalling the setting on fire of the Rex Theater in Abadan, and the killing of innocent people in the last few months of the shah's rule, the setting ablaze [as heard] of the precincts of the Holy Ka'bah by agents of the Khomeyni regime in 1366 [year beginning 21 March 1987] Rajavi emphasized that the clerical regime--despite its claims to being a protector of Islam--has gone a step further and has massacred innocent pilgrims in the Imam Reza shrine, the most hallowed site in all of Iran. The unprecedented crime is an indication of the incurable crises in Iran, and the abject impotence of the clerics before the resistance of the Iranian people. He added: In addition, the vestiges of the Khomeyni regime--in view of the lack of participation on the part of the people in the anniversary ceremonies for Khomeyni--are seeking to damage the Imam Reza shrine and by violating its sanctity, they wish to replace it with the temple of idols in which Khomeyni is interred. Rajavi called on the United Nations, Islamic Conference Organization, the Islamic governments, international organizations that are defenders of human rights to condemn this appalling atrocity and to send a team to Iran to investigate this crime. In order to thwart any deceitful actions by the clerical regime, the Iranian Resistance deems the presence of its representatives necessary in an international delegation to investigate this incident. This is the insistent demand of the people and the Resistance of Iran to the international community who should not permit the criminal clerics to escape unscathed after committing such an unprecedented crime.
