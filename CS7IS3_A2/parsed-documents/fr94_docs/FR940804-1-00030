FR940804-1-00030 FR940804-1-00012 The Laguna Mountains skipper ( Pyrgus ruralis lagunae ) is a small butterfly within the skipper family (Hesperiidae). It is about 3 centimeters (cm) (1 inch) in length and is distinguished from the rural skipper ( P. ruralis ruralis ) by extensive white wing markings that give it an overall appearance of white rather than mostly black (Scott 1981). The Laguna Mountains skipper is found in wet montane meadow habitats. Pyrgus ruralis lagunae is one of two recognized subspecies of the rural skipper, Pyrgus ruralis (Boisduval). Scott (1981) first described Pyrgus ruralis lagunae from a collection made in 1956 by F. Thorne in the Laguna Mountains of San Diego County California, based upon population isolation and color differentiation. The Laguna Mountains skipper is restricted to the Laguna Mountains and Mount Palomar in San Diego County. The other subspecies of the rural skipper ( Pyrgus ruralis ruralis ) ranges from the mountains of British Columbia and Alberta south to central California, Nevada, Utah, and northern Colorado (J. Brown, Dudek and Associates, in litt. , 1992) and has darker wings than the Laguna Mountains skipper. Three other species in the genus Pyrgus occur in San Diego County: the common checkered skipper ( P. communis ); the small checkered skipper ( P. scriptura ); and the western checkered skipper ( P. albescens ). The Laguna Mountains skipper can be distinguished from all three of these species by the whitish appearance of the adults and the use of a single larval host plant in the rose family ( Horkelia clevelandi ) (Garth and Tilden 1986, Scott 1986). In addition, the western checkered skipper and southern California populations of the small checkered skipper are restricted to desert areas (Garth and Tilden 1986). The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found at one site in the Laguna Mountains and one site on Mount Palomar in San Diego County, California (Dr. John Brown, in litt. , 1992). The total population of the Laguna Mountains skipper is estimated to be fewer than 100 individuals (Murphy 1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). The Laguna Mountains population is restricted to a relatively small fenced area where cattle cannot reach the larval host plant (G. Pratt, as cited in Murphy 1990; Dave Hogan, San Diego Biodiversity Project, pers. comm., 1993). The Laguna Mountains skipper was sighted and collected on Mount Palomar in 1991 by D. Lindsley (J. Brown, in litt. , 1992; Dr. John Brown, pers. comm., 1993). The Mount Palomar population is extremely small where only five specimens have been reported in this century (J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). Horkelia clevelandi (Cleveland's horkelia) is the larval host plant of the Laguna Mountains skipper. Cleveland's horkelia occurs along the margins of pine meadows in the Laguna, Cuyamaca, Palomar, and San Jacinto Mountains of southwestern California and northwestern Baja California, Mexico at 1200 to 2500 meters (m) (4000 to 8000 feet) in elevation. Although a butterfly's distribution is generally defined by the presence of its larval host plant, it may be further restricted by other physiological or ecological constraints. The Laguna Mountains skipper is currently found in a few open meadows of yellow pine forest between 1500 to 2000 m (5000 and 6000 feet) in elevation; historically, this species was found at elevations between 1200 and 2500 m (4000 to 6000 feet). It may have occurred throughout the higher elevations of San Diego County (Murphy 1990; Brown 1991; J. Brown, in litt. , 1992; and references cited therein). Murphy (1990) reported that there were at least six populations of this species in the Laguna Mountains in the 1950's and 1960's (at Big Laguna, Little Laguna, East Laguna, Laguna Lake, Boiling Springs, and Horse Heaven) (see also J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). Most specimens of the Laguna Mountains skipper were collected from Horse Heaven Springs near Mount Laguna (Murphy 1990). Until rediscovery in 1983 by J. Emmel, the last known sightings of the skipper in the Laguna Mountains were from 1972. Until specimens were collected in 1991, the last known sightings from Mount Palomar were from 1980 and, prior to that, from 1939 (Brown 1991; J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). The Laguna Mountains skipper is apparently bivoltine (two generations per year). The adult flight season occurs from April to May with a complete or partial second brood flight in late June to late July. A partial second brood indicates that this butterfly may have a flexible or variable diapause (state of suspended activity). The Laguna Mountains skipper may have evolved a unique mechanism for coping with the low diurnal temperatures it encounters during its spring flight, which is unusually early for butterflies in the Laguna Mountains (Brown 1991). It is assumed that the life history of the Laguna Mountains skipper is similar to that of the nominate subspecies ( Pyrgus ruralis ruralis ), which diapauses as a full grown larvae and adults live 10 to 20 days (J. Brown, in litt. , 1992). The quino checkerspot, Euphydryas (= Occidryas ) editha quino (Behr) is a small member of the brush-footed butterfly family (Nymphalidae). It is about 3 cm (1 inch) in length and checkered with dark brown, reddish, and yellowish spots. It is one of 12 recognized subspecies of Euphydryas editha (editha checkerspot) (Garth and Tilden 1986). The quino checkerspot can be distinguished from other subspecies of Euphydryas editha by its wing coloration pattern and overall body size. The quino checkerspot tends to be larger with redder wings. The light spots on the wings tend to be fewer and more disjunct than in the other subspecies (Garth and Tilden 1986). Euphydryas editha quino is geographically disjunct from them. This taxon is also phenotypically similar to two other species of butterfly that occur within its range. The Chalcedon checkerspot ( E. chalcedona ) is more yellow and is slightly larger than the quino checkerspot. Gabb's checkerspot ( Chlosyne gabbii ) is smaller than the quino checkerspot and has orange instead of red markings (Orsak 1977).
