FR940705-2-00064 FR940705-2-00043 National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee; Open Meeting ACTION: Notice of open meeting. SUMMARY: A meeting of the National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC) will be held at the Sheraton Inn University Center, 2800 Middleton Avenue, Durham, North Carolina 27705. The telephone number is (919) 383&hyph;8575. DATES: July 18 and 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: The meeting is open to the public. Anyone wishing to make a presentation must contact Ms. Teresa Clemons at the Emission Standards Division (MD&hyph;13), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina by July 14, 1994. The telephone number is (919) 541&hyph;5571. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Section 183(e) of the Clean Air Act of 1990 requires the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to conduct a study of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC's) from consumer and commercial products and to report to Congress the findings of the study. Upon submittal of the report to the Congress, the EPA must list those categories of products which contribute at least 80 percent of the VOC emissions from all consumer and commercial products in ozone nonattainment areas. The EPA must at that time divide the list into 4 groups by priority. Beginning no later than 2 years after publishing the list, the EPA must regulate one group every 2 years until all 4 groups are regulated. One objective of the study is to develop criteria for regulating consumer and commercial products under section 183(e). These criteria are to be used to select products for regulation. Section 183(e) lists 5 factors which must be taken into consideration when developing the criteria: (1) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand of consumer and commercial products; (2) any health or safety functions served by the products; (3) those consumer and commercial products which emit highly reactive VOC's into the ambient air; (4) those products which are subject to the most cost-effective controls; and (5) the availability of any alternatives to such consumer and commercial products that are of comparable costs, considering health, safety, and environmental impacts. The EPA has developed criteria based on the 5 factors listed in section 183(e). The EPA has not yet exercised the criteria to develop a prioritized list of categories for regulation under section 183(e). In order to ensure consistency and fairness in developing the draft prioritized category list, a decision was made to convene an independent panel to exercise the criteria. The National Air Pollution Control Techniques Advisory Committee (NAPCTAC), established in 1968 by the Surgeon General, is an ongoing advisory group which provides independent views based upon specialized knowledge and skills unavailable in the EPA. The NAPCTAC consists of the Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, or his designee, as chairperson and 11 members appointed by the EPA's Deputy Administrator. The members are selected from the chemical, engineering, biomedical, and socioeconomic disciplines resident in universities, State and local governments, research institutions, industry, and public interest groups. Because of the balance afforded by such a diverse group, the NAPCTAC was considered a logical and convenient choice for the panel. The panel will consider each category of products subject to section 183(e) and will assign a score of 1 to 5 for each criterion. The output of the scoring exercise will be a draft prioritized category list, with the highest scored categories receiving the highest priority for regulation. The draft list will be reviewed by the Administrator who reserves the right to make adjustments to the list. For example, certain health and safety products may be considered for exemption as provided for in section 183(e)(3)(a). Some product categories may be grouped in the interest of regulatory efficiency. The criteria and draft prioritized category list are not final and may be subject to change until regulatory action is taken. The agenda for the meeting is as follows: July 18 (Monday)_9 a.m. to 12 p.m. _Overview of section 183(e) and expectations for the meeting. _Presentations by interested parties (10 minutes each). 1 to 5 p.m. _Criteria exercised by the NAPCTAC panel 7 to 10 p.m. Evening Session _Continue criteria exercise July 19 (Tuesday)_8 a.m. to 12 p.m. _Continue criteria exercise 1 to 5 p.m. _Continue and conclude criteria exercise _Closing remarks Dated: June 28, 1994. John S. Seitz, Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;16212 Filed 7&hyph;1&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6560&hyph;50&hyph;M
