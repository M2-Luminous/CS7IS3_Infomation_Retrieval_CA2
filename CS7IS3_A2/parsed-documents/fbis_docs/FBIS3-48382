This discovery draws the attention of experts for rich deposits and good mining conditions. In recent years, Korea has made an effective use of diatom earth excavated from various places of the country for the development of the national economy. Absorptive, filterable and fire-resisting diatom earth is widely used in the building-materials industry, chemical and foodstuff industries, agriculture and other domains of the national economy. The demand for it is growing at world markets, selling at price of about 50 dollars per ton. The demand for diatom earth will increase still further for its low per unit cost and increasing economic effectiveness. Korea has made great achievements in the geological survey for a scientific analysis of the deposited conditions and circumstances of diatom earth and its extensive development.
