General Jean Cot, the French soldier who commands UNPROFOR in the former Yugoslavia, described the incident Wednesday [5 January] as "outrageous" and demanded that the Croatian soldiers be punished. The Canadian troops had obtained a routine authorisation to cross Croatian lines in the Medak enclave in the south of the country. Seven Croatian army soldiers approached them and ordered them to lay down their weapons before the Canadian soldiers were led away at gunpoint. UNPROFOR said the four were released after negotiations with a local Croatian commander. Canada has 560 troops in the region based at Gracac. They were deployed in the Medak area after Croatian troops attacked Serb villages, massacring dozens of people.
