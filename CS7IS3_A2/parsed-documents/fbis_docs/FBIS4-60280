Brigadier-General Misbah Hanafi Rushdi Saqr returned to his wife who believed he was dead after he went missing during the 1967 Middle East war. An AFP correspondent spotted the moustachioed general on Sunday walking to a Gaza City cemetery where his mother and father were buried. But the intelligence chief for the autonomous areas, who looked drawn and pale in his olive-green uniform of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA), said: "I'm too tired to talk." His family said they learned on Saturday that he would be coming home and had prepared a welcoming party with other relatives. But the general maintained his awesome reputation for discretion after, according to Palestinian police officers, living half his life clandestinely in Israel under a false name. He apologized saying he was exhausted and asked for the celebrations to be cancelled. Journalists were told to leave the family home. A brief announcement from PLO headquarters in Tunis last week that Saqr was to head the intelligence service stunned even those closest to the man, who all believed him dead. PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat "announced to us, a few days ago, that he would be the next chief of the intelligence services," an officer in the Palestinian police force told AFP. Born in Gaza in 1943, Saqr graduated as an officer from the Cairo military academy in the late 1950s. He was PLA commander for the Khan Yunus area of Gaza in 1967, when he disappeared without a trace. A nephew, taxi-driver Bashir Saqr, said the head of the Palestinian police force had contacted the family directly. "General Nasr Yusuf sent two of his men to my house ... and asked my mother: 'Where's your brother Misbah?' The poor woman replied she had no idea," the nephew said. "Then I met a deputy to the general who asked me what I knew of my uncle Misbah, and I replied that he was dead. "He replied: 'No. Your uncle is alive and is living somewhere nearby. If he turns up or calls, tell him that president 'Arafat wants to speak to him or that he should come to our offices.'" Some people believed General Saqr had drowned swimming the Jordan River from the West Bank to Jordan. But his brother Hamis said he had never really believed Misbah was dead. "I didn't wear black in mourning. I asked the International Committee of the Red Cross but they never found him in Israeli prisons." He also investigated in Amman and Beirut as well as with the PLO, who said the general had died a martyr for the Palestinian cause. "When I found out he was still alive, I burst into tears," said the brother, a merchant in Gaza City. Even the general's wife, Nismat Barzak, who runs a school, had no contact with him throughout the Israeli occupation, according to the family. Their two grown-up sons, who work abroad in Arab countries, also never saw their father and "only know his face from old photographs," said Hamis. A large crowd gathered at the family home in Gaza's up-market Rimal neighbourhood, but they were disappointed as Saqr did not appear. He was seen sitting quietly at the back of the house which was protected by a large number of armed bodyguards. Gun-wielding Palestinian guerrillas of the Hawks, armed wing of the mainstream PLO movement Fatah, were also kept away. "I do not have authority to talk to anyone," Saqr told AFP.
