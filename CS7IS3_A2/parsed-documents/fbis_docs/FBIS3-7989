[passage omitted] [Rozgics] In one of your interviews for UJ MAGYARORSZAG in January you referred to your book "I Would Like To Cry Freely" which had been published earlier. Today, it is no longer a question whether one is allowed to cry freely, we now are expecting you to say why it is worth crying? [Fur] It is worth crying so that we succeed in continuing the policy that ensures freedom in the future, too, and through this freedom we can continue to build a real and true European democracy in Hungary. What we began with much toil and suffering has finally been completed, and once we have completed this building, we should utilize it well to live in, we should furnish it in a way worthy of humans, and fill it with balanced civic existence. [passage omitted] [Rozgics] What are your views on the survival of the Hungarian nation? [Fur] This issue might be even more difficult than the issue of the economy. We know the consequences of the long historical process. It is a very difficult issue. It has two components. The decline in the number of Hungarians in the country: It is public knowledge that we are 30-40 thousand fewer every year. Therefore, the reduction of the number of Hungarians in the country has to be stopped because this is one of the signs of decline. It is also known that the Hungarian nation is a nation torn apart, it constitutes huge minority groups. Stopping the decline in the size of the national minorities, and establishing such conditions with the majority country and the mother country in which they can survive, is a very bitter process. This is a difficult issue in this part of Europe, and in the West, too, although certain methods have been learned there. Unfortunately, we still have much to do before the conditions for the survival of national minorities can be guaranteed. I repeat that we also have to halt the country's domestic biological decline because we are decreasing. Unfortunately, year after year, we are decreasing. [passage omitted] [Rozgics] In 1989, the Forum outlined three roads: red dictatorship, abyss, or democracy. What is the situation now? [Fur] I also spoke about it at the [Hungarian Democratic Forum's MDF] National Meeting, that this had been at stake at the elections: Either the postcommunist dictatorship continues to vegetate, anarchy breaks out in the country, or we can switch over to a democracy in a constitutional and legal framework in a disciplined manner. Today, although the situation is not as keen, the question is what will happen to the country. Knowing society's sober attitude, I hope that anarchy is not threatening the country, but the danger of a left-wing change can certainly be felt. It is my firm view, that the question continues to be whether a constitutional, legal, calm, balanced, and secure democracy will continue to exist in Hungary. Although, this means hardship for many people and social groups. A left-wing change could mean an unpredictable and incalculable direction for democracy and everything that goes with it, namely the economy, and the change and transformation of society. The reflexes, thinking, and the political goals of the left wing are completely different from ours who are the sober political forces that honestly insist on democracy. [Rozgics] The MDF announced the triple road of national liberalism, Christianity, and popular-national ideology. How are we to interpret these? [Fur] This is not a road because it only leads to problems if a road goes in three directions. It is more appropriate to say that these are the ideological and political source of the MDF. The term tendency is too strong because tendencies can easily turn into independent political movements and divisions which have actually happened. This ideological and political source whose roots go back to the popular and national traditions that did not only represent the political activities of the populist writers of between the two world wars, but it could actually be taken back to Rakoczi and Bocskai [historical figures in 17-18th century]. Christian democracy is our other source which, in addition to modern Christian democracy, also means the values that Europe accumulated throughout the 2,000 years of Christianity. This is a way of looking at and understanding the world, and it is not a world view. Naturally, it also includes the political thinking of the modern Christian democracy. The third part of our source is national liberalism that flourished in the 19th century, and since then, it has been a determining factor of Hungarian history. However, here, I am talking about nationally committed liberalism, rather than the supra-national liberalism that reflects a different attitude. We have been able to see these principles as important components of the MDF and still see them this way. [passage omitted]
