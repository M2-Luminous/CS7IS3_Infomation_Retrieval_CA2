FBIS3-28735 "dreas028__a94012" FBIS-EAS-94-028-A Document Type:Daily Report 10 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Tokyo, U.S., ROK `Agreed' on DPRK Sanctions OW1002061994 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN in Japanese 10 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 1 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW1002061994 Tokyo YOMIURI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] Regarding the issue of the DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms development, by 9 February, Japan, the United States, and South Korea had agreed on an understanding that if there is no change in North Korea's position of refusing inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), economic sanctions by the UN Security Council would be inevitable. This was revealed by a government source. The Japanese Government -- primarily, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, and the Ministry of Finance -- will soon begin studying taking such specific measures as restricting trade with North Korea and stopping remittances to North Korea by Korean residents in Japan. In the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February, Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa also wants to confirm that Japan will maintain close contact with the United States on ways to deal with North Korea. Since North Korea declared its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) in March last year, Japan has continued to take a cautious attitude of watching the question of enforcing economic sanctions against North Korea, hoping the matter will be resolved through the U.S.-DPRK talks and South-North Korea dialogue. But the DPRK-IAEA talks underway since late last month, which came on the heels of the U.S.-DPRK talks, again reached an impasse. The situation is now such that (according to a UN diplomatic source) it looks as if "there is no choice but to begin discussions on economic sanctions against North Korea" if the IAEA, at its Executive Council meeting on 21 and 22 February, decides to move the North Korean question onto the UN Security Council. Under such circumstances, Japan, the United States, and South Korea held a working-level meeting in New York on 4 February to discuss measures to deal with the situation. If the UN Security Council decides on economic sanctions, the Japanese Government will begin revising government rules on trade control, foreign exchange control, and control of entry into, and departure from, the country as necessary; it wants to freeze money remittance channels such as ships traveling between Niigata and Wonsan (North Korea), and foreign banks in such places as Hong Kong. According to trade statistics for 1992, Japan-DPRK trade included: 28.28 billion yen in exports from Japan of products like textiles and machinery products, and 22.68 billion yen in imports from North Korea of textiles, nonmetallic minerals, and others. It has recently been learned that some Japanese products including high-tech equipment have been converted to military use. Concerns have also been raised over the reports that Korean residents in Japan are sending funds to the tune of 60 to 100 billion yen a year to North Korea. Furthermore, the Japan-U.S. summit meeting on 11 February is expected to take up the policy on North Korea, and to confirm the position: "If IAEA security measures do not transpire, Japan and the United States should cooperate in deciding on what to do as the next step." A government source said: "It is clear `what the next step' means." Thus he indicated that enforcing economic sanctions will be considered step by step.
