Mr. Moroz told UNIAN that the main purpose of his visit was to meet Crimean Supreme Council deputies. "The Crimean authorities' alienation from the center does not contribute to the settlement of Crimean problems," said the Supreme Council chairman. Considering the frequent bias in some of the media coverage of the Crimean issues as well as third party political manipulations "by Russia," Oleksandr Moroz plans personal meetings with Crimea's residents and labor collectives in person. There will be no time for a meeting with the Black Sea Fleet command, although the Ukrainian Supreme Council chairman said he was willing to hold one.
