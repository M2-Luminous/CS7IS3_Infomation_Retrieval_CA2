FR940711-0-00033 FR940711-0-00004 DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION Federal Aviation Administration 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;18&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;8958; AD 94&hyph;14&hyph;06] Airworthiness Directives; Beech Model 400A and 400T (Military T&hyph;1A) Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes, that requires an inspection of certain flap roller retention components to detect discrepant or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts; and installation of new washers on the roller attach bolts. This amendment is prompted by reports of undersized tabs on some lock washers, and tabs or inner tangs missing from the washers installed on the flap roller bolts. Such discrepancies defeat the locking function of the tab washer, and could result in loss of the nut and flap roller. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent loss of the main or aft flap surface and subsequent reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective August 10, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of August 10, 1994. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Beech Aircraft Corporation, P.O. Box 85, Wichita, Kansas 67201&hyph;0085. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Transport Airplane Directorate, Rules Docket, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington; or at the FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Larry Engler, Aerospace Engineer, Airframe Branch, ACE&hyph;120W, FAA, Small Airplane Directorate, Wichita Aircraft Certification Office, 1801 Airport Road, Room 100, Mid-Continent Airport, Wichita, Kansas 67209; telephone (316) 946&hyph;4122; fax (316) 946&hyph;4407. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Beech Model 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes was published in the Federal Register on March 15, 1994 (59 FR 11939). That action proposed to require an inspection of certain flap roller retention components to detect discrepant or missing parts, and replacement of discrepant or missing parts with new or serviceable parts; and installation of new washers, tab washers, and flat washers on the roller attach bolts. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. No comments were submitted in response to the proposal or the FAA's determination of the cost to the public. The FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed. There are approximately 122 Model Beech 400A and 400T (military T&hyph;1A) airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 102 airplanes of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 8 work hours per airplane to accomplish the required actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts will cost approximately $100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $55,080, or $540 per airplane. The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no operator has yet accomplished any of the requirements of this AD action, and that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not adopted. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A final evaluation has been prepared for this action and it is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES .
