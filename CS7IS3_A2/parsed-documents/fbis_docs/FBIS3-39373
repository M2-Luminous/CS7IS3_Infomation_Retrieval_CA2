About a month and half ago you criticized the head of state. Today, after this meeting, is the dispute over? [Berlusconi] I believe so. I explained the motives behind that statement to the president, but I also told him that I found his conduct in these difficult moments of the election campaign beyond reproach. [[Ferragni] At the moment the election campaign is very vociferous and annoying people. What do you think? [Berlusconi] I agree that is exactly how things are. Above all television is showing voters an election campaign of personal attacks, people speaking over each other, ambushes and traps, and very little in the way of concrete substance. [Ferragni] Until a few days ago you were the chairman of Fininvest. Now you are a candidate and a leader. Is everybody going to get equal time? [Berlusconi] I believe that the rule of equal time should apply -- i.e. giving all politicians and the leaders of the various political forces equal time and space. [Ferragni] Do you mean, in journalistic terminology, a kind of electoral forum spread over all the TV channels, during this difficult and important campaign? [Berlusconi] Yes, according to the criteria used in all democracies -- in France and Spain where I am familiar with the television system -- and in America, for example, where each candidate has the right to a certain amount of air time to explain his program. Even when he is face to face with an opposing candidate, he has an impartial moderator who is chiefly responsible for keeping time, and he answers questions put to him by his opponent or by journalists, and he is allotted time to complete his arguments and to explain his position and that of his party in depth. [Ferragni] You are now -- in the run up to the elections -- allied with Bossi and Fini. After the elctions, do you think it would be possible to break up the alliance and form a new one? [Berlusconi] No, absolutely not. It is a requirement in elections that an important alliance is formed around a program with a view to carrying it out after the elections -- otherwise there would be no sense in it.
