It will decide whether to give four more years of rule to those who turned incompetence into a government policy and who lectured the people instead of serving them. Hungary will decide whether to keep in power those who further deteriorated the economic situation and brought the economy to the verge of collapse, people whose failure is reflected in an unemployment rate of almost 1 million, the fall of the middle classes, massive poverty, the hopeless situation of Hungarian agriculture, and the spread of corruption. Hungary will decide whether to continue to give credit to those who kept breaking their promises. Contrary to its promises, this government has not become a government of freedom, because it is constantly attacking the institutions of freedom, and especially the press. It has not become the nation's government because, instead of cooperation, it caused a fateful division. It has not become a European government, because its policy is antiquated and it propagates ideas that have been obsolete in the better part of our continent for half a century, and it opened the way to extreme right-wing efforts. It has not become the government of economic change either; instead, it has become a government of wasted opportunities. This government is responsible to the voters for all this. According to the socialists, it is the government that failed, and not democracy and the market economy. We are facing difficult years, because the wasted confidence and time and the wasted goods and resources cannot be regained. The situation is not hopeless only because there is a choice. This country can be led out of the crisis and the conditions for national prosperity can be created with an honest and competent policy supported by society. The Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] offers such a policy to the voters. Our program aims at Hungary's economic and social modernization. We want a modern society based on an efficient economy, one connecting economic rationality with social solidarity, social care and modern education that reduce inequalities of chances, protection of human rights and universal human values, and the protection of nature and the environment. We believe that there is no way back! Hungary cannot be led back into the deadend of either five or 50 years ago. We must again take the road that the nation set out on with full consensus in 1989- 1990, a road from which the nation was diverted by the coalition. We do not promise a new change in the regime; instead, we promise a foreseeable future that will again lay the foundations for the people's lost faith. We want a change, not chaos. A Change in the Economy! [subhead] We offer an economic policy that will halt the decline within two years and will lead us out of the crisis and create the conditions of a lasting growth of 1-3 percent annually. We offer firm legal frameworks, predictable economic conditions, and venture-oriented financial possibilities. Our program protects Hungary from an unforeseeable increase in our domestic and foreign debt and from rampant inflation. We will force the decline of the forint to between 15-20 percent within four years. The essence of our economic policy is to reduce our economy's lack of capital, reduce its technological backwardness and, thus, increase its competitiveness. We will encourage projects, investments, and savings accordingly. We are determined to halt state waste and limit government expenditures. We will increase the pace of economic restructuring and will create the necessary legal and economic regulations as well as the institutions that are still missing. We will attribute special attention to broadening the foreign markets of Hungarian products, especially rebuilding some of the lost East European markets. Our economic policy program pays particular attention to the budget reform, the modernization of the Hungarian banking system, the development of infrastructure, the revival of agriculture, the structural reorganization and modernization of our processing industry, and to tourism. We are striving to develop a political, legal, and economic environment in which an active capital of at least $1-1.5 billion annually will flow into Hungary, a capital essential for laying the foundations of economic growth and servicing our foreign debt. Our goal is that foreign capital should primarily serve the spreading of modern technology as well as the modernization of our infrastructure, including transportation, telephone services, public services, and settlement development. An Honest and Efficient Privatization We want an economy based on the decisive role of individual and partnership private property, one that guarantees the equal rights of various forms of property. We believe that the economy functions efficiently through the interest of natural owners. We want to get rid of the current privatization practice. We will continue to privatize the state property, but for the benefit of increasing economic efficiency, preserving the domestic market of competitive Hungarian products, and securing technological development and employment. We will eliminate the State Property Managing Company Ltd and will restore parliamentary control over the State Property Agency. We will use the funds originating from the selling of state property to improve the viable companies, create new jobs, and cover the debts of state enterprises. We support the participation of small investors and employees in the privatization process, but we oppose the free distribution of property. We will provide an active property to the local self- government bodies and forms of public foundations to educational, cultural, scientific, and sports institutions. We want to prevent large-scale dismissals and production reductions with guarantees stipulated in the privatization contracts. We reject the distribution of property and positions to compensate for political services, but we respect property acquired through privatization, as any legally-acquired property. We will take a stand against abuses connected with privatization and corruption through publicity and with every legal means. Agriculture: Market and Production Security! We want to put an end to the disintegration of the agricultural sector. Our program serves the foundation of a modern and competitive agriculture and of a secure future for peasants. We will conclude the process of compensations. We will reexamine the debts of agricultural farms and will temporarily halt the land tax. Our agricultural policy is in favor of agricultural cooperatives; at the same time, it creates identical rights and conditions and provides identical defense to all agricultural producers and owners. In the course of privatization, our program provides an opportunity for domestic producers to become owners both in processing and marketing. Our program limits the emergence of monopolies. Our program would eliminate the chaos prevailing on the producers' market and will offer improving incomes to producers. In a short time, we will halt the decrease in agricultural production and will lay the foundations for an annual growth of 3-5 percent. By gradually stabilizing the standard of living, we will halt the drop in domestic consumption, including the drop in food consumption. We will improve the competitiveness of our food production. For this, we will introduce a market defense used in the West, and we will initiate the broadening of the framework of the agreement signed with the European Union and an improvement in the marketing conditions of Hungarian products. Unemployment: Human Tragedy and Economic Shackles We cannot promise the complete elimination of unemployment. Not even a spectacular economic growth is capable of eliminating the current unemployment rate of almost 1 million; on the contrary, unemployment itself becomes the main obstacle to economic growth. We can only change this situation by counting on our society's resources and solidarity. We want to prolong the training and instruction period so that young people can seek employment later and with better chances. We will gradually assert the right to the first job. We want to free jobs by introducing part-time employment and a flexible retirement system. We offer an economic policy that also considers employment factors in order to save jobs. We support the creation of jobs through a new investment policy, the development of infrastructure, and public utility work. In the course of this activity, we will pay particular attention to helping the backward areas to catch up. We will reduce the number of unemployed people to about 500,000 by 1998 by means of coordinated economic decisions. We will encourage the unemployed to find jobs by providing adequate unemployment benefits and active employment help, without forcing people. We will make their situation more bearable by means of a humane administration. Legal Security and Democracy in the Employment Field! It is only possible to solve the economic and social crisis on the basis of a broad social agreement. In preserving social peace, we attribute a key role to the coordination of interests of the employers, employees and the government and to the active system of social partnership. We regard the trade unions as natural allies in the implementation of our program. We want to strengthen legal security in the employment field. We will guarantee increased labor rights to women, people raising small children, and people with reduced working capacity. We will encourage collective agreements with political and legal means. A Proper Human Environment! Help for Backward Areas To Catch Up! The value of environmental protection expenditures is extremely low in Hungary. The deterioraton of the natural and built environment is so big that it threatens the healthy human life and the quality of work. Our program will increase the environmental protection expenditure threefold in the next four years. We want to cover the expenses from public funds, but the correction of new environmental damages will be paid by the polluters themselves. We want to focus our resources on halting the pollution of our air and waters, saving the forests, and spreading environmental protective and energy-saving technologies. We will initiate the legislation of modern and strict laws for the protection of nature and the environment; we will particularly support the information and educational programs connected with environmental protection. We regard the development of backward areas and the easing of problems of village areas with critical employment and supply conditins as basic tasks, and we also attribute great importance to avoiding the extreme division of the country. We will set up institutions of regional coordination in charge of working out local and regional development programs. We want to create a harmony between initiatives based on local resources and efforts and the central development programs. We will initiate the legislation of a law on regional conditions and tasks as soon as possible. A Just Distribution of Public Burdens and A More Thrifty State Budget! We think it is just when everyone shares in public burdens in accordance with one's ability. Within the tax system, we want to reduce the burden of personal income tax and increase the percentage of consumer taxes. This would make it more difficult to avoid taxes. We will considerably increase the corporate tax, and we will make the invested incomes free of tax; however, we will tax the accumulation of property. We will eliminate the tax on the interest on forint and hard currency saving accounts and the minimum tax, and we will restore the tax exemptions encouraging the foreign investors. We will reduce the exceptions and benefits. Along with reducing the central taxes, we will increase the right of local government bodies to levy taxes. Today two-thirds of the income is taken by the budget. This is an unbearably high percentage, but it can only be reduced gradually. We want to pay particular attention to the reform of state administration and to the reduction of expenses, deficit, and income withdrawal. We will primarily save on wasteful and inefficient political, state power and administrative expenses. We want to stabilize the tax system in order to create a predictable economic environment. It will be impossible to carry out a considerable tax reduction in the next four years, but it is possible to avoid the increase in taxes. The social security payments that seriously burden wages can only be reduced gradually, along with the reorganization of the welfare system and the development of supplementary insurance. A Stronger Social Security! The source of the most severe tensions in the coming years is that welfare expenses can only increase slightly. However, the burdens of the most helpless strata of the society cannot be increased any more. Therefore, we need a reorganization of the welfare system in which help really reaches those eligible to get such help. Instead of the humiliating eligibility investigations, the conditions of social welfare must be regulated by laws and local rules. By modifying the welfare law, we want to increase the basic social rights and expand the circle of recipients. Within the welfare expenses, we will curb the bureaucratic administrative and supervision expenses. We want to encourage the welfare activity of various civil organizations (associations, foundations, church services, and so on) by tax exemptions. We want to preserve the real value of family allowances among the low and middle strata of the population. We will make the child- care benefits a citizen right, and an active grandparent who accepts the rearing of a child will also be able to get such benefits. We think that it is correct for the families to receive support, rather than the institutions, if these families enroll their children in nurseries and kindergartens. We intend to take preventive measures for the benefit of children and youngsters living in an endangered environment. We will strengthen both the legal and institutional background of the bodies in charge of this and of the follow-up care. The social security self-governing bodies are the independent and responsible organizations of social security. We will strengthen their role by providing them property and broadening their rights. We want to make sure that pensions at least increase simultaneously with the net average salaries. We will guarantee income supplements as citizens' rights to people over 70 years of age who totally or partially lack any care. We will gradually introduce a widows pension supplement. We will introduce delaying measures for the benefit of women most affected by the increased retirement age. We will work out a flexible system of retirement, so that the people in question can choose the most favorable of the given alternatives. We are fighting against poverty, not against prosperity. However, the process of pauperization can be halted at the end of the next government period at the earliest. Poverty that humiliates human dignity is everyone's shame. The economy cannot get into such a situation that anyone starves or freezes in the street. We regard the need for the society to jointly and obligatorily help its fallen members as a minimum of human solidarity. Everyone has the right to basic health care. We want to guarantee the circle and quality of services within the compulsory health insurance by law. It is essential to settle the financial situation of health-care institutions and the wages of health workers. We will help the creation of private practices and the operation of other health and welfare ventures with adequate credits and tax exemptions. We will initiate a national cooperation in preventing illnesses leading to early death or physical impairment and in encouraging and spreading a healthy way of life. A Chance for Sports! We regard physical exercise as an important part of a healthy way of life. Therefore, first of all, we want to settle the legal situation and ownership of the sports associations in order to save the competitive sports, the student, and leisure-time sports. We suggest that the sport clubs receive the facilities they use in the form of public foundations. We suggest that both private persons and economic units be able to deduct their support for sports from their taxes. We initiate the legislation of a sports law that will put the entire issue in a uniform framework and will create institutional conditions for the development of competitive sports, student sports, and leisure sports. Housing Also for People With Low Incomes! We will work out a system of housing support that will provide two-thirds of the relevant state funds to low-income families. We will help the construction of new housing projects with full reimbursement of value added tax. We suggest that the state should provide support to local government bodies for the development of plots with public utilities suitable for housing construction and for the construction of social housing. We will help young people acquire their first housing with new and advantageous credits. We find it extremely important to spread the housing management ventures in towns, something that serves the mobility of the population. We want to support the construction of family houses that guarantee several generations living together. We will encourage this program with adequate credits, tax benefits, and proper inheritance rules. A Modern and Democratic Education! As a basic condition of modernization, education is one of the breaking points where we must focus the available resources. In the wake of the state administration reform, we will halt the decrease in the real value of educational expenditures by 1996, and we will gradually increase it later. We want to increase the duration of the general and uniform basic education, and provide increasingly broader chances for secondary education. With the introduction of new training forms, we want to guarantee studies in vocational institutions and institutions of higher education for an increased number of young people older than the compulsory schooling age. We want to stabilize the schooling system. We will support new institutional forms that exclude the need for an early career and school choice, reduce the division of families according to their financial situation, and guarantee the progress of talented children. It is our basic goal to provide school textbooks free of charge to children in a disadvantageous situation. We will take measures to expand the supply of cheap catering for students. In higher education, we will provide social scholarships and exemption from tuition fees for students in need. We support the extension of the freedom of instruction. According to the social demands, needs, and support, we regard the strengthening of church and private schools as important. At the same time, we think it is the obligation of the state to guarantee an ideologically-neutral education. We oppose the instruction of religion or any other organized activity based on ideology in state schools. We will eliminate the Educational District Instruction Centers, and will restore the independence of public education institutions, colleges and universities. We will make sure that the state can only appoint leaders to the state institutions who enjoy the support of most of the teachers and most of the council members of the respective college or university. We regard the ability of the educational institutions to use their own property freely as a guarantee of the autonomy of higher education. We regard the improvement in the training, retraining, and living and working conditions of the teachers as essential. We will assert the rights of student bodies by creating the necessary conditions. National and Universal Values in Culture! We want to serve Hungary's spiritual prosperity and the preservation of our national culture. Our goal is to develop a spiritual environment and social public mood in this country that is favorable to the acceptance of an intellectual role suitable for a modern society at the turn of the century, namely to contribute to the financial and spiritual prosperity of the entire nation by enriching culture in the widest sense of the word, to make it open to anything new and thus help laying the foundations of our prosperity, and to constantly signal the disturbances in the functioning of the society and the mistakes of the prevailing government. We want to guarantee the complete freedom of culture, namely of knowledge, research, arts, religion, publication, and creation. The state cannot interfere in the culture as a guider in any way whatsoever. However, it is the task of the state to maintain the national institutions, guarantee their operational conditions, and work out the legal regulations regarding cultural activity. Cultural centers, libraries, and some of the other institutions engaged in the spreading of culture have preserved their ability to function so far. It is also a task for the state and the local bodies to continue to maintain these institutions and to restore and save those in danger. We are urging, and we will encourage with tax benefits, the contribution of local government bodies, public foundations, civil organizations, private persons, and economic units in supporting culture. We regard the freedom and independence of scientific and technical research as a natural condition. We support the independence and democratic structural reorganization of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The Hungarian Radio and the Hungarian Television will continue to play a special role in informing, educating, entertaining the population, and in exercising a democratic control over the government. On the basis of the bitter experience of the past two years, we think that a law separating the mass media from the prevailing government, political forces and balance of power will guarantee an objective, multilateral, and clear information. We find state ownership over the press incompatible with the freedom of the press. Independent Churches and Free Religious Life Spiritual freedom means the freedom of religious people and non- religious people alike. We respect the independence of the churches: They should be independent of the state and should not engage in the political struggle on either side. We highly appreciate the role of the churches in supporting the ill, the old, and the fallen, and we acknowledge their activity in education. The churches must also receive budget support for this. We fully accept the rights of the churches to have their property restored. Our goal is to see to it that that this process takes place as soon as possible, to the extent of public support and actual church activity, with the consideration of material and financial conditions, and by coordinating the different interests. We want to assert the spiritual and religious freedom and the peaceful coexistence of believers and non-believers in everyday practice in cooperation with the churches. Public Security We find it particularly important that the citizens feel that they, their families, and their property are safe. The defense of life and values precedes every other task. For this, it is essential to increase the number of policemen, improve their professional training and technical equipment, and provide financial appreciation of the police staff. We need a firm, but not a violent, police. It is expedient to shift some of the tasks related to public road control and administration to the local government bodies and give them rights with which they can influence and control the activity of the police. The aforementioned changes can only lead to results if society supports the cause of public safety and the various civil organizations help this cause. A More Complete Democracy and a Cheaper State! There is no, nor can there be, political interest for us the assertion of which could precede the values of parliamentary democracy. We consistently defend the principles of a constitutional state, the democratic institutions, and the human, national minority, social, and cultural rights. We want a firm bourgeois democratic regime. We want to formulate the foundations of such a regime in a new constitution that expresses the requirements of a social constitutional state. We will attribute greater role than hitherto to the direct forms of democracy, to the participation of citizens and their communities in the decisions. In accordance with the requirements of social partnership, we will systematize public dialogue in the legislative process. We want to create a system of public supervision and control over public foundations created by the government. We want parliament to play a genuine role in supervising the government and we want to strengthen the Parliament's character of shaping policy. We want to declare the assertion of ministerial responsibility in the form of a law. We want to broaden the role of the president of the republic, and we find it necessary to create his independent tasks and authority. We suggest to eliminate the uncertainty prevailing in the president's constitutional status. We will initiate the direct election of major public figures by the citizens. We find it essential to assert the independence of judges and of their power. We think it is correct if judges decide on their leaders. We want and offer a more thrifty, professional, and efficient government and public administration. We will limit the spreading of government bureaucracy. At the same time, we want to increase the freedom and responsibility of citizens and their communities, civil organizations, and self-government bodies. We will cut bureaucratic expenses considerably: We will initiate the elimination of compensation offices, decentralized government offices, and some ministries, or the reduction of their personnel. We will reexamine the position of minister without portfolio. However, we will strengthen the organization of justice administration, police, customs, and tax authorities. We need non-party-affiliated public servants independent of government changes, civil officers who deserve social and financial appreciation on the basis of their professional knowledge and honesty. We must finally do away with the property-hoarding personnel policy. Our goal is to develop self-government bodies that serve the citizens. For this, we will initiate the modification of the law on self-government bodies. We find the direct election of mayors and the expansion of the authority of local referenda justified. We want to eliminate the regional institution of republic commissioner; a small county office is sufficient to replace the republic commissioner. At the same time, we want to strengthen the role of elected county bodies. We will continue to play an initiative role in the assertion of the individual and community rights of national minorities living in Hungary and in the consistent implementation of the law on national minorities. We support the creation of national minority self- government bodies and a change in the national minority education. We will pay particular attention to supporting the relevant efforts of the Gypsy population. We think that a smaller army than today is necessary, one gradually modernizing, an armed force respected and appreciated by the society, an army that carries out Hungary's defense with a well- trained staff free of politics and subordinated to the country's interests. Just as it is natural that the organizational order of the Army is based on strict discipline and relations of subordinates and superiors, the same way we can expect that human rights are fully implemented in the Army. We will attribute particular attention to supporting such efforts by the Gypsy population. Rapprochement With Our Neighbors and Living As Hungarians in Europe We offer a historical rapprochement and reconciliation to Hungary's neighbors. In our foreign policy, there is no place for reminding of historical grievances, a mission awareness, or ideological considerations. We are ready for clarifying debates and new initiatives in order to lay the foundations of good neighborly relations. We want to trade, rather than engage in litigations. We think that the security and stability of Central and Eastern Europe can be strengthened by confirming the borders in the international law and fully asserting the rights of national minorities. We find it essential to mutually build confidence, develop bilateral relations and regional cooperation, and to make the borders open. We want to serve the full assertion of the rights of Hungarians living abroad and the acceptance of autonomy efforts in harmony with European norms with a firm and calm policy. We will continue to take a stand at international forums for the creation of an efficient system of national minority protection. We can only guarantee the foreign resources and markets indispensable for the development of the Hungarian economy if Hungary becomes full member of the European Union. The domestic conditions for joining the European Union must be created as soon as possible. It is necessary to further develop Hungary's relations with NATO, but NATO-membership is not the only possible guarantee for Hungary's security. A referendum must decide on joining the European Union and NATO. The Hungarian Socialist Party relies on the best traditions of the 1,100-year past of this nation, the lively political and spiritual heritage of the great figures of our nation, and on the current special historical possibility in which the people can decide on their own fate. The MSZP wants to serve the citizens, and does not ask services from them. The MSZP promises, but does not keep promising. In harmony with the aforementioned political program, we formulated our concrete, detailed, and professionally-founded ideas that could provide the basis of government activity. If we gain the voters' confidences, we will count not only on those who voted for us, because we need the support of every Hungarian citizen for solving the tasks of coming years. The next government will not receive a 100-day period of grace, because Hungary's situation demands immediate action. We call for social peace. Crisis management needs consensus: on a clear agreement between the government and society on the goals to be attained, on the distribution of burdens, and on compensation to be given to those whose interests are hurt. We need a consensus between generations according to which the current generations will not be sacrificed on the altar of the future, and future generations will not become victims of the present either. We cannot promise exemption from difficulties for the young people, but we can promise a predictable future. No government can work wonders. However, the Socialists would start this country on the road leading out of this crisis and we would get over the hard part by the end of the government period, by 1998. We promise an honest, professional, calm, and rational government that takes every citizen into consideration as an individual, and we promise protection to the fallen, reduction of uncertainty and helplessness, and the suppression of corruption. The democratic left based on social democratic values is capable of achieving these goals. This political force simultaneously represents the freedom that creates democracy, equality of chances based on justice, and solidarity that expresses brotherhood. The stakes are very high: Whether we will succeed in laying the foundations for Hungary's progress in the coming four years, or we will helplessly drift to the level of the third world. The MSZP does not promise salvation; it offers a solution. The MSZP Congress.
