Indeed, the unique feature of the party's 28th Congress stems from the fact that the communist leaders of the CGT do not constitute a united bloc; far from it. Alain Obadia, the confederation's "virtual" No. 2 man (no such post exists), has created a bit of a media scandal. By releasing the letter which he sent to Georges Marchais at the end of December informing him of his intention not to seek a new term on the PCF Central Committee, he opportunely reminded him that one of the PCF's discreet--if not secret--trump cards is also the control it can exercise over the CGT. In a situation marked by the collapse of communism in the East Europe and the crumbling of the PCF's election influence in France, the CGT remains, despite a drop in membership, the largest trade union force in France, a fact that rouses the envy of PCF leaders, as well as the astonishment of others. "Some intend to give trade union leaders instructions, even when it is a matter of defining the union's guidelines," Obadia wrote to his party's secretary general, thus unveiling an open secret for noncommunists, but approaching the problem from an unusual angle for practitioners of the "usual channels." His longstanding (despite his youthful appearance) membership in the CGT-communist nomenklatura only lends more weight to his words. Indeed, the Marchais "group," mainly working through Michel Warcholak, organizational secretary of the CGT until the last congress, currently head of the PCF regions, and still a member of the Central Committee, has repeatedly tried to bring the trade union confederation into line. The most elaborate, head-on attempt took place in October 1992, when the PCF organized a national conference on business. Its avowed objective was to bring PCF members together to refine party policy. Actually, it represented a war machine against the 44th Congress of the CGT, judged too "open" by the PCF leadership. Iconoclasts The failure of the maneuver pointed up the limitations of the party's doctrinal power over the trade union confederation. However, it did not settle the problem of the dual membership of leaders. Three CGT officials: Henri Krasucki, Secretary General Louis Viannet, and Francois Duteil, a member of the Confederal Secretariat and editor of the newspaper LA VIE OUVRIERE, recently renamed L'HEBDO to the great chagrin of hard-line laborites, are retiring members of the PCF Politburo. The presence of the first of the three, a tribute to the history of the communist movement, is no more than anecdotal. The other two will be nominated again. The symbolic significance of a withdrawal of the secretary general of the CGT would be too heavy, particularly after Obadia's outburst. As for Francois Duteil, "Tonton Jambon"--as he is affectionately called in the halls of the CGT by his friends and, ironically enough, his foes, for once united--he takes his place good-naturedly in the ranks of those nostalgic for a time when everything was black or white. Or simpler, at least! At the intermediate level, Jacqueline Leonard, in charge of social welfare issues in the confederal office of the CGT and a member of the PCF Central Committee--based on the logic of the old days when any CGT leader was a member of the PCF organs--shares this "straightforward" conception of party-trade union relations. On the opposite side, Gerard Alezard, head of the economic sector, already suspect in the CGT and the party, decided--unlike Obadia--to agree to be represented on the Central Committee. In a noteworthy contribution to the PCF congress published by L'HUMANITE on 4 January, he wondered whether the situation had been given proper consideration by the party and posed the following questions in particular: "Can one stand still on the notion of `renationalization' without any further examination of concrete situations? Is it not urgent to put together innovative elements for the public-private report?" These iconoclastic questions got him into hot water at the most recent congress of the CGT's Nord departmental section, where a welcoming committee mainly made up of members of the metal union awaited him. The fact remains that they are of capital importance for the future of relations between the party and the confederation. The heavyweights of the PTT [Postal and Telecommunications Administration] and EDF [French Power Company] federations, which enjoy great influence in the party as well as the CGT, want to reduce demands to the defense of the status-quo, without thinking about the slightest problem with respect to the idea of a necessary shift in case of a crisis. It all comes down to "knowing whether the PCF congress will infect the CGT a little more," muses Jean-Christophe Le Duigou, former secretary general of the CGT's finance federation and, like Alain Obadia, a signer of the appeal to the "conclave of social transformation." Le Duigou is close to Philippe Herzog, who is going to join the economic sector of the CGT, and intends to remain a member of the PC's Central Committee because "we must fight on the political level and make a critical voice heard so as to protect the union." Albeit recognizing that he does so without excessive illusions. Whatever the case, it is obvious that if the PCF congress falls into lockstep with those, particularly in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis, who condemned the Socialist Party as the "main danger and class enemy," it will be difficult to control the damage within the CGT, as difficult as the prospect of a refusal to consider the left's return to power in medium-range terms. The latter would have the effect of strengthening the confederation's systematic refusal of any compromise, its most natural tendency. Indeed, the shillyshallying on both sides illustrates just how complex the relations of an old couple on the brink of a divorce are. The hesitations of Jean-Louis Fournie, secretary general of the Metallurgy Federation, who will finally be represented on the PCF Central Committee after practically being a candidate for the Politburo and, in the meantime, having avowedly resigned from his seat on the Central Committee, is a caricature of an illustration. When even the diehards doubt, the skeptics are already banging on the exits.
