FR940825-0-00116 FR940825-0-00017 5. Congress sought to address these concerns by including Sections 19 and 12 in the 1992 Cable Act, which added Sections 628 and 616, respectively, to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended. Section 628 (47 U.S.C. 548), which contains the program access provisions, primarily restricts the activities of vertically integrated programming vendors and cable operators with respect to other, unaffiliated MVPDs. Section 616 (47 U.S.C. 536), in contrast, contains the carriage agreement provisions that were designed to restrict the activities of cable operators and other MVPDs when dealing with unaffiliated programming vendors. 6. The underlying premise of both the program access and carriage provisions of the 1992 Cable Act was to increase competition to franchised cable operators from other MVPDs, reducing the undue market power held in noncompetitive markets by cable operators as compared to that of consumers and video programming vendors. 5 The legislative history shows that Congress routinely treated Sections 616 and 628 in concert, thereby confirming its concern for the impact of anticompetitive conduct on programming vendors and on emerging MVPDs' access to programming. 5 See, e.g., 1992 Cable Act section 2(a)(2). 6. The Commission has determined that it is in the public interest to grant WCA's petition and to amend ยง76.1302 of the Commission's rules to specifically afford standing to aggrieved MVPDs to file complaints under Section 616 of the 1992 Cable Act. Based on the record, the criteria set forth in the 1992 Cable Act and its legislative history, the Commission believes that it serves the public interest if all potential violations of Section 616 are brought to the Commission's attention. Moreover, the Commission believes that the statutory purpose of Section 616 is further served if the Commission is made aware of such violations through complaints by both programming vendors and MVPDs alike. The mere threat of potential complaints by allegedly aggrieved competing distributors is an added check on potential anticompetitive behavior by MVPDs with respect to carriage agreements. While the Commission believes that this approach is entirely consistent with the purpose and intent of the 1992 Cable Act, it also is well within the Commission's general authority in Sections 4 (i) and (j) of the Communications Act to amend the rules in this manner. 6 6 Section 4(i) provides, in part, that the Commission ``may perform any and all acts, make such rules and regulations, and issue such orders, not inconsistent with this Act, as may be necessary in the execution of its functions.'' Section 4(j) provides, in part, that the ``Commission may conduct its proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.'' 47 U.S.C. 154(i), (j). 7. The Commission emphasized, however, that all complaints filed pursuant to Section 616 must be based on documentary evidence or testimony in the form of affidavits, (signed by an authorized representative or agent of the complaining party), and may not merely reflect conjecture or allegations based only on information and belief. 8. The Commission stated that it intends to strictly enforce the prohibition in ยง76.1302(q) of the Commission's rules (47 CFR 76.1302(a)) against the filing of frivolous complaints. Thus, the Commission believes that this rule affords adequate protection against any potential frivolous complaints filed as a result of its decision to expand the scope of parties with standing to file carriage agreement complaints pursuant to Section 616.
