Andreatta said that the CSCE does not reproach Estonia as far as legislature regulating the problems of minorities living in Estonia is concerned, the application of this legislation is what causes problems. He stated that we should not as much talk of nationalities as of citizenship and expressed his opinion that all aliens living in Estonia should have a right to a residence permit and foreigners' passport. Andreatta had also a meeting with Estonian President Lennart Meri last night where he said that the CSCE activities will in the future, as at present, be directed towards finding constructive solutions to problems of Estonian-Russian relations. Italy as a EU member state was interested in economic and political cooperation with Estonia, he added.
