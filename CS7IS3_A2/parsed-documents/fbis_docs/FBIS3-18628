However, it differs considerably from the initial French plan. France would have liked the United Nations to appoint a veritable "administrator" for the city of Sarajevo. This idea was curbed from the start by the Americans who regarded it as an attack on the Bosnian Government's sovereignty. The modified plan now proposes the appointment of a "high-level civilian official" who, in "close cooperation" with the Bosnian Government, would have the mission of restoring essential public services in the Sarajevo area. Russia's objections to the French plan were clearly more extensive. With regard to Sarajevo, Moscow opposed the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Force] taking control of certain road systems and intersections, because, they said, their soldiers could thus be in a situation of confrontation with the Serbian militias. Russia also opposed the resolution referring to Chapter 7 of the UN Charter (which makes provision for the use of force) and reaffirming the NATO ultimatum. Finally, it refused to allow the use of force to be mentioned with regard to remedying the situation in three other Bosnian cities which France proposed turning into new "security areas." On Monday [28 February], Moscow informed the French delegation that such a plan would meet with a Russian veto. However, following Franco-Russian contacts, the deadlock was broken on Tuesday and Moscow no longer intends to oppose Paris' efforts. According to Russian diplomats to the United Nations, Moscow's initial "reservations" were "bureaucratic and not political." A compromise document was due to circulate among the other members of the Council on Thursday. It calls on all sides to "achieve with UN assistance" the full freedom of movement for the civilian population of Sarajevo and on the secretary general to appoint a civilian official "immediately and for an interim period." Taking account of the U.S.-British initiative announced on Tuesday by Bill Clinton and John Major, the French resolution calls on Mr. Butrus-Ghali to create a fund of voluntary contributions for Sarajevo "with a view to promoting a return to normal life." Finally, the French plan asks the secretary general to draw up a report within 10 days on the "feasibility and means of extending" the protection provided for the "security areas" to Maglaj, Mostar, and Vitez. Before the vote, Washington could still ask for amendments to curb the authority of the civilian official who will be appointed for Sarajevo, making him "a simple coordinator, or even a chief engineer" whereas Paris wants him to have "real powers." According to General Michael Rose, the UNPROFOR commander in chief in Bosnia, the extension of the security areas to three other cities requires the deployment of 2,000 to 3,000 additional soldiers. It seems possible to solve this problem because, according to Mr. Butrus-Ghali, Malaysia, Bangladesh, and Pakistan have agreed to send "several hundred" soldiers to Bosnia.
