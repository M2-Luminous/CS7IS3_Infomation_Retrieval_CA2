He said: I do not know how a UN body like the Economic and Social Commission of West Asia, ESCWA, permitted itself to endorse a report of an official nature on a sensitive issue like the stealing of water by one state from another neighboring state--even though they are hostile to each other--without relying on tangible evidence and without conducting a direct field study to arrive at its conclusions. Maj. Gen. Lahd affirmed that this is what the ESCWA has done. According to a statement by 'Umar Tuqan, the official responsible for the water program in ESCWA, to a BBC correspondent last Wednesday, it was content just to collect available reports and articles published by some magazines and newspapers on the issue of water in west Asian countries and then presented the results of its work to the member states without confirming the correctness of these reports and articles. Maj. Gen. Lahd added: The Lebanese Government picked up this report and began clamoring about dangers that only exist in its imagination. This comes at a time when Lebanon is neglecting and overlooking a more serious danger, which is undermining Lebanon's sovereignty and threatening its very existence. He asked: Doesn't the Lebanese Government have enough problems to worry about with regard to the economic situation, the suppression of liberties, and the domination of the nouveax riches and the angels of punishment? Or did it fabricate all this clamor in order to distract people's attention from other matters being cooked up in secret, something that constitute a real danger to Lebanon's entity and future? Maj. Gen. Lahd concluded: How long will the Lebanese Government continue such lies, false heroism, and distraction of the people from the essence of matters?
