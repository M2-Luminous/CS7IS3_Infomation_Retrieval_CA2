He said the organization is trying to gather 50,000 signatures all over the country to endorse an amnesty bill within the framework of the popular legislation mechanism Congress is debating. Pastro Vives categorically emphasized that the movement is exclusively of a civic nature and that it has no other political objectives. He added: "Gen. Salinas has no political ambitions, as he himself explained on several occasions." He explained, however, that Salinas can make his own choice after being released and that the organization has nothing to do with it. For his part, Salinas' lawyer, Javier Valle-Riestra, said during the presentation of the movement on 18 February -- and also in interviews that he granted to the media a few days later -- that Salinas might be a good presidential candidate for 1995.
