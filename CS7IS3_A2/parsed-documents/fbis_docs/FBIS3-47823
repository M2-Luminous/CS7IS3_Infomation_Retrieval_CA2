Even though the third round of the official working-level contact between North Korea and the IAEA side was held on 17 January, no "green light" was shown, as expressed by the IAEA side. It has been learned that, through steady contacts in New York at the end of last year, the United States and North Korea reached a series of agreements on resuming ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary [tongsang] inspections, on the announcement of the discontinuation of the Team Spirit, on resuming the working-level contact for exchanging the North-South special envoys, and on resuming the third round of North Korean-U.S. talks. Accordingly, it was expected that the IAEA inspection team would be able to enter the North by mid or late January, at the latest, without any problems. However, as soon as technical negotiations between North Korea and the IAEA started, North Korea began to behave as though it had forgotten the political agreement. Such an atmosphere makes us believe that the U.S.-North Korean agreement attaches more importance to the beginning of the IAEA-North Korean negotiations to conduct ad hoc [imsi] and ordinary [tongsang] inspections, than to the resumption of full-scale ad hoc and ordinary inspections. Actually, it is believed at the IAEA that, because the Clinton administration wants to have a diplomatic success, it might make "an early announcement." The subjects of the three rounds of the official North Korean-IAEA negotiations have been: sounding out mutual positions (on 7 January), delivering the IAEA's technical demand conditions regarding inspections to North Korea (on 10 January), and delivering the North Korean side's position toward the IAEA's demand conditions (on 17 January). The IAEA side has kept silent about the concrete contents of the negotiations. However, it has been learned that the great stumbling blocks to the negotiations are the scope of the inspections and technical issues. Among the seven nuclear facilities North Korea reported to the IAEA, North Korea has felt particularly nervous about the 5-MW Yongbyon experimental reactor, which is the most important one in clearing North Korea's nuclear suspicion; and a radiochemical laboratory, suspected to be a reprocessing facility. North Korea has assumed the position that it can receive restricted inspections by just allowing the replacement and repair of the existing monitoring equipment. North Korea has claimed that this is enough to guarantee the continuity of the nuclear safeguards accord. The IAEA holds that the ad hoc inspections are aimed at verifying the accuracy and integrity of the reported facilities, that there is no alternative but to conduct full-scale and unconditional inspections. Along with this, it has been learned that the issue concerning the number of inspections has yet to be resolved. Regardless of the level of the political agreement reached between the United States and North Korea, it is certain that North Korea is once again trying to buy time. North Korea has come to avoid international sanctions by beginning negotiations with the IAEA. It seems that North Korea is employing a two-pronged policy to leave behind a "nuclear suspicion," at the most, during negotiations with the IAEA. This is the very strategy North Korea had employed for the past year. Whenever North Korea has been driven to a corner, it has used a hard-line strategy of worsening the situation and benefiting from it. For example, when North Korea was faced with the pressure of special inspections, it withdrew from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. It will be two years in April since the nuclear safeguards accord was effectuated. However, North Korea has refused to receive even the ad hoc inspection, which is the most basic stage of the inspection, not to mention special inspections. North Korea has diverted the people's focus of attention elsewhere so that they regard even the resumption of the ad hoc inspection as progress in the nuclear issue. It seems as though North Korea this time thinks it can still buy time. The fourth round of the IAEA-North Korean negotiations may be held on 19 or 20 January. However, it is difficult to expect that North Korea will change its position at once. North Korea will probably accept full-scale ad hoc inspections at a time when it believes that it can obtain the greatest benefit from the third round of the high-level talks with the United States. It seems that North Korea has planned it can prevent the issue of special inspections from being a key point in the agenda at the third round of the high-level talks.
