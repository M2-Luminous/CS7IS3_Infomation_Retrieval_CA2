The central issue of their talks with all the political parties so far was the rights of minorities in Romania. Our special correspondent Judit Laszlo reports from Bucharest: [Laszlo] The Democratic Party, led by former Prime Minister Petre Roman, considers itself a social democratic party, though a liberal one in economic matters. Therefore its program is similar to the SZDSZ's program, Gabor Kuncze, parliamentary deputy group leader of the SZDSZ, said. Minority rights have also been on the agenda of their talks with Petre Roman. It is Romania's primary interest to guarantee minority rights and to avoid ethnic conflicts, the former Romanian prime minister said. Senate President Oliviu Gherman also met the SZDSZ delegation. He promised that Romanian legislation will, in the near future, ratify the readmission agreement and agreements concluded by the two countries on avoiding double taxation and on the protection of investments. The issue of establishing a Hungarian university is also on the agenda. The Romanian negotiating party accepted the need for it but drew attention to the difficulties of its realization, Kuncze said. He told the chairman of the Senate that it would be desirable if Hungarians in Romania could peacefully celebrate 15 March [anniversary of the Hungarian revolution and war of independence in 1848]. A Romanian extremist leader has recently called this celebration an anti-Romanian action. There was great understanding on political matters between the Young Liberals--a party of the Civic Alliance--and the SZDSZ, particularly with regard to the situation of Hungarians. The leaders of the Romanian opposition expressed their views that Romania's democratic future depends directly on a responsible policy by the leadership of the Hungarian Democratic Union of Romania [HDUR] and, last but not least, on the statements of the Hungarian Government in power. The liberal parties would also like HDUR not to monopolize the protection of minorities. At the same time, other parties should also undertake this issue. The SZDSZ delegation has agreed with this idea.
