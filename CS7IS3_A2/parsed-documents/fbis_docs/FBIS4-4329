"I think that, if possible, we should try to invite China to participate and that we need Russian cooperation too," he added. In the 33-minute conversation which started at 10 A.M. when Clinton called Kim while on Easter vacation in California, Kim explained his visits to Japan and China, Presidential spokesman Chu Ton-sik said. "I think China will consider our position and will eventually cooperate with us in the U.N. Security Council," Kim said. He added that Beijing would inform Pyongyang of Seoul's policy against the German-style reunification of Korea, with the South absorbing the North, and "my firm will to maintain peace" on the peninsula. "The Chinese leaders said they oppose not only the North Korean nuclear issue standing in the way of South Korea-China economic cooperation but also a nuclear presence in either of the two Koreas." Clinton said he is well aware of China's concern that the U.N. Security Council may adopt a resolution on North Korea, while stressing the need to send a strong signal to show "our unity" before the North Koreans and the world. He expressed hope that China would not veto a resolution in the U.N. Security Council, saying the Chinese are in a difficult position but must prevent North Korea from breaking the promises it has made. Clinton, admitting that the Stalinist state's nuclear program is a sensitive problem, stressed the need to make clear "our position on this issue." The United States believes that settling the nuclear issue through dialogue is most desirable, but realizes the difficulty of talking with North Korea, he remarked. Clinton said that because North Korea has not kept its promises, the U.S. Government must continue pressing for full International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and resumption of inter-Korean dialogue. He added that since Washington does not want the dispute to develop into a crisis, it will opt for a gradual and prudent approach so that North Korea can talk out a solution with South Korea, the United States and the IAEA. Clinton stressed the need for Seoul and Washington to cooperate closely on the diplomatic front and take the initiative if necessary. Rendering ineffective Pyongyang's policy pitting Washington against Seoul is vital, he said, adding that Japanese, Chinese and Russian cooperation must be brought to bear. President Kim reiterated the need for additional IAEA nuclear checks in North Korea and substantial inter-Korean talks, noting that China supports "dialogue between responsible authorities of South and North Korea." Saying he has invited Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit Seoul soon, Kim said Jiang had promised to come before the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting slated for November. In his two meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in Tokyo, Kim and the Japanese leader agreed that South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation is key to solving the nuclear issue, Kim told Clinton.
