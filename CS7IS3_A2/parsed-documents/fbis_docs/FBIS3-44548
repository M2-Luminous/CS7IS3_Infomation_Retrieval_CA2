Qin Daofu, head of the drafting committee for the law, said the ban will prevent these departments from using their influence and connections to control the insurance market. At present several departments such as the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Civil Affairs, are involved in the insurance business in one way or another. He said after the passing of the law, which is scheduled for some time next year, these departments will only be authorized to engage in social insurance business, such as unemployment insurance and pension schemes. The drafting of the law is nearly finished, Qin said, adding that the committee studied insurance laws in 16 countries and regions, including both developed and developing countries and regions, while doing its work. After the law comes into effect China's insurance market will have a comprehensive legal framework to ensure fair competition, normal market operations and healthy development of the industry, he said. Under the law, the People's Bank of China will supervise the industry. The bank will be responsible for ensuring insurance companies fulfill the obligations they undertake in their policies. Qin said the guidance of the People's Bank of China is aimed at maintaining order in the insurance business. And an insurance association, which will be a self-disciplinary organization, is expected to be established in the future. The law will also require new insurance companies to be formed as stock or mutual companies, he said. At present, the Chinese insurance market is dominated by the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which has a 97-percent market share. The rest of the market is divided between the Shanghai-based Pacific Insurance Company, China Pingan Insurance Company in Shenzhen, Agriculture Insurance Company in Xinjiang, and eight life insurance companies, Qin said. The law will apply equally to foreign-funded insurance companies, he said. A foreign-funded company, if registered in China, will be considered a domestic company. These companies don't have to lodge a deposit with the People's Bank of China as they have registered capital. However, under the law, branches of foreign insurance companies will be required to lodge a deposit guarantee with the People's Bank. They will also have to have a permanent Chinese resident as their representative. The law will also empower the People's Bank to make other relevant regulations to govern the industry, he said. Qin said many foreign insurance companies are eyeing the vast potential of the Chinese insurance market. So far, more than 20 foreign insurance and brokers companies have opened representative or liaison offices in the country and two of them, the American International Group and the London-based Sedgwick Group, have opened branches in Shanghai and Beijing respectively. China's insurance industry has seen rapid growth in recent years. In 1992, the total property insurance policies in the country reached 4.56 trillion yuan ($786 billion)-44.7 percent more than the previous year. Some 700,000 firms and 143 million families are covered by property insurance policies, while 313 million people have bought personal insurance policies.
