The work on restoring peace in the former Yugoslav Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina would be resumed in Geneva, despite the fact that the conference was sidelined this spring, REUTERS quotes diplomatic sources in Geneva as saying. Relevant international bodies have also agreed on allowing a budget for the future work of the conference, [words indistinct] Russian and especially U.S. initiatives for strengthening the Bosnian peace process, have contributed to the sidelining of the Geneva conference. The United States, determined to show the Europeans it had more efficacious solutions for Bosnia, took over the initiative in February. Shortly earlier, in January, the European Union (E.U.) plan collapsed because of the U.S.-sponsored Bosnian Moslem rejection. Namely, Bosnian Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic took a hostile stand towards the plan, relying on undoubted support by the U.S. Administration. The E.U. peace plan, the adoption of which was within reach in January, was thus completely neglected and international mediators Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg were nearly eliminated from the talks. Despite various efforts made in the meantime -- including direct negotiations between Bosnian Moslems and Croats, who have signed a federation agreement, and open threats and air strikes -- peace in Bosnia was more and more distant. Everything has returned to Geneva where seven ministers of the "great troika" (the United States, Russia, the E.U.) on Friday reached accord to resume seeking a political solution under the E.U. plan, thus taking everything back to where it was in January. The latest Geneva initiative, which could also be called "a plan of united action," represents a new proposal primarily because Washington and Moscow are backing the E.U. concept. The latest evidence that everthing is going back to the Geneva conference, i.e. the E.U. plan, is seen in the current diplomatic mission of Owen and Stoltenberg, who arrived in Belgrade on Tuesday to confer with President of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia Slobodan Milosevic. The Yugoslav Government's commission for monitoring the international conference on the former Yugoslavia on Tuesday requested that the Yugoslav delegation should be treated on an equal footing at the conference, especially within the group for economic issues and the group for succession, which implies that U.N. sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia/Montenegro) should be lifted. The insistence on the lifting of the sanctions is even more justified by the fact that Yugoslavia was requested by Geneva to submit a report on the application of market economy which is hard to realize under the sanctions, the Yugoslav Government's commission said at its session.
