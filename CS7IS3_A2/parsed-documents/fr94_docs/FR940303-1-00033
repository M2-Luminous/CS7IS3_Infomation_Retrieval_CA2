FR940303-1-00033 FR940303-1-00009 FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 47 CFR Part 90 [PR Docket No. 93&hyph;61; DA 94&hyph;178] Automatic Vehicle Monitoring Systems AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission. ACTION: Proposed rule; order extending comment and reply comment periods. SUMMARY: The Private Radio Bureau issued a Public Notice soliciting additional comment and reply comment on written ex parte presentations received by the Federal Communications Commission from PacTel Teletrac, Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. and Mobilevision in late January and early February 1994. Comments were due on or before February 25, 1994 and reply comments were due on or before March 7, 1994. This Order extends the period in which to comment on these ex parte presentations through March 15, 1994, and extends the reply comment period through March 22, 1994. This action provides commenters with additional time to account for alleged difficulty in obtaining the ex parte filings from the Commission and eliminates ``confusion'' over the scope of comments permitted by stating that comments may be filed on the ``technical'' issues as well as any other issues raised by these filings. DATES: Comments must be filed on or before March 15, 1994. Reply comments must be filed on or before March 22, 1994. ADDRESSES: Federal Communications Commission, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC 20554. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John J. Borkowski, Rules Branch, Land Mobile and Microwave Division, Private Radio Bureau (202) 632&hyph;7125. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Order Adopted: February 24, 1994. Released: February 25, 1994. In the Matter of Amendment of part 90 of the Commission's Rules to Adopt Regulations for Automatic Vehicle Monitoring Systems, PR Docket No. 93&hyph;61. By the Chief, Private Radio Bureau: 1. In late January and early February 1994 the Commission received written ex parte presentations from PacTel Teletrac (PacTel), Southwestern Bell Mobile Systems, Inc. (SBMS) and Mobilevision concerning the licensing of Automatic Vehicle Monitoring (AVM) systems, currently under consideration in this docket. 2. On February 9, 1994, the Bureau issued a Public Notice soliciting additional comments and reply comments on these filings. 1 Comment was specifically solicited regarding whether Rand McNally Basic Trading Areas (BTAs) 2 should be used as Commission-defined service areas for the licensing of AVM systems, or whether, alternatively, Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) and Rural Service Areas (RSAs) should be used as licensing boundaries. 3 The Public Notice established a due date of February 25, 1994 for comments and March 7, 1994 for reply comments. 1 Public Notice, DA 94&hyph;129, released February 9, 1994, 59 Fed. Reg. 7239 (February 15, 1994). 2 See Rand-McNally Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide 36&hyph;39 (123d ed. 1992). 3 This additional period to file comments and reply comments on these specific issues did not in any way abrogate the right of any interested party to file ex parte comments on any aspect of this proceeding. 3. On February 18, 1994, Metricom, Inc. (Metricom) requested additional time to respond to the ex parte filings specified in the Public Notice and requested that we clarify that interested parties may comment on the ``technical issues'' raised by these ex parte filings. Metricom bases this request on alleged difficulty in obtaining all of the ex parte filings from the Commission and on ``confusion'' over the scope of the comments requested. 4. Because of the apparent confusion on this question, we believe a short extension of time is warranted. Parties responding to the Public Notice may comment on the ``technical issues'' as well as any other issues raised by these filings. 5. For good cause shown, and pursuant to sections 4(j) and 303(r) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. §§154(j) and 303(r), it is ordered that the period of time for filing comments and reply comments on ex parte filings addressed in our Public Notice, DA 94&hyph;129, released on February 9, 1994, is hereby extended. Comments must be filed on or before March 15, 1994. Reply comments must be filed on or before March 22, 1994. 6. To file formally in this proceeding, you must file an original and four copies of all comments and reply comments. If you want each Commissioner to receive a personal copy of your comments, you must file an original and nine copies. Comments and reply comments must be sent to the Office of the Secretary, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC 20554. 7. Ex parte filings, as well as all comments and reply comments in this proceeding, are available for public inspection as part of the record in PR Docket No. 93&hyph;61 during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center, room 239, 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC.
