They also called for cutting short all intervention hampering reforms in agriculture. The picketers, who are participants in the congress of the association, which opened in the Kyrgyz capital today, decided to make their views known to the government and the public on the very first day of the gathering. Their representative Askarbek Bazarkulov said "the government headed by Apas Jumagulov has not justified our confidence, because it is only paying lip service to reforms in agriculture. "We ask only one thing -- that they do not interfere with our activity and give us loans. The 150 million soms (about 15 million dollars) allocated to agriculture recently has been wasted in supporting unviable collective farms, and only ten million soms (about 1 million dollars) of that amount of money were given to private farmers. "We, free land owners and farmers, have not received anything", said Askarbek Bazarkulov, one of the organizers of Kyrgyz peasant movement. The congress is expected to raise a question about the resignation of the republic's government.
