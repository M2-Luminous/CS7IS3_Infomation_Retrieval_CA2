FBIS4-4939 "dreas066_m_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 6 Apr 1994 Thailand Central Bank Reports Status of Economy Central Bank Reports Status of Economy BK0604102894 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network in Thai 0000 GMT 6 Apr 94 BK0604102894 Bangkok Radio Thailand Network Thai BFN [Text] Thailand's overall economic situation in 1993 was better than previously estimated. The country's economic growth rates increased from 7.6 percent in 1992 to 7.8 percent in 1993. In 1994, there are several factors, both external and internal, indicating that the Thai economic growth rate will exceed 8 percent, but it may result in a more severe inflation rate above 4.2 percent. Aphisit Wetchachiwa, spokesman of the Prime Minister's Office, gave a briefing on the outcome of yesterday's cabinet meeting and said that the cabinet acknowledged the above-mentioned report presented by the governor of the Bank of Thailand. According to the report, the International Monetary Fund [IMF] has estimated that Thailand's total export value this year will possibly increase by more than 15 percent because the economies of its trading partners, especially the United States, are improving. Besides, there has also been greater demand for Thai goods in Japan and Europe. Thailand, however, is expected to suffer a greater trade deficit than originally estimated due to the increased import of goods for use in expanding export-oriented production. Regarding competition in goods exports, there will be new competitors -- China and Vietnam. Due to greater export expansion in 1994, possible shortages of labor and raw materials are predicted. Thailand will not be faced with a capital shortage as has happened in the past because investors consider Thailand to still have good basic factors for investment. The influx of foreign capital contributes to better financial liquidity. The expansion of loans is expected to reach 22 percent -- a considerably high rate when compared to that of 20 percent in 1993. To maintain economic stability in Thailand, IMF representatives advised the Thai Government to establish a highly efficient savings system and at the same time cut down expenses.
