This will be the first visit to sovereign Kazakhstan by one of top Chinese leaders. Judging by information coming in from official circles, the visit is associated with hopes for the revitalisation and development of bilateral relations. Goods turnover between Kazakhstan and China decreased to $205 million U.S. dollars last year as against $433 million in 1992. Only a few out of 150 registered joint ventures are engaged in production activities while the bulk of them practice trade and purchasing operations. A number of direct agreements were concluded recently between Kazakhstan and China enterprises on establishing the co-manufacture of various types of industrial products and consumer goods. This is a good sign which shows that the basic document which determines long-term cooperation between the two neighbouring countries -- the joint declaration on the principles of friendly relations, which was signed during President Nursultan Nazarbayev's visit to China in October last year -- begins to work in earnest at last. In all, 15 bilateral agreements have already been concluded. They concern political, trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural contacts between Kazakhstan and China. Li Peng is to hold talks with Nazarbayev here in a narrow format and meet with members of the Republic's business community. There will be also talks between official delegations. As a result of the visit, the two sides are to sign an agreement on the Sino-Kazakhstan state border, which is 1,700 km long, and agreements on a Chinese commodity credit, which is expected to amount to about 50 million U.S. dollars, to Kazakhstan, and on Chinese humanitarian aid to the Republic to the tune of 1.5 million yuan.
