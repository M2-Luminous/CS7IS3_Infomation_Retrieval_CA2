Korea and Japan Denounced"--KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) [SKNDF] made public a statement denouncing the South Korean puppets and the Japanese authorities for trying to accelerate their nuclear armament by a new method, according to a report of radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul. Noting that the South Korean and Japanese authorities who have concealed their moves for nuclear armament for the recent several years and acted as shock brigades in the U.S. nuclear row against the DPRK announced the development of a new modified version of light-water reactors simultaneously, the spokesman said: This is a trick to evade the denunciation of the world public away from them in a crafty way and press on with the development of nuclear weapons. The modified version of light water reactors the South Korean and Japanese authorities are intending to develop are plutonium reactors under changed name, he noted, adding: The South Korean and Japanese authorities must not employ petty tricks but give up, first of all, the development of the modified version of light-water reactors and fast-breeder reactors intended to deceive the world opinion, and dismantle the heavy-water reactors and reprocessing facilities now in use for the development of nuclear weapons. The spokesman expressed the hope that the governments, political parties, organisations and peaceloving people of all countries will look squarely at the substantial moves of the South Korean and Japanese authorities for nuclear armament and lift up louder voices to check them.
