In a speech during a two-day workshop on "export finance policies and modalities," Mudavadi said further reduction of the inflationary pressure may be anticipated in coming months. "I targeted a rate of only 10 percent in my budget speech by the end of the year and while this has not been achieved, we are already on track and progress to date has been substantial," he said. Mudavadi told the bankers, insurers, manufacturers, and fresh produce exporters who attended the workshop that development of export finance and insurance sectors had to be set within the context of the financial management of the economy as a whole. The minister said the performance of financial markets directly affects the rest of the economy, adding that sweeping changes in the banking act, the central bank act and insurance act were being considered within the treasury. Mudavadi noted that a majority of Kenyan banks confined themselves to asset-based lending rather than cash flow lending to avoid high risks.
