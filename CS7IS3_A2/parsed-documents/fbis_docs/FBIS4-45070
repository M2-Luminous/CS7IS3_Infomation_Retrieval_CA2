Memorial ceremonies and lectures in the schools, films about World War II on television stations, and special supplements in the daily and weekly press. But these celebrations, especially the share of the administering of them, are full of irony. For if the invasion of Normandy, the beginning of the end of World War II, symbolized the beginning of 50 years of active American intervention overseas, the Clinton administration constitutes the end of that era, and the allies of the United States again yearn for determined American leadership. In recent weeks, the Clinton administration has lost yet another large measure of prestige and strength overseas. From Korea to Haiti, from China to Bosnia, the foes of the U.S.A. are learning that it is possible, and sometimes even worthwhile, to oppose it. Its friends are learning that it is difficult to rely on it. As the days of the Clinton administration go by, it becomes clearer that what appeared to his predecessor, George Bush, as a mission, appears to Clinton as a nuisance. On his way to the White House, Clinton thought, justifiably, that the American public held the strength of the president in the internal sphere to be more important than his power overseas. Now it is becoming clear to him that the slogan "It's the economy, stupid" was a good election slogan that blew the right wind in the sails of his campaign, but in the White House it is turning into a squall that is liable even to throw its passengers overboard. The public opinion polls prove that Clinton's weakness in the foreign sphere is not overlooked by the public and impairs his popularity. The American people are indeed more interested in internal matters than foreign affairs, but it wants to see a strong, determined, and proud president. Clinton's weak hesitation in the sphere of foreign relations, therefore, harms not only the image of the U.S.A. in the world, but also his own image. When the subject is humanitarian failures of the administration, which was supposed to stress this aspect in its foreign policy, so be it. President Clinton did not make even one harsh denunciation of the insane genocide raging in Rwanda. As far as intervention, it is understood that there is nothing to talk about. When the President disavows his promises to exert heavy pressure on China in the area of human rights, so be it. When the military junta in Haiti mocks loudly the promises of the American President to return Jean Bertrand Aristide to the presidency, so be it. Clinton's image can be forgiven. To a certain extent, America's image, as well. But when things get to the point of a threat to world peace, the negligence of the world's only superpower is criminal negligence. The reference is to the North Korean crisis--the events around the efforts for nuclear armament of Pyongyang have become complicated, and the dynamic of the events is too complicated for the American press to give them proper coverage. It may be assumed that the majority of the American public is not completely aware that an isolated state, with an unstable regime, about developments in which there is scanty intelligence information, is developing nuclear weapons under the nose of the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] and is threatening explicitly to use them against one of the main allies of America, South Korea. The present crisis is going on in a region of the highest strategic importance to the United States. Again and again, the North Koreans are going against the U.S.A. and the entire world, either by selling ballistic missiles to countries like Iran and Syria, or by their nuclear tricks. Washington's policy of appeasement has failed. "For every step that we take in order to slow (the North Koreans' nuclear race) they take two steps in order to speed the process," said the American expert on nuclear affairs Leonard Spector, in an interview with THE NEW YORK TIMES. Even after the director-general of the IAEA, Hans Blix, announced last Friday that its inspection delegation cannot carry out its mission properly because the North Koreans are deliberately speeding up the pace of the refueling of the reactor at the Yongbyon site, Washington responded slowly and moderately. The Security Council was only convened three days later, and the announcement that it issued was a call to North Korea to slow the process, and not a warning that contained a threat. Clearly, there is no quick and easy solution to the problem of North Korea. The way to handle Pyongyang's nuclear refusal must be many-sided, and it must rely on cooperation of the countries of the region, especially of Japan and China. The main deficiency of the Clinton administration in the foreign sphere is its weakness in creating international coalitions. This weakness reflects the entire range of problems of the administration in the foreign sphere. For the building of a coalition requires trust and credibility between Washington and each of the potential members of the coalition, and such credibility is built up by a strong and stable foreign policy, by determination and perseverance, by radiating leadership. These characteristics are lacking in the relations of the U.S.A. both with its friends and with its rivals. China celebrated recently the victory of its strong stand against the hesitant American pressures in the sphere of human rights, when Clinton ended the connection between the trade relations with Beijing and the human rights situation there. The U.S.A.'s European allies "reached the conclusion that they cannot work constructively with this administration," in the words of the commentator Jim Hoagland in the newspaper THE WASHINGTON POST, "and they are simply trying to suffer it in silence." The place to rehabilitate the credibility of the United States is not the blood-soaked shores of Normandy, but the Korean peninsula.
