To select and train minority nationality cadres well, we must first deepen our understanding and clarify the guiding ideology and principal tasks of our work. To select and train minority nationality cadres properly, we must take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as our guidance, put into practice the party's nationality policies and the "Law on Regional National Autonomy," and, closely centering around the major task of economic construction, intensify the building of leading bodies according to the principle of "four transformations" for cadres--making the ranks of cadres more revolutionary, younger in age, better educated, and more professionally competent, to train and foster a contingent of minority nationality cadres who: Have both ability and political integrity, will work honestly, and who can maintain close links with the masses of various nationalities with a complete range of specialities and well coordinated professions rationally formed to suit the needs of reform, opening up, and the development of the socialist market economy. To this end, it is necessary to: Proceed from the reality of the nationality regions, adopt effective measures, step up training and education, and further enhance the political and professional levels of the ethnic minority cadres; tap the sources and increase the number of cadres for special training in a planned way to replenish various kinds of scientific, technological, and management personnel and improve the structure of the ranks of nationality cadres; and to boldly select and use fine young and middle-aged cadres of minority nationalities, take great pains to enhance the ability of leading bodies at all levels in nationality regions to control the socialist market economy, and build leading bodies into staunch collectives adhering to the party's basic line, persisting in doing two types of work simultaneously, and having the ability to lead building socialism with Chinese characteristics, providing an organizational guarantee for carrying out in-depth reform and promoting economic and social development for minority nationalities in nationality regions. To train minority nationality cadres well, we must intensify training and education to comprehensively enhance the quality of minority nationality cadres. Education in political theory must be strengthened and education in Marxism, particularly Comrade Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, conducted universally among minority nationality cadres. Education in the party's nationality and religious policies must also be carried out to further elevate theoretical and political levels, set up Marxist concepts on nationality and religion, consciously safeguard the unification of the motherland and unity of all nationalities, and resolutely resist and oppose splitting and infiltratiion activities by antagonistic forces at home and abroad. At present, it is necessary to carry out the decision of the central authorities on studying Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping. We must enlist, in a planned and systematic manner, the vast numbers of minority nationality cadres, intermediate and senior cadres in particular, to study Comrade Deng's works conscientiously, put in a lot of time and energy to read the works in the original, and deeply understand and master the strategic ideology and theoretical views on building socialism with Chinese characteristics in a bid to enhance the consciousness, steadfastness, and creativeness of implementing the party's basic line. In this regard, it is also necessary to vigorously conduct cultural, professional, and practical training. Party schools at all levels must really undertake the task of training cadres of minority nationalities. In training nationality cadres, we must reinforce the building of grass-roots cadres in nationality regions. Cadres in townships and towns, and in township and town enterprises, are the backbone forces of agriculture and animal husbandry in nationality regions. Building up this contingent of cadres well is a necessity for the reinforcement of the party's grass-roots organizations and the state power at grass-roots level in nationality regions. It is also a foundation for selecting cadres at relatively higher levels. For this purpose, we must increase the number of grass-roots ethnic minority cadres and tap the sources for these cadres in a planned manner in light of the requirements for economic and social development in nationality regions. When training minority nationality cadres, we must step up building a contingent of ethnic minority professional and technical cadres. In order to change from having insufficient economic, scientific, technological, and management minority nationality cadres, various localities and departments should, in light of the organizational reform, select a number of capable minority cadres suitable for doing economic work, to receive the necessary training in a planned way and then send them to work in economic departments or enterprises. To adapt to the requirement to transform operational mechanisms and institute a modern enterprise system, we must extensively search and enthusiastically train management personnel of minority nationalities for enterprises of various kinds and enhance their standard in operation and management. To train and select minority nationality cadres well, we must select and assign leading cadres of minority nationalities properly. Leading bodies at all levels in the localities practicing national autonomy must select and assign minority nationality cadres in an appropriate manner in accordance with the "Law on Regional National Autonomy" and stipulations in pertinent documents. Minority cadres should be assigned work in leading bodies in provinces, prefectures, and counties with relatively large minority nationality populations; in minority nationality townships and towns with a relatively large minority nationality population; in departments closely related to the production and lives of minority nationalities; and in enterprises and institutions which have relatively more minority nationality staff and workers. Attention should also be paid to selecting and assigning minority nationality cadres to work in various departments of state organs at the central level. Finally, to do a good job of training and selecting minority nationality cadres, we must stress the necessity to intensify leadership and ensure implementation of the above measures.
