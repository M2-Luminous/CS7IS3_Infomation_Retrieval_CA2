[passage omitted] Let us look more closely, then, at the Pact's seven proposals, as illustrated by Buttiglione and Baldassarri. 1. Italy's peace and security. National unity is a basic principle that must be upheld against [League secretary] Bossi's and [League ideologue] Miglio's separatism. This assertion must have been welcomed also by Foreign Minister Beniamino Andreatta, so much so that in his contribution he expressed appreciation for this "wait-and-see position" in relation to the League, urging the latter to "clarify the boundaries between federalism and Italy's federal break-up." 2. Reform of the state and of local autonomous governments. In order to combat centralism, Segni's movement is proposing to strengthen the local autonomous governments. "Autonomy," Buttiglioni explained, " means transferring decisionmaking power as close as possible to citizens, voters, and taxpayers." However, this does not rule out "coordination instruments at interregional level." 3. Law and order. This means protecting people and their property. Apart from continuing to combat organized crime, efforts must also be made to combat petty crime, which is threatening urban life more directly. 4. Tax reform. According to Baldassarri's proposal, tax rates should not exceed 40 percent. Sharing the tax burden more equitably is one of the platform's objectives. 5. Solidarity policy. Until now, this policy has been "false and mystifying." It must now strive for efficiency. As regards running the services, budget limitations must be complied with, and managerial criteria applied. 6. Job and employment development. Access to work must become more flexible -- for example, by transforming unemployment benefits into incentives to become employed. To help young people, trainee contracts must be reintroduced, with reduced social charges during the first few years. 7. Modernizing society. This involves, in the first place, developing the south. For Baldassarri, however, the south's development "must be understood in terms of the country's overall development." For his part, ruling out massive subsidies, Segni explained in his contribution that "this policy must enable the south to become its own master, and provide for itself."
