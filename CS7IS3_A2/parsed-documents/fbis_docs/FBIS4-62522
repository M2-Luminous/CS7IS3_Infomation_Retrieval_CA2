Eliasson in Favor of Joint Actions"] [Text] Jan Eliasson (Sweden), chairman of the CSCE Minsk conference on Nagorno-Karabakh, has expressed support for close collaboration between the CSCE and the CIS in settling the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. "At the present stage, I think it is essential to consolidate the state of cease-fire in accordance with the commitments, which the sides have undertaken," he stated in an interview with an ITAR-TASS correspondent on the eve of his trip to the crisis region, which begins this week. The cease-fire, J. Eliasson believes, should be accompanied by specific measures. It is necessary to try to form an observer group with the participation of both the CSCE and the CIS, so that the observers can work together as closely as possible. "I hope that we will be able to take other steps too, including the withdrawal of troops, the removal of obstacles to transportation, the return of refugees, and the establishment of military and political guarantees," the chairman of the Minsk conference noted. "It is exceptionally important that we take measures now, otherwise the risk of an escalation of the conflict will be great. Joint actions on our part are extremely important." J. Eliasson sees the task of his forthcoming trip to the conflict zone as trying to "stabilize" as far as possible the cease-fire situation, which is to be monitored by CSCE and CIS representatives. He intends to hold meetings with "all leaders." It is proposed that the visit will last one week.
