This week, Robert Gelbard, the State Department official in charge of overseeing the antidrug fight, said Panama is doing very little to fight money laundering. Cardenas said: "I think he does not know the Panamanian situation or the efforts the government has made to fight drug trafficking and money laundering throughout the country. The U.S. official's statement was also rejected by Foreign Minister Jose Mulino, who described it as "unacceptable and irresponsible." Minister Cardenas said: "We have done our part, but the United States still has one important task to perform: to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT]." Panama and the United States signed MLAT in 1991, and it has been ratified by the Panamanian Legislative Assembly but not by the U.S. Congress. Cardenas described the position of the U.S. official as "unfortunate." Gelbard said Panama "has not taken the necessary steps to counteract the problem of the presence of millions of dollars generated by drug trafficking." In a note sent by Foreign Minister Mulino to U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton, the Foreign Ministry lists twelve steps the administration of President Guillermo Endara has taken to fight drug trafficking and money laundering. Gelbard's assertion came at a time when the Bill Clinton administration has announced a new policy for fighting drug trafficking. The new policy is based on the fight against the consumption of drugs and foresees a drop in financial aid to countries that do not make real efforts to fight the production and trafficking of drugs. Hinton, who yesterday concluded his work in Panama, apologized to the Endara government for Gelbard's statement. "In my opinion," he said, "Panama has done a lot to fight drug trafficking and I can point to the efforts of organizations like the Judicial Technical Police, the National Air Service, and the National Maritime Service in this endeavor." Meanwhile, Supreme Court President Arturo Hoyos affirmed that Panama "works seriously" to fight drug trafficking activities. He described the statement by the U.S. official as "improper." According to Hoyos, there is a "big difference" between this government and the past regime in matters having to do with the fight against drug trafficking because, in those days, drug trafficking was backed by important state officials. He noted that although the state has limited resources, the government has done a lot to confront drug traffickers throughout the country. The justice said: "We must remember that this country has just signed and delivered documents ratifying the Vienna Convention regarding the fight against the trafficking of hallucinogenic and illegal drugs." Justice Hoyos said Panama has signed the MLAT with the United States and Colombia. He explained that although Panama has already ratified MLAT, which was signed in the United States, the United States has not ratified it.
