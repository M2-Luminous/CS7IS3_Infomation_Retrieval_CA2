A group of former police and defense force generals have called on ANC members to disclose their role in what they termed past acts of terror. The newly-appointed deputy defense minister and former MK [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing] intelligence chief, Ronnie Kasrils, has dismissed the nine generals' call as a red herring. Ronel van Zyl reports. [Begin recording] [Van Zyl] Freedom Front leader Constand Viljoen, the only one of the group who is in Parliament, seriously questions the merits of the truth commission. [Viljoen] We in this regard feel that it is necessary for us in the interest of our own people, but also in the general interest of the country, for peace for our country, that we should warn the people against such a commission which might have the opposite effect which the ANC has in mind about the commission. [Van Zyl] He said equal treatment should be meted out to anyone who committed crimes in the political struggle. Mr. Kasrils, who was sworn in as deputy defense minister this afternoon, described the general's statement as totally irrelevant. [Kasrils] We stood for indemnity. We provided the information. Our slate is clean. That's why we've been insisting those who served apartheid must do likewise. [Van Zyl] Mr. Kasrils' appointment follows a request from Defense Minister Joe Modise for additional senior personnel to run the Defense Ministry. Mr. Modise has indicated that he's prepared to testify before the truth commission if it's expected of him. [end recording]
