Nonetheless, before this event even occurred, police and special services in West Europe had begun to pay attention to the fact that following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the trade in contraband radioactive material from the East has grown considerably. Latvia has no choice -- it is situated directly between the global powers of East and West. Is it inevitable that it should become a transit corridor for such contraband? "Last year, even INTERPOL became anxious over the trade in radioactive metals; principally, Germany. Now reunited with East Germany, the Germans are evidently aware, better than anyone else, that these materials were available to the special services which were linked throughout East Europe. And these relations are still vivid...," this is how Juris Jasinkevics, head of Latvia's national bureau of the international police organization INTERPOL, sums up the situation. Thus far, his bureau has not been tasked by his colleagues in other countries to investigate possible trade in radioactive metals here in Latvia. Over the last half a year, only one concrete case has been uncovered. The inquiry, which came from Germany, was connected with a car which was stopped at the German-Polish border while trying to return after delivering a load of so- called colored metals to Germany; border police detected radioactive traces in the car. In this case, the only link to Latvia was the fact that the car turned out to be the property of a Latvian company. In the export of these so-called colored metals, Latvia had been the transit country -- the load was delivered from Russia through Belarus. The reason for the radioactive traces remains unexplained, because German police had not been able to find where the load had been delivered. The fact that a special working group on trade in radioactive metals was established by the Ministry of Home Affairs in January, is evidence that the significance of the problem is actually growing. INTERPOL has organized two international conferences on criminal activity linked with environmental pollution and illegal trade in radioactive material. Copies of the reports are in the possession of the Latvian bureau and they reveal that at the last such meeting held in Lyons in September, it was the German representative who expressed extreme anxiety over the sharp increase in the number of such crimes in Germany. At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that in cases where the presence of radioactive elements was suspected, radioactivity was actually detected in relatively few instances (in 1992 -- 18 out of 158 inspections). He stated that material often toted as radioactive, is in being sold by taking advantage of prospect buyer's credulity. Among every case when radioactivity was actually detected, there has not been a single case of material being discovered which could be used in the production of nuclear weapons, which is the most dreaded scenario. In reports delivered at INTERPOL conferences, "Red Mercury," as an example, is most often mentioned. As DIENA has already reported, citing German press reports, this was the material Johann Rimmele supposedly had been planning to buy in China. There are different opinions concerning its usage. INTERPOL experts are of the opinion that "Red Mercury" is a material which can be used as an element in making detonators for plutonium-based bombs. The German and Dutch representatives at INTERPOL directed attention toward Russia as a source of the trade in dangerous materials. The Dutch representative emphasized the participation of former Red Army officers -- it is understood that they are cheating, by selling relatively useless goods as strategic material. [passage omitted] Dzintars Kalnins is the head engineer of the Center for Nuclear Research at the Latvian Academy of Science in Salaspils -- an institution where Latvia's most highly qualified specialists in this field are working. Therefore, the explanations and comments of Dz. Kalnins can evidently be treated as the opinion of a Latvian expert. First of all, it should be stated precisely that the valuable materials involved in the famous Lake Constance episode were not simply rare metals, but enriched isotopes. They are made by growing them in a crystal reticle. Isotopes are applied in precise technologies, in radio electronics, computer techniques, etc., where the respective isotopes -- perfect, precise atom crystals -- are necessary. In Latvia, such isotopes are not being manufactured, due to lack of necessary equipment. As Mr. Kalnins told us, the institutes which possess the special equipment needed to enrich these elements are situated near Moscow. "These institutes are practically under military management -- so it was during the time of the Soviet Union, and so it is now, that in the field of exact sciences, at least in this branch, the military line is being developed in the first order" -- he said. [passage omitted] To the question of what amount of rare metal contraband there is in Latvia and if there are inspection facilities to detect radioactive material at the border, the answer of the expert was skeptical -- he allows for the fact that customs officers, for the sake of financial benefit or due to a lack of knowledge, often "turn a blind eye." Also, they do not have adequate equipment to detect radioactive shipments. Naturally, at the airport any isotope -- radioactive or otherwise -- would be discovered by a common detector, since it is a metal... Nevertheless, the situation in radioactive control is hopeful -- at the Center for Nuclear Research there is a laboratory being established, where the certification and attestation of radioactivity detecting devices will be possible. There are also plans to organize training for customs officers and border guards in this laboratory. Judging by what Dz. Kalnins said, customs officers and border guards are not the only ones having problems: Recently, some kind of "mafiosi" called me and, not revealing their names, offered me a great amount of money to check the radioactivity of some metal in their possession. I replied that I do not make deals with anonymous people... A rhetorical question could be put as to whether it would not be in Russia's interests if there were strict controls over the export of isotopes? "Of course, and I am sure they would do it gladly, but I suppose that the Mafia has grabbed it in her hands" -- answered Dzintars Kalnins. To be continued...
