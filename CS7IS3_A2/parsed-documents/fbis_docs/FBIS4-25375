He expressed thanks for the careful arrangement the Myanmar Government had made for the sojourn. Nyunt said that to make the event, a milestone of their bilateral relations, the Myanmar Government decided to build two Buddha towers in Yangon [Rangoon], its capital, and Mandalay, its second largest city, using donations of the Myanmar people. Over 85 percent of the Myanmar population are Buddhists, and the country's rich cultural heritage, glittering temples and pagodas are well-known throughout the world.
