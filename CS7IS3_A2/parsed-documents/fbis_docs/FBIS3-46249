China's Environmental Protection Achievements Attract Worldwide Attention China's economy has entered another period of rapid development in the 1990's. Economic development, population growth, and higher consumption levels mean our country faces the threat of a global environmental problem. Moreover, with the increased degree of development and urbanization, as well as the development of village and town enterprises, environmental pollution and ecological damage accompanying our economic development have increasingly become an important factor actually obstructing our economic and social development. In 1993, the World Environmental Day meeting and award ceremony for the world's "top 500" were held in Beijing. The event attracted worldwide attention for China's environmental protection. In environmental protection, China has always been in the front ranks of developing countries. Many of our achievements have gone down in the history of civilization: -- Ecological agriculture has spread across the country, with the establishment of several thousand ecological agriculture experimental units of various types and size. As early as the beginning of the 1980's, China stopped the production of insecticides with strong poisons and high residue. The agricultural department began experimenting on pollution-free production and made new progress in afforestation on plains and along coastal regions. In particular, the shelter-forest project in the northeast-north-northwest region is known as "the world's best ecological project." -- Success has been achieved in preventing industrial pollution. A large number of industrial pollution control facilities built in our country in the 1980's have successively yielded results, raising the rate of disposal of three wastes [waste gas, waste water, and industrial residue], as well as the up-to-standard rate, remarkably. -- China's urban environmental situation has improved remarkably. As a result of the comprehensive efforts to improve the environment, the environmental quality of many cities has become better to varying degrees. Despite large increases in the urban population and energy consumption, urban atmospheric conditions have basically not worsened and the amount of some pollutants in the atmosphere have even decreased, thanks to various urban air pollution control measures. China's environmental protection has unique features, which have attracted the attention of the Third World. 2. Our Country Still Faces Grim Environmental Protection Prospects At a Time of Rapid Economic Development According to relevant departments, our country should soberly assess its current status of environment protection, despite its tremendous achievements in preventing and controlling industrial pollution. In the past year, some newly-launched projects, especially "wholly or partly foreign-owned" construction projects in development zones, continued to develop new pollution sources because they failed to strictly implement relevant state regulations mandating environmental impact assessments, and the "simultaneous construction of projects and facilities to control three wastes." Pollution in village and town enterprises worsened with each passing day, and the general level of industrial pollution increased. In 1992, 36.6 billion metric tons of waste water was released across the country, up nine percent from 1991; this figure does not cover village and town enterprises. The amount of waste water released last year was significantly higher than that discharged in the preceding year. Although the water quality in the main course of the Chang Jiang is good, pollution is quite serious near the river banks in sections that run through the major cities of Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing, and Shanghai. Only 41 percent of the 38,000-km stretches of the seven major rivers and inland rivers subject to water quality tests measure up to first- and second-class water quality standards, whereas 48 percent indicate fairly serious pollution. Surface water pollution is serious in the cities, with the river stretches in 80 percent of the cities suffering varying degrees of pollution. Statistics on 67 cities show that the annual and daily average levels of suspended atmospheric particles in approximately half of those cities exceed the limits. The annual and daily average levels of sulfur dioxide in 13 cities exceed secondary state limits. Our country's ecological problems also cannot be neglected. The devastating sandstorm that erupted in the northwest on 5 May 1993 left 85 people dead and 31 missing. Once again, we were given a warning of ecological destruction. The entire country is suffering from grassland degradation, desertification, salinization, and alkalinization. The illegal occupation and utilization of farmland has yet to be completely halted. Soil erosion is serious. A recent survey shows that 1.93 million square km [sq km] and 1.88 million sq km of land is affected by water and wind erosion, respectively. A sandstorm danger line totaling 10,000 li has been formed in northwest, north, and northeast China. Approximately one-third of the country's land is threatened by sandstorms, and more than 60 percent of impoverished counties in our country are concentrated within this line. Economic losses from sandstorms reach 4.5 billion yuan annually. 3. The Entire Country Was Buffeted by the Environmental Protection Wave in 1993 Last spring, the Eighth National People's Congress [NPC] decided to create an Environmental Protection Committee. Never before had our country set up environmental protection committees under both the government and the NPC. On 27 May, the State Environmental Protection Bureau released the names of 3,000 key pollution-causing enterprises in an attempt to encourage enterprises to control pollution. Unlike in the past when enterprises were allocated "spots" in order of their output value, profits, and taxes, they were listed according to the amount of effluents. Some of the large and medium enterprises which had previously been considered "efficient" were on the list. The move caused quite a stir throughout the country. In 1993, work to set up environmental indices was carried out gradually across the country. The establishment of an environmental index system is an environmental protection measure that is suited to the socialist market economy. Completely banning the movement of rhinoceros horns and tiger bone -- including medicines and handicrafts made of relevant materials -- into and out of the country is an important measure taken by our country to honor international conventions and to protect wildlife; the same can be said of completely banning the sale, purchase, carrying, and mailing of such products. At a national conference on industrial pollution prevention and control in Shanghai in October, Zhu Rongji, vice premier of the State Council, stated: Environmental protection has strong technical, economic, and legal implications. As in quality control work, we should heighten the environmental awareness of all people. It is wrong to think that pollution control can be spared to save money and accelerate industrial development. If we fail to control pollution, we will end up spending more money and will be unable to recoup losses that we have incurred. He stressed the need to combine environmental protection with comprehensive utilization, to protect and make full use of national resources, to generate economic returns, and to clean up the environment. The general inspection of the nationwide enforcement of environmental protection laws organized by the Environmental Protection Committees under the NPC and the State Council, as well as activities launched in October in connection with China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century, have had an extensive impact on all localities across the country. The high-standard and large-scale inspection of environmental protection law enforcement, which was launched for the first time since our country began its environmental protection program 20 years ago, has focused on seven provinces and autonomous regions, including Heilongjiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Anhui, and Jiangsu. It also covers 43 cities and counties and 166 factories in those provinces and autonomous regions. A number of cases involving environmental law violations and wildlife destruction have been investigated and dealt with. An example is the destruction of resources and the environment as a result of the illegal sale of rhinoceros horns in Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province; the extraction of gall secretion from live bears on the Zhuhai Bear Farm; the illegal construction of a seriously polluting cement plant in the Shilin tourist spot by the Jianan Company in Lunan County, Yunnan Province; and illegal gold mining in the Altun Mountain Nature Reserve. Besides citing negative examples for educational purposes, the state has issued a circular to commend a large number of advanced environmental protection models and instances. This has led to the enactment of local environmental protection laws and heightened the environmental protection awareness of local cadres and people. In Shandong, Governor Zhao Zhihao has urged leading cadres at all levels to "become accomplished individuals instead of a culpable generation" in environmental protection work. "China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century," attended by as many as 100 reporters from scores of news organizations, has had a great impact nationwide. For 20 days in a row, the China Central Television Station, during its National News Hookup program, broadcast reports on environmental protection from various areas, an unprecedented event since the founding of our country's television station. Many of the problems reflected during "China's March Toward An Environmental Protection Century" have attracted the attention of leaders at all levels, who have taken action to solve them. For instance, the report on environmental pollution and ecological destruction as a consequence of energy development in areas linking Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia has attracted the attention of State Council leaders. In mid-December, the State Council's Environmental Protection Committee held an on-site inspection and work meeting to solve the pollution problems of the "Black Triangle" of energy. Mankind is marching toward the 21st century. China's environmental protection is also marching toward the 21st century. China's environmental and development goals are magnificent. China is capable of seeking the ultimate solution to its environmental problems while maintaining sustained economic development.
