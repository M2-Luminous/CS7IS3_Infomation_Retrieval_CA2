Saburov, who was offered the post of Crimean vice premier, told our correspondent that the political situation on the peninsula interested him from one point of view only: Whether it will make it possible to develop a free economy in the Crimea. He said that on 4 and 5 March, he would go to Moscow to hold meetings with Russian and foreign structures, whose representatives he would like to invite to the Crimea. Then he will fly to London for the same purpose. He plans to return to the Crimea in three or four weeks and get down to work, provided that the parliament approves his status as vice premier. He does not intend to adopt Ukrainian citizenship. However, Chairman of the Crimean Supreme Council N. Bagrov said that he would not allow Saburov to occupy such a high post. Meanwhile, a strike committee represented by the bloc of pro-Russian forces and trade union leaders was created in Sevastopol. The strike committee submitted a package of draft resolutions for the forthcoming city council session. The package includes a draft resolution on transferring Sevastopol to Russian jurisdiction.
