Since the early 1980's, the Giurgiu Chemical Plant has been the major polluter of the air of the Danubian city of Ruse. The Romanian minister came to Bulgaria to work out a regional environmental programme aimed at the lower reaches of the Danube. On the basis of the programme the two ministers will sign a memorandum to the European Union to seek its support for the implementation of the programme. The sides are pleased with the fact that the two countries are becoming increasingly active in European environmental policy. "The signing of the Convention on Black Sea Protection in Bucharest last year and the forthcoming endorsement of the Danubian Convention, which will take place in Sofia, go to show the will of Bulgaria and Romania to share in a very important process: the conservation of Europe's natural resources," Mr. Bosevski said. Further talks between the two ministers will focus on a number of issues related to the finalizing of nuclear safety accords. The Romanian guest proposed that expert teams be set up to work in the sphere of nuclear safety and exercise reciprocal control. The sides are also expected to work out the status and composition of the inter-governmental commission on the implementation of the bilateral agreement on cooperation in environment protection.
