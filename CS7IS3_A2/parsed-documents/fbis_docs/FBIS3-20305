Berlusconi, the Milan media and publishing magnate who joined forces with the noisy Northern League and the neo-Fascist based National Alliance in January, declared, "I have no uncertainty in relations with the League" against the backdrop of rumblings from League leader Umberto Bossi against the Forza Italia driving force and the neo-Fascists under the Freedom Front umbrella. Bossi was quoted in today's newspapers as saying he opposed seeing Berlusconi in the premier's office, as appeared more than likely according to a reading of the tallies and projections as he spoke, and would never go into government with the neo-Fascist "lynch mob" in the winning coalition. In his first interview in the flush of victory, Berlusconi said, "I think relations are totally positive. The League candidates will now look behind the votes they have won and they'll be aware that the votes for the pole were in the majority. ``So I don't think there will be any betrayal of the voters who indicated exactly what they want: the formation of a unified pole which gives a majority to the country and expresses a strong and authoritative government,'' added the businessman-turned-politician. Asked whether he had his gaze set on Palazzo Chigi, the premier's office, he said the answer will come from Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who will "read the vote and act in consequence." On the incomplete tallies, which show Forza Italia, the Northern League and National Alliance with a comfortable majority in Lower House voting in capturing 355 seats, with 316 needed for a majority, and close to majority in the Senate, Berlusconi said the was pleased but, he added, "as for Forza Italia, we thought it would get even a better result." Later in the day, Berlusconi conferred for three house with ally Gianfranco Fini, who took his neo-Fascist MSI [Italian Social Movement] through a name-change to become the National Alliance which flanked Forza Italia in the south. The likely premier-designate also talked over the telephone to other representatives in his Freedom Front, League theoretician Gianfranco Miglio, and Centrist Union leaders Raffaele Costa, the outgoing transport minister, and Alfredo Biondi, both erst-while Liberals. In the vicinity was Cesare Previti, a successful Forza Italia candidate, who told reporters that he thought differences with Bossi could be patched up. "There are no problems of principle because it seems to me that Bossi was critical of the `lynch mob' right and Fini certainly does not belong to this category." On the League leader's "veto" levied against Berlusconi in the premier's office, Previti remarked, "Never say never," and said a meeting between the two men would be set up for the near future but had not yet been scheduled. As the Forza Italia leader conferred, the movement's spokesman, Antonio Tajani, said a press conference Berlusconi had announced had been cancelled but that he will take to the airwaves in the evening in an interview to be broadcast by the public radio and television corporation's channel one news program. On the left, the Democratic Party of the Left whip in the Senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said that arising from the ballot boxes is a "split between three Italies, the north, the center and the south" and spoke of the "dangerous logic" of the first-past-the-post system used for the first time in the watershed general election. According to the senator, the result of changes in the voting rules dictated by a national referendum vote in April last year, intended to give voters clear choices "to guarantee a stable and lasting government," will be difficulty in forming a government because of disarray on the right, "though they came out as clear-cut winners." After arguing that the ballot has "led Italian democracy into a dangerous blind alley," Chiarante said, "As far as the Progressives are concerned, it cannot be hidden that the defeat was clear-cut and, in certain parts of the country, like the North, especially heavy." He concluded his comment on the outcome of the vote by pledging that the "electoral understanding among the Progressives" will be further forged into "more consolidated democratic unity to make of this line-up a base and a point of departure for more dynamic and innovative political proposals which will not allow the right -- as has happened in part, paradoxically -- to present itself as a new and more modern force." The speaker of the Senate, Giovanni Spadolini, said today, in substance, the people voted and, in the coming months, corrections can be applied to the electoral laws as required. "But this electoral law corresponded to the indications of the people as clearly sanctioned in the referendum, no to party rule and corruption," he said with reference to the intentions of the referendum proposal architects to loosen the political party hold on public life and allow voters to vote the candidate. Talk now of an early end to the Parliament just voted into office, the twelfth post-war legislature of the republic, is "out of place," said Spadolini. "This Parliament, thanks to the seal of legitimacy received from the people, must find the energy to face and solve its major duties: first among them the start-up of institutional renewal in the country and the modernization of the state machinery to the level of new challenges," he added.
