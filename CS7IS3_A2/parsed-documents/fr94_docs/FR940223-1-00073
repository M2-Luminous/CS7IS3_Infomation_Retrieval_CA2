FR940223-1-00073 FR940223-1-00016 Amendment 2 to the FMP instituted a broad spectrum of measures to stop overfishing and to allow the stock to rebuild. These measures are to be revised, if necessary, each year to meet a mortality reduction schedule. One of these measures is a minimum mesh requirement in the cod end of an otter trawl net when certain amounts of summer flounder are retained (i.e., 100 pounds or more from May through October and 200 pounds or more from November through April). Since the regulations allow only nets that meet the minimum mesh size to be on board once the threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained, vessel operators are faced with several choices. The vessel may sail with only nets that meet the minimum mesh requirement and gamble on catching species of a certain size, including summer flounder, that are subject to capture with the minimum mesh size. Vessel operators may put nets with different size mesh on board and fish for several species of fish, including those subject to capture with small mesh, on the same trip. To conduct this mixed trawl fishery, vessel operators have to discard any amount of summer flounder that would result in the retention of the threshold amounts triggering the minimum mesh requirement. If a vessel operator pursuing a mixed trawl fishery wants to continue fishing for summer flounder in excess of the threshold amounts, he/she has to return the vessel to port to offload all nets that do not meet the minimum mesh requirement and return to the fishing grounds to resume fishing. Certain industry members (industry) approached the Council and claimed that the one-mesh-on-board provision is creating a hardship for those in the mixed trawl fishery without the concomitant benefits to those enforcing the minimum mesh requirement. Industry made a convincing case that the minimum mesh requirement could easily be frustrated by lining a legal size cod end with another legal size cod end, which could be located anywhere on deck, or by cinching off the net above the portion of the net with regulated mesh. As an alternative, the industry proposed that the one-mesh on-board provision be replaced with the net stowage provisions in the regulations governing the Northeast Multispecies fishery, in which a number of summer flounder fishermen participate. The Council, after hearing industry testimony, reviewing public hearing comments, and engaging in discussion, decided at its December meeting to adopt Amendment 6 and replace the one-mesh-on-board provision with the mesh stowage provision of the Northeast Multispecies regulations. Amendment 6, if approved, would allow vessel operators to carry several nets with different size mesh on board their vessels and exceed the minimum mesh seasonal thresholds, as long as all nets that do not meet the minimum mesh requirement are appropriately stowed once the minimum mesh threshold amounts of summer flounder are retained. Once stowed, these nets cannot be used for the remainder of the fishing trip. A regulation that would allow the Regional Director to authorize an experimental fishery to collect management information in certain circumstances was recommended by the Council for inclusion in this proposed rule to give effect to section 9.4.2 of the FMP regarding information and data needs. The Council is particularly interested in having additional mesh studies conducted to augment the results of the mesh studies done in New York and New Jersey. However, the Council was firm in its intent that no experimental fishery should result in a quota being exceeded. This restriction would maintain the integrity of the mortality reduction schedule, the central feature of Amendment 2. The Council also adopted for inclusion in this proposed rule a prohibition on the use of twisted mesh. Nets constructed of twisted mesh, when towed, do not conform to the minimum mesh requirement and violate the prohibition found at 625.8(a)(6). The addition of this prohibition would conform the summer flounder regulations with the Multispecies regulations. Such conformity is desirable since multispecies and summer flounder can be caught on the same fishing trip. The Council adopted another provision to modify the dimensions of the fish box or tote referred to in ยง625.25(d), to conform to those used in the Northeast Multispecies regulations. The prohibition found at ยง625.8(c)(9) would be revised to prohibit interference with a sea sampler or observer on board a vessel for any purpose, and not just for the activities under ยง625.26 and ยง625.27, as currently expressed in this prohibition. Observers placed on board a vessel engaged in an experimental fishery should have the same protection afforded to other observers and sea samplers.
