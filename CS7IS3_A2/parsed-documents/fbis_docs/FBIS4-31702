We also interviewed Magyar, member of the coalition negotiating team of the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], on the planned agreement and the chances of the negotiations. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What is the guarantee that the coalition partners will adhere to the contents of the agreement that is to be made? [Magyar] The coalition agreement is a political arrangement and of course no one can be forced by legal measures to adhere to it. The agreement is valid while the sides observe it. If someone violates the agreement, this means that he no longer wishes to govern together with the partner. In this case, the coalition can collapse. The coalition agreement establishes the conditions for joint governmental decisionmaking, the implementation of the jointly made decisions, and joint responsibility for these. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people might believe that the coalition talks have been halted because, according to the indications, you did not manage to make any progress on 12 June. [Magyar] The views are constantly being brought closer together and the number of disputed issues is being reduced all the time. With Imre Szekeres, executive chairman of the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP], we are continuously coordinating the text on the mechanisms and guarantees of joint governmental work. There is no need at all for concern; even in Germany, the coalition talks last two to four weeks although they already have established mechanisms for such talks. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Is it possible that you will manage to agree on the guarantees today or this week? [Magyar] I would not exclude this possibility. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Between the two rounds of the elections, you said that the MSZP would exclude the possibility of coalition cooperation with the SZDSZ if it named [MSZP Chairman] Gyula Horn as prime ministerial candidate. Did this cause any problems in the negotiations? [Magyar] Both parties acted independently when they set up the negotiating delegations for the coalition talks. I find it perfectly natural that neither side interfered in the other side's selection of the delegation members or in determining its size. As for the quoted statement, a fundamentally different situation arose after the second round of the elections because the MSZP acquired a 54 percent majority in Parliament. According to the surveys, the majority of the MSZP's and SZDSZ's voters are committed supporters of the two parties' coalition, and the Socialists made a coalition offer to us. All these made it perfectly clear for us that we had to enter the coalition talks. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] As one of the SZDSZ's influential politicians, do you have governmental desires, would you accept a nomination for some kind of governmental position? [Magyar] I have already said many times that I do not have such ambitions. I have not changed this view. As a matter of fact, participation in the coalition talks does not necessarily mean that the person in question wishes to take a role in the new government. [MAGYAR HIRLAP] According to assessments published in the press, the SZDSZ had spent the most money on the election campaign. According to certain information, the party has serious debts. I am asking you, as the SZDSZ's campaign chief, what is true from all this? [Magyar] The SZDSZ does not have serious debts. As a matter of fact, the assessments of campaign costs did not contain the costs of certain advertisement carriers. The SZDSZ used the amount that is had at its disposal during the campaign rather efficiently. I dare say that it was not us who spent the most money on the campaign but at least two parties were ahead of us in this.
