The plan was announced by General Carlos Alberto Pulido Barrantes, director of community participation, at a press conference, where he explained the scope of the official strategy for improving the police's image. The official indicated that one of the most important aspects of the program is the selection of the personnel who will serve as patrol officers and whose job will be to interact with the community in their assigned areas. The patrol officers will be selected very carefully, according to the police plan, to make sure that only qualified, well-mannered people with a strong civic spirit are chosen. "We will no longer take people," said Pulido, "who have nothing to do, who have been rejected elsewhere. The selection process will involve background checks, and the best high school graduates from each community will be identified." For now, the police academies will train the first 400 patrol officers, who will begin working in the underprivileged districts to determine the needs of these communities. The program requires that the activities of the patrol officers will be monitored constantly to make sure they adjust to the needs that arise in the districts where they are working. "The police," said General Pulido, "are willing to do whatever is necessary to reach out to each citizen. The police officer will get to know the people on his beat and will offer them service and friendship." The general explained, however, that this will not be an easy task, since "we need more men," but he said that if the population cooperates with the program, it will become stronger and there will be participation. In this regard, the patrol officers assigned to the program will participate in police campaigns to encourage courtesy and proper treatment to project a new image in the community. The strategy is designed "to respond to people with our efforts," stated General Pulido, "helping people solve their problems, entertaining children, and showing support for the community as it deals with its problems." Under the plan, in each village, municipality, and neighborhood in the country there will be a community participation office, a clearinghouse for complaints and claims, an information office, and a help line that will allow the people to voice their concerns. All for One To further the objectives of the program, the police will launch a campaign to involve patrol officers in disaster prevention, ecological projects, rescue operations, drug addiction prevention, literacy, and child protection. In addition, the officers will be trained to work with the community on projects to build schools, rest homes, sports centers, housing, and the reconstruction of parks, roads, and sewage systems. On another front, the police want to strengthen the Civic Police Force to contribute to the development of educational efforts to raise people's awareness of basic rules of safety and courtesy. "We want the service to be as pure and transparent as possible, to make our work visible and get trade unions, industrial plants, Indians, black people's associations, universities, women's groups, and other social groups involved in our work," stated Salgado. The high-ranking official also stated that as the patrol officers work in their respective communities, people's trust in that institution will be renewed.
