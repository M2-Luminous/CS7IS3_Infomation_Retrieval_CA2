According to an official report the Central Bank released yesterday on the new, 10th state short-term bond issue, the amount will be 100 billion rubles, or 30 billion less than the previous issue. Therefore, for the first time in the history of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance has had to reduce the amount of the bond issue to below the amount of the previous issue. Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank report limited the portion of the total issue available to foreign investors. The failure of the January primary state short-term bond auction, when the Ministry of Finance was able to float only three-fourths of the projected amount of the latest "portion" of the domestic debt, forced the country's main financial agency to take a more cautious approach in deciding the size of the anniversary bond issue, the 10th. For the first time in the history of the short-term bond market, the Ministry of Finance had to reduce the amount of the latest issue to below the previous figure, and the reduction was equivalent to 23 percent of the originally announced amount, which is extraordinary in itself. Exports from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the insubstantial results of the January auction were not the only reason for the Ministry of Finance's reduction of the bond issue. After taking a look at the results of the Central Bank's regular surveys of financial dealers, the organizers of the state short-term bond market apparently decided that the Ministry of Finance had lost the trust of many investors after the winter changes in the government and the probable dramatic adjustments of the reform policy. It is significant that the projected changes in the policy of economic reform were supposed to have been approved or rejected by the Council of Ministers at a meeting scheduled long ago for 17 February. Judging by the dynamics of key interest rates (particularly the current yield on Ministry of Finance short-term bonds and foreign securities), the market was clearly preparing for the worst. This means that next week the dealers are more likely to conduct operations in the foreign currency market than to invest in the Ministry of Finance's ruble bonds. If large dealers act on these intentions, it will be extremely difficult for the Ministry of Finance to float a debt of even 100 billion rubles on 15 February, the date of the primary auction of the 10th issue of state short-term bonds. Changes in Size of Short-Term Experts from KOMMERSANT-DAILY believe that the slightest hint of any possible destabilization of the foreign currency market this week will discourage participation in the primary auction on 15 February because it will be inadvisable from the standpoint of short-term speculative profits. In this case, the Ministry of Finance probably can expect insufficient demand for the bonds, and this will immediately reduce the liquidity of the secondary bond market. Besides this, yesterday's Central Bank press release set a limit of 10 percent of the total issue (10 billion rubles) for foreign investors. The Central Bank's technical move to regulate the market aroused the interest of the KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts: This is the first time that objective figures can be used as a basis to estimate the demand for short-term state bonds among foreign investors, because approximate estimates of the foreign interest in these bonds have been impossible up to this time.
