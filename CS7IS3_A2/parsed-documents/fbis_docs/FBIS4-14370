They added that the discussions have so far resulted in agreement to have figures from inside the occupied territory and figures from the diaspora equally represented in the authority body. [passage omitted] Meanwhile, informed Palestinian sources have stated that 'Abdallah Hurani, who had resigned from the PLO Executive Committee, has had a reconciliation with President Yasir 'Arafat. Their reconciliation resulted in his appointment as head of the "Returnees Department" formerly headed by 'Abd-al-Rahim Malluh, the representatiave of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] in the Executive Committee (who had also resigned). Hurani, who, along with five other Executive Committee members, resigned after the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles was signed on 13 September 1993, was previously head of the PLO's Cultural Department. AL-HAYAH has learned that Malluh visited Tunis at the end of last week for the first time since resigning from the Executive Committee last September. He met with some prominent Fatah leaders and also probably met with President 'Arafat. This is considered to be the first meeting between the the PFLP and Fatah since the Declaration of Principles was signed.
