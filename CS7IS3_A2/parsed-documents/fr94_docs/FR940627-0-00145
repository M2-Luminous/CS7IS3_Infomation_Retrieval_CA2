FR940627-0-00145 FR940627-0-00019 In order to simplify diesel additive testing and allow comparability between the test results of all diesel additives evaluated in this program, EPA requires that all diesel additives (including those produced exclusively for use in # 1 diesel fuels) be tested on the # 2 diesel base fuel (specified in Section V). If a manufacturer is concerned that the emissions generated using a blend of their # 1 diesel fuel additive with the # 2 diesel base fuel may be subject to artifacts due to this blending, then that manufacturer may submit a request for a modification in test procedures. Any such request must include supporting data (e.g., emission characterization data) and suggested test modifications. VII. Tier 1 Requirements The scope of Tier 1 encompasses: (1) a literature search for available information on the composition and effects of F/FA emissions on public health and welfare, (2) a chemical analysis to characterize the emissions of fuels or additive/base fuel mixtures, and (3) a qualitative discussion of potential exposures using information on total production volume and market distribution patterns of the particular fuel(s) or additive/base fuel mixture(s). A. Literature Search 1. Scope The registration program requires F/FA manufacturers to conduct a comprehensive data search that will include all relevant existing information concerning previous emission characterization and health effects and welfare studies. The data search must address the chemical composition and potential adverse effects of whole combustion emissions, relevant combustion emission fractions (e.g., particulate phase), and whole evaporative emissions, as applicable. The literature search must also address each of the individual combustion and evaporative (where different) emission products identified by the required emission speciation procedures, with the exception of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, and formaldehyde. Special literature search requirements for non-baseline and atypical F/FAs are described in Section VII.A.3. Information considered applicable to a given fuel or additive includes data obtained from the testing of emissions from the fuel or additive in question or from other similar products. For this purpose, ``similar'' products are those which meet the criteria for enrollment in the same F/FA group as the subject fuel or additive, pursuant to the grouping system criteria discussed in Section IV. F/FA manufacturers who choose to participate in the grouping system may pool information about all member products for purposes of their joint submission and may also make use of available data on other products which are not enrolled in the group but share the designated formulation characteristics of group members. Similarly, a manufacturer who chooses not to participate in the grouping system could include any test results which may be available for products which could theoretically be assigned to the same group as the manufacturer's own product. The survey on health effects studies is not restricted to the particular endpoints and experimental protocols included in Tier 2. Studies using other scientifically acceptable methods or protocols addressing all health effects of F/FA emissions must also be included in the Tier 1 report. Most often, data will be available from experiments conducted with laboratory animals, but other applicable studies must also be considered. Evidence for potential toxicity or lack of toxicity in exposed humans may be available from epidemiological studies, clinical studies, occupational exposures, or case reports. In general, referenced experiments must be concerned with the health effects of inhalation exposure to F/FA emissions (combustion and evaporative). However, data collected from relevant studies using other routes of exposure must also be included. Available results from in vitro tests, comparative metabolism studies, and structure-activity analyses are also considered relevant and must be included in the summary report for health effects of F/FA emissions.
