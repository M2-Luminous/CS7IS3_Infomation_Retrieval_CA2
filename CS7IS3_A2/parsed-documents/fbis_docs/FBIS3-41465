Sakharnykh, chairman of the Kaliningrad Oblast Ecology and Natural Resources Committee, by S. Tribunko; place and date not given: ``Ground -- for Dessert to Mother Nature''] [Excerpts] Tribunko: How serious is the ecological situation in Chernyakhovskiy rayon? Sakharnykh: The situation is very grave. The city's water-supply and sewage enterprise is the main polluter. This enterprise yearly discharges more than 6 million cubic meters of untreated sewage into water reservoirs, causing 2 billion rubles [R] worth of damage in 1993 alone. In 1993, the maximum acceptable level of nitrous ammonia in water exceeded the norm by 71 times, that of phosphorus -- by 37 times, and of oil products -- by 100 to 300 times. Tribunko: One gets the impression that there are no sewage treatment plants in the rayon. Sakharnykh: Such plants exist, but their number is insufficient. For example, out of 11 treatment plants not a single one functions in accordance with its planned operating schedule. Only four plants provide the mechanical treatment of sewage, while the remaining seven provide no treatment at all. The situation is aggravated by all kinds of accidents at city enterprises. Tribunko: Could you cite any examples? Sakharnykh: I will only cite the most serious ones. In 1993, the engine house discharged more than a tonne of oil products into the Angrapa river, causing damage estimated at more than a R1 million. There were similar accidents accompanied by discharging industrial oil at joint-stock enterprises ``Molochnyy Zavod,'' ``Chernyakhovskmebel,'' and ``Tekhmash.'' On 12 January, an industrial oil spill occurred at ``Tekhmash'' through negligence. [passage omitted] Tribunko: I would like to know your opinion regarding the building of the facility for processing toxic waste. Sakharnykh: This is not a bad idea. If everything goes according to plan, and all the technological requirements are observed, the functioning of the facility will not aggravate the ecological situation in the region. However, we cannot disregard the notorious ``what if'' factor which can bring about big trouble, including deaths. Besides, I do not understand the haste with which this idea is being implemented. Geologic research has not been completed, there has been no independent experts' evaluation of the project, nor its technical and economic justification. Thus, I believe that it is too early to speak about the facility at this point.
