Relations between the two countries now stand at their lowest ebb following Britain's protest to Iran for allegedly supplying the Provisional IRA with cash or arms. Tehran formally denied that and hit back today with new allegations claiming that Britain was sheltering terrorist organisations working against the Iranian Government. The Tehran Times said that Britain had no right to question Iran's adherence to international conventions against aiding terrorists. "Western powers, Britain among them, cannot plead ignorance when it comes to the terrorist nature of anti-Iranian groups they harbour in the West," the newspaper said. But a Foreign Office spokesman said: "The Government denies any contact of any kind with the Mojahedin-e Khalq group. Opposition groups from any country are free to operate in the United Kingdom within the law. If they break the law they will be prosecuted. If the Iranian have evidence of illegal activity they should let us have sight of it." Earlier this week, Foreign Office Minister of State Douglas Hogg summoned the Iran charge d'affaires Gholam Reza Ansari to give him a dressing down about Iran's alleged involvmenet with the Provisional IRA. Afterwards, Iran flatly denied this allegation, although Britain remains convinced that there were such links. The paper says that the British protest about the IRA was "a smokescreen to hide the fact that Western-based anti-Iranian terrorists are providing material and personnel to the Iraq-based terrorists to attack targets inside the Islamic republic." Britain's relations with Iran have been in a state of turbulence ever since the late Ayatollah Khomeyni passed sentence of death (a "fatwa") on author Salman Rushdie in 1989 for alleged blasphemy in his novel The Satanic Verses. This was a call to Muslims the world over to kill him. The sentence has never been lifted and Rushdie has been forced into hiding ever since.
