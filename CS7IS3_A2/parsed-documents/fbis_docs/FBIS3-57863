On Tuesday [4 January], Berlin's judicial authorities reported that the Federal Government has been trying since August 1993 to obtain the extradition of a stateless Palestinian arrested in Lebanon, who is suspected of having been involved in organizing the attack. They said the name of the man is Yusef C. In 1986 he was a diplomat at the Libyan mission in East Berlin, the so-called People's Bureau. In the course of 1992, he was detained in Lebanon pending extradition, a fact the German authorities did not know until November 1992. But the German authorities still do not know whether the suspect was arrested following an arrest warrant issued by the Berlin court in 1990 for accessory to murder. The Foreign Ministry in Bonn, via whom the extradition request was addressed to the Lebanese authorities, has not yet received an answer to this question. There is no extradition agreement between Germany and Lebanon. Two American men and one Turkish woman were killed and 230 people injured in the bomb attack on the La Belle discotheque on 7 April 1986. The discotheque, in Berlin's Schoeneberg district, was mainly frequented by American soldiers. United States fighter aircraft bombed the Libyan capital Tripoli and the port of Bengazi in retaliation. The extradition request is not directly linked with the suspension of criminal proceedings at the end of April 1993 against a Palestinian called Imad Mahmud, suspected of having been involved in the attack. He was accused of having been involved in the planning of the attack, at least at the beginning, but not in the organization or even the actual carrying out, as Yusef C. allegedly was. The person who planted the bomb has still not been found. This part of the proceedings could be resumed shortly, since the main prosecution witness, Muhammad A., who has meanwhile moved to Norway, was heard by a court there. He is said to have confirmed all the main points of the statement he had previously made to the Berlin Public Prosecutor. According to the findings of the Public Prosecutor -- which are contained in the indictment -- in March 1986, during the severe political tensions between the United States and Libya over the closing of the Gulf of Sirte in the Mediterranean, two members of the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin and the accused talked about carrying out an attack on American soldiers in which as many people as possible should be killed, without specifically planning the attack.
