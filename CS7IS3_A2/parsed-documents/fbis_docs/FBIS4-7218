The agreement was made during talks between visiting Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae and Japanese Defense Agency Minister Kazuo Aichi. Under the agreement, a South Korean cruiser is expected to visit Japan this fall, followed by a similar visit to Korea by Japanese Maritime Defense Agency vessels. The two ministers decided to expand military personnel exchanges and take others steps to further promote mutual understanding through substantial military exchanges, the report said. Exchanging opinions on other matters of common interest, Yi and Aichi agreed that the North Korean nuclear question should be resolved forthwith and North Korea should promptly return to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty if only to fulfill its obligations as a member of the world community. The Yi-Aichi talks lasted one and a half hours beginning 4:15 PM. Yi is set to tour major Self-Defense Force installations and pay a call on Prime Minister-designate Tsutomu Hata before leaving Japan for the next leg of his tour, Moscow, on Thursday.
