Daniel Cejas, president of the pensioner and retired people coordinating board, announced that the group will resist the government attempt to transfer the Pension Fund to the nation "to the final results." "The peaceful takeover that started around 0700 will continue until federal trustee (Juan) Schiaretti shows up to listen to the people and pensioners," Cejas said. On 6 June, in the largest protest demonstration since the social outburst in December, some 3,000 people marched in front of the federal trustee's office to repudiate the transfer of the Pension Fund to the national administration and the Savings and Loan Fund's reorganization. According to the administration headed by Schiaretti, a native of Cordoba Province, the Pension Fund runs a deficit of about 5 million pesos per month, or 60 million pesos a year, and needs an in-depth reorganization. Cejas in turn denied the deficit and warned: "The people of Santiago are mad and ready to resist this bad government. We spoke with many ministers and all of them gave us half answers. This is why we want to talk with Schiaretti."
