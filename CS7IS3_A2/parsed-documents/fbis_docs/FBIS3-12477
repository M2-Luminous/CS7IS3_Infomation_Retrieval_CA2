What are the PLO's preconditions for further negotiations? [Al-Franji] The demands of the Palestinians after the massacre are clear. They are looking for protection for the Palestinians in the occupied territories and they demand that not just a few settlers but all the settlers be disarmed. It is obvious that this issue must be discussed between us and the Israelis so that something like the terrible massacre of Friday cannot happen again. In addition, many Palestinians who enthusiastically advocated the peace process a month ago are now doubting whether it is worth negotiating peace while experiencing war every day. Of course, there is disappointment, bitterness, and the massacre has achieved its aim. [Beindorff] The PLO seems to demand that UN blue helmets are positioned in the occupied territories and not just unarmed UN observers. Do you think that you can push this demand through? Is it absolutely necessary for you? [Al-Franji] This demand is very legitimate. The Israeli Army cannot safeguard the security of the Palestinians in these territories. Immediately after the massacre when the Palestinians were demonstrating, they fired on the crowd. The number of casualties in the West Bank and Gaza went up afterward. This shows that the Israeli Army cannot be neutral in this conflict. And the Israeli Army does not intend to disarm all the settlers. This means that it takes a burden off the Israelis and their army if international protection troops are stationed between us and the Israeli settlers until we have found a solution to the problem. If they want, we could have U.S. and British UN soldiers so that the Israelis do not fear that a front is being formed against them. It has become very obvious that the Israeli Army is no longer in a position to control the West Bank and Gaza and that it cannot keep the settlers under control either. [Beindorff] Disarming the settlers is one of the PLO's main demands. Who is to protect the settlers? Or is this meant as a start to the breaking up of the settlements? [Al-Franji] When we excluded this question the Palestinians hoped that the problem would be solved by the Israelis leaving the country. They live in the West Bank, which is 5,400 square kilometers. In this territory there live 1.3 million Palestinians. And right among them live 150,000 Israeli settlers who occupied the land illegally and built their houses illegally. This decision of the settlers has not been accepted by international organizations. You must imagine that in Gaza nearly 1 million people live in 365 square kilometers. And there are 5,400 Israeli settlers, claiming 160 square kilometers. This is unbelievable. It is just not normal; and this is a situation that will lead to confrontations if we cannot find a solution quickly. And because we Palestinians are determined to get the peace process so far that we can achieve peace with the Israelis, we think that the Israeli Government can yield on this question. If the Israeli Government wants a lasting peace then it must make concessions in this matter and they must think about whether they want peace, or the settlements and the settlers. [Beindorff] If I understand you correctly, peace is only possible if the settlements in the occupied territories disappear. [Al-Franji] It is clear that in the long run they will disappear, or they will have to give in to the Palestinian authority that is forming there. This means if they accept, just like the Arabs living in Israel, Palestinian passports and Palestinian authority, this would be a new situation where we could discuss the issue with the Israelis. But the majority of settlers say they will not accept Palestinian authority and that they will use force to question this authority. And that is what they have done. This action in Hebron was meant to prove that the settlers can do it; and they can. [Beindorff] PLO leader Yasir 'Arafat is accused of making too many concessions to the Israelis. Does 'Arafat still represent the interests of the majority of Palestinians? [Al-Franji] Yasir 'Arafat does represent the interests of the majority of Palestinians. Of course, the disappointment of many Palestinians is understandable. It is disappointment because Yasir 'Arafat, and the PLO leadership, has promised that the Israelis will withdraw on 13 December. They did not withdraw. They said that the violence in the occupied territories will decline. The violence has increased. The activities of the Israeli Army have become much tougher. And of course, this is what the Palestinians experience. They say: Yasir 'Arafat has signed an agreement; he promised us a better life; he promised us freedom. And they see that we have been living in a state of permanent confrontation since September. And this massacre that concerns so many people brings up emotions and outcries. There are protests, and maybe also nasty words against 'Arafat and the PLO leadership. [Beindorff] Mr. al-Franji, you are going to Tunis today. Do you expect a debate on the PLO leadership there? [Al-Franji] Discussions within the PLO have never ended; discussions about the way we lead the PLO. We have never simply accepted a Palestinian leader within our ranks without being critical toward him, and this includes Yasir 'Arafat. But on the other hand, we cannot question these people's credibility whenever a conflict arises. We are in a very difficult process. We cannot prove quickly enough to the Palestinians that we have achieved some progress. We will have to count on two things: First, the Israelis must take us into account and give way on these matters in order to help us. Second, we demand, or we hope, or we ask, that the European Union, those countries that have good relations with Israel, do not pressure Israel but make recommendations so that they give way on certain difficult problems, such as the matter of settlements, and other problems which involve the Palestinians' possibility to get an autonomous state. [Beindorff] One last question, and I ask you to give me a very short answer. The Security Council has not yet agreed on a resolution. When do you expect an answer? [Al-Franji] We are waiting for this answer. And what the PLO will do partly depends on the Security Council's decision. We hope that it will react in a responsible way. [Beindorff] Thank you for the interview.
