Lavrov is expected to leave for New York as the Russia's permanent ambassador at the UN. Lavrov said issues on peacemaking activities, including on CIS territory, and on strengthening of the UN as an organization capable of uniting efforts of all states and of helping them to define the basis of the new system of international relations, would be discussed during the visit of the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali to Moscow (on April 1-5). Lavrov did not rule out a discussion on reorganization of the UN Security Council and the UN in general. He stressed that the issue was being considered by a specially established working group which was discussing criteria for possible enlargement of the UN Security Council. Possible candidacies were also discussed, including Germany, Japan, India, Nigeria, Egypt, Indonesia and other states. However, this does not mean that the candidacies will become a full member of the UN Security Council. Consensus was required to resolve the issue, primarily in the regional groups. Lavrov said enlargement of the UN Security Council must be balanced not only from the point of view of the industrially developed countries but also from the point of view of geographical regions. He suggested that the parties concerned would have to discuss this issue for a long time. There were proposals to finish the work on the issue by the fiftieth anniversary of the UN (1995). However, they were not accepted. The anniversary was not the main criterion for the work. Russia is prepared to consider the issue on limited enlargement of the UN Security Council. However, the efficiency of the Security Council must be preserved or even increased.
