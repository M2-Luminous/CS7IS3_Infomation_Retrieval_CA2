Issacson] [Text] Durban April 27 SAPA -- The Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] intends to complain to American President Bill Clinton about remarks made by a U.S. election monitor on South African television on Wednesday [27 April] night. IFP spokesman Ed Tillet said the remarks were partisan and uninformed. He said U.S. monitor Nellie Bailey referred to IFP President Mangosuthu Buthelezi as having "colluded with the racist regime" and was also critical of the party's late entry into the elections. "We do not expect foreign observers to interfere in South Africa's domestic affairs or deliver hostile political judgments against any political party or leader during the transition to democracy," Mr Tillet said in a statement. The IFP would ask the U.S. ambassador to forward the complaint to Mr Clinton.
