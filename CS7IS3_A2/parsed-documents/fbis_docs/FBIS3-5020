This, according to Gov. Abdulgani "Gerry" Salapuddin, is because the Islamic religion is being used to fuel the commitment of the group's members to turn Mindanao into an Islamic state. Basilan is where the group started to gain prominence and followings. It was founded by Islamic leader Abdulajik Janjalani. The military has described the group as "the third force" to reckon with in Mindanao, after the Moro National Liberation Front [MNLF] and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). "This (Abu Sayyaf problem) is more difficult to solve than mere insurgency," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. He said the insurgency problems are rooted on political and economic factors. Once these factors are addressed in a sustained manner, "the issue will die down by itself," he said. "But not extremism because ideas and beliefs don't die." It is likely, he said, that the group will not give in to any concession short of the establishment of an Islamic government in Mindanao. Abu Sayyaf members are ready to die for their cause, believing they will go to heaven (or surgah) if they die fighting. Salapuddin, a former MNLF commander, continued: "They will be accorded martyrdom by Allah if they are killed in combat. This is what new members are taught. It is difficult to re-orient them otherwise." It is the appeal on religious extremism, Salapuddin said, that contributes to the growing appeal of the group to new members in Mindanao and in Metro Manila. "Extremism catches fire," he said. Moreover, the group is reported to be targeting both the Muslim intellectuals and the poor fishermen "who are not educated enough to know the true meaning of Islam." But the majority of more than four million Muslims here are reportedly not supportive of the cause and ideal propagated by the Abu Sayyaf. "Islam espouses moderation, anything that is extreme is not what Islam teaches," Salapuddin told the INQUIRER. He urged local government leaders in Mindanao to mobilize the local "moderate" Muslim leaders to "counter the spread of extremism," which had reportedly reached many Muslim-populated barangays [villages] in Mindanao and Metro Manila. Meanwhile, he said the top leaders of the Abu Sayyaf have left Basilan for other places in the country. He could not say where they have gone to, but he gave this hint: "Where bombs are exploding, where terroristic activities are -- you can guess they have leaders there."
