The new cabinet is to be headed by present Deputy Premier Roman Kovac, who is along with Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik the main protagonist of the Alternative of Political Realism, a faction that recently emerged within the Meciar-led government Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), the daily reports. Michal Kovac is regularly informed of all agreements reached between the opposition parties (aimed at settling the current parliamentary crisis in Slovakia), the paper quotes the source as saying. The Slovak opposition is convinced that Meciar's cabinet can be removed only after parliament approves the term of early parliamentary elections. The paper quotes Slovak Ambassador to Prague Ivan Mjartan as saying at a meeting with businessmen in Brno, south Moravia, that he favored the creation of a broad coalition government in which top political leaders would be replaced by experts (as proposed by the Alternative). Mjartan said he expected Slovak Parliament to pass no confidence motion on the government. However, if parliament admits the shortening of the electoral term, it would be no solution, since the HZDS would win the early elections again, MLADA FRONTA DNES quotes Mjartan as saying.
