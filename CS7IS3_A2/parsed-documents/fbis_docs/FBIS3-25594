[Heine] I'm standing here at a packed farmers' hall outside Newcastle where thousands of Afrikaner Volksfront supporters have gathered. Gen. Tienie Groenewald has just addressed the crowd and told them to prepare for mobilization. He said a new government will take over 80 percent of the Afrikaners' jobs. He said this was the ANC's [African National Congress] so-called affirmative action. His constant reference to a volkstaat for northern Natal was met by loud applause and cheering from the crowd. CP [Conservative Party] leader Dr. Ferdi Hartzenberg will in minutes address the crowd.
