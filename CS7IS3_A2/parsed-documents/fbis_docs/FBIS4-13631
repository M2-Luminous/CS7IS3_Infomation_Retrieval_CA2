This was announced by Iraqi Information Minister Yusuf Hammadi, who delivered the message to Lt. Gen. 'Umar al-Bashir, at a news conference held this evening at the Hilton Hotel. The Iraqi minister, who is currently visiting the country, added that he discussed with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir the possibility of cooperation between the friendly and brotherly states to achieve the lifting of the blockade. Mr. Hammadi commended Sudan's stand of solidarity with Iraq. He pointed out that Lt. Gen. al-Bashir had assured him that the unjust blockade was not aimed at Iraq only, but at the growth of Arab strength and its confrontation with colonialists. It also aimed to exhaust the resources of the Arab nation. Mr. Hammadi added that his meeting with Lt. Gen. al-Bashir dealt with ways of strengthening brotherly relations between the two countries. Concerning the UN Security Council's position on lifting the blockade imposed on Iraq, Mr. Hammadi explained that the stand adopted by the UN Security Council differed from what it had held in the past, and that this was because a split had occurred in the viewpoints of the permanent member states. France, Russia, and China were in favor of lifting the blockade against Iraq, whereas United States and Britain were not. On Gulf-Iraqi relations, Mr. Hammadi affirmed a positive trend in his country's relations with Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
