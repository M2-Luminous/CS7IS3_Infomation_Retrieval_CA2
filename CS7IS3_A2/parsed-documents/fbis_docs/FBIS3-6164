He said the ban was tantamount to trade protectionism and discrimination because Thailand abided by regulations concerning its exports. He said the EC ambassador expressed concern about what happened and asked Thailand not to lodge a complaint with GATT yet. The commerce minister also said he would raise the problem for discussion at tomorrow's cabinet session because the Thai private sector has already reported a loss of more than 100 million baht -- and it could reach a billion baht. [Begin Uthai recording] I will report the matter to the cabinet tomorrow; the private sector appealed for retaliation against France. But if we take action, it could lead to strained relations, and we do not want that. We might have to lodge a complaint with GATT if we do not get a good explanation or proper solution to the problem. Anyway, the EC ambassador told us not to take that step yet, but to let him do the work first. [end recording]
