The history of the Arab-Israeli conflict is nothing if not a tedious roster of acts of violence and terror by Zionist gangs. This has been the case since British colonialism implanted Israel on Palestine's soil. The atrocity is reminiscent of terrorist operations carried out by Jewish extremists against the Palestinian people since the beginning of the occupation of the Palestinian homeland and the establishment of the State of Israel. Repeated UN resolutions on the partition of Palestine between the Arabs and the Israelis and the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination have been systematically ignored by Israel. Israel continued its criminal acts against the Palestinian people, safe in the knowledge that the punishment it is subjected to after each operation never goes beyond the rhetoric of denunciation for these operations and a perfunctory note that it should refrain from such acts in the future. Israel gains from such acts. It seized miles of Palestinian land, with the inhabitants forced to flee under pressure by Zionist gangs. Zionist operations in Palestine began with the well-known Dayr Yasin massacre, only to be followed by atrocities in Nasr al-Din, Bayt al-Khuri, al-Zaytun, and Bayt Dras. Al-Aqsa mosque was not spared. Monasteries were not immune to attacks by Israeli gangs. Some of these gangs attacked the Greek Orthodox monastery in April 1990, occupied it, and converted it into barracks for Jewish settlers. The number of settlers has been constantly on the rise, particularly since Israel succeeded in obtaining $10 billion in loan guarantees from the Bush administration. The loan was used to help settle the new immigrants who flocked to Israel from the former Soviet Union following the collapse of communism, as well as from poverty-stricken East European countries. There is no doubt that the thousands who live in the settlements built by successive Israeli governments represent a source of continued tension in the occupied Arab territory. It is in these settlements that acts of aggression carried out by the armed Jewish settlers against the unarmed native population are planned. It is from these settlements that these acts are mounted. Therefore, we categorically conclude that the massacre at the Ibrahimi Mosque against the Palestinian people will not be the last criminal act carried out by the settlers. This is because the settlers knew beforehand that reaction to their aggression would not exceed a strongly or even mildly worded resolution or statement, words that will have no perceptible mark on the political or economic life of Israeli citizens or governments. As long as the international community fails to assume its required duty vis a vis this steady stream of aggression, such attacks will persist. We must say that the timing of this ugly crime cannot be lightly taken. Muslim worshipers were mowed down as they stood in piety before God. The fasting martyrs did not have stones in their hands for Israel to use as a pretext for carrying out its aggression. Most were elderly people who simply showed up for prayers at the prescribed time and place. Israel's masks have fallen. Its unconvincing pretexts, which it routinely cites following every aggression against innocent Palestinians, have been invalidated. This time, the attacked Palestinians were not engaged in resistance against the occupation or pelting Israeli armored vehicles with stones. Yes, all the masks have fallen. International public opinion can now see that it has been deluded into thinking that Israel was serious in seeking peaceful coexistence with the Arabs and earnest in wanting to make lasting peace with the Arabs, while all that time it was the Arabs who scrambled for peace and strove long and hard for its realization. Despite the ugliness of the crime committed by the Israeli settlers against innocent Palestinians, we cannot absolve ourselves of responsibility for the atrocity. The absence of honest and serious Arab coordination was the crack in the Arab wall, through which Israel and others advanced their most odious schemes and got away with plots to destroy the Arab (?identity) and even the very faith of Islam. Serious and collective action is indispensable to confront these schemes that are now laid bare, shorn of their last bit of modesty.
