"A little brightness has been visible in the Japanese economy. We are making efforts to make Japan's market open to the international community," Hata was quoted as saying. The Japanese prime minister said he wants to deepen exchanges with Italy in politics, the economy, science and culture, the officials said. During a 45-minute meeting, Berlusconi replied that his country also shares similar problems and when he assumes the post of prime minister, Italy's economy will be strengthened and it can make a fresh start, the officials said. Berlusconi, appointed prime minister-designate last week, said he is looking forward to working with Hata at the July summit of the Group of Seven (G-7) major economic powers in Naples. Earlier in the day, Hata met departing Prime Minister Azeglio Ciampi for two and a half hours. Hata and Ciampi agreed that strengthening cooperation on political problems between Russia and the G-7, revitalization of the world economy, and assistance to African countries and other developing nations will top the agenda at the Naples summit, the officials said. Ciampi said, "in the summit meeting, we would like to discuss strengthening cooperation on political issues between the G-7 and Russia. We also want to discuss relations between North and South, and assistance to developing nations." Hata reportedly replied that summit meetings of the G-7 will assume new importance in a new era and praised Italy's role. The Japanese prime minister said it is important to extend aid to developing countries, and Middle East and East Europe. Hata, who was elected prime minister last Monday, arrived in Rome on Monday night, kicking off a series of official visits to Italy, France, Germany and Belgium. Hata's trip is aimed at forging personal ties with leaders before the July summit of the G-7.
