FR940112-0-00086 FR940112-0-00021 Comment: Some commenters suggested that we revise the regulations by clarifying that the combined budget period would not automatically include the entire 3-month retroactive period if the individual has no medical expenses in that period. Response: The commenter is correct that an individual may be determined eligible for Medicaid in the 3-month period before the month of application only if an individual received covered services under the State plan at any time during that period and would have been Medicaid eligible at the time services were received if he or she had applied. This is based on section 1902(a)(34) of the Act and regulations at §435.914. This principle is very clearly specified in §435.914. However, we have revised §§435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to clarify that the retroactive budget period begins no earlier than the first month in the 3-month retroactive period in which the individual received covered services. Comment: Many commenters opposed the revision to permit States to combine the retroactive period with the prospective period because States are permitted to consider an individual's income over a longer period, potentially 6 months, rather than just the 3 months of the retroactive period. Under the existing rule, an individual who was, for example, hospitalized and out of work for a 3-month period could apply for Medicaid after he or she had returned to work and have eligibility determined solely on the 3-month period before application when no income was received. If the individual met other eligibility requirements, that individual could have been eligible. Under the proposal, and these final rules, States have the option to consider income over an additional 3-month period extending from the date of application. When a longer budget period is used, greater income is available to the individual and, when measured against the State's income standard, that same individual might not be eligible for Medicaid. Response: Individuals may apply for Medicaid to cover high medical expenses that are incurred during a very short period of time, as in the above example, in the 3-month period before an application, or they may wish to cover expenses incurred over a longer period. We believe that it is appropriate to consider available income over a longer period than just a period when acute illness may affect a person's employment or other income. Therefore, we believe the option for States to select the use of a combined budget period is appropriate. Comment: Several commenters asked why we are making these revisions when they know of no evidence that individuals abuse the current system by manipulating the timing of an application for Medicaid to suit their needs. Response: We agree that it is difficult to document the extent to which individuals may be abusing the existing system. The potential for abuse exists, however, and we believe States should have the flexibility to control it if it occurs. Comment: A number of commenters advocated giving individuals the option to choose the start of the budget period, rather than giving the State that option. The commenters were concerned that a State might begin the budget period in the retroactive period, counting income received in such period, when the individual may have had no covered expenses in the period. The commenters believe that the individual should have the option of restricting the budget period to the first month in the retroactive period in which covered services were received. Response: As discussed in response to an earlier comment, we have revised §§435.831(a) and 436.831(a) to clarify that the retroactive period begins no earlier than the first month in the period in which covered services were received. Therefore, there is no need for the individual to elect such a restriction. Comment: Some commenters believed that the current method of separating the retroactive period from the prospective period is easier to administer than the proposed method of combining the two periods. Response: Since this provision is optional, States may select whichever method is easier for them to administer. Comment: Some commenters suggested that we require the use of a monthly budget period instead of a flexible period from 1 to 6 months. Response: Existing regulations, §§435.831 and 436.831, permit States to select a prospective budget period extending from 1 to 6 months. Administrative flexibility for States was a major consideration in proposing revisions to the budget period. It is our view that requiring the use of a monthly budget period not only restricts State flexibility from that currently existing, but requires that a State spend more time evaluating eligibility. Of course, States that prefer the use of a 1-month period may continue to use it. Therefore, we have decided to retain the flexible budget period as proposed.
