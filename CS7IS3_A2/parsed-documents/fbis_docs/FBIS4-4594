Following is the full text of the statement: The United Nations Security Council called upon the DPRK to accept an unreasonable additional inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] in a "presidential statement" on March 31 imposing an unjustifiable demand upon the DPRK. Our "nuclear issue" is, by nature, not a topic for discussion at the UN Security Council. We have already undergone inspection of our nuclear facilities, which was enough for the continuity of safeguards, as agreed with the United States and the IAEA. There is no room for doubt in this regard. Conflicting views, if any, in the course of the inspection, should have been solved on all accounts between the IAEA which was the actual inspector for the inspection and the country which was the object of inspection. Nevertheless, the UN Security Council actually put on the agenda and discussed the inspection of the DPRK and adopted a "presidential statement". Why query clear is the essence of the matter. [sentence as received] Out of its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK, the United States needed a forum of political debate, that is, the UN Security Council, and had to secure an expedient of pressure in the form of "presidential statement". It is obviously contrary to the purpose and principle of the UN Charter that the UN Security Council whose mission it is to guarantee world peace and security discussed the issue of the DPRK on the basis of the unreasonable and prejudiced "conclusion" of the Board of Governors of the IAEA that the "scope of noncompliance with the safeguards agreement has expanded". It is the present-day reality that the United States and some Western forces which hate our socialist system as a thorn in their flesh can freely manipulate international organisations, if necessary, in order to do harm to small countries like ours. No one can deny this. If the UN Security Council is truly to discharge its mission, it should take issue with the United States which is gravely threatening peace and security of the Korean peninsula with a huge amount of nuclear weapons, laying obstacles to the solution of the nuclear issue, and the South Korean authorities, its henchmen. It must not go unnoticed that the UN Security Council unreasonably took issue with the DPRK over its peaceful nuclear activities, while turning a blind eye to the countries which are engaged in a dangerous nuclear gambling under the patronage of the United States. This shows that the UN Security Council is playing into the hands of the United States in the latter's hostile policy of stifling the DPRK, applying double standards. This time the UN Security Council took sides with the United States in its hostile policy against the DPRK by including the question of compliance with the safeguards agreement in the "presidential statement", disregarding the essence of our "nuclear issue" on purpose. The safeguards agreement virtually ceased to be effective from the moment when the DPRK temporarilly suspended the effectuation of its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) for the sake of its talks with the United States. Out of the desire to prove the transparency of our nuclear activities, we have so far accepted only inspection for the continuity of safeguards as a well-intentioned, voluntary step. This was an inspection conforming to our special status. As they could not deny this fact, the United States and the IAEA agreed to the DPRK-proposed inspection limited to one for the continuity of safeguards, not routine and ad hoc inspections of us pursuant to the safeguards agreement. The call for compliance with the safeguards agreement and additional inspection, therefore, does not make sense at all for the DPRK which is now in a publicly recognized special status. We do mean what we say. We have consistently maintained a steadfast policy of independence and a correct line in external relations and never changed our once clarified position. The UNSC should first take a measure to set right the unreasonable act of the IAEA Secretariat in expanding the scope of partiality against the DPRK, flattering big countries, before demanding an additional inspection of it. The IAEA Secretariat must make a due apology for its acts in further widening the scope of partiality, openly joining the United States in its intrigues against the DPRK. We will surely call the IAEA Secretariat to account for expanding partiality against us stage by stage, instead of making an apology. Now, the United States is becoming all the more undisguised in stepping up the campaign for international pressure on our Republic by setting in-motion the Board of Governors of the IAEA and the UNSC. It is carrying into extremes its military pressure, threatening to resume "Team Spirit" joint military exercises and "make no scruple of a second Korean war". Facts patently prove that the United States has no intention to solve the nuclear issue at all but chiefly seeks the aim of executing its hostile policy of stifling the DPRK by deliberately straining the situation on the Korean peninsula. The South Korean authorities, following it, are trying to resume nuclear war exercises in league with the nuclear state against us at any cost, while continually shipping in nuclear weapons and putting spurs to their own nuclear development. This virtually shows that the South Korean authorities have no regard for the "joint declaration on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" but are taking the criminal road of nullifying it. Since the United States resorts entirely to pressure, reversing all its commitments with us, we have no alternative but to put on the normal track our peaceful nuclear activities which have been unilaterally frozen for the DPRK-USA talks. The United States and the South Korean authorities are intending to escalate the campaign for pressure on us with the UNSC "presidential statement" as the starting-point, but it can never work with us. The more desperately the United States and its followers try to stifle the socialist system of our own style, the more immensely the might of the singlehearted unity of our party, people and People's Army will increase. It is our unshakable will and policy to answer strength with strength, and dialogue with dialogue. The United States' hostile policy of stifling the DPRK is fated to be frustrated. Consistent is our stand to seek a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue.
