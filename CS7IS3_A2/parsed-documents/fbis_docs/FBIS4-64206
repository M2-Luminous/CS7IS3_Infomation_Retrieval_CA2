Following recession and stabilization, important economic spheres in the western part of the country have begun to recover. Growth has consolidated in the new laender. The boom there now seems to be the result of increasingly independent economic stimuli. Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt is even convinced that the government's economic forecast and the 1.5 percent real economic growth for the whole country predicted by the research institutes can be exceeded. Economic trends are going to be the focus of the Hanover Fair, the world's largest exhibition of investment goods. The mood among the over 6,800 exhibitors from 60 countries and among the visitors is optimistic; better foreign sales of German goods are expected than in 1993. "Production and turnover are clearly improving," the chemical industry, one of the largest industrial branches represented in Hanover, claims. Therefore it comes as no surprise that Chancellor Helmut Kohl ("a turn for the better") and German Chamber of Trade and Industry president Hans-Peter Stihl ("the order books are getting full") are very happy about the fair. Already before the fair, the statisticians noticed that demand and production in the processing industry had expanded in February, a growth of about 3 percent against the January level. Orders show that domestic business has also picked up at last, with an increase of 2.5 percent. Out of the large industrial sectors, the investment goods industry has reaped above-average benefits from the increase in orders. On the other hand, orders in the automobile industry have grown disproportionately against January, an increase of 9 percent. This development has obviously already had a bearing on production. Here too, production in the investment goods industry has experienced an above-average increase, beating the relevant 1993 result in terms of demand and output. This confirms what the FAZ [FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG] development indicator, which reports on the placement of orders, the business climate, and job vacancies, predicted over 12 months ago. "The chances of an economic revival this year have improved even further," the analysis reads. Even the latest Institute for Economic Research [IFO] economic development indicator shows a continuation of the positive developments in industry, consisting chiefly of brisk business with exports. All main production sectors and most subsidiary branches expect higher output than they did in last summer's survey. In August 1993 they expected a decrease in output in 1994, but in fact the size of 1994 orders has displayed respectable growth. A further consolidation of economic growth is expected in 1995. According to all these surveys, it is the investment goods industry that is the main source of the economic growth; the main sectors of this industry responsible for this growth are machinery, road vehicles, and electrical goods. A major reason for the improved trend and the optimistic forecasts for the coming months is the clear improvement in export conditions: Following "slow" growth among Germany's major trade partners, the demand of these partners for German commodities has again increased, and has done so ever since the beginning of last year. The growth stimuli were backed up by a repeated improvement in competitiveness, and a reduction in costs. The devaluation of the mark against the dollar and yen have boosted foreign demand by an additional amount. Following the sharp decline in exports, especially in the first half of 1993, exports picked up again in the second half of the year albeit by a very small amount. In February 1994, exports rose by a good 6 percent against January. Total exports in January and February were 3 percent higher than in the same months of 1993. The export surplus in these months, amounting to almost 12 billion marks, was almost double the figure for January and February 1993. In the meantime, the mood among consumers also seems to be improving slowly. The Nuremberg-based Society for Consumer, Market, and Sales Research expects an improvement in the general economic situation beginning in the middle of 1994, together with better prospects for the labor market, an increase in incomes, and higher turnover in the retail trade, coupled with a decrease in inflation. The Cologne-based Institute of German Industry says that in order to support private consumption, consumers should have reduced the savings indicator since the end of 1991 from 13.1 to 11.1 percent. In western Germany alone, every percent less inflation is increasing the maneuvering space of real incomes by around 18 billion marks. In eastern Germany, in the meantime, economic stimuli have been increasingly shifting from the construction industry and services sector to industry. Following earlier sharp declines, internal orders in the processing industry went up by almost one fifth in 1993. Industrial output has at last undergone a strong increase by 7.5 percent against the 1992 figure. Thus, the fall in employment in industry has been halted. The Bundesbank claims that the reduction in employment in the whole of German industry could now reach an end.
