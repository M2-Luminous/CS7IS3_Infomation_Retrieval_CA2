Stange had officially delegated to the Carabineros deputy director general, General Fernando Cordero, all the power and duties that the Carabineros Organizational Law permits him. Following his arrival in Iquique this evening, Gen. Stange said that the issue of the command was not under discussion. He said: [Begin recording] [Stange] I have not handed over command. It is one thing to delegate some normal duties, but quite another to delegate command. The command of the Carabineros is vested in the director general. [Unidentified reporter] General Stange, how are your relations with the president of the Republic at present? [Stange] Well, normal. Here there is no...[changes thought] There is no reason why they should have changed. [Reporter] What is your assessment of the problematic situation you have had to face? [Stange] In what sense problematic? [Reporter] In the sense that you had to be on leave for a considerable period of time. [Stange] Well, yes, I was on vacation. [Reporter] [words indistinct] how do you evaluate the case of the murder of the three Communist leaders? [Stange] That is another subject about which I am not going to comment; you are asking me questions I cannot answer, as this involves a lawsuit which is at another stage. [end recording] Gen. Stange will stay in the northern region for approximately two weeks inspecting various Carabineros units. The trip is being made within the framework of a study he is doing to draft a plan to streamline the institution, a task entrusted to him by the defense minister.
