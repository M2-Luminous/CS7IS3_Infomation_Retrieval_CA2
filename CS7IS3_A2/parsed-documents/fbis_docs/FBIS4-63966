Ukraine's Defense Ministry press service has announced that Vitaliy Radetskyy spoke at a conference of North Atlantic Council member countries' defense ministers today. The Ukrainian defense minister emphasized, in particular, that "overcoming artificial isolation from Europe and returning Ukraine to the range of leading European states" was one of the most important tasks in Ukraine's military political course. Vitaliy Radetskyy also said that Ukraine was in favor of creating a versatile all-European system of security on the basis of existing international institutions. Ukraine's immediate membership in these structures will provide the necessary external guarantees of its national security. The Ukrainian defense minister pointed out that Ukraine did not see any reasons why CIS countries could not join the "Partnership for Peace" program. "It would also be desirable if Russia were among the partnership members. The footing, however, should undoubtedly be equal for all," said the Ukrainian defense minister. The press service of Ukraine's Defense Ministry reported that Vitaliy Radetskyy met U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry and David Collenette, Canadian national defense minister, and discussed issues of military cooperation and developments in Crimea with them. The Defense Ministry's press service added that both William Perry and David Collenette expressed concern at the escalation of tension in Crimea, highly commended Ukraine's balanced and constructive position on normalizing the situation, and confirmed respect for the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Also today, the Ukrainian defense minister met George Joulwan, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
