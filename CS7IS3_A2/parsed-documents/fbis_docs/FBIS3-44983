The blast was sparked by a short circuit in the wiring system, igniting gas that had been allowed to build up in the shaft by the failure of the mine's ventilation system, the newspaper said. All 70 miners working in the shaft at the time of the explosion were killed, it added. The explosion at the Baohe mine followed a similar blast there in January 1991 that killed 53 workers. Industrial accidents claimed 11,600 lives in China last year, more than double the 1992 figure.
