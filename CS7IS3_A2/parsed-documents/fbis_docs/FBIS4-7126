In a document distributed on April 15 it charged that the Kim Yong-sam "government" deepened the national division by refusing even to accept the proposal of the North, without so much as showing an attitude to sincerely examine it. Noting that the crisis of the nation cannot be defused, nor can the way of an independent and peaceful reunification of the country be opened by such mode of dependence on outside forces as "South Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation", the document stressed the only way is to activate diverse dialogues of all levels including dialogue between the government authorities and thus boost the sentiments of great national unity and find an independent solution. It repeatedly urged the South Korean authorities to accept the proposal of the North for a national conference.
