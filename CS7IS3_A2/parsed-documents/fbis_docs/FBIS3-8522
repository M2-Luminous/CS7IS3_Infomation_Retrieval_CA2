[Jarcevic] Croatia is not attacking the Serbian positions in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK], but has carried out aggression on the territory of the Korenica commune. Supported with artillery and tanks, Croatian soldiers have stormed that territory. Moreover, in northwestern Dalmatia, they are attacking the communes of Obrovac and Benkovac. In the eastern part of the republic of Serbian Krajina, around Vinkovci, they are also attacking us with artillery and infantry weapons. This is only a prelude, and I am expecting all-out war between the Republic of Croatia and the republic of Serbian Krajina. [Announcer] On what do you base your views? [Jarcevic] General Tudjman was given support in all the international bodies, in the United Nations, the CSCE, and the European Union. Washington is now firmly supporting him in his calls for the reintegration of the republic of Serbian Krajina into the Republic of Croatia. He knows that he cannot accomplish this with the agreement of the Serbian people who live in the republic of Serbian Krajina or those Serbs whom he has expelled from the Republic of Croatia. He is only left with war and it is certain that in the secret connections with Western countries he has been given the green light for that. [Announcer] Thank you.
