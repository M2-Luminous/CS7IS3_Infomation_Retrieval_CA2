Briefing the Royal Lesotho Defense Force members based at (Ha Rakamose) today, Mr. Qhobela said there is no such task force and there will never be. He indicated that it is only the Commonwealth special envoys who are here to help the government in quelling the situation. Mr. Qhobela said the government was not hiding a thing and believes in transparency to avoid conflicts, like the one in Lesotho that has resulted in factions within the Army. He reiterated that the Army belongs to the nation and no individual church or political leader can own it. Mr. Qhobela briefed the soldiers about meetings held by the envoys with members of the diplomatic corps, the churches and political leaders which he said were very fruitful. The Commonwealth envoys, after their meeting with soldiers at (Ha Rakamose), will then hold a similar meeting with soldiers based at Makoanyane after lunch.
