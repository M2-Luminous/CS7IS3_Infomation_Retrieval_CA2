FBIS3-27949 "dreas022__a94007" FBIS-EAS-94-022-A Document Type:Daily Report 2 February 1994 ANNEX Japan Gazette Planned To Aid Open Bidding System OW0202065894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 1 Feb 94 Morning Edition p 5 -- FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0202065894 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:BFN [Text] The government will start publishing the GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT GAZETTE (tentative name) so as to implement thoroughly the open competitive bidding system in the government procurement system. The government intends to include this plan in the action program which will be worked out, it is hoped by early February, to improve the government procurement system. The government plans to issue this report also in English. In this way, the government hopes to meet the demand for market opening by making it easier for foreign companies to participate in government procurement bidding. In this action program aimed at improving the government procurement system, the government, first of all, intends to thoroughly carry out the open competitive bidding system as stipulated in the Public Accounts Act. However, it is expected that because the amount of information to be made public before the bidding will probably increase drastically, it will be impossible for the existing official gazettes to handle such a huge amount of information. Therefore, the GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT GAZETTE will carry only the information on government procurement for those who want to participate in the bidding. It is planned that the gazette will carry not only public announcements on the bidding but also other information, such as plans to introduce the open competitive bidding system by concerned organs, and lists of liaison offices. In addition to the official gazettes, a gazette known as the COMMERCIAL BUSINESS DAILY (CBD), which deals only with information on government procurement, has been widely circulated in the United States.
