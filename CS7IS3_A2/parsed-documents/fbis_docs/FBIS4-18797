Thousands of people who gathered in Zafer Square in Kizilay, Ankara, chanted slogans condemning the Serbian massacres and the attitude of the United Nations. The citizens then started marching along Ataturk Boulevard to the UN representation in Ankara. They continued their protests there as well. Certain provocateurs in the crowd hurled stones, shattering some of the windows of the UN building. Despite these provocations, the people proceeded to Kocatepe Mosque following the appeasing remarks of Ankara Governor Erdogan Sahinoglu and Ankara Security Director Orhan Tasanlar, who arrived at the scene of the incident. During the march, stones were thrown shattering the windows of the TRT General Directorate building, the U.S. Embassy, and the Russian Commercial Attache's Office. Some individuals climbed over the iron fence of the U.S. Embassy and entered the garden. They posted a flag at the main entrance of the U.S. Embassy and then left the garden. In a statement to TRT, Sahinoglu said that efforts are under way to determine who is responsible for directing the course of events. Asking the citizens not to heed such provocations, Sahinoglu noted: I believe that with regard to international relations, which are sensitive, it is appropriate for us to display attitudes that are more careful, self-sacrificing, and befitting our traditions. I particularly ask our people not to heed provocations and such rumors. The recent attack against Gorazde was also condemned in a demonstration held in Istanbul's Taksim Square. Groups, which gathered in Taksim Square at noon, shouted various slogans against the Serbs. The police did not intervene in the demonstration, which was held without a permit. Certain people attempted to behave in an excessive manner, however, attacking members of the press, who were filming the meeting, including TRT teams. The groups, which remained in Taksim Square for about three hours, later marched along Istiklal and Cumhuriyet Streets. Intensive security measures were adopted during these marches. A group proceeding towards Harbiye chanted slogans against TRT in front of the TRT Istanbul Radio building. The demonstrators shouted slogans against the UN, Israel, and the United States.
