New apartments were built on parts of the factory site in the eighties. Today, the citizens there are wondering whether they may have built on poisoned land. Although the competent authorities knew what the site was formerly used for, they did not remove potential risks due to pollutant residues before allowing the land to be built on. Not until the beginning of the nineties did they start a systematic investigation. The "Zuendhuetle" is only one of many examples of how slowly the awareness of the dangers of military legacies develops. "In the old German laender, people started to make a record of weapons waste at the beginning of the eighties; in the new laender they did not start until the reunification," stated Manfred Kurka from the Federal Environment Office in Berlin recently at a symposium on "Military wastes" in Offenbach. By the summer of last year, the authority had identified more than 4,000 "suspect sites" of weapons wastes and informed the German laender accordingly. There are still no uniform criteria throughout the laender for assessing pollution with weapon-specific hazardous substances. Not even the term "weapons waste" has been defined consistently throughout the laender. The development of techniques for cleaning up these legacies in an environmentally acceptable manner is likewise in its infancy. Explosives are a particular problem. Trinitro- and dinitrotoluene (TNT, DNT) are frequently used. DNT is extremely harmful to the blood, and can cause cancer in the long term, as can the degradation products of TNT. Whenever these substances occurred in their pure form, as in munitions residues on former training grounds, they were often burnt in the open air, resulting in contaminated soil and ground water. According to Kruka, the only environmentally acceptable way of incinerating the material is currently being tested by Buck in Pinnow near Berlin. The situation is even more complicated when the substances have contaminated the soil, as in Hallschlag near Daun in the Eifel, where explosives were once manufactured. Right up to 1987, cows were still grazing on the former works site. It is now known that about 80,000 cubic meters of soil are contaminated. In many places beneath the grass, the nitrotoluenes reach such high concentrations that there could be explosions if drilling were carried out for testing or remediation purposes. Pure explosive is to be found there in some places. Microbes could be extraordinarily helpful in dealing with the explosive inheritance. Certain types of bacteria of the pseudomonas strain, and also azotobacteriaceen, both natural soil dwellers, can thrive on TNT and DNT as a source of carbon and nitrogen. They degrade the explosive and convert it to composites from which they obtain energy or synthesize vital molecules. Toxic degradation products (metabolites) may, however, also be produced. Attack by Bacteria Andre Dahn, an engineer at Berlin-Consult GmbH, and Peter Koehler from the analytical center of Forgenta in Berlin, presented a process at the congress with which even highly contaminated soils can probably be decontaminated by chemical and biological means in the future. Initially, they render the toluene water-soluble by treating the material with chemicals, namely a strong base, and heating it. As a result, the dangerous substances are altered to such an extent that bacterial degradation is possible, from which no toxic substances are expected. The cooled solution is ready for attack by bacteria. Mixed bacteria populations are used -- including the explosives consumers -- which survive partly with and partly without oxygen (aerobic and anaerobic). It is useful to use such mixed populations because they often form stable communities and require only few additional nutrients. After the anaerobic reaction phase which precedes the aerobic phase, the researchers noticed during the experiment that just under 70 percent of the pollutants had already been decomposed. As yet, however, there are no test results for the biological process as a whole. The Federal Environment Office considers the process to be promising. It is currently being optimized with a view to being used in Hallschlag. A research group from Braunschweig Technical College is also considering micro-organisms for environmentally acceptable toxic waste remediation. At the Institute for Microbiology, Martin Wittmaier is working with colleagues on the question of how organic, aromatic hydrocarbons -- benzene, xylene, or toluene -- but also highly chlorinated composites and mineral oils can be disposed of biologically in situ. Substances like these can occur and pollute soils and ground water wherever vehicles and machines are maintained and repaired, for example, on troop exercise sites. The Braunschweig-based scientists want to exploit the natural self-cleaning potential of the soil. To this end, efforts are being made to promote the growth of those microorganisms that are capable of decomposing pollutants in the earth but for which the earth does not provide the ideal conditions for propagation. Their metabolism is specifically activated, for example, by introducing certain nutrients or gases by means of pipes (wells) inserted vertically in the soil. The microbes then multiply and destroy the substances to be removed. In this way, high rates of decontamination have been achieved in experiments. A plant installed on the site with which the area of a solvent recycling company was cleaned up achieved pollutant degradation levels of more than 99 percent. Such remediation measures do, however, take time. Depending on the degree of contamination, the process may take months or years. The ecological damage by toxic military waste will be a matter of increasing concern for the government and laender in the years to come. The troops of the former Soviet Union are leaving behind "massive environmental damage" on their 1,026 sites, according to initial research by Christina Sussbauer from the Free University of Berlin. She criticizes mainly the agreement to offset the value of the buildings and land against the environmental damage. As there is no financial inducement to hand over land "in a clean state," harmful substances and munitions were just left. Disorderly scrap heaps were created and drums with oil and other pollutants were simply thrown away -- adding daily to the new toxic waste.
