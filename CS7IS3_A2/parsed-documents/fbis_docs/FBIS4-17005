The sting in the tail is in Sukhoi's latest ground attack fighter, the Su-34, a development of the Su-27. A fighter version of the plane, the SU- 35, which is now being developed, is set to become one of the world's most capable fighters and is the aircraft the RAF's [Royal Air Force] new Eurofighter was designed to beat. Neither Eurofighter nor America's still-developing fighter, the F- 22, has a rear firing capability. Mr John Taylor, editor of Jane's All the World's Aircraft, said last night: "It would probably make life more difficult for Eurofighter. It makes it more difficult to attack." The missile was stated by the magazine to be a standard R- 73 air-to-air infra-red missile, a development of the AA-11 " Archer" . According to the Russian missile design bureau Vympel, a rear-facing tracking or acquisition radar sensor on a long aft "tail" picks up an approaching aircraft and warns the two-man crew to prepare to fire. The missile is on a wing rail and can be rotated backwards. Mr Taylor said it is then released and its rocket motor fires away from the aircraft. The radar guides it automatically to the target up to eight I miles away. Vympel claims the missile can be fired in supersonic flight. Mr Taylor said rear-facing radars have been in place on Russian. bombers for some time and the idea of firing a missile backwards has been researched by western air forces. The main reason British and American air force officials are not worried for their new aircraft is that both are designed to fire the medium-range Amraam missile, which can detect the Su-34 long before entering its radar vision. "A rear-facing missile might give problems if you want to get close but Amraam lets us fire from 20, miles away or more, long before the other guy knows we're even there," said a US air force spokesman at the Pentagon.
