They added that this bonus will not cover many expenditures, and "we won't even by able to buy presents for Epiphany Day because we won't have any money." They primarily blamed Defense Minister Hugo Estigarribia for this situation because he has never strongly defended the position of the younger officers, and added that they will request his replacement "because he is no good for that job." They added that the Armed Forces, as a whole, needs a minister who will speak up and equally defend them all and not somebody like Estigarribia, who only upholds the post of military forces commander held by Vice Admiral Eduardo Gonzalez Petit and tries to justify General Lino Oviedo's participation in politics by saying that soldiers cannot be deprived of partisan ideals. They also recalled that as soon as it was published that Armed Forces members were annoyed about the elimination of food rations, National Police officers reacted immediately and warned the executive branch about the serious situation that might occur within the force if their food rations were eliminated. The consulted officers, in the form of a protest, answered: "While the police complain, soldiers are afraid and are incapable of even defending their interests. No high-ranking officer has stood up for his NCO's or sergeants, who will be affected most, because they have money." They also explained that they have to pay for their uniforms and transportation out of their meager salaries. They reiterated that their superiors do not pay heed to their demands and added that nobody dares speak up out of fear of possible reprisals. They wondered why the police are allowed to voice their opinion while soldiers have precise orders not to speak publicly on subjects related to their profession. The affected soldiers said: "Neither Oviedo nor Gonzalez Petit gave us any explanations; they only addressed Christmas and New Year's messages as if that were enough."
