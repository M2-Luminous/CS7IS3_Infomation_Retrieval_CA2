At this stage he is in northern Mozambique. While in Zambezia Province, Jose de Castro told Radio Mozambique that his tour involved choosing Renamo representatives to the National Elections Commission, among other things. Approximately one week after Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama visited the city of Quelimane, the capital of Zambezia Province -- saying the people had shown their (?gratitude) and given a vote of confidence in his party -- is once again the stage for yet another working visit by high ranking officials in the [words indistinct] of the Mozambican Government. Renamo Foreign Affairs Chief Jose de Castro has been in Quelimane on what he described as a working visit and [words indistinct] General Peace Accord, concerning verification of the formation of Zambezia Province Elections Commission. Asked by our reporters whether the people who had taken him to Quelimane were linked to the formation of the aforesaid commission, that Renamo official said that another reason for his visit to Quelimane concerned the fact that the Renamo delegate has not been given an official residence. Castro also noted that work (?has been slow) to rehabilitate the building which will serve as the party's headquarters in Zambezia Province [words indistinct] that Renamo official also expressed concern about the fact that his movement's troops are being confined only in one of the assembly points in the province. He said that Renamo's troops have been assembling rather slowly because they do not have transportation and he added that the government has been making much out of it to dramatize the situation. Just as Afonso Dhlakama pointed out in several speeches in the province, the Renamo foreign affairs chief reaffirmed there will never be war in the country again. Another noteworthy point which came up in the interview he granted our reporters was the fact that Indian and Portuguese citizens are being detained in Renamo's (Mongola), in Zambezia Province's Milange District. Castro said he knew nothing about it and he added that matter is the responsibility of Renamo's internal administration. He noted, however, that such matters are often handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross, ICRC, which takes the detainees to Malawi; from there they are returned to their countries. After criticizing the fact that the provincial government had not made it possible for him to meet the provincial governor and that it had hampered the normal rehabilitation of Renamo's future provincial headquarters, Jose de Castro accused the Mozambique Liberation Front, Frelimo, government of deliberately seeking to jeopardize peace when it made an attempt on Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama's life in Nampula.
