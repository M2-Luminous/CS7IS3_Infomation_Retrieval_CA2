FBIS4-10698 "drlat074_b_94004" FBIS-LAT-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti Jean-Louis: Monde Responsible for Crisis Jean-Louis: Monde Responsible for Crisis FL1504175094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 15 Apr 94 FL1504175094 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The president of the lower chamber is allegedly one of those responsible for the crisis which has been raging in the country for over two years; he should at least have the heart to admit it instead of trying to hang the responsibilty on others, according to Deputy Fignole Jean-Louis, the president of the National Front for Change and Democracy. The deputy says that the appointment of a new prime minister will change nothing in the current situation. [Begin Jean-Louis recording] We think that Monde... [pauses] We think that Deputy Monde contradicted himself. He should have said instead... [pauses] He should be courageous enough to say if the country has reached such a situation, he is one of those who are responsible for the misfortune of the Haitian people, for the (?heartbreaks) and the chronic miseries the Haitian people are experiencing now because on 7 October [1991].... [pauses] We know what happened here. As for us, we could not enter the Senate, only Radio Nationale and Television Nationale d'Haiti had the right to enter on that day. What happened? After a vote favoring Article 148, which was ready to be sent to President Aristide in Venezuela so he could choose a prime minister, which all diplomats pretended to approve, Monde was the first one who set up a scenario and came up with a piece of paper in his pocket under the pretext that he had been arrested outside the parliament. They began establishing the de facto governments on the basis of a piece of paper upon which no parliamentarian cast a vote. The current situation of the country is a consequence of the successive de facto governments. So, he should be courageous enough to say that we in the FNCD are not responsible for this situation because since the beginning of the crisis we said no, we do not agree with this matter of a coup d'etat because the government was elected, and it was up to the people to take a measure if they were not satisfied with the government.
