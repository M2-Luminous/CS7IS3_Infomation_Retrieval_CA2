Addressing a news conference in London he said that the government would provide a better quality of life for everyone, but only by spending what it could afford. This might mean that the government would not reach the ANC's declared goal of one million new homes in five years. He said South Africa was not looking for handouts but for free trade and investment. Mr. De Klerk is in London to deliver the SUNDAY TIMES Nobel Laureate peace lecture.
