In the opinion of the Polish Government, the stand of the NATO states, as presented in the decisions taken during the North Atlantic Council session of 9 February this year, is a balanced one toward all sides in the conflict. It takes into account, in the right way, the role of the United Nations and meets its resolutions half-way. It takes into consideration the necessity of insuring the complete security of the UN forces and that of other observation and humanitarian missions that find themselves on the territory of the former Yugoslavia. This last matter is of particular importance for Poland in view of the presence of a Polish contingent in the UN Protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Polish Government shares the stand of the NATO states, and expresses the hope that the present heightening of the conflict can be defused without the need to use force."
