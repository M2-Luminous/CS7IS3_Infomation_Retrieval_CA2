"Although I can invoke my authority to call a general election even under the current multiseat constituency system still in place, it is desirable for the election to be contested under the new system," Hata said. Hata made the remark in a question-and-answer session in the House of Representatives Budget Committee. Although the Diet legislated in January a package of electoral reform bills replacing the current multiseat system for the 511-member lower chamber with a mix of single-seat electorates and proportional representation, it requires the passage of the demarcation bill to allow the next election to be lawfully contested under the single-seat system. At present, a government-appointed panel of experts are speeding up the task of splitting the nation's multiseat constituencies into 300 single-seat electorates. Hata said, "I am aware that some citizens are demanding an early holding of the election to seek a public verdict on politicians in view of the fact that my new administration has been reduced to a minority government." However, Hata said the legislation of the redistricting bill must precede the general election, saying, "it is crucial to firmly establish the (single-seat) system." "The public feels that politics is in a hopeless situation and their feelings have caused low voter turnout ratios in various elections," he said. On North Korea's alleged nuclear development program, Hata said Japan is trying to make contacts with Pyongyang through the Japanese Embassy in China to convey the international community's stance on the issue. He said that if North Korea really opens itself to the world, the United States, South Korea, China and Japan can help it "develop its people's livelihood." Japan is ready to talk with North Korea "if talks are necessary," Hata said. On the idea of "universal security" incorporated in policy accords among the ruling coalition parties, Hata said the idea is "very similar" to the collective security spelled out in the U.N. Charter. Last Thursday, Hata told a House of Representatives plenary session that the Constitution prohibits Japan's involvement in collective defense, in answer to concerns that his government may move toward active military actions overseas. Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa addressed the committee and appeared to retract his earlier statements referring to reconsidering the interpretation of the war-renouncing Constitution by postwar governments that it bars participation in collective defense. Kakizawa said he expected "wide-range discussion on what national security should be" and he would apologize and withdraw the remarks if the statements caused misunderstanding. On another remark of his calling for early steps toward legislation for dealing with international crises, Kakizawa said he was referring to a possible emergency situation related to North Korea's suspected nuclear development project. Kakizawa said he was not referring to "emergency legislation" that was once discussed to deal with a possible invasion of Japan.
