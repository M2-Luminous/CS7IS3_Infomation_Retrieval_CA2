They said the bank, whose headquarters are in Cairo, received the licenses from the Bank of Israel last week after the Central Bank of Jordan (CBJ) issued preliminary licences. The bank is seeking to reopen up to five branches in the West Bank and Gaza Strip but it received Israeli approvals for only one branch in the West Bank town of Bethlehem and the other in the Gaza Strip, they said. The Arab Land Bank became the second known Jordanian Bank to get Israeli licenses in line with a memorandum of understanding signed by Jordan and Israel in December. The Bank of Jordan got an Israeli license last week to reopen a branch in Ramallah in the West Bank. Other Jordanian banks which have received preliminary licenses from the CBJ include the Arab Bank, Jordan's largest commercial bank, the Jordan-Gulf Bank and the Jordan National Bank. The CBJ is known to have issued preliminary licenses for a total of eight branches of the five banks. [passage omitted]
