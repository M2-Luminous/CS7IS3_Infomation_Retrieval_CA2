Exactly two years ago, this area on the banks of the Dniester river was engulfed in a bloodbath, which left hundreds dead and thousands refugees. The madness was halted on 21 July 1992 when an agreement was signed in Moscow between Moldavia [Moldova] and Russia and a contingent of combined Russian, Moldavian, and Dniester peacekeeping troops was sent into the conflict zone. Thanks to their efforts, a fragile peace has been maintained in the area and talks have begun on finding a peaceful settlement for the crisis. Russia and the CSCE are mediating at these. This was announced at a rally today in Bendery attended by thousands in memory of those killed. At the rally, a speech by 14th Army Commander General Aleksandr Lebed was greeted by whistles when he criticized the leadership of the Dniester region, accusing it of corruption and reluctance to solve the conflict by peaceful means. Among other things, the general said in his speech that the Tiraspol leaders repaid Russia with base ingratitude when it sent its fighters to Moscow during last year's October events.
