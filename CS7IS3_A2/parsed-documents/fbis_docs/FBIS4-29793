Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Dr. Abdullah Fadzil Che Wan said today Wisma Putra [Ministry of Foreign Affairs] received a letter from Needham last week. Dr. Abdullah said the letter was discussed at yesterday's cabinet meeting and Needham's reasons were noted. "It was decided that no further action is necessary on the matter as the reasons given were deemed sufficient," he added. Dr. Abdullah said Needham had made it clear that his statement to REUTER News Agency was not meant as a threat to Malaysia. Asked if Needham had explained in what context he gave the statement, Abdullah said he did not elaborate this in his letter. "The reasons given are sufficient... there is no possibility of retaliation (by Britain) and we will accept that (the reasons)," he told reporters after receiving a RM [Malaysian ringgit] 10,000 cheque for the Barisan Bertindak Bosnia [Bosnian Action Front] Fund from Rotary Club District 330 at his ministry. Asked if Wisma Putra had sought the clarification from Needham, Dr. Abdullah said no. He said Needham sent the letter on his own accord after reading in the newspapers about Malaysia's dissatisfaction over his statement. [passage omitted]
