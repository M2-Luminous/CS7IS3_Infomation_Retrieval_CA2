[passage omitted] Delegation member Talab al-Sani' made a speech in which he said: At the outset of my speech I would like to say that this delegation represents all of Palestine, from the Galilee, the triangle, and the Arab Negev. This delegation includes people from Yafo, 'Akko, and Haifa. This shows they are a vital part of the Arab nation. Every day they experience attempts to uproot them from their land. But, they are standing fast on their Arab land. We always say we are part of the Arab nation. We are proud of our Arab identity. We are ready to pay the price. A week ago, after the holy Ibrahimi Mosque massacre, there was a massive uprising inside 1948 Palestine. A youth from the Negev city of Rahat was also martyred. Tens of people were wounded. This shows these people are a vital part of the Arab nation, despite political boundaries and the political siege imposed on us. We have not forgotten our affiliation. Neither have we knelt down or bowed our heads. Your Excellency, I would like to say that in addition to what my brother 'Abd-al-Wahhab Darawshah said, that Syria's position, your wise position at the Geneva summit, has put the Israeli Government in a corner, in a defensive position, because they have always used Israel's security as a pretext, as if security is only for one side and that the other parties and states have no security. We believe the occupier is Israel, that the aggressor is Israel, and that the side carrying out repressive and oppressive measures in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is Israel. Israel will not be able to use its powerful media to propagate its claims that the Arab world and the Arab states threaten Israel's security. Your wise position advocating full withdrawal for complete peace has put Israel and the Israeli Government into a corner. The Israeli Government is trying to find a way out of this impasse with weak justifications. The world knows, the Israeli Government knows, and the Israeli people know these justifications are very weak. They say the news media did not enter into and did not participate in the summit. We believe peace cannot be lasting if it is not a just peace. If peace is not just and is imposed in accordance with transient circumstances and facts, then there will be no peace, because circumstances and facts can change. For peace to be lasting, it must be just. Just peace guarantees all Arab people's rights. These rights are indivisible. We have an example of a separate peace in Egypt. This separate peace could not prevent wars on the Lebanese front and in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip where our heroic Arab people have their intifadah. In order to have a comprehensive peace, there must be coordination. We believe in the unity of the cause, the unity of the struggle, and the unity of the solution. Our fate is one. We hope there will be an end to political boundaries. But, this is a hope for the future that will be governed by future circumstances and developments. Now, at the current stage, there is a need for coordination, because Israeli efforts are aimed at imposing peace, or at suggesting there is peace without actually implementing peace on the ground. Israel tries to penetrate the Arab world economically and to propagate the idea of a Middle Eastern market, while continuing to occupy the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and southern Lebanon. We believe the occupation of southern Lebanon is the continuation of fighting there. Territory has never been and will never be a means of defense, but the cause of continued fighting. We have always said we are proud of your wise and honorable stands and your political wisdom, which is recognized by enemies before friends. We have faith in Syria's leadership role. We hope God will grant you success as a leader of the Arab nation and a leader of Syria. God willing, peace based on the establishment of a Palestinian state, with holy Jerusalem as its capital, will be achieved. God willing, the Syrian flag will fly over the Golan and peace will prevail in the region. Poet Mustafa al-Jammal, chairman of the 'Ara and 'Ar'ara council in the Triangle recited a poem titled Damascus, in which he reviewed the glorious past of Damascus and Syria's role in Arab struggle throughout history. He offered condolences to the president on the homeland's loss of Staff Major Engineer Paratrooper Basil al-Asad. Professor Khalil 'Ataminah from B'ir Zayt University recited a poem in praise of Basil al-Asad in which he expressed his heartfelt condolences to the president and the Syrian people on the homeland's loss of Basil al-Asad. He praised Syria's militant stands throughout history. The president replied to the speakers of the delegation members, saying: I was pleased with this meeting. I was pleased with this fraternal atmosphere. You prove, through what we heard from you, that boundaries and borders cannot cancel sentiments and history. We will continue to be sons of one nation. We will continue to aspire and work for our glory and dignity. Your are now in your country. This is not only my opinion, but it also expresses the feelings of all citizens in Syria.
