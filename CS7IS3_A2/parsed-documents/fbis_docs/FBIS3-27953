By a whimsical turn of fortune, a university president with whom she is acquainted in Austria is going to collect and publish "one-page messages" from persons in various fields in countries around the world, and she asked me to cooperate with him; it was a situation in which I had to write one. I sent him something with a stiff, formal title. "The Relationship Between the Central Government and the Provinces in Japan." At present, we are right in the midst of a "political reform Diet session." There is no doubt that the biggest news that should be dispatched from Japan is the four political reform bills which are fixed mainly on historic changes in the electoral system. But it makes me expect that the complications will be extraordinary. Moreover, I suspected that things were a bit too fishy, even if we take it as fairly certain that it would be settled during the Diet session. So I selected for my subject the secondary "eye" of the typhoon. To the Hosokawa government, decentralization is not so much an extension of political reform as it is something that complements, expands, and completes political reform. Is it, perhaps, rather a task with the properties of a leading point which forms a concentric circle? Expectations "Because It Is Hosokawa" Certainly one can say that decentralization is the Hosokawa government's highest task. Moreover, there are also great expectations because of it being the Hosokawa government. First, the lineup. Four persons who have been governors or mayors have assembled. Prime Minister Hosokawa spent 10 years as the "clan lord" of Kumamoto Prefecture. He is known for the "Artopolis policy," which tries to awaken consciousness of urban design, the "hands on" plan, which took the lead in computer education for elementary and middle school pupils, and for many ambitious experiments and bold initiatives in the "Japan first" campaign, activation of the prefecture, and regional development. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, has experience as an official in Saitama Prefecture, and he not only advanced rapidly to mayor of Yokaichi and governor of Shiga Prefecture, he distinguished himself by such environmental policies as the Biwa treaty and policies on municipalities and communities. Minister of Construction Kozo Igarashi was mayor of Hokkaido's Asahikawa, a "shopping paradise"; and Eijiro Hata, minister of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries, was the "idea mayor" of Oita Prefecture's Hita. That is the lineup. It is not just the lineup. In his keynote address for the special Diet session, Prime Minister Hosokawa made his position clear, saying, "We must by all means succeed in the tasks of relaxing regulations, promoting decentralization, and correcting the harmful effect of administration which is compartmentalized by competition over turf... and also continue to develop regional administration that is filled with a vitality in which the region's special characteristics and autonomy are reflected." It cannot be doubted that every government agency will be gauging the wind direction toward decentralization as it considers development of new policies. Take, for example, the Ministry of Construction. Since the formation of the new government, it has set forth changes of posture in rapid succession: a great reduction in such duties entrusted to agencies as decisions on city plans, reconsideration of national leadership in wide-area public works, creation of "regional improvement action programs" centered on autonomous bodies, and so on. I would like to take this to mean that the ministry became aware of the political reform goal of eliminating the hotbed of politician-bureaucrat-businessman collusion, and changing the centralized administration of construction. The Wind Direction Was Changing But the favorable wind toward decentralization was growing much stronger up to the general election. Along with political reform, decentralization was gradually being narrowed to an issue both at the center and in the provinces. The moves this year to which one should pay attention are the "wide-region alliance" and "nuclear city" reports of the 23d Local Government System Research Council, the proposal of the Political Reform Promotion Council (Private Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform) for a "decentralization revolution," and the "decentralization resolutions" in both houses prior to dissolution of the lower house. It was an upsurge, with the report of the Third Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform, and the proposals of the Japan Junior Chamber, Inc. and the National Congress for Political Reform, and the trend in the research and discussion of the National Governors' Association, and advocacy by all political parties of a system of basic law for decentralization. Nostalgia also appeared for the past argument for merging of prefectures to form "regional" administrative bodies, there were also animated calls for a new federal system, and such fruitful steps as the Hyogo Prefecture Symposium hosted by the National Governors' Association and the National Discussion Conference hosted by the Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform were also seen. A number of things can be considered as the background to this. First, the changes in the world political and economic situation because of the collapse of the cold war structure. The fact that the central government should turn its eyes outward, and transfer both authority and responsibility for internal affairs to autonomous bodies. Diverse multipolar policies on national land can be cited as the second, and for the third, which is the reverse side of the coin, transfer of authority to local areas was sought because there was a genuine grappling with such activities as improving district towns. And for the fourth, there were demands for structural reform linked to political reform; and so on and so forth. It is probable that the circumstances of decentralization have begun to differ from when things were, in a real sense, driven by an adverse wind in the direction of "neo new centralization" by the policy line of "the general settlement of accounts for postwar politics" under the Nakasone government. Toward Basic Laws on Decentralization and Laws To Promote Decentralization Among the times when the argument for decentralization has surged since the end of World War II, the major special characteristics this time are such things as the striking enthusiasm of chiefs of prefectures and municipalities who are grappling with decentralization, such core parties as the Japan New Party also have officially espoused it and begun action, and municipalities are concentrating on making it a reality, within the scope of what they can do, and have, therefore, elevated it to a priority task in such municipal administration as ordinances and charters. There were also proposals for a national campaign. The point which, more than any other, sets it off decisively from past arguments for decentralization is that calls to reverse the proper nature of the relationship between the central government and the provinces, and to change to a blueprint in which the provinces come first in both social consciousness and the legal system, occurred without being anticipated. Up till now, virtually all assertions in favor of decentralization have employed the method of probing minutely into such things as work entrusted to state agencies, local agencies of the national government, licensing authority and subsidies, and seeking a share for the provinces by reorganizing the functions and business of central government agencies. It was based on the existing centralized administration, under which everything is done in instalments. This reverses that. Prefectures and municipalities would shoulder authority and responsibility for everything concerning domestic affairs, and the agencies of the central government would bear a portion limited to diplomacy, national defense, planning, and preservation covering the entire country, such as currency, and adjustment among local governments. It is a view that penetrates to the heart of decentralization in the general discussion, rather than in later details. The National Governors' Conference and the Ad Hoc Council on Political Reform proposed it. In the representative interpellation at the beginning of the last regular Diet session, Sadao Yamahana, who at the time was chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Japan, sought establishment of a system of basic law for decentralization. At a meeting of the prefectural assembly, Governor (Toshitami) Mihara of Hyogo Prefecture proposed "laws limiting centralization." There are various ways of referring to it, such as a basic law on decentralization, or laws to promote it, or a basic law on local autonomous bodies, but the direction of the argument for decentralization is being established. The Wall Is Still High, But... However, the wall impeding the favorable wind toward decentralization is still high. The resistance of central government agencies is a force that renders essentially hollow the "main purpose of local autonomy," which the new postwar Constitution held up as a principle. It is not easy to raze a wall that is strengthened by such things as administration compartmentalized by turf boundaries, work entrusted to agencies, licensing authority, and policy on subsidies. Nor can one see that the advent of the new Hosokawa government, which makes decentralization its highest task, changed the situation. The symbol of that is the final report of the Provisional Council for Promotion of Administrative Reform (Third Administrative Reform Council, chaired by Eiji Suzuki). Prime Minister Hosokawa is serving as chairman of this council's sectional meeting on affluent life, and even when addressing a regular meeting after having assumed the post of prime minister, he said "I feel that I have returned to a room that is dear to me," but in the report is nothing that challenges the wall. The resistance of government agencies to compilation of the report was dreadful, so it ended with the opinion of some members wanting to make clear a posture toward decentralization that differed from that of the time of LDP governments, being repulsed. Ironically, after the Hosokawa government was born, the worst situation that puts a damper on the approach to decentralization is spreading. The corruption of heads of local governments. After the arrest of Mayor Toru Ishii of Sendai and Governor Fujio Takeuchi of Ibaraki, the entire system of general contractors and the heads of other local governments bodies continue to be shaken. When the agitation toward decentralization increases, voices from central government agencies arguing against it are heard without fail. Will it be safe to transfer authority to the provinces; will they be able to handle it; will money not be used in a wasteful manner? It is a so-called "catch-all" argument. The corruption of a string of headmen and general contractors evoked uneasiness in the population, to say nothing of agencies of the central government. Even if one tries to answer the uneasiness by saying such things as "the corruption of money and power is the same even for the central government, nay, the scale of Lockheed, Recruit, and so on is far greater," and "if authority shifts to the provinces, the locus of responsibility will be clear, and it is easier to do a thorough job when the eyes which are monitoring are near to the public," it sounds feeble. It is probably certain that the momentum toward decentralization was diminished. I cannot help being disappointed. Rebound by Four Political Reform Laws Even if it were not so, there is confusion in the provinces, not so much because of the advent of the Hosokawa government as because of the crumbling of the LDP's long rule. At the National Governor's Conference that was hosted by the government on 14 September, the prime minister and Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura received words of the greatest welcome, such as "persons who understand the heart of the provinces..." (Governor Morihiko Hiramatsu of Oita Prefecture). On the other hand, the picture of an uncertain attitude by the provinces is conspicuously making the rounds, at the center, of Diet members from the prefectures, and in Diet policy in the local areas and in dealing with the coalition governing parties and the opposition LDP. One can say that it is unavoidable, but to the Hosokawa government this, too, is a wall which it must break through. The current Diet session is a political reform session, so passage of the four bills becomes the goal with the highest priority. The outlook has come to be that even the opposition-party LDP will have to cooperate in their passage. It will probably work out to be a form in which there will be decentralization in the future. Transparency and a sense of fairness. With the four reform bills as an impetus, the Hosokawa government will grapple with decentralization as an extension of them. What will it do about the system of laws on administrative procedure which was inherited from the previous regular Diet session; what will it think of the next-generation administrative reform of the Third Ad Hoc Council on Administrative Reform, which has finished its mission; will it devise a Fifth National Comprehensive Development Plan in response to a complete inspection of the Fourth National Comprehensive Development Plan, which began in the time of the previous government; furthermore, what about a thorough relaxation of regulations; what about systematization of opening information to the public, and what about a system of basic laws for decentralization---? In my "one page message" to Australia [as published], I wrote that the situation of making a reality of the decentralization and local autonomy which retrogressed in terms of the principles of the new constitution would probably be difficult for Europeans to understand. It can be called a different world from that of people who possess a history in which autonomy of cities led to nation states. And next, when I am asked for a followup report on the "message," I want to dispose of it with one line. "True political reform became a reality in Japan."
