The Meretz Knesset faction threatens to walk out of the coalition the moment Labor starts negotiating with Tzomet on joining the government. This was decided tonight in a meeting attended by Meretz ministers and its caucus. Meretz notes that the coalition agreement gives it veto powers over other parties joining the coalition, and it is certain that Prime Minister Rabin will abide by the agreement. Our correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports that Meretz says that coopting Tzomet into the coalition will constitute a negative message to the PLO leadership, Israel's Arab community, and the entire peace process. Minister Shulamit Aloni informed Prime Minister Rabin of the Meretz decision. She said his response was indignation and that he said he would continue contacts with Tzomet. Minister Aloni said the prime minister thinks Meretz has to do his bidding and that he demands more from it than from his own party. She said they are two separate parties and the Meretz position also has to be taken into account. Tzomet leader Refa'el Eytan told our correspondent that following the Meretz decision his information permits negotiations into Tzomet joining the government. Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the Meretz decision is strange. It is unclear why they rule out Tzomet, which is ready to join on the basis of the government's basic guidelines, he said.
