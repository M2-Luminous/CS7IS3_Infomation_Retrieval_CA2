FBIS4-44113 "drweu123_h_94006" FBIS-WEU-94-123 Daily Report 27 Jun 1994 GERMANY Saxony-Anhalt Officials View Result Saxony-Anhalt Officials View Result AU2606193594 AU2606193594 BFN [Editorial Report] Mainz ZDF Television Network in German at 1705 GMT on 26 June in its "Heute" program carries 10 minutes of live statements by leading party officials of Saxony-Anhalt to questions by ZDF correspondent Barbara Friedrichs on the preliminary results of today's Landtag election, which give the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) 35 percent of the vote, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) 34 percent, the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) 3.7 percent, the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) 19 percent, the Greens 5.1 percent, and the Republikaner 1.3 percent. Minister President Christoph Bergner (CDU) describes the result as "relatively positive." "For me it is important that we have stuck to our political course," which is what was honored by the voters. He expresses his thanks to those who supported the CDU, adding that he was "sure" that the support from Bonn in the election was important. "I have the impression that the support by the federal chancellor was most effective here" compared to the appearances of other party leaders from Bonn in the Saxony-Anhalt election campaign. Asked about a possible grand coalition, which now seems the only possibility for a new government since both the CDU and the SPD ruled out a coalition with the PDS even before the election, Bergner says that the current "constellation" is "not very good." He does, however, support coalition talks with the SPD, "and then we will see how easy or difficult this is going to be." Reinhard Hoeppner, chairman of the SPD group in the Saxony-Anhalt Landtag, argues that coalition talks with the CDU will not be easy since there are "a number of essential differences" between the two parties. "The decisive thing," however is "to advance the country." He is optimistic that his party will "overcome" the "difficult constellation." He is "not particularly happy" about the apparently inevitable grand coalition with the CDU, and adds that he is still "worrying" about the fact that the Greens will be represented in the new Landtag. Hoeppner then says: "I have my doubts whether it would be good for the development of democracy in our country if the PDS were the only opposition party." The SPD official notes that, compared to the European election, "we have increased" our share in the vote again. Peter Kunert, chairman of the FDP group of Saxony-Anhalt, which lost more than 10 percentage points from the 1990 results, and will not be represented in the new Landtag, blames the poor result on the "negative trend" in which his party has been for some time. "The voters did not honor" the FDP's work in Saxony-Anhalt, and we will have to "analyze" the result. He does "not rule out" personal consequences. Petra Sitte, chairwoman of the PDS group in the Landtag, says that her party's good result has "certainly" nothing to do with a "nostalgia for the GDR," as suggested by the ZDF correspondent. The high score is partly due to the "protest" by the electorate, but she also believes that "the PDS has been recognized" as an opposition power. "I also think that building a coalition against the PDS, as was tried in the past few days, has not worked out." She adds that "for us, political responsibility also means responsibility as opposition." Heidrun Heidecke, spokeswoman for Alliance 90/Greens, argues that the result "clearly shows" that the reformist forces in Saxony-Anhalt are "not as strong as in the old laender." Nevertheless, one must not forget that Alliance 90/Greens is still "a young party." She assumes that her party can continue its work in the opposition in the next four years and will be able to set its own "accents."
