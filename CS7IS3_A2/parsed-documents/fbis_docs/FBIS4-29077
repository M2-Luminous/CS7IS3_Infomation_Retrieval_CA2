This follows the discovery of a rocket-launcher and several automatic rifles in two Vietnamese fishing trawlers detained in Terengganu recently. Abdul Hamid Syukor, chairman of the Marine Division of the Fishery Department said that from the national security viewpoint, the discovery of the weapons is serious and at the same time a danger to the country's maritime officials. "Even though there were no clashes when the weapons were seized, the seizure was something serious because these Vietnamese were well trained in using war weapons," he said to reporters after visiting the marine fishery center here. Therefore, maritime officers have been instructed to conduct thorough examinations on Vietnamese trawlers involved in illegal fishing in the area. Abdul Hamid said the trawlers were found during the incidents on 4 and 7 March to be armed with one rocket-launcher, one light machine gun, two M-16 rifles, and two AK-47 rifles, as well as eight ammunition magazines, 13 rounds of 40mm ammunition, and 485 rounds of ammunition. He added the two trawlers had been detained by two Royal Malaysian Navy patrol boats at 150 nautical miles in Pahang waters early in the morning. [passage omitted]
