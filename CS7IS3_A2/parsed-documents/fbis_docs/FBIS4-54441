"We insist on the border's permanency since in Slovakia the fear that the border might be altered is a real political factor," Moravcik said, adding he believed an agreement on the issue might be concluded this year. Moravcik said the meeting of the two countries' premiers planned for last Monday [25 April] did not take place due to Hungary's unwillingness to issue a joint statement on border inviolability. He also said that owing to his crowded schedule he would not attend the coming international meeting of Liberals at Visegrad in Hungary, where he was supposed to unofficially meet Hungarian Premier Peter Boross. But he added that he did not rule out the possibility of still meeting Boross before the elections. Observers in Bratislava are skeptical about the meeting materializing in view of the Hungarian election campaign. Moravcik also warned that Slovak-Hungarian relations would not be helped by taking mutual problems to the "Balladur plan" meeting due to take place on May 26-27 in Paris. French President [as received] Edouard Balladur has proposed that a conference should be held at which the twelve countries of the European Union, Central and East European countries, the United States and Canada should come together to try to resolve territorial and ethnic minority questions concerning the former Communist countries. The plan has been approved by the EU.
