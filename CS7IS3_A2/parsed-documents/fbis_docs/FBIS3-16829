The conversation focussed on election issues and relations between central executive power bodies and the local executive power in the autonomous Republic of Crimea. [Correspondent] Crimea's top executive, President Yuriy Meshkov, plans to conduct a poll on 27 March. There has been a lot of talk about this poll on the air.... [Kravchuk, interrupting] I talked about it, too. [Correspondent] And about your decree that abolished some of its premises. But a lot will depend on, and I quote the U.S. embassy press statement, Kiev's considerable self-control. Does Kiev have that considerable self-control, Leonid Makarovych? [Kravchuk] Of course it does, because, first of all, this self-control needs to be understood in the way that we are acting in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of Ukraine. It is very important. Whereas the president of Crimea has exceeded his powers, that is, has ignored the law, both the Ukrainian one and his own, the president of Ukraine is acting clearly within the framework of the law. Thus, if you put both of these documents [the two presidents' decrees] on the table, then you will see that we are acting clearly in accordance with the law, while the president of Crimea has violated the norms of both Ukraine's and his own law. And that is dangerous. Our self-control shows in the fact that we are staying always within the law. The Crimean president's lack of self-control in this case shows in the fact that he wants to break the law, and he is breaking it. I already said this, and I want to say once again that the main thing that needs to be done in Crimea today is to solve economic problems. [Announcer] That was an excerpt from an interview with President of Ukraine Leonid Kravchuk. You can see it in full today, at 2200 in the television program "Without Protocol."
