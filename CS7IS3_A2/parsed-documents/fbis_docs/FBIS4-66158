Given such an agenda, to answer the question how enterprises can best understand its import and grasp the substantive issues involved in establishing a modern enterprise system in order to effectively implement the process of reform, this reporter called on several individuals for a wide-ranging discussion: State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System's Horizontal Coordination Bureau director Lu Piao [0712 2613], an expert on enterprise groups; State-Owned Property Administrative Bureau's Enterprise Groups Department deputy director Zhou Fangsheng [0719 2397 3992], an expert on the system of production authorities; and Beijing Junhe Consulting Company manager Li Su [2621 5126], an expert enterprise consultant. The content of our discussion is as follows: [Reporter] The future direction of enterprise reform is establishing a modern enterprise system -- privatizing enterprises is the inevitable trend after over 10 years of reform in establishing a new enterprise system by reallocating production authorities and enterprise profits. How did the impetus to establish a modern enterprise system come about? [Li] It began in 1987; No. 2 Gas Plant, having had experiences carrying out internal reforms, proposed the establishment of a modern enterprise system -- an urgent request toward privatization. At the All China Symposium on Enterprise Groups held in Luoyang, then No. 2 Gas Plant director Chen Qingtai [7115 3237 3141], after reporting the impressions of his observation tour abroad, proposed that his plant be privatized as a company under a modern enterprise system. Subsequently, we made three separate trips to visit and study No. 2 Gas Plant, and participated in its restructuring under comrade Chen Qingtai's leadership. [Zhou] In the earlier stages, concerned experts and cadres, organized by the State Commission for Economy and Trade, undertook a nationwide study of all aspects involved in establishing a modern enterprise system; they collected and reviewed a large body of data from both inside China and abroad dealing with the practices, experiences and lessons of enterprise system reform, and submitted an excellent proposal that China proceed to establish a modern enterprise system. Having taken part in the study and investigation which led up to this proposal, we were deeply impressed by the spirit displayed at the 3rd Plenum to act in a timely manner, a spirit crystallized by over 10 years of enterprise reform. [Reporter] There are many theories and explanations for a modern enterprise system, how can its substance best be summarized? [Lu] The point of departure in establishing a modern enterprise system is to break down all the original barriers, and change the system of classifying different types of enterprise by the source of production authority (people, collectives, individuals, or foreign investors) to classifying them on the basis of management responsibilities (by individuals, partnerships, enterprises with unlimited liability, companies with limited liability, or joint-stock enterprises with limited liability). Enterprises operated by individuals or partnerships have a long history, but the crux to a modern enterprise system is a system of privatized enterprises with limited liabilities. Therefore, in developing a modern enterprise system, we are basically applying the limited liability enterprise model to reform enterprises owned by the state, people or collectives where the production authorities are not clearly spelled out. [Reporter] How would establishing a modern enterprise system enable the state-owned enterprises to change their operating system? [Li] When we participated in restructuring the No. 2 Gas Plant into a privatized enterprise, we took note of two major difficulties which China encountered earlier in implementing the reform policy of reallocating production authorities and enterprise profits: First, the contradiction between decentralizing and centralizing authority. In the overall context of a planned economy, strong administrative controls hampered flexible operations of the enterprise; in the early stages of reforming the system, however, the profits structure created was open to strong pressure from the workers which also constrained the enterprise from moving briskly forward. Both these types of pressure were present in the No. 2 Gas Plant, resulting in sharp contradictions between branch factories and subsidiary enterprises demanding free reign to operate, and the headquarters wanting to hold on to centralized operating authority. A system of decentralized authority can lead to waste of resources if not tied to a production authority; but if centralization of authority goes too far, it will certainly strengthen administrative controls which affect the forward thrust of development. Given these factors, the contradictions experienced by the No. 2 Plant in the early stages of restructuring were similar to those confronting China's enterprise reform, and the reform process itself continued to be pulled in contradictory directions of decentralizing and centralizing authority. Second, there was the contradiction between competition and alliance or integration. In a planned economy divided into separate spheres, the various administrative monopolies created tended to block operational mobility, and various government managing departments acting like a large engine forcefully drove subsidiary enterprises to produce according to plan, allocated resources equally to different enterprises and divided the existing contradictions equally among all enterprises. The enterprise reform of reallocating authorities and profits involves, in essence, breaking down the administrative monopolies and reallocating production authorities and profits, but there can also be negative consequences including disorderly allocation of resources, duplication of investment, twisted organizational structure, and the lack of macroeconomic coordination, etc. To deal with this situation, horizontal integration of enterprises and enterprise groups was carried out. But, because of the enterprise structure, integrating loosely linked or radically different enterprises could not solve the contradiction of blind competition, while their administrative integration can easily result in restricting competition. The No. 2 Gas Plant led other enterprise groups in China in terms of growth and development, and experienced particularly keenly the contradiction between competition and integration. Looking at the situation from this perspective, the modern enterprise system reform which the No. 2 Gas Plant has pursued since 1987 involves changing the enterprise group into a privatized enterprise, and at the same time resolving the two obstacles in reform. In terms of the contradiction between decentralizing and centralizing authorities, a system of corporate management created by privatization, with its Board of Directors, can prevent government departments from administratively interfering in various levels of enterprise management, can restrain subordinate enterprises from blindly exerting pressure on top management or, by joining with workers and staffs, putting pressure on the enterprise, and ultimately develop an operating system which has both restraints as well as safeguards. In terms of the contradiction between competition and integration, a system of production authorities, which legalize asset linkage of parent and subsidiary enterprises, can strengthen control over subsidiary enterprises and help develop the transactional mechanism for reallocating and transferring production authorities and assets. Therefore, the establishment of a modern enterprise system is of great strategic significance in terms of changing the operating mechanism of state-owned enterprises. [Report] A modern enterprise system is not a simple system, it involves an array of substantive details, which of these are most important? [Zhou] The foundation of a modern enterprise system is a system of production authorities. Because the latter is basic to a market economy, only after production authorities are clearly established can we talk about commercial exchanges from which evolved a series of complex market-oriented economic rules and regulations. But at present, in the state-owned enterprises, the line of production authorities is not clearly defined, responsibility for production not clearly fixed, organizational leadership system irrational and managerial methods not up to par. The reform tasks are enormously difficult when the twin functions of government are not completely separated, and the mechanisms for transferring assets, organizing production authority and allocating resources are not fully developed. Among the collective enterprises, contradictions have surfaced over abuse of authority and confused lines of responsibility due to enterprises operating without clearly defined centers of production authority. Therefore, a rational system of production authorities is an indispensable condition for establishing a modern enterprise system. [Lu] One special characteristic of a modern enterprise system is the freedom to assign or transfer production authorities within a system of safeguards, and the goal of developing a modern enterprise system is to achieve unity of production efficiency and safeguard in a market-oriented economy; because the public nature of enterprise production authority is increasingly being emphasized by the development of large-scale stock-holding incorporated companies, these companies, unlike the individual enterprises in the early days of reform, must give priority to the unity of production efficiency and safeguard. That is to say that in terms of the structure and management in a modern enterprise system, enterprises must operationally emphasize internal coordination, working with the stockholders and workers through the corporate body (the management). In terms of the enterprise's external concerns, the enterprise and government should jointly promote and perfect a social welfare system and ensure that enterprise managers have the freedom to allocate corporate assets for this purpose within a rational environment with safeguards. [Li] In summarizing, it should be pointed out that establishing a modern enterprise system involves establishing a system with eight major features, as follows: 1. A system of production authorities designed to meet conditions of market-oriented transactions; this is the foundation of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, a clear definition of production authority; second, the freedom to exercise that authority; and third, the ease in exchanging or transferring production authority. 2. A system of incorporation based on a modern system of credits; this is the symbol of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, a production authority governed by stock and bond transactions; second, personification of enterprise management (in the independence of a new body of stockholders); and third, public accountability for enterprise management. 3. A system for acquiring enterprises based on a market for trading in stocks and bonds; this is the trend of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, the freedom to buy and sell shares; second, lowering the controlling share ratio; and third, simplification of transactions of key asset factors. 4. A system for stratifying enterprises based on a system of macroeconomic coordinations; this is the essence of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, competition among large monopolistic enterprises; second, government coordination and control at different levels of the enterprise; and third, linking or merging of medium and small enterprises. 5. A system of association or merger of enterprises based on a strict system of laws and regulations; this is the form of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, limited liabilities on the part of parent and subsidiary enterprises; second, lively and free purchase or transfer of components of enterprises; and third, standardization of business management practices in branch companies (supervising asset managements of subsidiaries). 6. A system of finance based on a system of public accountability and supervision; this is the linkage of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, transparency of enterprise accounting practices; second, balanced earnings from assets; and third, rational allocation of financial assets. 7. A system of personnel governed by social welfare regulations; this is the essence of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, intensification of personnel competition; second, market determination of the value of labor; and third, socialization of personnel attribution and replacement. 8. A system of enterprise management based on a consolidated approach to education; this is the safeguard of a modern enterprise system characterized by, first, blending of personnel trained in science and technology and the liberal arts; second, consolidation of management departments; and third, systematization of managerial techniques. [Reporter] Summarizing what has been mentioned above, establishing a modern enterprise system is not something enterprises can accomplish by piecemeal reforms; its development must be systematic, and involves various ramifications and varying intensities which go beyond the reform policy of reallocating authorities and profits; this is a gigantic systemic task which cannot be accomplished in one fell swoop, but only by painstaking labor of a generation. This year is a year for major efforts in China's reforms and we must press ahead systematically and steadily and tackle the tasks from the simple gradually to the complex; with emphasis on reforming the current enterprise system, we begin by changing the state-owned enterprises into enterprises with limited liabilities, would that be a fair summary? [Lu] It is, because the publicly organized joint-stock companies with limited liabilities can now operate only within a limited sphere, while a series of reforms dealing with enterprise bankruptcy, exchange or transfer of production authority, strengthening of management and expansion of enterprise groups are closely related to the restructuring of the state-owned enterprise system. [Zhou] The reform of the state-owned enterprise system should be coordinated with the operation and management of components of enterprise groups, including those operating with state-owned assets, which are in the process of reallocating production authorities. As for privatizing existing enterprise groups, we should make a clear distinction between two groups of enterprises, the nuclear enterprise and the close-knit, multi-layer enterprise, pursue privatization separately with each group, and step by step shape the parent- subsidiary relationships that exist between the two groups.
