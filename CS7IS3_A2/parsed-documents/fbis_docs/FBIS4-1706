He made the above remark in a speech at a seminar "Sanctions and Trade Control," sponsored by the U.S. Council for Foreign Affairs. He said: The National Council for U.S.-China Trade hopes very much, and will be happy to see more trade and other exchanges between the United States and China. Disruption of trade relations between the two countries will incur heavy losses to both sides. According to him, Washington should not hassle over China's MFN status every year. He called for solving this problem once for all this year by granting permanent MFN status to China. On the human right issue, he said the United States has its own standards of human rights, but should not force China to comply. He added that the National Council for U.S.-China trade, as a nongovernmental organization, will continue to exert efforts to urge the Congress and Clinton Administration to grant MFN trade status to China. Jane Shilaka, representative of the U.S. Boeing Aircraft Company, also spoke at the seminar. She repeatedly stated that Boeing "entirely supports MFN for China every year." She added that if the annual debate over the MFN status is cancelled, "it will be much better for the American people."
