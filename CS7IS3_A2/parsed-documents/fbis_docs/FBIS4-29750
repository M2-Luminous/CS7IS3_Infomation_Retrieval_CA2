Under the accord reached by LDP head Yohei Kono and other leaders, the party will hold a series of leadership meetings to authorize the motion, which it hopes will be joined by the second largest opposition Social Democratic Party (SDP). The accord came amid a flurry of strategic talks held separately by the SDP, which quit the governing alliance in April, and coalition parties seeking to lure the SDP back into the fold.
