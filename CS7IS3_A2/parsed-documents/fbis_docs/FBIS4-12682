It is with much pleasure that I extend to you and to your accompanying delegation a warm word of welcome as valued guests and as friends whom we hold in deep affection and high regard. I also wish to welcome you on behalf of the people and government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Let me assure you that we in Jordan take much pride in the ties that happily exist between our two countries, founded on trust and cooperation for the benefit of our two peoples and based on our common faith in the principles of freedom, justice, democracy, and respect for human rights. We share with you a sincere desire to contribute in building a better future in which subsequent generations can live in peace, security, and prosperity. Mr. President, we in Jordan have always stood by the striving of people for freedom and an independent will. The stand we take on this issue is deeply rooted in our history. Our democratic drive, inspired by the Constitution and the National Charter, which was ratified by a national conference, opting for pluralism of opinion, belief, and cultural and ideological reference, is a true embodiment of our firm adherence to the values of freedom, equality, and regard for human rights. It stems from our nation's history, from its message of tolerance, and from its great civilizing role. Not only do we cherish our democratic march, but we always endeavor with every possible means to strengthen its foundations and enrich its fabric to serve as a model emulated and sought by others. Mr. President, in the last few decades Jordan has played a pivotal role in maintaining the security and stability of our region despite the many causes and manifestations of conflict and despite Jordan's limited capacity and resources. To this end, we have endured much hardship. When circumstances became conducive to a convening of the Madrid peace conference, we were among the first to respond to the call of peace. We took part in the conference itself as well as in meetings that followed it. We were diligent in asserting the constant elements of our unequivocal stand on the whole question of peace. The elements called for the application of resolutions based on international legitimacy and for total support for our Palestinian brethren so as to enable them to participate in the peace process as a prelude to regaining their rights on their national soil. We have always been careful to uphold the independence of the Palestinian decision and to respect the options made by the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. Our recourse in all of this has been an abiding faith in the need to achieve a comprehensive, durable, and just peace in a region torn by tension and conflict. It is the right of future generations to enjoy stability and the state of wellbeing enabling them to make their own contribution to the civilization of the modern age. We in Jordan recognize and understand the intricate relationship between a realization of peace on the one hand, and the achievement of growth and prosperity on the other. Real peace can neither stand nor flourish in the absence of development and a decent standard of living. Therefore, the people of our region look to the international community, and specially the countries of Europe, to play a role in the promoting of economic development as a major cornerstone for a real and lasting peace. Mr. President, in expressing to Your Excellency our pride in the distinctive ties between our two countries, based on confidence and mutual cooperation for the good of our two peoples, I wish to assure you of our keen desire to foster and strengthen those bonds in all walks of life and in the various fields of endeavor. My friend, I reiterate our pleasure at having you and your accompanying delegation here as guests of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and as valued friends. I wish you health and happiness and a very pleasant stay among us. Ahlan wa sahlan. [preceding words in Arabic: "you are welcome"] Once again peace be with you and God's mercy and His blessings. [applause]
