He told reporters at the airport that during his last two days of visit in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, he saw great potential in the already remarkable economic growth there. Iliescu said the province's two cities of Shenzhen and Zhuhai are among the strongest of China's economy, and that they have transformed themselves from poor country villages to modern cities in 15 years. He said the inflow of foreign capital into the area has greatly contributed to the development there. The president, who had visited South Korea before making a stop in Guangdong, pointed out that the Asia-Pacific region is leading the world's economic growth. His visit to the region will help Romania make its own opening policy, he added.
