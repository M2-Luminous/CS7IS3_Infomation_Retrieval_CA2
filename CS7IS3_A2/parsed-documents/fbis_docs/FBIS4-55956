"And the reason is," she continued, "that the world considers Hungary to be a democratic country. In other words, once the country undertook international obligations, one assumes that it will fulfill them." "It never even occurred to me to consider the legal consequences of a possible cancellation of the world fair," the chief commissioner emphasized. (There are no legal consequences of canceling the event, but the loss of prestige can be considerable. And should an invited country have already invested a certain amount in Hungary, and should the event be canceled, the foreign country can sue for damages. -- Editor) "The new government will most probably survey the issues and projects in progress," Mrs. Barsi said, "but only the parliament has the right to put a stop to them." According to the chief commissioner, canceling the expo would be an illogical step for several reasons, because the entire event is being organized in such a way that almost every site can be utilized afterwards. It seems that the antagonism between Budapest leaders and the programming office was revived in the last few days. According to Budapest, the city needs 50 billion forints [Ft] to implement the expo, but the chief commissioner says that the remaining time is only sufficient to carry out work in Budapest in the amount of no more than Ft24 billion, and that money is there. "Some people also claim," the chief commissioner said, "that the Universitas bonds are not successful, but actually they were oversold." To the question of MAGYAR HIRLAP--because Mrs. Barsi ran for the parliament--how she imagines her work in the programming office in the future, she replied that she did not run as an individual representative. If all goes well, she wants to continue to deal with the expo in the parliament, as well. True enough, she will not always be able to participate in committee meetings, but the Hungarian Democratic Forum thinks that it is a good idea for someone to represent the expo in the parliament. "I also kept my seat in Budapest, and I was not present at every meeting, but if my work is scrutinized, it will be found that I am among the top 10 people who did something for the city," Mrs. Barsi said.
