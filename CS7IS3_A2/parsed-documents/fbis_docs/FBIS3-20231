The fine weather over France did not make for a large-scale turnout. Some 58 percent of those eligible actually cast a vote, as opposed to 60.40 percent on 20 March, the rural population showing itself to be considerably more "civic minded" than urban voters However, more than two-thirds of the seats remained in very tight run-off situations (1,372 as opposed to 2,028 in mainland France and the overseas territories): Just 21 were fought for by a single candidate, 132 by three candidates, six by four candidates, and one by five candidates (Molieres in the Tarn-et-Garonne department), all the rest being head-to-head confrontations. This second round, moreover, was not, far from it, without political significance, even after a first round which had indicated better than any opinion poll the current balance of power between the moderate right (44.59 percent) and the left (40.40 percent), and the National Front with 9.7 percent and the ecologists with just 3.5 percent. The majority therefore did a little better than in the first round (44.2 percent) of the legislative elections of March 1993. That allowed Edouard Balladur to say yesterday that "confidence in the government and its majority had been confirmed." The Socialists and other parties on the Left, with 29 percent of the vote, garnered five points less than in the previous local elections of 1988, but won back nine points over their disastrous result at the legislative elections. The stakes of the second round, over and above the seats that were being fought, was the control of several regional councils. The Right, which had already held 75 of these councils, hoped it could win another three or four. Its gains (only the Creuse region) were more modest... The Left, which had held just 29 regional councils (including Seine-Saint-Denis and Val-de-Marne held by the Communist party), had several departments in its sights. It thus won the Dordogne, the island of Reunion, and the Gironde. Vaucluse and Upper Corsica stayed with the Right, while Tam, Cotes d'Armor, and the territory of Belfort all went to the Left. In addition to these direct stakes, there were what could termed the particular centers of interest of this second round: the fate of various political personalities (Bernard Tapie in Marseilles, Jean-Louis Bianco in Digne, Olivier Stern in Vire, Jean-Marie Bockel in Mulhouse, who were all elected; while Elisabeth Guigou in Avignon, Maurice Arreckx in Toulon, Brice Lalonde in Dinard, Jean-Francois Poncet in Laplume were beaten...), the solidity of the Right-Left "republican front" against the National Front [FN] (especially in Provence; Cote d'Azur; Dreux, where Marie-France Stirbois beat the outgoing Socialist; and in Creil, where Ernest Cheniere, the FN-backed Rally for the Republic [RPR] man, was beaten), the internal competition within the moderate right (the French Democratic Union, UDF, and the RPR were in opposition in some 20 constituencies), etc. Moreover, beyond the stakes and these centers of particular interest, this second round of local elections gave an initial indication of the results of next year's municipal elections. Everyone thinks spontaneity in Marseilles (Bernard Tapie fully intends continuing this "love story"), but in many other towns, mostly held by the Left, the majorities are fragile or unsure: Bourgas, Gueret, Valence, Thionville, Mulhouse, etc. In the first round you choose, in the second round you eliminate. This old adage of the two-round majority-based electoral systems has once again been confirmed. The voter who, on 20 March, had voted essentially from political motives, as closely as possible to his convictions and wishes, did not hesitate yesterday to vote for personalities, with the clear aim of knocking out those candidates he felt furthest from. This behavior is traditionally adopted by the parties of the Left. This is the celebrated "republican discipline" which, beginning with the evening of the first round, consists of standing down in favor of the candidate on one's own side who is better placed. Generally speaking, this principle has been respected, with fewer than 12 "smudgers." This undoubtedly explains the beginning of the recovery confirmed yesterday. Such acts of "spontaneous standing down" do not come as naturally to the Right. Competition between the RPR and UDF has not always made it possible to avoid breaches, which has not been without consequences at times, either for the fate of a constitutency or for the fate of a presidency of a regional council. These cases of disciplinary violations are most often to be appreciated as a function of the local context, the personality of the candidates who have remained, and what can be called small-town feuds. However, they must also be examined in the light of a not insignificant amplifying factor: The attitude of those who, in the first round, voted for National Front candidates. Although it was present in only 92 constituencies in the second round (less than one out of 14), the National Front had a noticeable effect on the vote. By holding a space in 41 "three-candidate" contests, these candidates allowed the Left in some places to either keep a seat or gain one. In those constituencies where it was no longer represented, its first-round electors did not all transfer their votes to a candidate of the Right. The hardening of the National Front was not completely unforeseen: Its score in the first round only allowed it to hope for a very small number of victories, i.e., less than five. So it had to make its presence felt some other way!
