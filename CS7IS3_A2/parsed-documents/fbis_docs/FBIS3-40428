Scientific research is concentrating on telecommunications. Four projects that require a global investment of 42 billion lire have been accepted for facilitated contributions from the IMI [Italian Institute for Financing Real and Personal Property] fund. The OK came after approval from University and Scientific Research Minister Umberto Colombo. The companies concerned are Telespazio (of the IRI-STET [Institute for the Reconstruction of Industry - Turin Telephone Finance Company] group), Ericsson Fatme, FIAR (IRI-Finmeccanica) and ARE [Electrical Radio Applications] (Racal Electronics). The goal of the Telespazio project is to develop an automation systems network for telecommunications equipment at a total budgeted cost of four billion lire. On the other hand 20 billion is to be invested in Ericsson Fatme. In this case systems should be constructed for digitizing telecommunications networks. FIAR's applied research plan provides for an expenditure of 15 billion in the remote sensing sector. The fourth project that has been given the go-ahead for facilitated funding concerns the activation of apparatus for subscribers and network terminals for ISDN [integrated services digital network] telematic services. It will be perfected, with an investment of 3.2 billion lire, by ARE (Electrical Radio Applications), a company based in Legnano and connected with the British group Racal Electronics. Meanwhile, Italsiel of the Finsiel group will participate in the realization of the "Care Telematics Projects," for a European information system for food safety. An international consortium (that Italsiel is part of) will manage the project that will be coordinated by the World Health Organization. The Care telematics projects form part of the larger program called ENS (European Nervous System) that the EU [European Union] has launched for the diffusion of telematic exchanges between the administrations of EC countries.
