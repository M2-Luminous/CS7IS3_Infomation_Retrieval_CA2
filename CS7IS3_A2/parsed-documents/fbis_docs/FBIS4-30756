"I have come to the conclusion that it will be useful for the two sides if I change slightly the method of my contacts with the government as a whole, with the individual ministers, and with the prime minister. I think that it is in the interest of our state's stability for these contacts to be matter- of-fact and frequent," said the president as he was leaving yesterday's cabinet session, which he attended for about 70 minutes. The government expressed its agreement yesterday with the president's visit to Slovakia, which is scheduled for 26 May. "The government did not give me any tasks, but, of course, I will receive background materials from the Foreign Ministry as I do for all my foreign visits," said Havel in connection with his visit to Slovakia. The government also agreed with the president's participation in the celebrations to be held at the beginning of June to mark the 50th anniversary of the allied landings in France.
