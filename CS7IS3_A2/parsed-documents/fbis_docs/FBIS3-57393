He declared about this on Saturday at the opening of the first Kurultai (congress) of Kyrgyzstan's peoples. At the same time Akayev underlined that he would solve the problem of dual citizenship minding Russia's priority significance "as the major partner in all spheres." According to the Kyrgyz leader, "the Russian language has been and remains the second one" for the republic's all peoples. Akayev is convinced that it is necessary "to strive for trilinguality which is to become the basis of mentality of Kyrgyzstan's single people" (saying trilinguality, Akayev believes that all citizens of the republic must fluently speak the Kyrgyz, Russian, and English languages -- Interfax). He pointed out that the lingual factor "should not be a dominating one" during educating process and job placement. Akayev called formation of a maximum favorable climate for joint existence of all nations and citizens as a necessary condition to activate consolidation of all ethnic groups into Kyrgyzstan's "single people." After the compatriots perceive their multinational unity, there will appear "a public atmosphere of aversion to nationalism and chauvinism."
