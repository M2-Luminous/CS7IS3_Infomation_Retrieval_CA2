"On March 18 the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution denouncing the massacre in Hebron and providing for a set of measures to ensure the safety of Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories. "Russia, from the very beginning of the discussion of the resolution in the Security Council, had been calling for its soonest possible adoption, considering it as a crucial step for normalising the situation in the Middle East and resuming Arab-Israeli talks. "The initiating steps taken by the Russian cosponsor -- personal address by President Boris Yeltsin to the leaders of Israel and the PLO, a trip by the foreign minister to Israel and Tunisia, a series of contacts by Russian special representatives in the region and energetic efforts in the Security Council -- not only facilitated the adoption of an effective resolution, but also laid the foundation for further progress in the Middle East peace process. "Russia, together and parallelly with the American cosponsor, intends to continue the active political line in the Middle East, including in accordance with the provisions of the adopted resolution and is ready to do its best to implement the U.N. Security Council resolution on Hebron, as well as promote the soonest possible agreement between Israel and Palestinians and its fulfillment. This would provide opportunities in other directions of the Arab-Israeli dialogue and near the time of establishing a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East."
