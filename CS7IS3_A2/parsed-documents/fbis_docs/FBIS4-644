Dr. Ibrahim Msabaha, principal secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, said yesterday that his government will take stern measures against the murder of any Tanzanians by any group belonging either to the Rwandan Patriotic Front forces or by government forces. He said Tanzania has made great efforts to promote peace in Rwanda and would therefore expect its citizens to be accorded security and special treatment in that country: We are not joking. We would never forgive any side held responsible for the death of any Tanzanians in Rwanda. Meanwhile the government has moved to evacuate its citizens from Kigali to Bujumbura, Burundi, where the first batch of 20 evacuees arrived on 10 April. The same story is carried in the fifth page of UHURU, which adds that the security of Tanzanians in Rwanda should be strictly ensured.
