SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On July 18, 1994, a petition was approved allowing the National Park Service to file an application to withdraw the following described public land from settlement, sale, location, or entry under the general land laws, including the United States mining laws (30 U.S.C. Ch. 2) and the mineral leasing laws, subject to valid existing rights: Willamette Meridian T. 28 N., R. 15 W., Sec. 6, lot 1. The area described contains 3.25 acres in Clallam County. The purpose of the proposed withdrawal is to protect the fragile, unique, and endangered resources at Cape Johnson. Until an application is filed, no further action will be taken on this proposal. For a period of two years from the date of publication of this notice in the Federal Register , the land will be segregated as specified above unless the application is denied or canceled or the withdrawal is approved prior to that date. The temporary use which may be permitted during this segregative period is dispersed, non-motorized recreation that is consistent with the Olympic National Park designated wilderness. The temporary segregation of the land in connection with a withdrawal application or proposal shall not affect administrative jurisdiction over the land, and the segregation shall not have the effect of authorizing any use of the land by the National Park Service.
