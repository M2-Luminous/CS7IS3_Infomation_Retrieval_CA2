FBIS4-10696 "drlat074_b_94002" FBIS-LAT-94-074 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 Dominican Republic Haiti `Source' Views Planned Senate President Speech `Source' Views Planned Senate President Speech FL1504171694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio in French 1030 GMT 15 Apr 94 FL1504171694 Port-au-Prince Signal FM Radio French BFN [Text] The president of the National Assembly, Senator Firmin Jean-Louis, will address the nation today, 15 April, on a private radio station in the capital within the scope of a message on the immediate political juncture, the HAITIAN PRESS AGENCY learned from a source close to Sen. Jean-Louis. According to the same source, the legitimate president of the Senate reserves the right not to react to the speech of Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, but to react to the immediate situation of the country. The current political juncture favors numerous irresponsible and illegal steps, the same source pointed out, holding as an example the attempt by some senators of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] and senators elected during the contested legislative elections of 18 January 1993 to implement Article 149 of the Constitution. The president of the National Assembly proposes giving his opinion as well on the possible legislative elections scheduled for this year in his message. The message will be delivered less than 48 hours after the one delivered on 13 April by Chamber of Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde, who announced a series of consultations for next week within the framework of finding a solution to the crisis. Promising to provide explanations on the presence abroad of the president elected on 16 December [1990], Deputy Monde, who has never hidden his hostility to the return of President Aristide to his post, contented himself with evoking the extended absence of the president of the republic, whom he nevertheless asked to assume his responsibility toward the Constitution by appointing a prime minister. Monde also asked General Cedras not to listen to the perverse songs of the sirens and to do what his duty and his word as a soldier order him to do.
