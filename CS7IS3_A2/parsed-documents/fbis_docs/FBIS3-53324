It is feared that this pressure will become even more serious and more dangerous. Do you have the same feeling? [Al-Mahdi] Yes, we too have this feeling. But with our people's support, we are ready to face anything. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] What do you mean by "anything?" Do you foresee a military intervention? [Al-Mahdi] We now see the indirect military intervention of arrogance in our country. They are strengthening the rebels in southern Sudan with arms and money. Also, they have started conflicts in northern Sudan so that attention will be diverted from the south and so that in the propaganda atmosphere created, they can more easily invest in and support the rebels in the south. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Are you not afraid because the United States and its Western allies have militarily intervened in Somalia, your neighbor, and do you not think that Sudan's turn will come after Somalia? [Al-Mahdi] Yes, basically, it would have been Sudan's turn after Somalia. But with the lesson that the Americans learned in Somalia, it is impossible that they will take this dangerous risk. They are aware of the uniformity that exists between the government and the nation of Sudan. They also have their actions in Somalia in front of their eyes. Naturally, under such conditions they do not consider it advisable to repeat their disgrace in our country. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Then do you rule out the threat of a military attack against Sudanese territory? [Al-Mahdi] No, not completely. We only consider it improbable and think that they have concentrated their policy against us in other forms such as economic sanctions, boycotts of our exports, preventing economic investments in Sudan, and -- of course -- sending arms and money to the armed rebels in southern and northern Sudan. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] You are emphatically specific in attributing the uprisings in southern and northern Sudan to forces outside your borders. Do you have any proof of this? [Al-Mahdi] Yes, based on the type and brand of the arms that we have taken from the rebels and the prolongation of their resistance, we are confident that they are receiving support from abroad. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Which government do you suspect? [Al-Mahdi] I am not accusing a specific government. But the crisis in southern Sudan has definitely been created by British colonialism. Britain started to invest greatly on creating ethnic and religious differences in Sudan a long time ago, and we consider British colonialism to have been very involved in the commencement of the crisis in our country. This is historical fact. As for northern Sudan, it is not in the interest of any country to support the incidents and the uprisings there. We believe that such tensions in southern and northern Sudan stem from a specific policy that the United States and Israel are pursuing today. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, you strongly condemn governments that are far from your borders for the ethnic crisis and the domestic rebellions in your country, as if there were no other country along your borders that had a hand in sparking the fire in Sudan. [Al-Mahdi] Look, we are living in a world that is being managed on the basis of a new order--a system that has its regional mentors, elements, and supporters. I only want to say that there are also many governments and nations that are resisting this order. They are not sitting idle and are defending the rights of the oppressed. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, the Westerners have accused you of opposing the military presence of the U.S. and UN forces in Somalia or, in other words, of supporting the people and the rebel groups in that country. Is this accusation correct? [Al-Mahdi] They have to prove their accusation. They want to cover up their defeat in Somalia by resorting to such accusations. Naturally, we consider the people in Somalia to be right, and we also know that the foreign forces have not gone to Somalia to help the Somalians and that their mission has never been humanitarian as was publicized. Naturally, some governments have extended support for the popular resistance in that country. But this does not mean that a specific country can be so easily accused. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] I thank you for Your Excellency's remarks and would like to hear your comments on the relations between your government and the Islamic Republic of Iran. [Al-Mahdi] The most important aspect in the relations between Iran and Sudan that has enraged the two countries' common enemies is the Islamic nature of both countries. In other words, Islam has become a common element that has paved the way for a healthy and fraternal relationship between the two countries. This is a phenomenon that is very rare in the world. We have been able to transform our friendship and our positive relations from words into deeds. Our political stances are the same and both of our countries have a common view at international forums. We in our country have greatly benefited from the technology and the economic and technical strength of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and we are observing Iran's constructive activities in our country; and this is something that we value. [JOMHURI-YE ESLAMI] Mr. Ambassador, if you have something to add, please do so. [Al-Mahdi] I only want to make one point and that is that we are an independent country, nation, and government. Today we are actually paying for our independence. The West's pressures, plots, and attacks against us are happening because today we want to stand on our own two feet and become economically self-sufficient, contrary to the past. The West's fear is that we want to implement Islamic shariah in our country and to rid ourselves of the pro-Western culture that is a legacy of colonialism. If we are now able to stand on our feet despite all the foreign pressures to weaken us, it is because we enjoy the people's support.
