"The wall put between the RP and the people will be removed much more easier from now on," Erdogan said. After his victory in the Istanbul mayoral race, the biggest metropolitan center in Turkey with a population of 10 million, Erdogan held a press conference. He said that the 14,627 ballot boxes that have been counted showed that his RP received 913,580 votes or 25.84 percent of the total vote in Sunday's elections. "The people will witness the practices of the RP and will run to a bright future with us," he said. He also claimed that the "mentality of RP which has been a minority so far, will be a majority in Turkey." The RP's sweeping local elections victory and its new mayor for Istanbul worried many over what the future would bring. A statue of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern secular Turkey, stands in historic Taksim Square. But Erdogan declared Tuesday: "I will build a mosque in Taksim." During his election campaign, Erdogan promised to invite Pierre Cardin to arrange a women's fashion show for Islamic-style dressing. He also said he would close Istanbul's brothels. The anti-Western and anti-Israeli RP, which also won many borough representative races in Istanbul, has caused concern among Western-educated Turks. It also has women worrying whether they would be forced to wear the chador (head-to-toe black Islamic garb). Beyoglu, Istanbul's picturesque and cosmopolitan district, is threatened with the closure of its bars, amusement places and brothels. And there may be no more new year's celebrations at Beyoglu. "That's a Christian tradition," says Beyoglu borough representative-elect Nusret Bayraktar, "we cannot allow a prophet's birthday to be celebrated with drinking, gambling and prostitution." Intellectual Turks, upper middle class people, minorities and foreigners who form the mosaic of this city and meet in the melting pot of Beyoglu say a new, unwelcome era has dawned on Istanbul. Although the new fundamentalist mayor as well as his district colleagues promised a better Istanbul in their post-election statements, the intelligentsia is not convinced. The resurgence of women in Islamic dress with heads covered and religious bearded men wearing turbans worries followers of Kemal Ataturk, who adopted the Western dress code and declared Turkey a secular republic.
