Some countries have concluded wars through talks, while others have terminated them through war. Vietnam, after 30 years of fighting, finished its war through war. In Cambodia, Pol Pot and Khieu Samphan have also ended a war through war. The Khmer Rouge [KR] still nurtures the obsolete idea of terminating war through war, by which it has previously succeeded. This being the case, it does not want to hold talks to end the war. Ignorant individuals-cum-politicians that a party picked up from a "rubbish bin" claim that peace can only be achieved if the Khmer Rouge is included in the Royal Government. We are still optimistic, however, that "if the war is to be terminated," the war must be fought. Negotiations should not be held at any rate, because holding negotiations is tantamount to handing over a sword to the Khmer Rouge. The policy of "negotiating" with the Khmer Rouge could once again become a "policy of fleeing the country." Those siding with the Khmer Rouge must go and stay with them. The Kingdom of Cambodia will not surrender to the Khmer Rouge, come hell or high water.
