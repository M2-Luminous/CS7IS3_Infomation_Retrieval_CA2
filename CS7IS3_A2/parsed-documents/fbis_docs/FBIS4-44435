Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps Attacks On the night of 5 January, a train headed from Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province to Hefei in Anhui Province entered Guzhen near Bengbu at high speed. Its markings showed it to be a military train that had to be given the right of way. Just then, the people's armed police escorting the train discovered that something was wrong up ahead. Two hundred people had suddenly appeared from out of nowhere, most of them young and strong lads. Each of them seemed to have been trained well. Within a very short time they took control of the military train. Carrying weapons, they engaged the people's armed police train escorts in a fire fight. These "train robbers" were completely fearless amidst the intense sound of rifle fire. While fighting, they organized others to haul away from the train light industrial products, household electrical appliances, motorcycles, etc. on trucks and horse carts. The fire fight continued until 5:00 the next morning. Surprisingly, the people's armed police were unable to quell the disorderly band. The fight continued until the Bengbu garrison army received word and hurried to the scene where it encircled the gang and shouted in a loud voice: "Anyone who does not put his hands up will be shot on the spot!" After brief hand-to-hand combat, the army gained control of the situation. Only during the interrogation of the captured train robbers was it found that they were retired servicemen! These retired servicemen and nearby villagers had long been eyeing the military trains that passed through the area. They carried out this robbery only after careful planning. After the event, it was learned from the Anhui Military Region that six cars of freight had been stolen, the losses running to more than 1.8 million yuan. Three people's armed police had been killed, and 11 demobilized servicemen, who had taken part in the robbery, had also been killed. Now the authorities are worried because these demobilized servicemen are not just a gang of desperadoes. In the winter of 1992 they organized the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps consisting of more than 400 men divided into four groups for the purpose of intercepting military and civilian freight trains. They are active along railroad lines in Henan and Anhui provinces, and they have built temporary warehouses in mountainous areas along railroad lines. Each time they strike, they have a small contingent guard the base camp. Retired Servicemen Add an Element of Social Instability These demobilized servicemen were once members of a favored group who have sunk into brigandage. Why did such a tremendous change occur? Official data show that more and more PLA personnel cannot be placed following discharge. In 1993 alone, 500,000 people retired or were demobilized. This was the largest year for discharges since Deng Xiaoping decided on a 5 million force reduction in 1985. This retired army of 500,000, in addition to the number from previous years, produces no small pressure. An official in the Beijing Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau said with heavy heart that given the current city and countryside employment difficulties, there is simply no way to place them. This adds an "element of instability" to society. This is truly the case. By regulation, soldiers may return to the place at which they entered service, but the government is not responsible for providing them jobs. Many peasant lads who joined the armed forces to escape from farming find themselves back in their hometown "repairing the earth," so naturally they are unhappy. The term "self-salvation" in the name of the demobilized serviceman organization that robbed military trains, the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" should be underlined. The local authorities are very concerned about this nasty case that has not yet been revealed in the media, fearing that "a single spark can light a prairie fire." Reportedly, the Anhui and Henan military sub-districts have assigned two battalions to work with the people's armed police on an investigation. They have issued a final ultimatum: All members of the "Anhui-Henan Railroad Self-Salvation Commando Corps" must surrender their weapons and pilfered goods to the nearest garrison army or public security unit before 20 January. Those who fail to turn themselves in by that time, or who continue nefarious activities, shall be strictly punished according to law. Positively no mercy will be shown. Retired Deputy Commander Also Takes Party One should not suppose that only ordinary soldiers take part in "self-salvation." Actually, military officers are involved. On 2 January, a train carrying military cargo from Guangzhou to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, was completely looted and set afire by more than 160 local demobilized servicemen near Ziyang, more than 100 kilometers from Chengdu. The Chengdu Military District dispatched a battalion of quick reaction troops to the scene. More than 140 demobilized servicemen were arrested, and 21 who refused to hand over their weapons and surrender were killed. Astonishingly, interrogation found that the leader of the demobilized servicemen, a certain Zhou, had been deputy commander of the Zibo Municipal Garrison District in the Shandong Provincial Military District, holding the rank of lieutenant colonel. Zhou had been ordered to retire from military service and urged to resign from the Party in the autumn of 1992 for complicity in smuggling and corruption. After retirement, he become a section chief in the Ziyang County government. In former years, when a military officer transferred to a government organization in civilian life, he retained his former rank, salary, and special benefits. Nowadays, however, when government agencies everywhere have too many personnel, military officers have also become a burden that everyone pushes and shoves around. Since he had a lackluster military career, naturally Zhou had no standing. Disgruntled, he simply gathered together some colleagues from the old days for "self-salvation," styling himself as the "commander." Since disturbances organized by military personnel are more threatening than those organized by workers, peasants, or students, the Chinese Communists have resorted to strict repressive measures regarding this "element of instability." Reportedly, in the wake of the 2 January train robbery incident, Ziyang County and Neijiang Prefecture set up a special court, which quickly and severely tried and sentenced to death seven of the ringleaders. "Serious Situation" on Nine Railroad Trunklines Nevertheless, the "quick and severe" sentencing to death of a number of ringleaders cannot solve the problem. Reportedly, the PLA is to cut 250,000 personnel. If so, tens of thousands of servicemen will take off their uniforms during the next two years to become individuals in the great army of the retired. They become another group that does not fit into the frenzied world of "everyone doing business." In fact, "highwaymen" have become a plague on the mainland. The following figures illustrate the problem: During the second half of December 1993, the railroads termed the situation as "serious" on nine trunk line railroads and "fairly serious" on 35 branch line railroads. The nine trunk lines named as having a "serious situation" were the Beijing-Baotou, Xiangyang-Chongqing, Sichuan-Guizhou, Chengdu-Kunming, Lanzhou-Qinghai, Xinjiang-Taiyuan, Guizhou-Kunming, Lanzhou-Xinjiang, and Longhai lines
