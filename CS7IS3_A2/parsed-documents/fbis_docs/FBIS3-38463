Gianfranco Fini feigned surprise: "What meeting? There was no meeting." There are strong rumors that the MSI [Italian Social Movement] secretary and National Alliance coordinator took advantage of Berlusconi's presence in Rome to meet with the Forza Italia leader. "That is untrue. When we do have a meeting with him, it will be official." [Ventura] Very well. What is certain, however, is that [Northern League Secretary] Bossi said: "Either with us or with the fascists." [Fini] That shows he is scared. He is very well aware that his leadership will collapse if he reaches agreements with other forces. I believe he is terrified of Berlusconi's involvement, and he has sent him an ultimatum with the attitude of someone who wants not to form an alliance but to carry out an annexation. [Ventura] There is a preclusion against you. [Fini] We asked Bossi to explain to us whether or not he considers national unity a good thing. Not only has he not replied, but he has not progressed beyond his anti-fascist anathema; that is, a stance that not even the left identifies with now. [Ventura] There is less and less time in which to reach an agreement. [Fini] Bossi will realize this on 27 March. We will certainly not remain passive. We will have our own candidates in the north, and Bossi will realize that he does not enjoy hegemony in the north at all. Obviously, he will not receive a single vote in the center and south, which will inevitably confine him to the role of a regional leader. For the present! Because in a while he may not even be a leader in the north. [Ventura] The compactness of the anti-left alliance is at stake. [Fini] Bossi is shouldering a huge responsibility, and is doing so because he either cannot or will not resolve the real issue. Which is not fascist ideology but national unity. I do not believe that Berlusconi and the centrists are willing to be treated like underlings in the north or to submit to vetoes in the south. [Ventura] What will you do, unless a miracle occurs? [Fini] We will field candidates in all the single-candidate constituencies throughout Italy. I will not form pacts, at least not within a national political context; otherwise, I would be lending strength to the League's theory of the two or three Italy's. [Ventura] Is it possible to imagine a pact with Berlusconi but not with the League? [Fini] Maybe, yes, if there is an agreement on programs. It remains to be seen how Berlusconi will respond to the ultimatum. Bossi is trying to play Russian roulette. [Ventura] What about the agreement between Berlusconi and the neocentrists? [Fini] I read the communique, and I consider the reference to the absence of preclusions a good thing: They have the feeling that Bossi wants them to serve his interests in the north and to consign them to defeat in the south. [Ventura] Is it possible to resolve the split over whom to put forward for the premiership? [Fini] Bossi cannot say who it should be. If he accepts an alliance, he is automatically placing himself in a subordinate position with respect to whomever he may put forward. That would be the beginning of his downfall. If he stops shouting and starts reasoning, he will lose his support. For my part, I am standing aside. I am not a candidate or even a potential candidate. The only person capable of commanding support in the north, and in the south, is Berlusconi. Not Bossi -- and not only because of his language and behavior, but also because, as I have said, he is a regional leader. [Ventura] Could you name some of your candidates? [Fini] I do not like this candidate game. It is much more important to field candidates who are well established in their own areas -- perhaps supported by trade, business, and agricultural organizations -- than to field 20 outgoing deputies of parties that no longer exist, or famous names that served as enticements under the proportional system. I am not seeking names for their own sake. [Ventura] Has [world diving record holder] Enzo Majorca said yes? [Fini] I heard about Majorca through IL GIORNALE, I made inquiries, and I was told that talks are going on. [Ventura] Would you give us an election forecast [Fini] I am very confident. Our success in Catania shows that I am not deluding myself. If we project that result to the level of the contest in the single-candidate constituencies, the figures would secure victory for us in every constituency. Catania is not Italy, but nevertheless....
