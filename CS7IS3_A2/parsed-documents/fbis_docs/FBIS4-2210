Foreign Ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin told a press conference that Wei, detained since last Friday, "has broken the law and must be prosecuted." "These people are outsiders and are cut off from the Chinese reality," he said of Wei and other pro-democracy agitators. The arrest of Wei was "a small problem that should not be exaggerated," Wu said. "There are people in jail anywhere in the world. In China, this is so because they have broken the law," he said, adding: "There is no universal penal code." Wei was released on parole in September, six months short of a 15-year prison term for his "counter-revolutionary" role in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement. [passage omitted] Foreign ministry spokesman Wu derided suggestions that the government was "persecuting" dissidents. "It is a completely groundless accusation," he said. "For China, stability is essential for economic development and it is necessary to uphold order." The row over Wei and other dissidents comes in the runup to the decision by President Bill Clinton, scheduled in June, to renew most-favoured-nation status for Chinese goods to the US market, a benefit estimated to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in customs dues.
