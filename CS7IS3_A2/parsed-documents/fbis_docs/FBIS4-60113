[Isma'il] [passage omitted] As for the civilian tasks of the police, since they arrived, the police assumed their duties in a normal way in the area. In Jericho, they assumed their full duties to ensure security and safety and maintain order. Things here are proceeding normally and the police are running the affairs according to their program. [Husayn] You are aware that many settlers reside in the Jericho area and will be subject to Palestinian police protection. Do you think they might cause any trouble for the Palestinian police forces? [Isma'il] Since the beginning we have been working hard to avoid trouble with the settlers and with religious people in particular. As you know, they have a small synagogue here in Jericho, and agreements stipulate that religious people can visit the synagogue once a week or at any time they like on the condition that they be unarmed. They still enter the synagogue with their arms and refuse to abide by the agreement, causing trouble and problems for us; and they pass through the city, too. We are trying hard to overcome the problems with the Israeli side through the liaison committee. We are still suffering from this problem because the religious settlers are persisting in these acts in a provocative way. [Husayn] Regarding Palestinian people visiting Jerusalem, Israel imposes a special system according to which advance permits must be obtained. Does this apply to the Jericho residents, or has the situation changed? [Isma'il] The Israeli stand on Jericho residents visiting Jerusalem has not changed; we have a problem here. We discussed the matter with the Israeli side but the Israeli stance has not changed. They insist that any one wanting to visit Jerusalem must have a permit, but we told them that Jerusalem is part of the Palestinian land. We will visit Jerusalem soon, God willing, and we are working hard to lift the blockade and rescind the Israelis' measures concerning Jerusalem. [Husayn] Another question, regarding preparations to receive President Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] in Jericho, the headquarters of the transitional self-rule authority. [Isma'il] Here in Jericho we are anxiously waiting for his arrival. All our people in the West bank and Gaza Strip (?look forward) to President Yasir 'Arafat's arrival. We are preparing for his arrival but the date is left for the president to decide on. [passage omitted] [Husayn] Concerning the supervision of traffic to and from Jericho over the Allenby Bridge and the crossing between Jericho and Gaza Strip, what is the position of the Palestinian police forces? [Isma'il] The Israeli side is preparing the necessary installations for the three crossings, in accordance with the agreement, and will soon complete building the terminals. After that we will begin to implement all the measures concerning traffic at the crossings according to the provisions of the agreement. [passage omitted]
