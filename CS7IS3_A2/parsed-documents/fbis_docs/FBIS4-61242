Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, by A. Leksina on 30 April; place not given: "`The Treaty Could Ease the Situation'"] [Text] As reported, M.Sh. Shaymiyev, president of Tatarstan, left immediately following completion of the session of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Tatarstan for Moscow to take part in the work of the Federation Council and to sign the Social Accord Treaty. The president returned to Kazan late in the evening of 29 April and the following day granted an interview to correspondents of republic newspapers. [Leksina] Mintimer Sharipovich, many different declarations have been adopted as of late, but our problems and misfortunes remain with us, as before. In signing the Social Accord Treaty were you not hoping that it could fundamentally change the situation on the difficult path of political and economic reforms? [Shaymiyev] No, I was not. Neither this nor any other document, however carefully it has been drawn up, should be overestimated. But this treaty has a number of clauses whose practical embodiment could ease the situation and forestall many surprises. It was worth taking part in its signing if only, as it says, to ensure that no force be used in the solution of problems that arise and that in the already troubled times demands for early elections and the creation of various military formations not arise. You know my position, I have always advocated accord, and I accept no other way. The birth of this document, however, was caused by the fact that certain political forces have after the adoption of the constitution continued to make demands that go beyond the framework of the constitution, which, of course, has not contributed to the desired stabilization. Accord, however, which I hope will be achieved, should help us. [Leksina] But you signed the treaty with amendments.... [Shaymiyev] Yes, there were many criticisms. They were cogent and presented officially, which is particularly important. After all, a conciliation commission, to which it will always be possible to appeal, should the need arise, will be formed. I insisted in Moscow at the meeting of heads of the republics on the removal of a number of provisions which could evoke actions the opposite of accord. I note with satisfaction that two-thirds of our observations were adopted. The value of the document that was signed lies, further, in the fact that it contains many positions concerning the rights of the individual and whole peoples. The need for support even for small diasporas in their aspiration to knowledge of the culture of their people and development of the language is emphasized. Any support-- both material and moral--is important here. [Leksina] I would like to know whether the Tatar diaspora of some region sought support from you specifically. [Shaymiyev] There are many such appeals. Specifically, the Samara diaspora had asked that I lend some assistance in the organization of a Tatar newspaper and put in a good word, so to speak, with the local authorities. I met in Moscow this time with K. Titov, head of the administration of Samara Oblast. We talked about a newspaper. The Tatar people are greatly attracted to their own national culture, however fate has scattered them. We are asked frequently not only to send textbooks and books in Tatar but also to organize tours by performing artistes. This is understandable, such meetings are spiritually enriching to both sides. [Leksina] We know that you met in Moscow with Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin. [Shaymiyev] We thought about how to "force" the Russian-Tatar treaty to function with maximum efficiency and to ensure that a variety of bureaucrats not impede us en route to its realization. We will set up a commission for coordinated supervision, and the progress of fulfillment of the treaty obligations will be examined at the highest level several times a year. The question of how to strengthen Tatarstan's economic independence within the framework of the agreement that has already been signed was broached also. It is not so much a question of Russia's position here as of the obstacles we are creating for ourselves. Although some people continue to blame Russia for all the misfortunes. This was seen also during discussion of the budget at the last session. Shaymiyev and Yeltsin shaking hands is the reason for the deepening of our problems, it was said. This is not the case, of course. Moreover, had there not been real support on the part of Russia, the situation would possibly be considerably worse. Yes, we are an industrial republic with giant enterprises. It is good when these enterprises are operating continuously. When they are standing idle, however, it is a disaster. Those who share it out know that we are today receiving from the federal budget for current expenditure more than we are paying in. For the spring operations alone we obtained a soft loan of R60 billion. This is almost 10 times more than our payments. So I stress once again that much will depend on ourselves. In order to move forward we must have a precise program fine-tuned in all respects. And perhaps not one but two or three radical economic reform programs. It would be no great misfortune were they to differ from one another fundamentally--we would fish out what was rational. May these programs unite several groups of authors--ours and "outsiders'." The latter should not be dismissed, for great experience of the creation of various programs has after all been accumulated in the country. It is essential to speed up the birth of such a program, there is no doubt about this. In the present economic situation, however, we are putting the emphasis as yet only on measures of social protection. [Leksina] As we know, in the morning you visited Kazan's markets. Fairs have been established there now. So, then, have our granaries not been depleted? [Shaymiyev] No. The markets are well stocked. But it is important, in addition, that there be consumer demand, and many people's income has, unfortunately, declined. I spoke with very many people on this occasion, for hours, about everything. About the impending summer season, for example. The summer residents' concern is understandable--will the fares on suburban routes be reduced, as was the case last year and the year before. There will be a 50 percent reduction on the buses. They asked that thought be given to those who get to their country cottages by river. We will give it some thought. [Leksina] But there are the suburban electric trains.... [Shaymiyev] I had a special talk about these with Boris Nikolayevich. It is a general problem. Thus it was decided to cover from the federal budget the reduction in fares for the summer period on suburban railroad transport. Only on weekends and holidays, it is true. [Leksina] You were gone from the republic for more than a week. The reports in this time surely carried much that is new from the spring fields? [Shaymiyev] The pace of work is, on the whole, higher than last year, and no particular surprises are anticipated, I believe. It will be more difficult, perhaps, only for the areas that had a protracted wet fall. The farms of the southeast of the republic. [Leksina] The final question, Mintimer Sharipovich. You were taking part in the Federation Council for the first time. What was your impression? [Shaymiyev] I believe that it is as yet making inadequate use of its constitutional possibilities and that this chamber has not yet (since December!) formed its own handwriting. Use needs to be made of the council's legislative initiative for the resolution of major strategic problems. [Leksina] Thank you for the interview. We wish you a good rest from the Moscow workload during the May Day holiday.
