Applications were accepted 1-10 March, and over 10 trading firms submitted applications. All these trading firms meet the requirements to apply. For example, applying trading firms "must be corporations (including those set up in Japan but affiliated with foreign companies) with capital of over 100 million yen and must have experience trading in rice and wheat." However, based on the judgment that, "when viewed from such standpoints as credibility and experience in actual trade, these firms seem to be unqualified" (as stated by the Import Division), the Food Agency has rejected these applications. When applications were made, no standards for approval were made public. However, all of the trading firms were notified by 31 March, with each individual firm given reasons for the disapproval of the registration. Trading firms have expressed dissatisfaction with the decision, saying that "it may somehow lead to dango [bid-rigging]."
