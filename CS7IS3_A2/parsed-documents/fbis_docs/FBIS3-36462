Several of the weapons were discovered with the suspects, while the rest have yet to be found, according to the Public Communications Center of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs. Specialists in the Interior Ministry still consider Army units a stable "source of supply" of weapons to criminal elements. Military personnel fairly often make off with guns and ammunition in order to earn some extra money. In 1993, 6430 weapons were illegally "transferred" into criminal hands, twice as much as the corresponding 1992 figure. Every third stolen weapon is from the Army. Deputy Chief of the law and order department's investigative section Leonid Turchin says he is "astonished" by the fact that unit and regiment commanders cannot ensure the safekeeping of weapons and explosives, even when they are locked up in depots, located in military bases and surrounded by high fences and barbed wire.
