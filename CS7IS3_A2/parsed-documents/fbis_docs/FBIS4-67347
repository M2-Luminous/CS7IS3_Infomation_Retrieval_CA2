The two-year project involves a pollution study and aims to work out new charges for offenders, said Lu Xinyuan, deputy director of Nepa's supervision and development department. It is being financed by a $1 million loan from the World Bank and 5 million yuan ($600,000) from central and provincial governments. All enterprises are to be taxed for emitting sulphur dioxide before the end of the year and they will have to pay for discharging solid waste next year. Lu said the measures would help curb the spread of acid rain which is caused by sulphur dioxide. Acid rain damages crops, forests and buildings and costs China an estimated 16 billion yuan ($2 billion) a year. It is currently spreading from Southwest to East China, the official said. The country first adopted pollution charges in the late 70's. And 30 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities have levied charges on 113 pollutants. More than 200,000 enterprises nationwide have paid a total of 18 billion yuan ($2 billion) in the past 15 years. Last year, they paid 2.7 billion yuan ($310 million) -- more than lO times the figure in the late 70's. The charges have been used to subsidize the control of key polluted areas. And they have covered 6 per cent of the country's total spending on the control of industrial pollution. Studies into the uses of pollution charges in 24 large and medium-sized cities showed 796 million yuan ($139 million at the old exchange rate) had been levied on 3,901 enterprises in seven years. This cash, plus government investment, funded the construction of more than 7,000 pollution-control projects nationwide. They were designed to treat 794 million tons of waste water and 199.1 billion cubic metres of waste gas a year.
