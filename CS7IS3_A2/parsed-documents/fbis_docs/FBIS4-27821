The analyst says: Recently, the Kim Yong-sam group arrested students in Kwangju on charge of the violation of "the National Security Law", after they opened photo exhibitions with several dozen pictures showing the reality of the North at Chonnam and Choson campuses in the period of the inaugural ceremony of the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils. This was another fascist violence of the "civilian" dictators. Their suppression of patriotic students who did a good thing for national unity and reunification fully revealed their true color of traitors who want neither unity nor reunification. Photo exhibitions on the North had taken place even under the preceding military dictatorship in South Korea as part of "the movement for gaining a correct knowledge of the North." While talking about "reform" and "opening," the Kim Yong-sam group is criminalizing the opening of such exhibitions. This is, indeed, a self-contradiction. The fact shows that "reform" and "opening" advertized by the Kim Yong-sam group are nothing but a camouflage for deceiving the people and that South Korea is a zone of most brutal human rights violation and closed society of fascist dictatorship without an equal in the world. The Kim Yong-sam fascist group must clearly see the situation, scrap "the National Security Law" and release the illegally arrested patriotic students.
