FBIS4-14045 "drnes080_l_94003" FBIS-NES-94-080 Daily Report 25 Apr 1994 ISRAEL Peres: No Golan Settlements To Remain After Land Ceded Peres: No Golan Settlements To Remain After Land Ceded TA2504161694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew 1400 GMT 25 Apr 94 TA2504161694 Tel Aviv IDF Radio Hebrew BFN [Report by Tamar Asalem] [Text] Knesset Member [MK] Avi Yehezqel asserted at today's meeting of the Labor caucus that two men are not equals among equals in the government and the faction. He was naturally referring to the prime minister and the foreign minister, who are steering the peace negotiations but keeping the faction in the dark. In response, Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres delivered an extended political review. The faction members' questions focused on two issues: the conclusion of negotiations and the prime minister's remarks at a United Kibbutzim Movement forum concerning the evacuation of Golan Heights settlements. On the first issue, Peres repeated the remarks he made yesterday at the cabinet meeting: [Begin Peres recording] There are no disagreements between Yitzhaq [Rabin] and me. We both believe the negotiations should be concluded. They could be dragged out through eternity, but I think -- and that is the opinion of our colleagues in Cairo, too -- that we should assemble all the outstanding issues in one cluster and resolve them in one fell swoop this coming weekend. [end recording] Peres added that it had been agreed that only two issues will be left for Rabin's and 'Arafat's ruling: the size of Jericho, which the Palestinians want to be 100 square kilometers and Israel will agree to about 60 only; and the matter of the Palestinian policeman on the bridge. Peres stressed that Israel does not wish to leave any unresolved issues. The reports I receive indicate that the other side is likewise interested in wrapping the thing up, Peres said. [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 25 April adds that "addressing the Labor caucus, Shim'on Peres said that the reports he received from Cairo today reflect a certain optimism. He said that after the prime minister returns from Russia, all the finalized issues will have to be revisited and decisions will have to be made on the outstanding issues, such as the judicial procedures and the air and sea space."] As for rumors about disagreements between the foreign minister and the prime minister, Peres clarified that they were totally baseless. Peres was forced to parry another attack by faction members, including MK's Avigdor Qahalani and Eli Goldschmidt from the Golan Heights lobby, over the prime minister's remarks about settlement evacuation made at the United Kibbutzim Movement forum. [Begin Peres recording] Want peace? There is not a single person who does not realize that peace entails a deep and painful change in the Golan Heights. Whoever is ready for a territorial compromise understands that if we cede territory, our settlements will not remain there. The settlements themselves are not going to want to remain. [end recording] It will be noted that some faction members lauded the prime minister's remarks. Peres, however, asked the forum to refrain from discussing the issue while the prime minister is abroad.
