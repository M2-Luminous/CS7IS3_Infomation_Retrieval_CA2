Taking only Fudan University, "the top-ranking university south of the Changjiang," as example: During the entire 1980's, this university hired 1,442 new young teachers, of whom 402 have by now again left the university. Among these, 384 went abroad for further studies, and 28 [sic!] transferred domestically to other positions with better salary and welfare conditions. The total number of young teachers that left the university accounted for 28.2.percent of those newly higher during the corresponding period. The well-known International Journalism Institute of the said university's Department of Journalism had been famous in China and abroad for its teachers, who, all in the prime of their lives, had displayed outstanding talent. However, in the short space of a few years, they were gone, leaving an empty place where only one lonely teacher remains, so that many subjects can no longer be taught. A responsible staff of the personnel department told this reporter that the university is now loosing about 200 teachers every year. An analysis of these shows that by age groups most are middle-aged and young, by specializations most are teachers of presently crucial subjects and subjects with practical applications, and as to their quality, most are outstanding teachers proficient in key subjects. The loss of all these teachers is indeed having an ever more evident adverse effect on the quality of instructions. During the interviews and investigations, this reporter found out that because many teachers could make their own arrangements about time, they decided on a more practical way out, namely taking up concurrent jobs. Concurrent jobs are of various different patterns: some jobs require fixed attendances so many times a week, in some cases offices are set up at home, while remuneration is by salary, by pieces, or by time, and incomes vary. According to incomplete statistics, among teachers aged below 40 in Shanghai institutions of higher learning, 40 percent have concurrent jobs; the purpose of these is two-fold, namely: first, to improve the economic situation, and second, to achieve a certain self-worth. If these two tracks should collide at any time, the decision in eight, nine out of ten times is "better quit and go elsewhere." These people constitute an unsteady element among university teachers and are of a proportion that must not be ignored. In the first half of 1993, an outstanding young teacher in the physics department of Fudan University was faced with an uneven scale, to weigh between a 200 yuan and a 2,000 yuan income, and he chose the latter. He abandoned his speciality and abruptly flung himself into the ocean of commercial affairs, to become a salesman, roaming all over the country. For a time this made big waves in society, but whether he was praised or berated for it, the fact remains that he was gone. The specific places to which these Shanghai college and university teachers are actually moving are the "three capital" enterprises, and the financial, banking, tax, industrial, and commercial sectors, where they vie with each other for positions. This shows that individual income is the most weighty argument that determines the moves of the teachers. Another one is: going abroad for further studies. In the last two years the frenzy for the TOEFL [Test of English as a Foreign Language] has somewhat cooled down, but going abroad is still a major aim that college and university teachers, especially the younger ones, aspire to, and they now begin to extend the scope of their destinations for studying abroad beyond the United States to Singapore and other small countries. There is also a new trend in this rush to go abroad, when they formerly went abroad it was purely to pursue studies, but now many directly go to take up employment. According to statistics, for almost half of those who go abroad on state stipend or at own expense it is like in the old verse "the yellow-crane flies off, never to return." Even among those college and university teachers that go abroad on scholarly exchanges or scholarly cooperative activities, many settle down in the foreign countries. The great loss of college and university teachers actually is due to complex and manifold reasons. When college and university teachers in 116 institutions were questioned, "what is the main reason for your decision to quit?" the answers were, in this order: "unsatisfactory social environment," "no prospects for advancement in sight," "poor living conditions and family considerations," etc. One teacher expressed it this way: The reason why our group of people endured in poverty is none other than the idea of making a contribution to instruction and research. We make no high demands, maintaining a somewhat higher than middle level in society and having a relatively quiet environment for study and private life, that is all. If these demands cannot be met with, we cannot see any value in our profession and should make a change. However, when it really comes to change the old habitat, there is much inner conflict and pain; discarding 20-odd years of work is like cutting off a "first love." There was a certain Li, a young teacher of modern literature at a certain teachers training college in Shanghai. As an excellent graduate, he was kept on by the college, and for a time he was happy and proud to wear the red college badge. However, we don't know when it started, but the color and lustre of the badge faded. Last year, he took his family back to the countryside. There, some puny, average-grade former schoolmates of his were spending money 600 yuan at a time, visiting sing-song places and dance halls, and there again spending lots of money, all that left this highly talented man speechless with surprise and suddenly feeling that he cannot associate with them anymore. This matter really stirred him up inwardly, although he was ordinarily of a quiet disposition. Formerly, he lived the quiet life of a man devoted to studies, who after class would discuss the present state of literature with groups of students, obsessed with literature, and in fact he was extremely happy. However, now his frame of mind is quite different. If he could, he would warn youngsters who are full of poetic sentiment and picturesque ideas that literature cannot take the place of life, but may only be an embellishment of life. Look at yourself, at your low status of literary types within the system, when will you ever amount to anything in the pecking order according to qualifications. Finally, this teacher who is long over the age of 30, who had delved into the books and passed the examination of graduate student at another university, decided to change his profession. An old professor of economics at a famous university had formerly always thought it shameful to talk of money, but has recently had good reason to worry about money. He had some manuscripts on his specialty, which were the fruit of many years' painstaking labor, and which he wanted to present to the university as his valuable gift on retirement. However, since they were mostly on theory and too highbrow to be popular, the publishing company told him: either you underwrite the sale of 5,000 copies, or contribute 10,000 yuan to the expenses. This sum is not a small amount for a teacher who has been poor all his life, and was completely beyond the old teacher's means. Later, a very farsighted industrialist generously came to the rescue at the last moment. After this, the professor was painfully regretting: "If I would be 20 years younger, I would also move out."
