But I would like to say simply that people must stop saying that we do not have a program. I think we did well because we had courage. We had the courage to try to put forward ideas that are not very popular today and that are not winners -- that is to say, the idea of a federal Europe is not something that excites people. The idea that the problem of immigration is not one to be tackled by repression is not a very popular thing either. [end recording] [passage omitted]
