Rebuilding and Reorganizing the Armed Forces Rebuilding and reorganizing the Armed Forces is one of the primary issues. The Armed Forces are directly affiliated with the Government. No military or paramilitary force belonging to any other side shall be formed. The general plan to reform, merge, reconstruct, and reorganize the Armed Forces will be prepared in accordance with the following principles: 1. The Yemeni Armed Forces are defense forces responsible for protecting the Yemeni Republic's borders, waters, and air space, and to defend national sovereignty. 2. The Defense Ministry's budget must be controlled to enable it to play its role in accordance with the requirements of defending the Yemeni Republic. 3. The size of the Armed Forces will be confined to three arms: land, sea, and air. No force will be allowed to exist and no units will be allowed to be formed in contravention of that and outside the three aforementioned arms. 4. The required formations of the Armed Forces, which will be suitable to the operations theater, will be defined in accordance with what the competent authorities see fit within the conditions and in accordance with requirements of defending the sovereignty and independence of the Yemeni Republic. 5.

Deploying units at border areas. B. Protecting sites of economic activities for operating companies. C. Reorganizing and redeploying the rest of the units in the inland regions according to needs and to function as a reserve.

The control agencies should have strong, qualified, and neutral elements that can withstand all pressures and any attempts that obstructs their duties or try to use them for political purposes or favoritism. 2 - 8 Civil Service Reform Civil service reforms must be subject to a thorough study of the current situation, including regulations, practical measures, and measuring performance.

Also, regulations and practical measures should be reformulated in line with the following: A. Simplicity and clarity of regulations to facilitate their understanding and implementation. B. A precise and sound definition of duties, responsibilities, and powers. C. Laying constant foundations to delegate powers on all central and local levels. D.

Forming a general civil service organization instead of a ministry. This will be affiliated with the cabinet. Economy and Financial Organization The failure to complete the structure of the Yemeni state has directly affected economic and financial conditions. One of the most obvious effects of the absence of the unity of the state's political establishment is that the country has been left without a clear financial and economic policy to organize this vital sector. Clear economic policy has been missing since the first day of our experiment in unity, despite the fact that our declared policy was economic freedom. However, this policy was not been consummated to allow the economy to be built within its framework. Trouble and concern grew and anarchy displaced organization. With the absence of political unity and decisive measures, general expenditure became a source of increasing anarchy that was reflected in the national currency and led to the deterioration in the rial's purchasing power. It led to a disruption in productive economic activities such as agriculture and industry. Prices soared and the real value of people's income dropped because of the deterioration of the national currency. All this was in addition to the rampant deficit in the general budget. Therefore, the economic reform process, within the policy of economic freedom and through a number of urgent measures to stop the deterioration, becomes very important. Based on all this and in order to come up with an integrated policy that will be combined and completed within a process of reforming the entire system of government, the following steps should be taken: 1. Abiding by a general state budget that specifies expenditures and revenues and seeks to end the growing deficit resulting from the huge gap between expenditures and revenues. This can be achieved by emphasizing increasing revenues and curtailing and organizing expenditures, within the limits of what is needed; 2. Following balanced development plans and annual investment programs to guarantee balanced economic and social development; 3. Adjusting the monetary system to stop the deterioration of the national currency and activating the role of the Central Bank and organizing its functions in a way that does not run counter to the functions of the commercial banks; also, taking the necessary and practical measures to protect the currency, including the issuing of the new currency that was agreed upon, regulating money exchangers' activities, and fighting currency counterfeiting; 4. Fighting corruption, bribes, and administrative negligence and uncovering smugglers of goods, commodities, weapons, and drugs and punishing them in accordance with the valid laws; 5. Implementing the decisions pertaining to the establishment of a free zone in Aden; executive measures must begin immediately and all measures must be completed by the end of this year; 6. Organizing and supervising the activity of public institutions and public companies, especially activity that affects the foreign currency that may be used to finance activities that exhaust the economy; 7. Making a quick decision about which of the raw materials needed for basic national industries, and the resources needed in agriculture, fisheries, and other production activities, are to be treated the same way as foodstuffs financed by the Central Bank, in order to stop the increase in the price of these materials and the deterioration of this vital activity of the national economy. 4. Constitutional Amendment: As the Constitution is a document of great importance in our people's present and future life, the following should be observed: A. Abiding by the current Constitution until it is amended. B. In order to Implement the content of the accord document and to make the necessary Constitutional amendments, serious efforts should be exerted to carry out these Constitutional amendments within three to five months. A national committee consisting of ulema, parties to the Political Forces Dialogue, some specialists from Aden and Sanaa universities, and some social figures should be formed to draft Constitutional amendments, taking into account the fact that draft Constitutional amendments should not conflict with general principles and fundamentals, as well as the missions and powers of bodies and ways of their formation in the accord document of the Political Forces Dialogue. The committee will take full time to do its work within the fixed period. C. Reconsidering the overall parliamentary and local production system, particularly election by list in light of a scientific study of Yemeni and other human experiences. The election law will be reconsidered in light of the results of that study. 5. Implementation Mechanism: To ensure the implementation of this national document, which is aimed at correcting the course of unity and building a modern Yemeni state, a state of order and law, every national official and popular energy should be mobilized. Therefore, the following mechanism should be adopted: A. The government shall have full power and be free from interference in its work in order to allow it to carry out its duties. B. The government will draw up timetables to carry out specific duties within one month. C. Anything in the document requiring a Constitutional amendment should be observed as soon as the Constitutional amendments are approved. Some duties should also be prepared along with the preparation of the draft Constitutional amendments. An issue that does not require a Constitutional amendment will be carried out immediately. D. Measures by the government to implement the document and the policy statement should be taken publicly. E. A monthly news conference should be held to define progress in implementing the duties; a government spokesman will be appointed. 6. The Follow-Up Mechanism 1. The Political Forces Dialogue Committee shall follow up and supervise the implementation of the decisions enshrined in the accord document signed by the parties to the Political Forces Dialogue to build a modern Yemeni state. 2. Executive decisions will be made granting the committee the following: A. The right to obtain information from any source, particularly to the extent that it will help the committee carry out its duties. B. The right to have access to the media to propagate statements detailing progress in the implementation of the document, the obstacles hindering it, and those who may by obstructing it, whether individuals or bodies. C. The government shall make available to the committee its official and administrative capabilities to help it fulfill its functions. 7. The Security Arrangements and Circumstances Needed for Signing and Implementing the Agreement. A committee is to be formed from among the parties to the dialogue to work out security conditions for signing the document and guarantees for initiating implementation in coordination with the president and his deputy. The date shall be fixed in accordance with the agreed arrangements. Conclusion: The completion of such work must be the result of a powerful political will to engage in vigorous work and honor promises and obligations. The aim is to safeguard unity and protect the republic and our democratic choice and confirm our people's will to achieve their objectives--security, stability, and the affluence of the individual.
