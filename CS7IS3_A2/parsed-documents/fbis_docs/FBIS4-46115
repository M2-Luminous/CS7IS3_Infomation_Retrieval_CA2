FBIS4-46115 "jptot022__l94023" JPRS-TOT-94-022-L JPRS Terrorism FOUO 18 May 1994 LATIN AMERICA PERU MRTA Allegedly Protecting Foreign Drug `Firms' MRTA Allegedly Protecting Foreign Drug `Firms' PY2605182794 Lima EXPRESO in Spanish 18 May 94 p A11 PY2605182794 Lima EXPRESO Spanish BFN [Text] The terrorists who attacked an Army helicopter in Quebrada Pena Blanca (Chanchamayo) on 12 May may be members of an MRTA [Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement] column that protects some five "firms" of drug traffickers operating on the outskirts of the jungle in that region. This was asserted by Interior Ministry intelligence sources, according to which the terrorists allegedly come from San Luis de Shuaro. The terrorists belong to one of the MRTA columns that have lost their slight ideological tint, and are surviving as a mercenary group protecting a Mexican "firm" that is allegedly trying to grow poppy plants in the surroundings of Sanchirio, Alto Batinaki, Santa Herminia, and on the banks of the Paucartambo River near Villa Rica. This, however, is not the only organization of foreign drug traffickers: Colombian and Bolivian drug traffickers operate in the region in cahoots with Peruvian traffickers. Intelligence experts maintain that this MRTA column, and those located on the outskirts of the Satipo (Junin) and Oxapampa (Pasco) jungle, enjoy the compulsory help of peasant and indigenous communities, whose leaders and heads of family are forced, under threats of death, to cultivate coca leaf, marijuana, and poppies. They are also forced to produce washed cocaine paste, which provides the MRTA with a significant income. According to information obtained from peasants in Villa Rica, 500 kg of washed cocaine paste are shipped to Colombia each week. This represents an income per shipment for the terrorists of approximately $225,000, taking into account that the drugs are sold at $1,800 per kilo and the terrorists collect 25 percent of the total amount. As for the "political military" organization of that terrorist group, the analysts believe that the MRTA Central Regional Committee has lost its geographical domain. In other words, it no longer has the same control it used to exercise in Pasco and Junin, and only survives due to its link with drug traffickers. Another source of income is allegedly the protection fees the MRTA members charge merchants, businessmen, and passengers traveling through San Francisco, Esperanza, Miraflores, and Villa Rica in Oxapampa (Pasco).
