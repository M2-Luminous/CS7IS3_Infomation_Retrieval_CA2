President Karimov has taken with him to Japan more than ten projects of bilateral cooperation designed to lay the groundwork for new economic relations between the two countries. President Karimov is accompanied on the trip by Deputy Prime Minister Otkir Sultanov and Foreign Minister Saidmukhtar Saidkasymov. Under the Japanese diplomatic classification, the Uzbek president's visit falls under the heading of "official business" visits, and therefore the head of Uzbek state will be accommodated in a hotel and not in the official residence for top guests of the state. But this will not affect the level of reception in any other way. Karimov will hold talks with Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata on 19 May and will be received by Emperor Akihito. He will meet representatives of the Japanese business community. The two countries are expected to sign a joint document, although Tokyo, pressed for time, has been unable to prepare specific proposals for economic assistance to Tashkent. Karimov is due to spend the last part of his visit in the ancient Japanese capital of Kyoto, the "finishing point" of the Great Silk Road, which linked Europe with the Far East via Central Asia. The museums and temples of this ancient city keep exhibits which were brought by the merchants and pilgrims from what is now Uzbekistan more than 1500 years ago. The main objective of the visit is of course to establish business links and attract Japanese capital and investments. Last year, the volume of trade between the two countries amounted to a mere $30 million, mainly from trade in Uzbek cotton and natural gas in exchange for Japanese computers and equipment. Islam Karimov told journalists ahead of the visit that Tashkent has prepared at least a dozen projects aimed at expanding cooperation including in the field of ecological normalisation of the Aral Sea and the improvement of water supplies. Certain funds will be allocated for the purpose along the line of the Japanese governmental assistance to developing countries. Prospects for major private investments are less promising since Uzbekistan has not yet become a promising market for the Japanese companies, according to Japan's Charge d'Affaires Kozi Hino. The Japanese diplomat pointed to Uzbekistan's high taxes on foreign businesses and the absence of effective joint enterprises in Uzbekistan as the main obstacles. Business links are further impeded by the fact that Tashkent, unlike Alma Ata [Almaty], has not yet signed an agreement with the International Monetary Fund which conditions the signing on the introduction of tough restrictions on budget spending in Uzbekistan and a tougher control over the currency and financial system. Islam Karimov has already told Japanese journalists that he sees the building of an oil and gas pipelines across Kazakhstan and China to the Pacific coast as a priority in cooperation with Tokyo. Other plans include the building of a railway to China via Urumqi, and the building of a highway and a railway from Uzbekistan via Afghanistan to Pakistan's port of Karachi. Most of these initiatives appear romantic enough, but Tokyo does not conceal its interest in the gradual expansion of contacts with Uzbekistan, taking into account its important strategic location in Central Asia, which, according to Kozi Hino, Japan cannot ignore in the context of its continuating territorial dispute with Russia.
