It is a myth created by reactionary propaganda media, both in and outside of the United States, which dissolves in its own steam while maneuvers are made to discover ways to present a twisted image of Cuba to the world. The great majority of Cubans, more than 95 percent, who have migrated to the United States and other countries, have done so by legal means, or at least with the approval of the Cuban Government. The basic reasons for these migrations has to do with the economy, given that these people did not want to resist, together with their people, the difficulties that a small country has to go through if it wants to be free and sovereign in the face of opposition by an imperial power like the United States, which is also a very close neighbor. For 35 years, the Cuban people have resisted the hostility of successive U.S. Governments, which have launched all sorts of aggressions, both overt as well as covert, against Cuba for the declared purpose of overthrowing the revolutionary government, wiping out its will for independence, and inflicting Washington's political will on this small country. The evidence behind this statement has repeatedly been given by the U.S. Government itself when it has publicly stated it will only lift the economic blockade and begin normal relations once Cuba makes the political changes the United States wants and replaces the revolutionary government, headed by Fidel Castro, with another, supposedly democratic, which will have no qualms in subordinating itself to U.S. political and economic interests. To this end, the U.S. Government has developed an immigration policy that scandalously favors Cubans who abandon their country on improvised rafts, defy the dangers of the open sea in the hope of being rescued by a Coast Guard vessel and taken to Florida where they are forced to make politically hostile statements against the Cuban revolutionary government. Only then do these Cubans earn preferential treatment by the U.S. authorities. With regards to the thousands of Cubans who wish to travel to the United States to visit their relatives and then return to Cuba, they are treated very differently. Last year, of 100,000 Cuban citizens who tried to obtain a U.S. Government visa to legally travel to the United States, 70,000 were turned down. Day after day thousands of Cubans form long lines outside the U.S. Interests Section's doors in Havana with the hope of receiving the required visa. Only 30 percent have accomplished this; the rest, after putting up with being humiliated and mistreated by diplomatic officials, leave disappointed and their only hope is that one day this will change. Quite a few, after being turned down by capricious arguments, have undergone the raft adventure and been received as heroes in the same country that rejected them because they may have chosen to stay in U.S. territory and perhaps become a public burden. It is for this reason that Cuba insists on stating that this policy is criminal and violates all humanitarian principles. It is a policy that stubbornly disregards human rights.
