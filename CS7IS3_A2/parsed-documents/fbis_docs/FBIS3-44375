Yang Zhou, 49, told KYODO NEWS SERVICE in a telephone interview that he was taken into custody in Beijing on November 14 and held through December 31 at detention centers in both Beijing and Shanghai. He said he was treated badly at both centers. Yang was among nine people taken into custody after signing the draft charter intended to stimulate a national dialogue on bringing democracy to China. All were released the following day except for Yang and another dissident Qin Yongmin. Qin, from the central city of Wuhan, gained attention earlier for campaigning against Beijing's bid for the 2000 Olympic Games. His whereabouts are unknown. Yang said the charter aims to promote nonviolent political reform in China in contrast to some pro-democracy groups that advocate violent revolution to achieve their goals. The charter advocates nonviolence and cooperation with the Communist Party, which it describes as the only force capable of leading a peaceful transition to democracy. It also calls for increasing individual rights, striking political crimes from the legal code and releasing political prisoners. Yang, who is from Shanghai, was previously jailed for three years for his role in the democracy wall protest movement of the late 1970s.
