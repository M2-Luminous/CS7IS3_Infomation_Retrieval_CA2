The agricultural committee of the House of Councillors, which is scheduled to convene Wednesday, is also expected to set a date to discuss consumers' worries about the rice supply in a plenary session of the upper house. Legislators from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), had urged the committee meetings after customers started to line up in front of supermarkets hoping to buy some scarce unblended Japanese rice. In a controversial decision, the Food Agency announced on March 7 that it would mandate the blending of Japanese and Thai rice for retail as an emergency measure to discourage consumers from hoarding domestic rice. In a field excursion to supermarkets and rice retailers in central Tokyo, a group of 11 LDP legislators from both houses of parliament interviewed shoppers about the situation on Tuesday. The group also visited the metropolitan rice center, where imported rice is being packed, and observed the quarantine inspection of Australian rice shipments at the Yokohama customs office. The legislators also plan to inspect government storehouses and other facilities related to rice distribution on Thursday and Friday and on two days next week, in preparation for the special Diet meetings, they said.
