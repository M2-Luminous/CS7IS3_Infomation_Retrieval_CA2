To our regret, judging by remarks he made at the House of Representatives' Budget Committee session on 18 February, it is difficult to see how he plans to use his leadership to ease the economic dispute with the United States. To find a way out, it is urgent that Japan, having said "no," now says "yes" and declares that "without delay, it will do what it can." It should then move into action voluntarily. The government will hold a meeting of concerned ministers early next week to discuss how to correct the trade imbalance. It is important that the prime minister not rely solely on scenarios written by bureaucrats. In the current times of great change, ideas from bureaucrats, who tend to cling to the same old framework of thinking, often have limitations. It can be said that the government's slowness to act, which was caused by bureaucrats, is also to blame for the breakdown of the summit talks and the prolonged economic recession. The major points in the plan to correct the trade imbalance are expected to be the promotion of deregulation, the expansion of import and investment, the development of positive policies to promote competition, and the improvement of government procurement procedures. We have no objection to any of this. However, the most serious question is whether or not the prime minister can quell resistance from the bureaucracy and industry, and take a step toward further drastic market liberalization. Japan ought also to think about the possibility of setting endeavor goals voluntarily to reduce its current-account surplus. There are risks involved in making such political decisions. To bear the responsibility for such risks should be a problem for the prime minister who has touted the start of "a mature Japan-U.S. relationship." Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who fears the failure of the Japan-U.S. summit could intensify trade friction between the two countries, contributed an article to the U.S. newspaper NEW YORK TIMES with the suggestion that a wisemen's meeting of intellectuals from both nations be held. This is worth considering. Might we suggest the prime minister also call on people such as former prime ministers, who themselves experienced tough times dealing with the United States over trade frictions, and business executives, to canvass other than bureaucratic views. A meeting of businessmen from the two countries was held in Washington immediately after the summit talks. We would like to suggest the prime minister pay heed to and make the most of the views expressed at that time formulating future policies. President Bill Clinton barely managed to restore the Democratic Party to power after a 12-year Republican reign by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. With a bye-election coming in November, Clinton is no doubt fighting against the trade deficit with Japan, using retaliation as a threat, to solidify his political base at home. Meanwhile, in Japan, the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party ended with the start of the coalition administration. But the coalition has not been able to free itself of the old framework of bureaucracy, which means the strategy has not changed from that used in 12 years of contact with Republican governments, and it appears to be perplexed by the new negotiating style of the U.S. Democrat administration. Japan and the United States must soon establish relations of mutual trust appropriate to this era of change. It will only harm and not help bilateral relations if the United States increases pressure on Japan by reviving the Super 301 provision of the Trade Act. It would be regrettable if President Clinton really meant what he said at the summit about past Japan-U.S. trade accords having been almost useless in opening up the Japanese market. Japan bears a grave responsibility for letting him believe that. Japan's failure to spell out its market-opening efforts to other countries is just as harmful as its awkward negotiation strategy.
