Defense Minister Ter Beek, who began a four-day working visit of the Netherlands units on Monday [11 April], will probably have to alter his plans as a result of the NATO air strikes. The Netherlanders have not yet been faced with any aggression in the form of shooting or threats from the Serbs. However, on Sunday and Monday, virtually all units were placed on a higher level of alert immediately after the NATO air strikes. The Netherlanders freedom of movement is being further limited by the fact that convoys are finding it impossible to get through, and the Serbs are not giving soldiers on furlough permission to leave "their" territory. In all likelihood, the 600 or so Netherlands troops in the eastern Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica will be caused the greatest annoyance by the decision made by the Bosnian Serbs to break off contacts with the UN peacekeeping forces. The Dutch battalion in Srebrenica is dependent for supplies on the Netherlands logistics unit in Lukavac, 120 km away. The Bosnian Serbs must always issue their permission for such deliveries, which have been called off over the next few days. Even Minister Ter Beek is not being granted permission to visit Srebrenica. The heightened state of alert means that leave is being cancelled, partly for security reasons. The supplies of the Netherlands troops in Srebrenica will provisionally last for a good month. In the short term, the Dutch battalion needs the Serbs to allow helicopter flights between Srebrenica and the nearby enclave of Zepa, where more Netherlands troops will soon be stationed. On Monday, in central Bosnia, the area from which the Netherlands transport battalion is operating, the Serbs closed the important Sierra One checkpoint between Sarajevo and Kiseljak, reported one Netherlands spokesman from Zagreb. Netherlands convoys pass through this checkpoint on the way from the Croatian port of Split to the Bosnian town of Busovaca. Minister Ter Beek plans to visit this "home port" of the transport battalion. The question is whether he will get that far. Meanwhile, a group of UN military observers has been trapped in the hotbed of Gorazde. They include Netherlands Major Buisman. One spokesman in Zagreb said that the UN observers have been placed under house arrest by the Bosnian Serbs and may no longer leave the enclave. The Netherlands F-16 pilots in the Italian base of Villafranca are keeping themselves ready to take part in any future action by the NATO air force.
