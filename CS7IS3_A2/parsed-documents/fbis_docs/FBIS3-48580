The Midterm National Party Conference [MNPC] accomplished its duty and achieved fine success after six days of urgent work with a high sense of responsibility to our revolutionary undertaking, the fatherland's destiny, and our national future. The delegates contributed their best to the success of the development of the democratic spirit in party activities. They expressed their agreement with the party Central Committee political report. They also took part in lively discussions and provided many important and correct opinions. The delegates carefully selected qualified people to replenish the party Central Committee, which increased the strength of the leading party organ. This is the first time our party held a midterm national conference according to stipulations set forth in the party statutes. Many new issues have arisen, including challenges, opportunities, difficulties, and advantages, in an international background and national situation of many changes. These issues have come up after only a little more than two years after the Seventh National Party Congress [SNPC]. They require the entire party's intelligence to evaluate the implementation of the SNPC resolution in the past, to review in one step our renovation cause since the Sixth National Party Congress, to analyze the current situation, to outline major policies and measures, and to replenish party cadres to the party leading organ. This will meet the current demands of our revolutionary stage and heighten the willpower and strengths of our entire party, Army, and people for the continuous advancement of our revolutionary cause and for the accomplishment of the goals, directions, and duties outlined by the SNPC. The MNPC resolution concretizes and develops the spirit and content of the SNPC resolution in the new situation. We must quickly organize practical activities to disseminate and understand the resolution after this conference. Party committees at all levels must closely supervise the resolution's implementation together with the satisfactory organization of their midterm delegate meetings to accelerate control work, develop positive aspects, and quickly correct shortcomings and mistakes. The government urgently must institutionalize the resolution content. Governments from the central to grass-roots levels must introduce detailed plans to quickly execute the resolution. Fatherland fronts and mass organizations must engage deeply to motivate the public, to strengthen the national unity block, to develop their existing emulative movements, and to organize new movements in order to widely gather and motivate everybody to enthusiastically transform the SNPC goals and major MNPC duties into realities. We must strive to build clean and strong party and state mechanisms in order to satisfactorily implement the SNPC and MNPC resolutions and to ensure a correct direction for development. We must also improve leadership capacity and management efficiency. Our party is the party of the workers' class and a loyal representative of the interests of the workers' class, laborers, and entire nation. Since its formation, our party always holds the national flag high and fights determinedly for the fatherland's independence and the people's freedom and happiness. The past 60 years of history prove that our party is a vanguard fighting force for the entire nation. Our party is resolute about accomplishing this important duty in the new stage. All party cadres and members must earnestly study to improve their knowledge, quality, and morality; fight against corruption, waste, and bureaucracy; and continue their sacrifice and struggle for the revolutionary undertaking, thus deserving to be considered the people's loyal servant as Uncle Ho used to teach us. We must study Marxist-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh Thought and correctly apply and develop them in the new situation. We must preserve, inherit, and develop our national characteristics and quintessence. We also must study and selectively acquire mankind's achievements and other countries' experiences to correctly and creatively apply them to Vietnam's real situation. We must not copy dogmas. All dogmas from this side or the other side will cause damage to the national revolutionary cause. The MNPC calls on the entire party, Army, and people to develop our ancestors' fine tradition in national construction and protection. We must heighten the willpower of independence, sovereignty, and self-reliance; exercise diligence; practice frugality; instigate honesty; and uphold righteousness for the construction and protection of the fatherland and the party. We must work for the development of our economy, culture, and society; and we must strengthen our national defense and security to protect the regime that our people built with so much effort and the blood and bones of many generations. The MNPC calls for the increase of unity and unanimity to fully exploit opportunities; eliminate dangers; overcome challenges; proceed with the national industrialization and modernization; take our renovation cause to new heights and depths for the goals of a rich population, strong nation, and just and civilized society; and gradually and successfully build socialism. On the new year of 1994 and on entering the Year of the Monkey, I wish party Central Committee advisers; Comrade Nguyen Huu Tho, president of the VFF Presidium; former members of previous Central Committee Political Bureaus; conference delegates; and all comrades good health and more contributions to our party and people's revolutionary undertaking. Our MNPC hails comrades who, for health reasons, voluntarily resigned from the party Central Committee to create favorable conditions for the appointment of younger comrades to the party leading organ. It is hoped that they will continue to actively contribute their experience to the party and state's common tasks. On behalf of the MNPC Presidium, I declare the Midterm National Party Conference closed.
