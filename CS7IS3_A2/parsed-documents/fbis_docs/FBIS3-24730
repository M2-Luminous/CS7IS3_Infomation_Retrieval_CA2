[Buthelezi] Well, the absolute minimum has been spelled out on the document that we presented to the ANC [African National Congress] and government on the 19 December, and that is concerning the provinces, concerning the powers of provinces, concerning the concurrents, concerning the fiscal powers, concerning the single and double ballot system. Those are, I think, the absolute minimum things that we would want to be put right. [Robinson] We have been discussing those things in our studio tonight, but what is the most important for you, or are all of them as important and should a settlement be on all of those points together, tomorrow? [Buthelezi] I think all those points are equally important, but I would say the single ballot and double ballot is a crucial thing. I would think that, in fact, it could really be the thing that will be decisive. [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi -- moving away from that -- if you go ahead with your decision not to take part in the election, will you nevertheless take part in the sense that you will dissuade people to vote? [Buthelezi] Well, I know that the ANC and the government, in their collusion, have set traps for people who take action, in fact, to dissuade people from voting so that minefield I suppose.... [changes thought] I hope that I will not be forced to walk that minefield, because it is a minefield, but I think that the determination of the members of the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party], as I saw it throughout the night last until the early hours of this morning, convince me that they are prepared to walk that minefield than sacrifice, you know, their principles for a massive (?portage). [Robinson] Dr. Buthelezi, thank you very much for your participation tonight. Obviously we don't have the time now to have a long interview with you, but we'll try to create that opportunity as soon as possible. Thank you for your contribution. [Buthelezi] Thank you, Mr. Robinson.
