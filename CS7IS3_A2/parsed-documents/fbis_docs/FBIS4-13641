Regarding the failure to achieve withdrawal on the fixed dates and the frequent stoppage of talks, Dr. Sha'th said that peace can be achieved step by step, adding that "peace must result in the repatriation of refugees to their country and the establishment of a state with Jerusalem as its capital." Sha'th said that peace must also results in a strong Palestinian economy, noting that "peace provides Israel with peace and security" and strengthens its economy without depending on U.S. support. The chief Palestinian negotiator also dwelt on the developments in the peace process. He said: We are in the first phase of the "four-phase" peace process. In this phase, "which will last several weeks," withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho will take place and the Palestinian Political Department will enter Gaza and Jericho. The second phase is the deployment of 4,000 Palestinian police one week after Israeli withdrawal. Meanwhile, we will be ready to receive economic aid and work on the infrastructure will be launched. During this period, a committee will arrange for the return of (?88,000) refugees. Dr. Sha'th said that the interim phase should not exceed five years. He added that during the third phase, Israeli forces will withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza Strip and then a force of 15,000 Palestinians will become in charge of security affairs. Then, international forces will come in to prepare for the election of a "Palestinian legislative council." In the fourth phase, more important issues will be discussed such as security, settlements, borders, [words indistinct]. Palestinian-Israeli talks resumed in Cairo yesterday with the aim of removing the obstacles preventing the implementation of the self-rule agreement in Gaza and Jericho. Responsible Palestinian sources said that the two delegations "are drafting a general agreement." The sources added that the Civilian and Legal Affairs Committees will resume their meetings later. The Palestinian sources said that "progress was achieved" on various issues. Palestinian and Israeli negotiators reached agreement, during the Taba talks, on setting up the Palestinian radio and television station. Reports said there are major obstacles to the work of the Security and Civilian Affairs Committees following the paper presented by Israel at the end of the previous round of talks with regard to the legal jurisdiction of the Palestinian self-rule.
