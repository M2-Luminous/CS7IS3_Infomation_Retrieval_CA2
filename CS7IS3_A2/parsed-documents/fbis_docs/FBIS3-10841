He added that the objective within public finances is to maintain a balanced budget and that the devaluation rate will not be changed. De Posadas told the Viewpoints radio program, aired by Montevideo Radio El Espectador: "We want a zero deficit and I believe we will not miss it by much." As far as prices are concerned, De Posadas stated: "Inflation has been falling, it will stand at 2 percent (...) in February. This means inflation is on its way down and I believe the trend will continue." De Posadas added: "There are no plans to change the exchange rate guidelines" because "the economic program calls for maintaining the present devaluation rate." De Posadas admitted that a recent review of economic targets with IMF experts "has led to upward and downward corrections," adding that General Taxation Department and Social Security Bank revenue expectations "had been very pessimistic, but reality is showing that revenues are much higher than our typically Uruguayan pessimism had led us to expect." Asked about the trade deficit, he answered: "A trade deficit is not necessarily bad, just as a surplus is not necessarily good." He said: "Traditional exports continue to grow, which is very important. Whenever one looks at national figures one must look at them as a whole. Uruguay is receiving a lot of capital which is not registered because of errors and omissions. This capital is used mainly for investment and consumption." De Posadas added: "It would seem that the upward trend of the deficit changed in December, although one swallow does not make a summer." [passage omitted]
