The ability of the large numbers of workers in cities and towns, especially low-income and retired workers, to withstand the effects of reform will have direct influence on the outcome of this carefully designed plan. Associate Professor Feng Tongqing of the China Worker Movement Institute in Beijing, who has long been engaged in the study of workers' mentality, pointed out that when carrying out reform, one must taken into account economic compensation and welfare assurance for workers in the lower income bracket, and one should never overestimate the workers' capacity to withstand the effects of reform. In recent years, poor coordination between a series of reform projects launched in mainland China has resulted in an increase in the living expenses of worker households and relatively insufficient compensation in terms of actual income. Feng Tongqing believes that a reform plan which keeps the workers' "net burden" at the level of about 5 percent of their income will, generally speaking, be more readily acceptable to most workers. But, while raising pay, it is still necessary to introduce a full range of reforms regarding the insurance, housing, price, and welfare systems, so as to keep a basic balance between pay rises and the due price for introducing the reforms in the areas of insurance, housing, price, and welfare. Anyway, the reform package will possibly cause a chain reaction in commodity prices, as excessive price hikes will possibly be intolerable to the workers. What is more, price increases caused by an increase in labor costs usually ends up the cost transfer process with enterprises paying the price in the form of losses. Also, as reform may advance faster, thus imposing heavier a burden on workers during a certain period, the pressure on some low-income worker households may exceed the limit they can withstand. Feng noted that the limit of "net burden" that the workers can withstand should be scientifically estimated so that it can be kept within a certain range without causing any fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life. Associate Professor Feng Tongqing participated in the discussions, forecasts, and analysis that resulted in the blue paper: "An Analysis and Forecast of Social Conditions in China (1993-1994)." He emphasized that relative grievances among low- income workers, fluctuation in the workers' daily economic life, and the intensifying conflicts between workers and management may all contribute to more frequent occurrences of "eventualities." The so- called "eventualities," he explained, are collective actions taken by a certain number of workers (more than 10 people), in the form of strikes, collective slowdowns, collective visits to government departments to lodge complaints, assemblies, sit-ins, and so on. Statistics by the letter and visit bureaus of the CPC Central Committee General Office and of the State Council show that the number of visiting groups and individual visitors received by the two bureaus from January to May last year increased by 31 and 29.8 percent over the corresponding period in 1992. Of the cases raised during these visits, 28 percent were to complain about some issues related to daily economic life. Meanwhile, as shown by incomplete statistics made among enterprises in 10 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government, the number of eventualities that took place in the second quarter of 1993 was 83.9 percent higher than the figure in the corresponding period in 1992. Feng Tongqing said: Intensifying conflicts between management and workers is a basic cause for eventualities. The workers have grievances against reforms within their enterprises, especially against some enterprises' practice of "three changes and three no- changes" regarding the redundant manpower layoff operation; specifically, the practice of changing workers but not changing cadres; changing first-line employees (that is, producers) but not changing second- and third-line staff (that is, administrators); and change on general issues but no change on deep-rooted issues. Feng Tongqing held that it is necessary to quickly establish a tripartite mechanism which enables the trade unions and enterprises to open talks, with the government as a mediator, so that the labor disputes can be put on a normal basis. Only in this way will it be possible to substantially reduce eventualities. The knotty problem of personnel reemployment has long been disturbing enterprises. This problem has not only dampened workers' initiative, but it is also the basic reason why the standing of workers in state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises has been further downgraded. An estimate shows that at the moment enterprises in mainland China have some 17 million redundant personnel, of whom about 10 million are working with state-owned enterprises. Statistics released by the labor department indicate that some 200,000 of the 1 million personnel laid off from enterprises still remain jobless. According to the plan by the government department concerned, the re-employment of redundant personnel of enterprises will not be properly solved until 2000. Therefore, Feng Tongqing said the standing of workers of state- owned enterprises is expected to be further downgraded in 1994.
