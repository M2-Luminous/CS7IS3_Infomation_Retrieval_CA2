FR940930-1-00030 FR940930-1-00011 VIII. Regulatory Assessment Requirements A. Executive Order 12866 Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the requirements of the Executive Order. Under section 3(f), the order defines a ``significant regulatory action'' as an action likely to lead to a rule (1) Having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities (also referred to as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order. Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, it has been determined that this proposed rule is not ``significant'' and therefore not subject to OMB review. B. Regulatory Flexibility Act Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, the Agency must conduct a small business analysis to determine whether a substantial number of small entities will be significantly affected by a proposed rule. Because this proposed rule eliminates an existing requirement, it would result in cost savings to facilities, including small entities. C. Paperwork Reduction Act This proposed rule does not have any information collection requirements under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.
