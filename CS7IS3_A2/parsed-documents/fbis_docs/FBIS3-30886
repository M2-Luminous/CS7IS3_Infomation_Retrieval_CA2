At its meeting on Thursday 3 February the government hid the real reason for the temporary ban on importing vehicle gasoline, aviation fuel, and gas for lamps. The true reason is the immense import of fuels across the Danube Bridge. Yesterday morning alone, the customs authorities detained 96 Romanian fuel tanker vehicles. According to a source in the Ministry of Trade, the border and customs authorities in Dragoman are no longer in a position to say no to the mafia, which is threatening their lives if they refuse to let the tankers through to Yugoslavia. A police source declared that the state apparatus is not functioning, and only a complete ban can stop the flow of fuel to Belgrade. Until the new excise duty tariff takes effect, the duty on liquid fuels is negligible, as compared with the huge profits of 250 to 300 percent that can be gained in embargo-stricken Yugoslavia. At the moment the excise duty is 60 percent on A-96 and A-98 gasolines, and 50 percent on the A-86 and A-93 grades. A special police officer said that the Bulgarian mafia is stepping up its attempts to send fuel through the Dragoman border checkpoint because the Romanian and Hungarian mafias cannot wait. The possibility cannot be excluded that the gasolines shipped through Ruse from Romania have actually been processed at the Neftokhim refinery in Burgas, because the Romanians insist on marketing their own petroleum abroad themselves. The economic police are unable to check on the amounts of gasoline entering the country to establish whether it is destined for domestic consumption, whether it is stored in the huge tank parks of the state Petroleum Company, or whether it leaves the country again in Bulgarian railroad tankers.
