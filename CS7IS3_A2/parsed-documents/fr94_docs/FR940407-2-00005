FR940407-2-00005 FR940407-2-00004 Inadequate Demand for Official Services in Wyoming AGENCY: Federal Grain Inspection Service (FGIS). ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: FGIS has determined there is inadequate demand for official services to designate any organization to provide official services in the State of Wyoming. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 1994. ADDRESSES: Neil E. Porter, Director, Compliance Division, FGIS, USDA, Room 1647 South Building, P.O. Box 96454, Washington, DC 20090&hyph;6454. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Neil E. Porter, telephone 202&hyph;720&hyph;8262. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This action has been reviewed and determined not to be a rule or regulation as defined in Executive Order 12866 and Departmental Regulation 1512&hyph;1; therefore, the Executive Order and Departmental Regulation do not apply to this action. In the September 30, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 51047), FGIS announced that the designation of Wyoming ends on March 31, 1994, and asked persons interested in providing official services in the geographic area assigned to Wyoming to submit an application for designation. Applications were due by October 29, 1993. Wyoming applied for designation in the entire area currently assigned to it. FGIS requested comments on the applicant in the December 1, 1993, Federal Register (58 FR 63331). Comments were due by December 31, 1993. FGIS received no comments by the deadline. FGIS then contacted the major applicants for grain inspection services in the Wyoming area and determined that, pursuant to the provisions of the Act, there is an insufficient need for official services to designate an official agency. Therefore, FGIS is not designating an official agency to provide services in the area currently assigned to Wyoming. Any firms which may require official inspection services after March 31, 1994, should contact FGIS' Wichita Office at 316&hyph;269&hyph;7171 (FAX: 316&hyph;269&hyph;6163). Authority: Pub. L. 94&hyph;582, 90 Stat. 2867, as amended (7 U.S.C. 71 et seq. ) Dated: March 31, 1994. Sidney U. Allen, Acting Director, Compliance Division.
