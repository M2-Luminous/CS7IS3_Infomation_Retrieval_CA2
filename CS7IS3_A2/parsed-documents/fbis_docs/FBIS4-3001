Chiang [words indistinct] Taiwan minister made the statement after meeting with Sri Lanka's Trade and Commerce Minister A. R. Mansoor, who is leading a delegation to the ongoing ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Chiang is heading a 15-member Taiwan delegation to the four-day GATT meeting, which opened Tuesday [12 April]. Both sides exchanged views on how to boost bilateral trade cooperation, he noted. Chiang said he also expressed Taiwan's willingness to promote trade ties with Sri Lanka. "I told my Sri Lanka counterpart that any bilateral relationship would be substantially strengthened if official trade offices could be established in each other's territories," he said. The offices will certainly help protect the interests of traders and investors, thereby paving the way for increased trade exchanges, he elaborated. The Sri Lanka minister pledged he will convey the proposal to the Colombo government and work on ways to promote trade with Taiwan, he added.
