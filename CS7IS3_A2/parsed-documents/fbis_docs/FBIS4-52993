Speeches were made on the subjects of "formation of 'two Koreas'", "present status of the Korean question and prospect of its settlement" and so on. The speakers pointed out that the division of Korea, a product of the "cold war", was caused by the moves of big powers, the United States in particular. They said that President Kim Il-song called a joint conference of political parties and public organizations in the North and the South of Korea to prevent the division of the country, initiated building a democratic unified state and later put forward the three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation, thus opening a bright vista for the reunification of the country. They noted that the proposal for reunification through confederacy and the 10-point programme, advanced by President Kim Il-song, are a reunification proposal acceptable to everybody because they reflect the will common to the nation, and the proposal and the programme are positively supported by the world's people as well as the Korean people. Referring to the prospect of Korea's reunification, the speakers said Korea should be reunified by the Korean people themselves without outside interference. They held that Korea must become one unified state.
