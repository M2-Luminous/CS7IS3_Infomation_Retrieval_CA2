FR940810-1-00059 FR940810-1-00010 Content and Organization of the Federal Program This proposed rule, 30 CFR Part 903, is consistent with the previously proposed rulemaking of October 6, 1982 (47 FR 44194), except that this rulemaking includes modifications to account for revisions to the permanent program rules that have taken place during the period between proposed rulemakings. The content and organization of the proposed Federal program for Arizona would generally follow the permanent program regulations. However, as discussed above, instead of the full text appearing, each section includes only a reference to the pertinent permanent program regulation section. Sections 903.700(e) and (f) set out both more stringent and inconsistent State statutes. A separate paragraph is proposed to be added under each section where there are deviations from the Federal permanent program regulations for the Arizona Federal program. These paragraphs will generally be found in a subsection (b). The content and organization of the proposed Arizona Federal program would be based on the following provisions of the Federal permanent program regulations, 30 CFR Chapter VII: Subchapter A_General Subchapter F_Areas Unsuitable for Mining Subchapter G_Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Permits and Coal Exploration Systems under Regulatory Programs Subchapter H_Small Operator Assistance Subchapter J_Bond and Insurance Requirements for Bonding of Surface Coal Mining and Reclamation Operations Subchapter K_Permanent Program Performance Standards Subchapter L_Permanent Program Inspection and Enforcement Procedures Part 955_Certification Program for Blasters Technical literature cited by OSM in the preambles to the permanent regulatory program (44 FR 14901&hyph;15309, March 13, 1979) and the regulatory reform rulemaking notices ending September 30, 1983, was relied upon in developing the Arizona Federal program. The reader is referred to those preambles for a discussion of the bases and purposes of the permanent program rules proposed to be referenced in the Arizona program without substantive change. The numbering system of the permanent program regulations has been incorporated into the numbering system for the proposed Arizona Federal program. Subchapter T of 30 CFR Chapter VII has been established to include regulatory programs by State in alphabetical order, and each State has been assigned a part number. As previously indicated, the regulatory program for Arizona is assigned Part 903. Program elements have been categorized under headings similar to the subchapter titles of the permanent program in 30 CFR Chapter VII. Detailed Discussion of the Arizona Program General Section 903.700 would contain six subsections: the first four subsections, 903.700(a), (b), (c), and (d), would contain general statements on the scope and applicability of the program. Section 903.700(e) would indicate Arizona State laws that have been identified as having provisions that regulate activities involved in surface coal mining operations and that have provisions that in some instances are more stringent than SMCRA and the Secretary's regulations. Section 903.700(f) would identify Arizona State laws and regulations that interfere with achievement of the purpose of SMCRA and Federal regulations. These identified State laws and regulations would be preempted and superseded. Sections 903.701 through 903.707 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter A, General. Section 903.701(a) would contain all applicable general requirements, including the definitions in 30 CFR 700.5 and 701.5. Subsection (b) is proposed to be added at ยง903.701 to make clear that beginning on the effective date of this program and continuing until an operation has a permanent program permit issued by OSM, compliance with the interim program standards in 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter B is required. Section 502(c) of SMCRA provides that all surface coal mining operations on lands on which such operations are regulated by a State shall comply with the interim program standards until a permanent program permit is issued. Paragraph (c) of ยง903.701 would provide that records required by 30 CFR 700.14 to be made available locally to the public shall be retained at the OSM Albuquerque Field Office. Section 703.702 would establish the same requirements as Part 702, Exemption for Coal Extraction Incidental to the Extraction of Other Minerals. Section 903.707 would establish the same requirements as Part 707, Exemption for Coal Extraction Incident to Government-Financed Highway or Other Construction. Permit Fees Section 903.736 Permit fees, would establish the same provisions as 30 CFR section 736.25. Areas Designated Unsuitable for Mining Sections 903.761 through 903.764 would establish the same provisions, where applicable, as 30 CFR Chapter VII, Subchapter F, Areas Unsuitable for Mining. However, 30 CFR 736.15(b)(1) provides that the procedures and criteria for designating lands unsuitable shall be implemented one year after a Federal program is made effective for a State. Therefore, ยง903.764 provides that Part 764 shall apply beginning one year after the effective date of the Arizona program. No separate section for Federal lands is proposed because 30 CFR Part 769 is directly applicable and need not be made a part of a Federal program for a State.
