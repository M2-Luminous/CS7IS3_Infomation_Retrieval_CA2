They are asking that their debt with International Development Agency [AID] be forgiven. The peasants were received at the embassy by U.S. adviser Marilyn McAffe, who refused to speak with the press. The demonstration blocked part of La Reforma Avenue, one of the most important highways in the southern part of the city, causing an enormous traffic jam. The leaders of the movement explained that AID granted an $11 million loan to the Penny Foundation, which in turn purchased land to sell to the peasants under very flexible payment terms. The drop in coffee prices and other agricultural products, however, has forced the peasants to fall behind in payments. That is why they are asking AID to forgive the debt. The farmers said they would continue to picket until their demands are met.
