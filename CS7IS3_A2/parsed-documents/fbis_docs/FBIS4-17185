"Crimea must not become a source of discord between the two fraternal nations," he said to INTERFAX. He said he and his Russian counterpart, Pavel Grachev, at a meeting they had behind closed doors in Sevastopol on Thursday, had discussed the life of Crimea's population. The 40-minute meeting was followed by talks on the Black Sea Fleet between a Ukrainian and Russian delegations. Russia's delegation was led by Grachev and included Navy commander-in-chief Feliks Gromov and ambassador at large Yuriy Dubinin. Ukraine was represented by Radetskyy and Navy commander-in-chief Vladimir Bezkorovaynyy. "At this stage of negotiations the question of the division of the fleet should be solved, while the redeployment problem will be tackled at the second round of negotiations by the presidents of Ukraine and Russia," Bezkorovainy told Interfax-Ukraine. He said that, at the present round of talks, the two countries were going to divide the fleet infrastructure between them but would not discuss the division and leasing of any naval bases. The president of the Ukrainian autonomous republic of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, addressing a rally in front of Black Sea Fleet headquarters, protested against the deployment in Crimea of "a second fleet," meaning the Ukrainian Navy. "This does not meet our interests, because the Black Sea Fleet is able to ensure the security of the citizens of Crimea and protect their legitimate rights."
