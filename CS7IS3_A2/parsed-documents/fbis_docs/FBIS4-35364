[Sha'th] Good evening, you are welcome. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, when will the PNA members residing outside the West Bank and Gaza Strip begin to arrive in the self-rule area to pursue their work in order to confront the great challenges? [Sha'th] In the next two weeks, God willing. Brother President Yasir 'Arafat will be there no later than 15 June. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, in fact, the current picture is not a rosy one. The economic situation is serious, and there is a great responsibility to be assumed by the PNA. Immediate measures should be taken, and any delay will make things difficult. [Sha'th] No doubt, we will do our best to resolve these problems. However, brother Sa'id, I should say frankly that one sometimes forgets why the situation in the Gaza Strip is bad following 27 years of occupation. The Israeli Government, as an occupation government in this area, was in charge of the Gaza Strip for 27 years. The current talk about the difficult crisis is true. However, the party that was in charge for 27 years is to be held responsible. Moreover, we have been assuming our responsibilities only for weeks. I believe this should be said to know who is responsible for this situation and how it can be resolved. In any case, I am not one of those who lament the past, and I believe we should make every effort to build and compensate for all these lengthy years of suffering experienced by our people in the Gaza Strip. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, what about the financial aid to the Palestinians, knowing that the economic situation is the key to the agreement's success? [Sha'th] As you know, this aid has been delayed. We barely obtained money for the Palestinian police entry [into the self-rule area]. However, the greater portion of funds, which will come through the coordination committee organized by the World Bank, was delayed until the Gaza-Jericho agreement was signed. In any case, I believe these funds will come in succession, so all salaries can be disbursed on time and the current expenses can be managed at least for the first few months until we can collect part of the taxes which the Civil Administration used to collect before the agreement was signed. I am not pessimistic about this issue. I believe that we will fulfill all obligations, and sufficient funds will come to meet these obligations. What is important is that this should open the way for real economic development which will be the key to ending the problem of unemployment and create a new situation in the Palestinian territory. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, the issues of the Palestinian institutions in East Jerusalem and the attempt by the Palestinian side to impose political realities were recently raised. The prime minister stated that the Palestinians committed themselves to establishing institutions in the self-rule area. What do you say about this? [Sha'th] I believe there is confusion between the institutions which are confined to the self-rule areas in Gaza and Jericho, namely, the PNA areas--by the way, the agreement stipulates that these institutions will be established in Gaza and Jericho and not only in Jericho--and the Palestinian institutions existing in Jerusalem before the signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. These Palestinian Arab institutions in East Jerusalem are Palestinian institutions and there was an agreement to keep them. During the Likud's rule, these institutions remained open. Orient House is not an institution that was built after signing the Gaza-Jericho agreement but it is one that was established and recognized, along with many other similar institutions, before the current Labor government took office. Thus, we find it very strange that there is objection to the Palestinian institutions in Jerusalem. We regard this objection as an open violation of the agreement by all concepts. This is because there was agreement that negotiations on Jerusalem's final status will be held during the final status negotiations. This does not at all allow the Israeli side to behave as if Jerusalem was an annexed city at a time when this side denies the Palestinian side, which is deeply entrenched in East Jerusalem, the right to keep its institutions. This cannot be accepted; it is inconceivable that the Likud government permitted something that the [Israeli] Labor Ministry has canceled with a pen stroke. This remark by Prime Minister Rabin is really strange and not understood. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil, last question: On the level of setting up the PNA, are contacts still continuing with the Hamas Movement to join the PNA? Was Shaykh Sa'id Bilal officially appointed in the PNA? [Sha'th] As far as I know, no new appointment has been made since the meeting held in Tunis. However, I know that there is real readiness to expand this authority. There are still six open portfolios for anyone who is ready to be committed to the agreement we signed and to work through this agreement to serve the Palestinian people. In fact, this is the basis through which contacts can be made with any of the Palestinian forces that are ready to participate in assuming the responsibility of next phase. [Mu'addi] Dr. Nabil Sha'th, member of the Palestinian Authority, thank you very much. [Sha'th] Thank you, brother.
