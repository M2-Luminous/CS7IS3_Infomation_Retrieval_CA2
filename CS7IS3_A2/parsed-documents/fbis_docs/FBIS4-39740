It was also reported that the president had actually met with Yu. Skokov and the relevant draft edicts had now been prepared. But senior officials in the Russian presidential and government apparatuses denied these reports. "Someone was very keen to destabilize the situation in the country and cause trouble on the threshold of the election race," I was told by Valeriy Grishin, deputy chief of the Russian Federation Government Press Service, who, incidentally, had been cited in the press. "I did not talk to anyone on this subject. This false report has reverberated worldwide. For example, we are being telephoned and quizzed by anxious staff of foreign banks.... It is just another `scenario,' which could cause the country material as well as psychological damage..." Vyacheslav Kostikov made a very strong statement on the Russian president's behalf, describing the rumors as "downright lies. Let all the conjecture and speculation on this subject be on the conscience of the unscrupulous journalists and the politicians who are behind reports of this kind," Kostikov said.
