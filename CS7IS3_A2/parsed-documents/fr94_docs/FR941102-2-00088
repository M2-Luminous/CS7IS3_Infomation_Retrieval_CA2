FR941102-2-00088 FR941102-2-00065 [Docket Nos. 50&hyph;250 and 50&hyph;251] Florida Power and Light Company; Turkey Point Unit Nos. 3 and 4; Notice of Partial Denial of Amendment to Facility Operating License and Opportunity for Hearing The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) has denied a portion of an amendment request by the Florida Power and Light Company (FPL or the licensee) for an amendment to Facility Operating License Nos. DPR&hyph;31 and DPR&hyph;41, issued to the licensee for operation of the Turkey Point Plant, Units 3 and 4, located in Dade County, Florida. Notice of Consideration of Issuance of this amendment was published in the Federal Register on March 30, 1994 (59 FR 14889). The purpose of the licensee's amendment request was to revise the Technical Specification (TS) to delete the frequencies from the audits performed under the cognizance of the Company Nuclear Review Board (CNRB) and remove the audit of the emergency and security plans and implementing procedures from TS. The audits would be performed at the frequency specified in the FPL Topical Quality Assurance Report (TQAR). Some audits would be performed less frequently (biennial rather than annual in most cases). The NRC staff has concluded that the portion of the licensee's request regarding audits of the Fire Protection Program cannot be granted for the reasons stated in letter dated October 26, 1994. The licensee was notified of the Commission's denial of the proposed change by letter dated October 26, 1994. By December 2, 1994, the licensee may demand a hearing with respect to the denial described above. Any person affected by this proceeding may file a written petition for leave to intervene. A request for hearing or petition for leave to intervene must be filed with the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC, 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may be delivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, by the above date.

Reis, Esquire, Newman and Holtzinger, P.C., 1615 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036, attorney for the licensee.
