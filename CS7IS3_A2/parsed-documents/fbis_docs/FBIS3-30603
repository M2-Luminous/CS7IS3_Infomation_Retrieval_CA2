Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana issued his warning after meeting here with Croatian Prime Minister Nikica Valentic. Solana said that if reports of regular Croatian troops being involved in fighting in Bosnia turned out to be true, "the international community will have to seriously examine the issue" of sanctions, the Croatian news agency HINA reported. Valentic rejected the charges and said that "the international community's pressure for a peaceful settlement must be applied evenly on all warring parties," the agency added. Zagreb has acknowledged that up to 2,000 "volunteers" -- mostly Croats of Bosnian origin -- were fighting alongside Bosnian Croat (HVO) forces in Bosnia, but said that no active regular army troops were involved. Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said in Rome Thursday that although some of the Bosnia "volunteers" were former soldiers and officers, there were no regular Croatian forces serving there. Zagreb had no intention of intervening in the Bosnian conflict, he said after a meeting with his Italian counterpart Beniamino Andreatta, adding that the number of volunteer fighters on the Moslem side was much higher. Andreatta earlier told Italy's parliamentary foreign affairs committee that, if reports of the presence of regular Croatian troops in Bosnia were correct, there were dangers of a "substantial change in the attitude of the international community towards Croatia." He added: "The position of Italy and other European countries, who have until now forcefully rejected calls for a lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems, would risk being weakened." Meanwhile in Copenhagen Danish Foreign Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said that "the United Nations should impose sanctions against Croatia because of its military involvement in Bosnia." He said Denmark would appeal for sanctions at the European Community's foreign minister-level meeting in Brussels Monday, and would also propose, as an alternative, the lifting of Croatia's preferential trade status with the EC. Although he admitted that opinions are divided within the EC, he said Denmark felt that the presence of Croatian troops in Bosnia "should not go unnoticed." After his meeting with Valentic Thursday, Solana was to meet with UN special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia Yasushi Akashi before heading back to Madrid. He had earlier visited the Spanish UN peacekeeping contingent in Medjugorje, in southern Bosnia.
