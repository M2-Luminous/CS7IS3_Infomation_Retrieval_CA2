The ghost of possible fraud continues to hover in the atmosphere a few days before the elections take place. Nevertheless, this was ruled out today by President Cristiani who assured us there is no basis for fraud charges, rather these charges are generated by groups that foresee a negative result in the elections. [Begin Cristiani recording] In my opinion, this is a totally wrong strategy that seeks to mar an electoral process that has been open and has complied with everything. With regard to the UN remarks, I believe these are simple excuses given what the results could be. [end recording] As far as the problem reported by the FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] on the transfer of voting places in several hamlets in the Chalatenango Department, President Cristiani said that the highest electoral institution was clear that this action is not intended to adversely harm or [word indistinct] any particular political party. [Begin Cristiani recording] As has been explained, in four Chalatenango municipalities the population resides in the department's capital city -- at the seat in Chalatenango. More people would have to travel if the voting takes place in the municipalities than would have to travel from the municipalities to Chalatenango given that the voting document indicates the voting place. [end recording] Cristiani told the media that the people should feel assured because there will be 900 Onusal [UN Observers for El Salvador] observers and approximately 3,000 independent observers, who in his opinion will be the witnesses to the election's transparency.
