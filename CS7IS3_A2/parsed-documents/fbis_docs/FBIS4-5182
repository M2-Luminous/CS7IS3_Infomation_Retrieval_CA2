Cambodia has accused Thailand on a number of occasions of continuing to support the Khmer Rouge guerrillas in their war against the elected Phnom Penh government. The Thai government denies it, but acknowledges its (?military) has business links with the guerrillas across the border in Cambodia. "As for Thailand, my prime minister is not happy," Prince Sirivut said at the airport while awaiting the arrival of Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans. "If we must go to the Security Council, we will go," he said, without stating what kind of action, whether resolution or sanctions, against Thailand would be appropriate. Asked if the Cambodians would ask Evans' support for such a move, Prince Sirivut said: "I ask everybody to support the Cambodian Royal Government and not the Khmer Rouge." France already indicated support for action against Thailand during a visit last week by deputy premier Simone Veil. Evans said he believed the Thai government was "absolutely sincere" about its resolve "not to give aid, comfort and support" to the Khmer Rouge, but that central control may not be total. "I mean, there may be some individuals who continue to play some kind of a supporting role in the Thai business community and some areas of the Thai military," he said. "That's perfectly possible, because that's historically been the case, and it's not always easy to address these issues." He said he discussed Cambodian border issues with Thailand's top officials during a recent visit to Bangkok, but that it was not for Australia to interfere. "I think it's an issue that has to be resolved bilaterally between the two countries, and the sooner they get into a frank, comprehensive dialogue on the issue, with all the necessary mechanisms and strategies that go with that... the better," Evans said, expressing support for Cambodia's government elected by the UN peace plan that he was instrumental in putting forward in 1991. Evans, due to leave Sunday, also announced a doubling of foreign aid to Cambodia over the next four years in line with pledges made at previous aid conferences in Tokyo. Areas of concentration include building bridges, demining, human rights promotion, English-language training and health. Australia will also provide 2.5 million to three million Australian dollars for defense cooperation, part of which will go to Cambodia's demining coordination agency. Evans was also scheduled to meet co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, acting head of state Chea Sim and deputy premier Sar Kheng. He was also scheduled to open the Australian Centre for Education, which teaches English to Cambodians.
