The king, who has recently been released from Beijing hospital where he received medical treatment for his tumour near prostrate area, is scheduled to return to Phnom Penh on April 8 after his brief visit to North Korea. The following day he will officiate at a 90th anniversary memory ceremony for his late mother, Queen Kossamak Nearirat, and then meet envoys who have been accredited to Cambodia during his absence. In his massage to his compatriots dated on March 23 and received by AKP today, the king said he would hear "five very serious problems or difficulties" in his first people's audiences. He, however, did not identify those five serious problems. The people's audiences to hear grievances of the people date back to the 1950s and 1960s when the royal palace was open to hear and judge complaints. "I know," the king said, "your problems are much more numerous than five, but we must make a choice." Selections will be made by the high privy council of the king who will meet next week in the royal palace to examine any submitted problems. The king has said previously he will only listen to the grievances and leave implementation of solutions to government officials.
