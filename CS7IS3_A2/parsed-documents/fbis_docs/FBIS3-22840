The reactor, operated by the governmental Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp., will soon reach criticality, the stage when a nuclear chain reaction is self-sustaining. It will then produce 280,000 kilowatts of electricity. Four large-scale trucks packed with 21 fuel assemblies set out Thursday afternoon from the factory in Tokai, Ibaraki Prefecture, where the mixture of plutonium and enriched uranium is produced. Although the government tried to keep the transport route secret, as with previous plutonium deliveries, antinuclear groups tracked its progress along roads across Honshu to the Sea of Japan coast. Since the first controversial plutonium shipment to Monju in July 1992, a total of 200 fuel assemblies have been delivered, including five for experimental purposes. Monju was originally scheduled to reach criticality last October but its start-up had to be postponed due to a technical mishap in fuel production last July.
