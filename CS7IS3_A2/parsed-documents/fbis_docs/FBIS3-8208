The talks were also attended by member of the Presidency Ejup Ganic and Army General Rasim Delic. Coming up is Nedzad Leko's report. [Leko] Following today's talks, it was Yasushi Akashi who spoke to reporters first. He expressed satisfaction with the fact that the situation in Sarajevo had improved considerably since his last visit on 20 February. I can see that people are happier, more relaxed, Mr. Akashi added. As for the talks he said: [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian translation] We discussed how best to restore important public services in Sarajevo. General Rose, in cooperation with Bosnian Army Commander Gen. Rasim Delic, has already done a lot in that respect. He has drawn up a list of priorities for restoring electricity, water and gas supplies, and opening roads. We will continue working in that direction. As you know, the UN secretary general has been asked to send a report on this to the Security Council in seven days. We are preparing that report, and as far as the restoration of services in Sarajevo is concerned, we will work closely with the Bosnia-Herzegovina Government. We also reviewed the military situation, which is particularly tense in Maglaj, while the situation in other towns such as Mostar and Vitez has improved somewhat. As you know, I visited those towns last week and the cease-fire is holding, although it is occasionally violated. We also discussed the opening of Tuzla airport, where some issues are still open. I promised UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Forces] full cooperation in improving the situation further and in strengthening peace, but, as you know, we need additional forces, reinforcements. President Izetbegovic expressed his confidence in UNPROFOR as a neutral and unbiased force, which acts on behalf of the whole of the international community, and I am grateful to him for that. [end recording] Akashi answered several journalists' questions. Speaking about when roads will be opened, he said that a special committee -- which will be headed by Bosnian Presidency member Ejup Ganic on the Bosnian side, and by Gen. Rose on the UNPROFOR side -- will review it. They will establish specific details of when and how, and whether all roads can be opened simultaneously. Answering a question about the convoy for Maglaj, Akashi could not say when the convoy would leave because UNPROFOR has no troops deployed in the area. He stressed that UNPROFOR was very concerned about the situation there because air-drops are the only way to send food, but only 40 percent of food reaches those for whom it is intended. Akashi could neither confirm nor deny the reports on this morning's bombing of Maglaj by Serb aircraft. He said that, since he had been travelling all day, he had received no information about it from NATO. Journalists wanted to know when Tuzla airport would be opened. Akashi said: [Begin Akashi recording in English fading to Serbo-Croatian translation] Of course, I hope that Tuzla airport will be opened as soon as possible. The airport is good, but it needs to be improved, and some parts need to be repaired. We also have to provide additional equipment. However, problems at the moment are more of a political nature rather than technical. I would like the airport to be opened as a result of a general consensus, and this is why I am holding very intensive talks with the interested parties. However, there are still certain problems that need to be overcome. [end recording] [Leko] The press were then addressed by Alija Izetbegovic. [Begin Izetbegovic recording] As you can see, we discussed a large number of issues today. It is my impression that we made some progress on each of these issues, on some to a greater extent, on others to a lesser extent. I believe that very soon we are going to have a far better situation regarding power, gas, and water supplies in Sarajevo. We also expect that these roads in Sarajevo will open very soon. We also expect Tuzla airport to be opened in the near future. There are some minor difficulties that ought to be resolved. They are of a political, not of a technical nature. Our talks today focussed on Maglaj. We will send a letter to the Security Council this evening again, on the basis of our talks. We also asked Mr. Akashi and Gen. Rose to enable us to visit Srebrenica and Gorazde. I believe that the problem of Gorazde will be solved very soon, perhaps in a few days. We will have to wait a bit longer for Srebrenica, but I believe that this will also be solved successfully. [end recording]
