(1)"] [Excerpts] RESPUBLIKA mentioned the name of Kaunas inhabitant Vladas Laurinavicius for the first time in the article "In the Tangle of the Kaunas Mafia" published in the fall of 1991. We described the cruise of the Kaunas Mafia "celebrities" around the Mediterranean. It seems that gathered on the ship "Gruzia," the leaders of the Lithuanian-Hong Kong enterprise "Grand Queen," who had caused suspicion among law enforcement officials for a long time, and their assistants were not just resting. The list of holiday-makers surprised the officials most of all because it included not only V. Laurinavicius, but also Andrius Jankevicius, nicknamed Psidze, who is one of the best known persons in the Kaunas criminal world, S. Ciapas, president of the closed stock company "Deka," and other well-known "businessmen." [passage omitted] The Lithuanian state and its government leaders authorized [former] Defense Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an agreement on the purchase of 5,000 machine guns from the Kaunas association "Selma" headed by no one else but V. Laurinavicius, a person who has been sentenced thrice, like Psidze himself. [passage omitted] Today, our law enforcement officials have become interested in the activities of this association and its ties with the former leaders of the National Defense Ministry [KAM]. Maybe, because aircraft and machine guns, as they suspect, were bought from Russia for a "nickel," while they were "pushed into" the KAM for hundreds of millions [currency unspecified]. Prosecutors are trying to assess material losses. They are also trying to find out who proposed the Kaunas company "Selma" with its president V. Laurinavicius as arms suppliers to the government. We will try to base the study of KAM former agreements on definite and documented facts in the current publication. Ship Traders Under Pirates' Siege KAM leaders established the first contacts with "Selma" last spring. On 11 May, they concluded an agreement on the acquisition of six armed war ships with equipment and ammunition. "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius pledged to observe it. The KAM leaders made a deal with "Selma" without delay. The then Deputy Defense Minister A. Pauzuolis was authorized by Minister A. Butkevicius himself to sign the agreement. However, when employees of the State Inspection Department began to analyze the conditions for concluding and implementing this agreement, the KAM leaders refused strictly to provide copies of the documents. By the way, as it turned out later, the agreement with "Selma" had been concluded without permission from the Lithuanian Government. A relevant government resolution appeared only on 1 July of last year. However, under the 11 May agreement, the KAM did not receive a single ship, as it is. Therefore, a new government resolution (24 September) was adopted which served as the basis for signing another agreement between the KAM and "Selma." True, the latter bears no concrete date, only the year 1992. It provides for the acquisition of one war ship at a price of 120 million rubles [R]. Although the 24 September resolution did not permit paying cash, R60 million were taken from the Vilnius branch of the Lithuanian Bank and handed to V. Laurinavicius the next day. The money was paid to the "Selma" president without the minister's signature, because the KAM allegedly owed him this money according to the former unfulfilled 11 May agreement. A week later on 6 October, following the government resolution, the KAM leaders took 117 million talonai [provisional currency before the litas] from the Lithuanian Bank and gave it to V. Laurinavicius. The money for one war ship. The KAM had no agreement with the association "Selma" for this purpose. It had only Minister A. Butkevicius' resolution (without a date and a number) on additional payment for one war ship. At the same time, the National Defense Ministry [KAM] launched another agreement with "Selma" (indicating only the year 1992) on the acquisition of a second frigate for 240 million talonai designed to combat submarines. Despite all Lithuanian laws, this agreement allowed that the "Selma" president be paid in cash. Another 240 million talonai were taken from the bank and handed over to V. Laurinavicius on 17 November. Thus, V. Laurinavicius received 417 million rubles [R] for two ships in cash. The statement of transfer of two small ships, built in 1980 and 1981, was signed by R. Baltuska, commander of the coast guard unit, and Baltic Fleet Deputy Commander N. Kachanovich. On 21 October 1992, this statement was confirmed by Baltic Fleet Commander Y. Yegorov and Minister A. Butkevicius. However, none of the documents indicated the actual price of the ships. Maybe, this is why officers often hold their heads when hearing the sum that the government paid for the two ships. One could buy newer and much better ships for the millions that went to "Selma." When the State Inspection Department tried to retrieve the documents from the KAM confirming the prices of the acquired ships, the ministry refused to provide them. As it turned out, the KAM was overzealous -- it paid to "Selma" 78.8 million litai more than it had in Finance Ministry allotments. "Selma" Takes Care of Arms A government resolution of 19 August 1992 authorized Defense Minister A. Butkevicius to conclude an agreement with the "Selma" association, so that the latter assisted in supplying the KAM with light firearms. According to the plan, "Selma" had to provide 5,000 AKM-74 machine guns for R198,770,000. This government document served as a basis for the agreement between the KAM and "Selma." The agreement (bearing only the year 1992) was signed by "Selma" Managing Director V. Laurinavicius and Minister A. Butkevicius. Although without a date, the document has a stamp. Under this agreement, "Selma" had to supply 5,000 AKM-74 machine guns. The KAM had to pay $220 for each of them at an exchange rate of $1 to R180.70. For some reason the minister again promised to pay this sum in cash, although Lithuanian law forbids this. Judging from the documents that RESPUBLIKA possesses today, between 20 August and 7 September 1992, KAM officials took out R198,770,000 from the ministry's account in the Vilnius branch of the Lithuanian Bank. All the money was handed over to "Selma" President V. Laurinavicius. V. Drupas, chief of the KAM Armament Department, received the machine guns from "Selma" on 15 August 1992. True, "Selma" supplied AK-74 machine guns instead of the AKM-74 indicated in the government resolution and the agreement. The arms were transferred without a ministry's commission. The bills of lading were issued the same day. However, there is not a single word about the price of these arms and the total sum paid for them. How much did the ministry actually pay for these machine-guns? (To be continued).
