In remarks to NOTIMEX, Paz explained that Honduras was not allowed into the NAM during the past decade, when the country served as a base of operations for the Nicaraguan contras who were fighting the Sandinist regime. The official indicated that the nonaligned countries agreed to let Honduras join its ranks in the wake of the inauguration of President Carlos Roberto Reina, who is regarded as a leader of social democratic ideas and defender of human rights. Paz, who will be the first Honduran foreign minister to participate in a meeting of that organization, said that he will attend the NAM conference with an "optimistic" attitude and that the conference will be held from 30 May to 6 June in Cairo, Egypt. He added that he will attend the meeting with confidence that the new realities ruling the world will provide just and equitable participation to the Third World countries in that international movement.
