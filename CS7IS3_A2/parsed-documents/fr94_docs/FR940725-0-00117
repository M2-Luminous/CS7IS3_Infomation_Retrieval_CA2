Inseason Action 1994 Halibut Landing Report No. 9 Last Oregon Sport Season Canceled, 30&hyph;Fathom Fishery to Continue The final sport Pacific halibut season scheduled to begin August 6 in all depths between Cape Falcon (lat. 45 46 ’00 ’ ’N.) and the California border (lat. 42 00 ’00 ’ ’N.) has been canceled. Insufficient catch limit remains to allow for a complete day of fishing. Therefore, the current sport halibut fishery inside the 30-fathom curve nearest to the coastline as plotted on National Ocean Service charts numbered 18520, 18580, and 18600 from Cape Falcon to the California border will continue until the overall catch limit for this area is reached. The fishery is open 7 days a week with a daily bag limit of two halibut per person, one with a minimum overall size limit of 32 in (81.3 cm) and the second with a minimum overall size limit of 50 in (127 cm). This fishery will close when the remaining catch limit of 2,610 lb (1.2 mt) is reached and the season is closed by the Commission, or September 30, whichever occurs first.
