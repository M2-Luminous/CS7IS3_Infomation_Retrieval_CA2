The prospects for bilateral military and political cooperation reveal such a possibility, it was stressed today at a meeting between Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev and General Klaus Naumann, the inspector general of the German Bundeswehr. The Russian Defense Ministry, Grachev said at the meeting, supports the Partnership for Peace program. However, the Russian minister noted, there are different approaches to the implementation of the program. He believes that it is necessary to develop a mechanism for joining the partnership program. This requires an intermediate plan that would envisage the unification of European countries into political unions, with the CSCE playing the leading role both in the regions and on a bilateral basis. The program of Naumann's visit to Russia is an intensive one. Tomorrow he will meet Colonel General Viktor Samsonov, chief of staff for the coordination of military cooperation of the CIS member-states. During the visit, which ends on 18 February, he will also have meetings with First Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin and Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of general staff of the Russian Armed Forces. The German guest is to address students and instructors of the General Staff's military academy. He will visit troop units stationed on the outskirts of Moscow, the 27th Guards Division of Russian peace-keeping forces in the Volga military district, and also Volgograd and St. Petersburg.
