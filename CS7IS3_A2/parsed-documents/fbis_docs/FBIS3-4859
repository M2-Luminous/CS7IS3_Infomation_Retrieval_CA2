Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of Employers Association [Nikkeiren], told a press conference that the "tankan" business survey by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), published the previous day, cannot be considered an exact reflection of reality. He said the report is "based on figures taken before the Japan-U.S. summit meeting" February 11, since when U.S. pressure has been mounting on Japan to cut its huge current account surplus. "So it is premature to say the economy has bottomed out. Last year, signs of recovery were immediately followed by worsening of the situation. I cannot be pleased with the report without reserve," Nagano said. The tankan report indicated that pessimism among businesses has hit bottom, with the BOJ index for business confidence among major manufacturers surveyed in February at minus 56, unchanged from the previous survey taken in November last year. Nagano also reiterated his proposal for no wage increases in the coming fiscal year, starting in April. "Further hikes in wages will encourage hollowing of the industry. Japan's wages are already the world's highest in nominal terms," he said.
