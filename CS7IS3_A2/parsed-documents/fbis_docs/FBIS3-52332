King Husayn's political adviser Marwan al-Qasim told our radio that if the PLO leadership now thinks that there should be a revision or a postponement of this subject, then Jordan can only respect the independent Palestinian decision. Al-Qasim noted that Jordan's aim behind the agreement, which has been ready for the signature of Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat for two months, is to extend assistance and support for the Palestinian people and fill the financial and economic vacuum in the transitional period until the Palestinian side takes over the banking authority. Al-Qasim recalled that the Jordanian move came in response to a desire expressed by the Palestinians since the beginning of joint coordination which began with the peace process. The agreement was a result of this coordination, he added. Al-Qasim said that the decision to reopen Jordanian banks in the West Bank was made in 1985 within a joint agreement aimed at extending banking services which would have a vital effect on reactivating the economic conditions and enabling the Palestinian people to adhere to their land. One bank has been operating in the West Bank since 1986, which is the Cairo-Amman Bank. However, since the Israeli-Jordanian economic agreement was signed earlier this month on reopening Jordanian banks in the occupied territories, eight Jordanian banks have expressed interest to operate there.
