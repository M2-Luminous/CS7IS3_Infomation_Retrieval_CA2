The officials said Sirivut made the call in a half-hour meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata. Both Sirivut and Hata serve concurrently as foreign ministers and deputy prime ministers. Sirivut arrived in Tokyo earlier in the day accompanying Co-Premiers Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen to a two-day meeting of the International Committee on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC), which starts Thursday. He was quoted as saying that in order to further consolidate ties between Cambodia and Japan his government is considering an early reopening of its embassy in Tokyo. Since the fall of the Lon Nol government to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, the embassy in Tokyo's Akasaka District has been occupied by Cambodians of various political persuasions but it has not been functioning in an official capacity. Officials said Sirivut told Hata Cambodia is requesting assistance from the international community from the perspective that its own self-help efforts are most important. They said Hata called such an approach laudable and expressed hope that the ICORC meeting will prove successful in facilitating Cambodia's development. Hata said that if Cambodia's reconstruction from years of civil strife goes smoothly it could serve as a model for similar efforts in other parts of the world.
