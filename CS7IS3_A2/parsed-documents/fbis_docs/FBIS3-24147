For the purposes of these Rules: a) the term "member nations of the CIS" is understood to be nations that are members of the Commonwealth of Independent States who have signed the Agreement on Collaboration in the Sphere of Foreign Economic Activity (15 May 1992, Tashkent); b) the term "country of origin of goods" signifies a nation that is a member of the CIS in which a good was manufactured entirely or was subject to sufficient processing. The cumulative principle of origin may be employed when applying the criterion of sufficient processing, that is, those nations are considered to be a whole when there is consecutive processing of a good in member nations of the CIS; c) the term "criterion of sufficient processing" signifies a criterion, in accordance with which a good that two or more countries have taken part in producing is considered to originate from the country in which it was subject to the final substantial processing sufficient to impart its characteristic properties to it; d) the term "customs control" signifies the aggregate of measures performed by national customs bodies for the purpose of ensuring the observance of national legislation in customs matters, as well as national legislation and international treaties whose monitoring is entrusted to customs bodies; e) the term "goods" signifies any movable property, including thermal, electrical and other types of energy, that is moved across a customs border; f) the term "goods list" signifies the Goods List of Foreign Economic Activity (TN VED) based on the Coordinated System of Describing and Coding Goods and Combined Tariff-Statistical List of the European Community that is employed in the member nations of the CIS. The procedure for determining the country of origin of goods imported onto the customs territory of the member nations of the CIS from third countries and shipped to third countries from those nations is regulated by the national legislation of the member nations of the CIS. 1. A nation where a good was produced entirely or subjected to sufficient processing is considered to be the country of origin. 2. The following goods are considered to have been produced entirely in a given country: a) minerals extracted from its territory or territorial waters, continental shelf and seas, if the country has the exclusive right to the development of those mineral resources; b) plant products cultivated and harvested on its territory; c) live animals bred and grown in it; d) products obtained in that country from animals bred in it; e) products of the hunting, fishing and sea trades produced in it; f) products of sea trades extracted and/or produced in the world's oceans by the vessels of that country or vessels leased (chartered) by it; g) secondary raw materials and by-products that are the result of production and other operations performed in that country; h) the products of high technology obtained in outer space on spacecraft that belong to the given country or are leased by it; i) goods produced in a given country exclusively from the products mentioned in subclauses a--h of Paragraph 2. 3. When two or more countries participate in the production of a good, the origin of the good is determined in accordance with the criterion of "sufficient processing." 4. The criterion of "sufficient processing" may be expressed: a) by a rule requiring changes in the tariff category of the corresponding goods list, with a list of exceptions[.sup]1[/]; b) by a list of the production or technological processes that are sufficient or insufficient for the good to be considered as originating from the country where those processes took place; c) by a rule of ad valorem share, where the percentage share of the value of the materials used or added value reaches a set limit in the price of the ex plant price of the good being supplied. 5. In the event that the criteria for the origin of a good are not specially stipulated in relation to specific goods or a specific country (or countries), a general rule is applied, in accordance with which a good is considered to have been subjected to sufficient processing if a change in the good entry (classification code of the good) according to the Goods List at the level of any of the first four marks occurred. 6. In the event that the criterion of "sufficient processing" is expressed through an ad valorem share, the value indicators are computed: a) for imported materials: according to the customs value, that is, the value subject to customs charges on import (based on the CIF) or, in the event that their origin is unknown, according to the stipulated price of first sale on the territory of the country of production; b) for finished products: at the ex plant price or export price of the seller. 7. Items in dismantled or unassembled form that are delivered in several lots, where their shipment in one lot[.sup]2[/] is not possible under production or transport conditions, should be considered, according to the wishes of the importer, as a unified item from the standpoint of determining the origin[.sup]3[/]. 8. The origin of thermal and electrical energy, machinery, equipment and tooling used in the production of goods is not taken into account for the purposes of determining their origin. 9. A good is considered to originate from the country of export only in the event that the good does not conform to the criteria of origin stipulated by these Rules and the other conditions, but is procured directly from an enterprise or firm duly registered in the country of export and is imported via direct shipment from that country to the country of import. Goods that are transported across the territory of one or several countries as a consequence of geographical, transport, technical or economic reasons, as well as in their temporary import or storage on the territory of those conditions, also meet the requirement for direct shipment provided that the goods are at all times under the customs control of the transit country. Goods that are procured by an importer at exhibitions or fairs also meet the rules for direct shipment, provided that those goods are not used for purposes other than those exhibited after shipment to the exhibition or fair, and remain under customs control during the exhibition or fair. 10. The submission of a declaration-certificate (hereinafter, a certificate) of the origin of a good to the customs bodies of the country of import is necessary in order to attest the origin of a good in a given member nation of the CIS. 11. The certificate of origin is issued, in the export of goods from member nations of the CIS, by bodies of the country of origin of the good authorized to do so in accordance with national legislation. The member nations of the CIS exchange samples of the seals of bodies and the signatures of persons authorized to attest certificates. Certificates are considered to be invalid without submission of these samples, and the preferences stipulated by agreements on the trade regime do not extend to the goods. 12. A certificate should contain the following essential information about the good for which it is issued: a) the name and address of the exporter; b) the name and address of the importer; c) the means of transport and the routing (as far as is known); d) the quantity of pieces and the type of packing, and a description of th good containing all of the information necessary for identification of the good; e) the gross and net weight.[.sup]4[/] 13. The certificate of origin should unequivocably testify to the fact that the given good originates from the corresponding country, that is, it should contain: a) the written declaration of the exporter that the good meets the appropriate criterion of origin; b) written attestation of the authorized body that issued the certificate that the information submitted by the exporter in the certificate corresponds to reality. 14. The certificate of origin is submitted to customs bodies in typewritten form, without corrections, in the Russian language. 15. The certificate of origin is submitted together with the freight customs declaration and other documentation necessary for the performance of customs clearance. 16. A officially attested duplicate (copy) of a certificate of origin is accepted in the event of its loss. 17. The exporter may declare the country of origin of a good in an invoice, or other accompanying documents attached to the good, to attest to the origin of small lots of goods (values of up to 5,000 dollars U.S.). 18. In the event doubts arise regarding the validity of a certificate of origin or the information contained in it, the customs bodies may appeal to the authorized organizations that attested the certificate or to other authorized bodies of the country indicated as the country of origin of the goods with a well-founded request to report additional or clarifying information. 19. A good is not considered to originate from a given country until suitable confirmation of the origin or the requested information is furnished. 20. The failure to submit a properly completed certificate of origin or information on origin, as a general rule, is not grounds not to permit the good to pass. Customs may refuse passage only in the presence of sufficient grounds to assume that ths freight is originating from a country that is not subject to passage into the country of import in accordance with international agreements prevailing for that nation, and/or its national legislation. Goods whose origin has not been reliably established are permitted into the country of import, with a regard for the provisions of the second paragraph of this clause, with the payment of customs duties at the maximum customs tariff rate of the country of import. 21. Most favored status or a preferential status may be applied (or restored) for the goods indicated in the third paragraph of clause 20 provided suitable attestation is received on their origin no later than one year after the shipment (release) of the goods. Footnotes 1. The list of exceptions could contain: a) a list of the production or technological operations that, even though leading to a change in the tariff category, are not considered a sign of sufficient processing or are considered such only with the observance of certain conditions; b) a list of the production or technological operations that, even though they do not lead to changes in the tariff category, are considered to be a sign of sufficient processing with the observance of certain conditions. The conditions mentioned in subclauses a and b may pertain both to operations that are performed with a good and to the rule of the ad valorem share. 2. This rule is also applied in those cases where a lot has been broken up into several by mistake or by virtue of incorrect addressing. 3. The conditions for the application of this rule are: --the advance notification of import customs of the breakup of a dismantled or unassembled good into several lots with an indication of the reasons for the breakup, the detailed specification of each lot as referenced to the TN VED, the value and the country of origin of the goods that make up that lot; --the delivery of all lots from one country or one exporter; --the entry of all lots through the same customs office; --the delivery of all lots of goods within a time period that does not exceed six months from the date of the first shipment. 2. These values may be replaced with others, such as the quantity of units or the volume, when the weight of the good varies substantially in transporting or when those units are employed in standard fashion in relation to that type of product.
