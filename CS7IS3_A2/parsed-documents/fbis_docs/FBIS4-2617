Zhang Yan said: Peacekeeping operations, as an important means employed by the United Nations to safeguard international peace and security, play a useful role in preventing the expansion of conflicts and promoting the settlement of disputes; and the actions have received worldwide attention. However, because of the need to expand peacekeeping operations rapidly, they are confronted with many new problems. He said: The Chinese delegation maintains that the urgent task for the United Nations is, under the guidance of its charter, to draw up a set of universally acceptable and effective guiding principles so that peacekeeping operations will have a solid political and legal foundation. The issue that needs a priority solution is that peacekeeping operations must strictly abide by the aims and principles of the UN Charter so that the operations can maintain a correct political orientation; peacekeeping operations must adhere to settling disputes by peaceful means and the nonuse of force; and the UN Security Council must be cautious in making decisions and it must safeguard the United Nations' initiative and leading role in peacekeeping operations. According to a report, the United Nations has been engaged in 17 peacekeeping projects, and 71,816 soldiers and policemen from 70 countries are carrying out peacekeeping missions in hot spots around the world. Peacekeeping budgets and expenditures have also grown substantially along with the increase in peacekeeping missions. Reports say that the expenses for peacekeeping operations during the 1986-91 period were approximately $380 million per year on average but that expenses soared to $1.73 billion in 1992 and to approximately $3.6 billion in 1993.
