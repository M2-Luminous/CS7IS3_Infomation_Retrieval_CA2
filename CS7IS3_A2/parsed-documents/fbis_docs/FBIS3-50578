President Fidel Castro himself on 26 July announced the need to make changes on the island, which has been seriously battered by the tightening of the U.S. embargo and the crumbling of socialism in the former USSR and Eastern Europe. Cuba maintained 85 percent of its trade with this region. The Caribbean country's purchasing power fell from $8 billion in 1989 to 1.7 billion in 1993, for which the search and development of new revenue sources has become one of the main objectives in the struggle for national survival. Political analysts agree in stating that opening the economy to foreign capital was the measure with the most significant impact on the local and international scene. It was also the most realistic in a country that must now purchase everything its needs with freely exchangeable currency. The government also deregulated the holding of foreign currency to improve the government's income by way of the growing segment of the population that receives U.S. dollars from tourism or from relatives living abroad. Some experts affirm that one decision the community pleasantly welcomed was the creation of the Basic Production Cooperative Units (UBPC) in the agriculture sector. This, in fact, constitutes a new concept in land exploitation methods. By virtue of a government mandate, state-owned lands were ceded for an indefinite period of time to groups of Cubans interested in cultivating them. These groups, in the end, will share the product of the sales of their harvest to the state. Fidel Castro said that this new policy improves the application of the socialist principle of pay according to work and allows better economic control of resources. Up to now, the weight of agricultural production was primarily on the shoulders of state farms. The extreme shortage of oil the island has experienced this year, the lack of manpower, and the inefficient production levels threaten the ability to produce sufficient food through intensive agricultural activity. According to local sources, the UBPC's offer greater control over production levels. It is expected the over 1 million Cubans will join these units, lured also by the possibility of cultivating food to supply their own family as well as increase their income. Local media reports point out that the next 365 days will be another period of significant changes in Cuba, to include an in-depth reorganization of the state apparatus. This issue will be one of the topics of debate at the Cuban parliamentary sessions on 27 and 28 December. The assembly is seeking ways to revive the country's domestic finances, which have deteriorated due to the excess amount of money in circulation -- calculated at approximately 10 billion pesos (equal to the same amount in U.S. dollars at the official exchange rate). Government officials say that the assembly will analyze the application of a tax system and other measures, pursuant to the labor and salary reorganization measures directed at achieving greater economic efficiency and encouraging production. The TRABAJADORES weekly recently reported that personnel rosters were to be reorganized, in light of the lack of jobs for the number of people in the work force. The publication, mouthpiece for the Cuban Workers Federation, says that this labor reorganization would be a gradual process, to prevent any major impact on household economies. Carlos Lage, a member of the Politburo of the Communist Party of Cuba and secretary of Council of Ministers, said that workers "will be moved to other centers. If this is not possible, they will be given part of their salary. No one will be left adrift." Another novelty: Cuban television carried, during its coverage of the recent Central American and Caribbean Games in Puerto Rico, broadcast advertisements for products and businesses for the first time in the Cuban revolution's 35 years. JUVENTUD REBELDE, the newspaper published by the Union of Young Communists, defended the publicity saying that it does not harm "the pure essence of our ideas" and allows the entry of currency; so necessary for the survival of the largest of the Antilles islands. As the Cubans see it, the logic behind the changes is the same logic that society applies to maintain this commendable social balance and its survival. The ways for change will be never-ending, but all will follow the same political line: to find a more stimulating style of socialism and economy.
