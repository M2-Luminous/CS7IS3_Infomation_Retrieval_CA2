"Meshkov has two modes of action before him: either really to begin to fulfil his election campaign promises, which may lead to a considerable complication of the situation on the peninsula and around it or come to see that talks almost on a par with presidents Boris Yeltsin and Leonid Kravchuk, provided a certain status quo is observed, are much more preferable than the role of the leader of an embattled enclave". At the same time the newspaper's correspondent points out that much in the Crimean president's position depends on Moscow. "If Russia makes it clear to the Crimean president that his speedy drift to Russian borders will hardly be viewed positively and if it becomes clear to the Crimea that its economic position will worsen rather than improve in the event of a conflict with Ukraine, the new Crimean leader, whther he likes it or not, will have to be cautious both in his actions and statements. "If the Russian Federation leaders view the Crimean president as their best ally in putting pressure on Ukraine and regard any Crimean decisions as a guide for their own action, then one may have no doubt that, following an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian relations, many Russian republics would develop a natural desire to follow the Crimean example and make use of the advantageous precedent in the interests of their own sovereignty". IZVESTIYA on the same subject: "The election of Meshkov as the president of the Crimea creates a fundamentally new situation in Russo-Ukrainian relations". "Until now, calls for the Crimea's secession from Ukraine and accession to Russia were issued only during demonstrations and rallies by opposition parties, which saved Moscow the trouble of officially reacting to them. The picture has changed after January 30: a person who does not conceal his pro-Russian sympathies and who is firmly intent on holding a referendum on the Crimea's status soon came to power in the Crimea. "Kiev resolutely opposes the idea: It is not difficult to visualise the outcome of the polling. If the new Crimean leader shows persistence, insisting on a referendum, the situation on the peninsula may get sharply aggravated, threatening to bring about serious complications in Russo-Ukrainian relations as well". TRUD on the election of Crimean president: Kiev, while stating that it has nothing against the election of a president in the Crimea, "at the same time hurried to adopt such amendments to the Ukrainian Constitution, which enable the president of the republic to call the Crimea to `order' if the two republics' positions diverge". PRAVDA quotes Meshkov as saying in an interview that "peace and national accord are the most important thing for people in the Crimea." "There will always be room for both Ukrainians, Tatars and Russians in the Crimea -- for all those who are prepared to work honestly here," Meshkov said. SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA believes that following the election of Yuriy Meshkov as the president "the Crimea has chosen its destiny" by quite definitely declaring its will for the establishment of closer contacts with Russia. ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI on prospects for the development of reforms in the Russian Federation and an economic policy which the country's reorganised government will pursue. The newspaper believes that the new government "will have to look for some different approaches" to the solution of economic issues. "This is quite an urgent necessity but one gathers the impression that the premier and his closet entourage fear 'anti-market' labels so much that they do not reveal their plans so far," points out the author of an analytical article on the subject. At the same time he expresses an opinion that an adjustment to the policy implies "enhancement of state economic regulation and limitation on the freedom of operation of market mechanisms". Academician Andrey Zhukov, member of the presidential council, is of the opinion that there is no rollback in the reform process. At the same time, he points out that "the tendencies that manifest themselves now took shape long ago". "They were laid down by the old government and in no way created a good climate for entrepreneurial activities in Russia". KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) on the military service under contract. According to the newspaper, more than 120,000 people now serve under contract in Russia, which has helped to raise the manning status of the Army and Navy by 10 per cent. According to a recent presidential decree, there will be another 150,000 professionals in the Army soon. IZVESTIYA carries an interview with former Belarusian parliament chief Stanislav Shushkevich. He remarked in particular that "through the efforts of the Belarusian Government, not a single market mechanism works in the republic now".
