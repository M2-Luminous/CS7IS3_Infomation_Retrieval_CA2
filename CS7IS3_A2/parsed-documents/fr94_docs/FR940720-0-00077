FR940720-0-00077 FR940720-0-00006 c. Use of California Sampling and/or Testing Methodologies. Section 80.81(h) allows refiners and importers of California gasoline to use sampling and test methods that are set forth in the California reformulated gasoline regulations, in lieu of those methods prescribed under §80.46 for the federal reformulated gasoline program. This provision is being revised to clarify that these California-approved sampling and test methods may be used only with California gasoline, and that these methods may not be used to satisfy the sampling and testing requirements for reformulated or conventional gasoline that does not meet the definition of California gasoline. B. Anti-Dumping Regulations (40 CFR Part 80, Subpart E) 1. Standards Applicable to Refiners and Importers (§80.101) a. Compliance Baseline Formula. Section 80.101(f)(4) currently provides that refiners and importers who use an individual 1990 baseline, and who increase their gasoline production volume above a certain level, must calculate a compliance baseline for each averaging period. EPA has combined the separate formulas for ``V eq '' and ``CB i '' in §80.101(f)(4) into a single, simpler formula. In addition, EPA has specified that the denominator of the compliance baseline equation includes the volume of California gasoline. The final rule excluded the volume of California gasoline produced in 1995 and thereafter from the compliance baseline equation, but this exclusion rendered this equation invalid for refiners of California gasoline because the numerator of this equation includes gasoline produced for the California market in 1990. In order to constitute a valid comparison of the volume of gasoline produced in 1990 versus the volume produced in 1995 and thereafter, both the numerator and the denominator of the compliance baseline equation must contain the volume of gasoline produced for the California market. This approach for including California gasoline in the compliance baseline equation is equivalent to the requirement that reformulated gasoline produced for use in covered areas outside the State of California must be included in the denominator of the compliance baseline equation. The definitions of the factors ``DB i ,'' ``CB i ,'' and ``B i ,'' are clarified to bring them in conformance with the terms used in the complex model calculations under §80.101(g). b. Compliance Calculations. Section 80.101(g), entitled ``Compliance Calculations,'' is restructured to reverse the order of the simple model calculation formula currently in §80.101(g)(1)(i) and the formula for determining the average value for the parameter being evaluated currently in §80.101(g)(1)(ii). This organizational change is necessary because in order to perform the simple model calculation for exhaust benzene emissions, the refiner or importer must first determine the average value for certain parameters. In addition, and for purposes of clarity, the heading ``Simple Model Calculations'' is inserted as a new paragraph (i) under §80.101(g)(1), and the heading ``Complex Model Calculations'' is inserted as a new paragraph (ii) under §80.101(g)(1). These changes restructure the compliance calculations in a logical sequence that will make this section clearer for compliance purposes. The formula definition of ``SG i '' in §80.101(g)(1)(i)(A) is amended to clarify that the specific gravity term only applies to calculations involving sulfur. The definitions of the factors ``BZ'' and ``AR'' under §80.101(g)(1)(i)(B), pertaining to compliance calculations for exhaust benzene emissions under the simple model, are clarified as to how these are calculated by expanding them to read ``calculated per paragraph (g)(1)(i)(A) of this section.'' Section 80.101(g)(1)(iii), (g)(1)(iv), and (g)(1)(v), pertaining to complex model calculations, are consolidated and simplified as a new §80.101(g)(1)(ii).
