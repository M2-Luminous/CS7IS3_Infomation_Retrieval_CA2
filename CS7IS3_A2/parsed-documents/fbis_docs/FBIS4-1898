The full text of the interview follows: [TA KUNG PAO] Looking toward the next few years of the post- transition period of Hong Kong, how will Guangdong and Hong Kong cooperate? Have any new plans and measures been promulgated which can help the two places to converge with one another on economic affairs, trade, and key projects and to jointly fight against crime? [Zhu] Economic exchanges and cooperation between Guangdong and Hong Kong has been getting closer and closer since we started implementing the policy of reform and opening up. Approximately 80 percent of the trade volume of the entire province goes through Hong Kong, and 80 percent of direct investment by Chinese and foreign businessmen which utilizes foreign capital originates from Hong Kong. Likewise, our province's rapid economic growth during the 15 years of reform and opening up, the vigorous development of joint-venture enterprises, and the investment in Hong Kong by enterprises from our province has also played a vital role in promoting Hong Kong's prosperity. At present, the economic ties between Guangdong and Hong Kong are as close as lips and teeth. Over the next few years of the post-transition period, Hong Kong will be able to bring into full play its superiority as an international financial, trade, transport, and information center. At the same time, our province will be able to bring into full play our superiority of having rich human and land resources, a full complement of production industries, low production costs, and a certain level of scientific and technological strength. While supplementing one another, our cooperation in many areas can advance to a new stage, such as the construction and convergence of infrastructure, the adjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure, the vigorous development of new- and high-technological industries, and the opening up of the international market. Moreover, the two places can further cooperate with one another in fighting crime. As far as economic cooperation and trade is concerned, we are formulating the following plans: (1) Guangdong and Hong Kong can work through various channels, such as business circles, the financial sector, various social groups, and government departments. These exchanges can take many forms, such as conducting reciprocal visits and holding symposiums, trade fairs, and sales promotions to explore and enhance economic exchange and cooperation between the two places. (2) Guangdong will widen the scope of foreign economic cooperation, will improve the investment atmosphere, will create a market environment for fair competition, and will vigorously attract financial groups from Hong Kong which have good reputations and abundant funds to invest in public utilities and basic industries, including power, communications, and some large industrial projects (for example, ethylene, oil refining, iron and steel, automobile, and other projects.) (3) Guangdong will utilize these channels and client relationships to open up a plural market, will vigorously take part in the international division of labor and competition, and will make our own efforts in maintaining economic prosperity in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Regarding convergence on key projects, the construction of all key projects in our province will be stringently proved in a scientific manner. For those that are linked to Hong Kong, all factors -- including social, economic, environmental, and security issues -- will be carefully considered. At present, the concerned departments from both sides are making frequent contacts with one another to accomplish the work of converging key projects. This year, we are prepared to hold a symposium on the development of transportation and communications between Guangdong and Hong Kong, with the key lying in coordinating the development and convergence of transportation and communications between the two places. As far as the task of fighting crime is concerned, we intend to enhance our cooperation with the Hong Kong side in the following areas: First, efforts will be made to exchange more information on crime, to quickly inform one another about criminal activities, and to provide timely assistance to the other side in finding clues and investigating and prosecuting criminals. Second, efforts will be made to enhance cooperation in fighting all types of crimes, particularly in cracking cases of armed crimes, kidnapping, drug trafficking, smuggling, and swindling, pursuing and capturing those listed as wanted criminals at large, and retrieving spoils. Third, efforts will be made to enhance cooperation in cracking down on triad crime. As far as the triad issue is concerned, our principles are as follows: (1) Overseas triad societies are not allowed, under whatever circumstances, to seek development and expand their influence on the mainland, and we will resolutely crack down on and ban any triad activities that are found; (2) Overseas triad elements who violate the law and commit crimes in the mainland will be severely punished in accordance with the law; (3) Overseas triad elements and all criminals who have committed offenses should harbor no illusions about escaping to the mainland, as we will pursue and capture them once they have been found and will turn them over to the police at their place of origin; (4) We will fight against activities conducted by criminal rings on the mainland which are triad groups by nature. They should never be tolerated. Fourth, efforts will be made to enhance cooperation and exchange in anticrime skills, and the two places will take concerted actions to discuss this issue and study new skills. [TA KUNG PAO] As Guangdong is going to select a site for the construction of its second nuclear power station, and Zhuhai is gong to build the Lingding Yang Bridge, which will link up with Tuen Mun. How are the plans for these projects progressing? [Zhu] Regarding the selection of a site for the construction of our second nuclear power station, because our province is rapidly developing its economy and has a great demand for energy, it will not work if we simply rely on coal, petroleum, and other conventional energy sources. Instead, we must have a multiple structure, and, hence, it is necessary to vigorously develop nuclear power. From a long-term point of view, this is an important way to solve the problem of the demand for energy in our province. In order to develop and to meet the power supply needs for the next century, it is not only necessary for Guangdong to build a second nuclear power station but third and fourth ones as well. The work of selecting the sites for the second and third power stations has been carried out for many years, and both Lingao of Daya Wan and Dongping of Yangjiang have been determined ideal sites. Of course, the construction project of the second nuclear power station must be finally examined and approved by the State Council. As far as the site selection and construction of the second and third nuclear power stations is concerned, I know the people of Hong Kong are very concerned about it. I can definitely tell all of you that a set of strict surveillance measures will be used in the area within 5 km of the stations and another set will apply between 5 and 50 km. In any case, in building the new power stations, we will follow Premier Li Peng's instructions that "safety must be the top priority." The construction of the Lingding Yang Bridge in Zhuhai is a project which will straddle the centuries and a requirement of reform, opening up, and economic development. It plays an important part in perfecting the layout of the coastal highways in western Guangdong and in linking up with Hong Kong and Macao. The feasibility report for the Lingding Yang Bridge project has been completed and examined, and the project will be implemented after receiving state approval. The construction of Lingding Bridge was an original idea of Zhuhai. The section from Zhuhai to Qiao Dao will be built in the first phase, and the section from Qiao Dao to Hong Kong will be built after 1997. When the time comes, I believe that it will be much easier to talk to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Regional Government. [TA KUNG PAO] How will Guangdong curb commodity price rises? [Zhu] This year, our province wants to keep the overall level of commodity price rises within 12 percent, and our government will try every possible means to achieve this goal, even though it will be quite difficult to do so. First, we will strengthen macroscopic regulation and strive to keep total supply and demand in balance; in particular, we will guard against excessively rapid growth in fixed-assets investment and consumption. Second, we will pay close attention to the production and supply of the residents' daily necessities and try to keep the prices of the "rice bag" and "shopping basket" stable. Third, we will further implement price reform in a timely and moderate manner. Fourth, we will strengthen the administration, supervision, and inspection of commodity prices and of charges. Our government will strive to properly control and manage prices and charges which are monopolistic, compulsory, and protective in nature and which belong to public welfare. Meanwhile, the practices of arbitrary price rises and unreasonable charges will be sternly punished in accordance with the pricing laws and policies so as to maintain the price order of fair competition and safeguard consumers' interests. Fifth, more work will be done to give publicity to and explain reforms in such key areas as taxation, finance, investment, and prices and to strive to eliminate man-made price rises. Of course, the control we have over inflation is determined to a very large extent by the macroeconomic environment of the state, which will take vigorous measures to keep the scale of fixed-asset investment and currency circulation in check so as to control the overall level of commodity prices. The issue of price increases is closely related to the people's lives, and governments at all levels must make efforts to regulate commodity prices. [TA KUNG PAO] The central authorities have implemented key reforms in many areas this year. Will Guangdong make some major breakthroughs in financial and taxation reform? [Zhu] The central authorities have implemented major reforms in finance and taxation. Our province will strictly carry out the reform measures taken by the central authorities and will introduce some reform measures under the reform framework devised by the central authorities. As far as financial work is concerned, we must fulfill the following tasks: (1) We must support and help the provincial branch of the People's Bank of China to transform its functions and strengthen monetary control, and we must also transform the operating mechanism of professional banks, take gradual steps to transform them into state-owned commercial banks which bear their own risk and are truly responsible for their profits and losses, and implement assets-liabilities ratio administration. (2) We will take gradual steps to run urban cooperative banks on a trial basis in major cities. (3) We will vigorously seek the state's approval for the establishment of the Overseas Chinese Bank. (4) We will create conditions to attract more foreign banks and PRC-invested banks from Hong Kong and Macao to set up branches in our province in accordance with the law, and we will also encourage competitive financial organizations to set up overseas branches. (5) We will develop and perfect the provincial monetary market, which mainly relies on bank financing, which is strictly administered, centralized and open, and which stresses fair competition. We will also accelerate the formation of a financial center in Guangzhou and will set up a standardized and united provincial financing center as soon as possible. Guangdong and Shanghai are simultaneously creating conditions to accelerate the establishment of a financial center. Shanghai, the historical financial center which is now implementing a great plan, has vacated approximately a dozen large buildings in order to run financial businesses and set up the financial center of the Far East. Guangdong will set up the financial center of South China. These two centers will have their own particular superiority and will not be able to be replaced by the other. Hong Kong is an international financial center with decades of experience. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao should cooperate with one another, and this is precisely Guangdong's superiority. [TA KUNG PAO] When Guangdong cooperates with foreign enterprises in various large-scale construction projects -- for example, the Guangzhou subway and ethylene projects -- how important are political considerations? [Zhu] When cooperating with foreign enterprises in large-scale construction projects, we always insist on considering each case according to our national interests, our industrial policies, and the needs of our national economic development on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Taking the Guangzhou subway project as an example, we bore six principles in mind when choosing partners: (1) They were to possess high prestige and have had concrete experience similar to that required by the Guangzhou subway project; (2) the equipment and systems provided must conform to the functional requirements stated in the letter of requirements for introducing equipment for the Guangzhou subway; (3) the equipment provided should be better in terms of technology, price, and capital (loans); (4) the equipment and systems provided should be safer and more advanced, mature, and reliable and must have a certain proven track record of operation; (5) the overall package should be favorable to project management and smooth project implementation and can also lower the overall project investment scale; and (6) we chose the best by upholding the principle of fair competition in line with our country's overall economic, trade, and foreign policies. Good inter-state relations constitute favorable conditions for our cooperation with foreign enterprises. If inter- state relations are in a state of abnormal development, they will inevitably affect our cooperation with enterprises from these countries. [TA KUNG PAO] As Guangdong and Hong Kong are closely related, some of the reform measures introduced by Guangdong will immediately affect Hong Kong investors. How have you taken this into consideration? [Zhu] Some of the current reform measures introduced by our country -- for example, foreign exchange and foreign trade restructuring -- will help our country administer foreign exchange in accordance with market standards. Meanwhile, the unitary and manageable floating exchange rate, which is set on the basis of market demand and supply, will further strengthen the role of market regulation in our country's foreign trade activities. The unification of exchange rates can settle the conflict that foreign businessmen encountered in the past when their registered capital was calculated at the official rate, but the profits sent out of the country were calculated at the swap rate. The foreign exchange administration for foreign-invested enterprises will remain unchanged, and this will be favorable to foreign investors in China, including investors from Hong Kong. [TA KUNG PAO] What measures are being taken to guarantee the safe production of a large number of foreign-invested enterprises and to safeguard the rights and interests and well-being of their staff and workers? [Zhu] Over the past few years, the provincial people's congress and the provincial government have formulated a series of laws and regulations on guaranteeing safe production of enterprises and safeguarding the working rights and interests of staff and workers, including: The Guangdong Provincial Regulations on Working Safety and Health, the Guangdong Provincial Regulations on the Labor Administration of Foreign-Invested Enterprises, and the Guangdong Provincial Regulations on the Working Rights and Interests of Enterprise Staff and Workers. These regulations are equally applicable to foreign-invested enterprises. In the future, we will vigorously strengthen law enforcement and supervision and guarantee the implementation of the regulations. We are taking effective measures to settle the existing problems and loopholes. [TA KUNG PAO] In some counties and cities, laborers from other provinces outnumber the number of local laborers. What is Guangdong's attitude towards laborers from other provinces? [Zhu] Laborers from other provinces make great contributions to Guangdong's economic development. At present, more than 6.5 million laborers from other provinces are working in Guangdong, thus meeting our province's labor needs in the process of economic development. Meanwhile, laborers from other provinces can learn skills and become more capable when they are working in our province, which is also an important channel for bringing Guangdong's influence and its "window" role into play. Therefore, we welcome laborers from other provinces to work in Guangdong. However, we must strengthen the administration and arrangement of laborers from other provinces who are working in Guangdong and recruit them according to our province's needs of economic development in an organized and planned manner. At present, the labor departments of our province have established ties with their counterparts in eight neighboring provinces to enhance cooperation in this respect.
