Rodriguez Vargas said that there is a need for a clearer policy regarding cases such as the presence of U.S. Marines in Juanchaco, on the Atlantic coast, and the incident involving the incursion by Venezuelan troops in Saravena, Arauca. In the case of Venezuela, Colombia has been too complaisant regarding the defense of our sovereignty. Some believe that President Cesar Gaviria is seeking the neighboring country's vote for the post of OAS secretary general, and have gone as far as to publish cartoons such as these. [Begin Rodriguez recording] I hope President Gaviria does become the OAS secretary general, but it should not be at the expense of our national sovereignty. [end recording] According to Gustavo Rodriguez, six of the seven meetings the commission has held have addressed the Venezuelan issue. Colombia first stepped back fearing Carlos Andres Perez' fall from power. Then it desisted in favor of the election process in Venezuela, and finally because of pressure from the Venezuelan press. SEMANA magazine reported on Gaviria's recent efforts. It says he spent his vacation on the telephone trying to recruit votes for the secretary generalship. He was after the votes of Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Panama, Ecuador, and, of course, Venezuela, which has Miguel Angel Burelli running for that same post. According to the magazine, Gaviria even contacted Burelli. Experts on international policy believe Venezuela will support Costa Rica, and its candidate Bernd Neihaus, instead of Colombia. They would benefit more by supporting a Caribbean candidate than a Colombian. Experts also say that President Gaviria must choose between his aspirations at the OAS and defending national sovereignty.
