Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, by Viktor Trushkov, PRAVDA correspondent, ``Science Suffers From Starvation''; the first paragraph is an introduction, the last paragraph is a postscript] [Text] V. Shevelukha, academician, Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, deputy chairman of the Committee on Education, Culture and Science of the Russian Federation Duma, answers questions from a PRAVDA correspondent, Viktor Trushkov. Trushkov: Viktor Stepanovich, permit me to congratulate you: insofar as I recall, for the first time in the history of Russian legislative authority the parliament has included in its agenda a special law on science. Shevelukha: Not simply on science, but also on the critical situation in science. It is true that such an approach did not sit well with some deputies. Until now there have been no programs for the reorganization of scientific research in our country. Accordingly, the Committee on Education, Culture and Science of the State Duma decided to draw the attention of the Duma, government leaders, ministries and departments to this vitally important problem. In world and former national practice 60-67% of all the appropriations for science were spent on fundamental research, 25-30% went to applied research and 8-10% went to technical and other development work. Such an infrastructure of expenditures on science has been the case for many years in the United States and other well-developed countries. So it also was both in the USSR and in Russia up to 1990 inclusive. Now everything is different. First slowly, and then at an accelerated rate, the government of Russia began to reduce the amounts of budgeted funding for science and by late 1993 had reduced it to 0.7% of the GNP. The financial bind in science first of all affected salaries of scientists. In late 1993 they received from 30 to 70 thousand rubles per month, which is two or three times less than the average wage of all categories of workers in the country. The payment of even this miserly wage is constantly in arrears at many institutes and institutions of higher and intermediate education. Trushkov: Is it not fundamental science which has suffered most severely? There is no real market for its product. Shevelukha: To be sure. Here development work cannot be turned immediately into a product which would make it possible to obtain additional sums for the funding of science. As a result, there has been a rapid curtailment of research in the fields of mathematics, physics, electronics, information science, theoretical biology and the most important branches of the humanities. Highly qualified scientists are leaving the laboratories and institutes for other spheres of activity and are going abroad. Becoming convinced of the growing catastrophe, the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy has attempted to bring about additional injections of funds. A fund for fundamental research was established. But its resources are negligible: 3% of all expenditures on science. It was clear that this was not enough. Then the government decided to ``rescue'' science in another way: designate science centers for the most important priorities in fundamental and applied sciences, based on already existing institutes. But this also will scarcely do the job. First of all, where is the guarantee that a proper choice will be made of the future priorities in the field of fundamental research? The entire history of world science gives evidence that such priorities arise in the course of the internal logic of development of science itself, not on the basis of the prevision of government officials. And second, the organization of so-called science centers in accordance with the ``latest'' concepts of the Ministry of Science and Technical Policy will inevitably result in the elimination of the solid front of fundamental research making up the optimum infrastructure of science, and also to the shifting of the greater part of expenditures from the sphere of the fundamental sciences into the field of technological development work. Trushkov: Recently foreign sponsors have appeared in Russian science. Their assistance is widely heralded. And what is the effect? Shevelukha: In actual practice this assistance for the time being for the most part has a propagandistic character and is being made available in inadequate, symbolic amounts. But it is accompanied, as a rule, by the collection of highly important information on the principal research directions, on scientific priorities, on the structure and attainments of Russian science. Judge for yourself: Russian scientists each receive $500 in one small grant (donative sum for a high-priority purposeful project) from the International Soros Fund. Three years in a row the World Bank has promised to render assistance to Russian agrarian science. Many private proposals arrive from abroad for our scientists asking that they carry out special-order priority tasks in Russian or foreign laboratories, with their results being sent abroad. But, indeed, it is well known that almost all those who are rendering assistance to Russian science are pursuing the objective of adapting and using the powerful scientific and technical potential of Russia in the interests of their own countries. ``echelon of science'' -- in technological research? Shevelukha: There also the conditions are pitiful. I will cite an example from a sphere close to me. Due to the reduction in state support there is a sharp decline in research not only in theoretical biology, but also in bioengineering. Laboratories are closing and specialists are departing for abroad. But it is precisely by modern bioengineering methods that in the next few years throughout the entire world there will be a qualitative improvement in plants, animals and microorganisms used in medicine, agriculture and in the processing and food industry. Unfortunately, none of this is being taken into account by the leaders of the country. Meanwhile, in the United States, in the European countries, in Japan, and during recent years also in China, India, Vietnam and in many countries of Africa and Latin America national bioengineering programs are being developed and applied. But we made the first breakthrough. Trushkov: The picture which you have drawn is a joyless one. The experience of Soviet science, if it is not being slighted, is being cast aside. But there is still world experience. Two different approaches to the choice of a state scientific and technical policy are known. First, the ``American'' variant, in which there is assurance of a broad front of fundamental research carried out by budgeted and other financial sources in the United States. The research results are used both for national needs and for the world market. Second, the ``Japanese'' variant, in which most of the new technologies are based on the purchase of patents from abroad and on their basis the latest national industry is organized. The high competitiveness in production makes up for the cost of acquiring patents and makes it possible to create their own scientific potential. Which of these routes is more acceptable for Russia? Shevelukha: Neither one of them is suitable in its pure form. We need our own way in the development of science and industrial technologies. And, in particular, under the present-day conditions. It essentially involves our own research in priority fields. This is much cheaper than the purchase of patents. Only in this case is it possible to ensure a gradual reduction in the volumes of importation of the latest technologies and the creation of our own competitive production of products with a high scientific input for our country and for sale on the world market. Precisely for this reason it is entirely inadmissible that there be a sharp reduction in space programs because there is an ongoing precipitous narrowing of the possibilities for producing the latest technologies in almost all economic branches. Trushkov: But not being concerned about the future, may political favorites not put the focus on applied research? Shevelukha: The reduction of budgeted funding has undermined the basis for the successful development of many priority aspects of applied research. As an example, I will once again cite a sphere which is close to me. The importance of plant selection and animal breeding is obvious to all; it exerts an enormous influence on the solution of acute agrarian and economic problems in the country as a whole. Precisely in these fields of applied science in the not distant past Russian scientists attained outstanding results which received world recognition. The genofund of varieties and hybrids of plants, animals and birds which they formed served as a basis for major achievements in plant selection and animal breeding in many countries. If today the good results of selection still persist in Russia it is due only to the enthusiasm of scientists of the older and middle generations. Despite the wretched wages, the lack of attention to it on the part of the state, they continue to manifest scientific zeal. During 1993 345 new varieties and hybrids of agricultural plants were developed and 182 were regionalized. More than 4000 varieties and hybrids have been developed and regionalized in Russia. This represents enormous national wealth. But the enthusiasm of selection specialists will soon dry up and the agrarian sector of the economy will have to rely on the old store of varieties and breeds. However, even that paultry economic support to selection science which was provided for by the Law on Selection Attainments, adopted in 1993 and signed by V. N. Yeltsin, unfortunately is not being delivered. The Finance Ministry and the Economics Ministry still refuse to carry out the economic measures for supporting selection work provided for in the law. Meanwhile the level of budgeted funding for selection work in the country is already less than 30% of the needs. Trushkov: But is it possible that applied science will begin to flourish with a changeover to a market economy? Possibly the scientists in this sphere, whose ``democrats'' are accused of inability to master market mechanisms, are responsible. Shevelukha: To be sure, under conditions of entry into the market scientists working in the applied science sphere must learn to advertise and market their scientific products. And this also applies to research of a technological nature in all scientific fields. But try to visualize a situation in which a talented scientist is forced to use more than half his time allocated for scientific research in seeking a buyer and sale of his product. This is a squandering of the national wealth. A scientist should be engaged in research work. Now many branch scientific research institutes are seeking different self- funding methods. The institutes and experimental stations of the Russian Academy of Agricultural Sciences, for example, cover almost of the expenditures in their activity by the sale of seeds, breeding cattle and vaccines, by contracting for the introduction of scientific advances and by other kinds of commercial activity. But in this case scientists are burdened by work which is not really their own and there is a decrease in the efficiency of scientific research. Conclusion No. 1 -- more than half the expenditures on applied research must be covered by the state budget. For covering the second half of the expenditures it would be possible to enlist commercial organizations engaged in the sale of scientific products. But government agencies should be concerned about such a dual source of organization and funding of science. Trushkov: Is there hope that the State Duma will assist in the survival of Russian science? Shevelukha: I think that it will. The adoption of reasonable laws favoring a rebirth rather than the suffocating of science is the primary intent of the parliament. Postscript -- The State Duma has adopted a decree entitled ``On the Critical Situation in Russian Science.'' In this decree it is proposed that the government examine the problem of ensuring the preservation and further development of the scientific potential of the country on the basis of priority funding of fundamental and promising practical research, establishing a commission for developing mechanisms for the funding of science, working out a program of state support for the entry of national scientific and development work into the world market, setting up a fund for the funding of expenditures on the patenting of scientific attainments abroad and formulating a program of measures for preserving the personnel base of science. The Duma spoke out for the granting of tax privileges to scientific, planning, design and educational institutions. It considers it to be inadmissible that monies for the funding of higher education be transferred to subjects of the Russian Federation and requires that in 1994 institutions of higher and intermediate education be funded from the federal budget.
