Subpart 623.4_Use of Recovered Material 623.470 Affirmative procurement program for recovered materials. 623.471 Purpose. This section establishes the Department of State's Affirmative Procurement Program for Recovered Materials in accordance with Section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) (42 U.S.C. 6962, Pub. L. 94&hyph;580). Section 6002 requires that each agency develop an affirmative procurement plan to assure that items composed of recovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practical and which is consistent with Federal procurement law. It requires that preference be given in procurement programs to the purchase of items containing recycled materials identified in guidelines promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Executive Order 12780, Federal Agency Recycling and the Council on Federal Recycling and Procurement Policy, directed implementation of cost effective affirmative procurement programs for recycled items. 623.472 Applicability. The affirmative procurement program is applicable to all domestic acquisition of items currently designated by an EPA guideline or by future guidelines promulgated by EPA. The requirements of this section are not applicable to acquisitions made and/or performed outside the United States or its possessions. 623.473 Definitions. Affirmative procurement program is a program which ensures that items composed of recovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practicable, consistent with Federal procurement law. There are four components to an affirmative procurement program: (1) A preference program; (2) A promotion program; (3) Procedures for requiring, obtaining and verifying estimates and certifications of recovered materials content; and (4) An annual review and monitoring. Designated item is an item that has been designated in an EPA procurement guideline as an item that is or can be produced using recovered materials whose procurement will advance the purpose of RCRA. Minimum-content standard is the minimum content of recovered materials that a designated item must contain pursuant to specifications implementing the Department's preference program. Postconsumer recovered materials are waste materials recovered from retail stores, office buildings, homes and so forth after they have passed through their end usage as a consumer item. Waste paper includes all items from the first two categories above in addition to forest residues, and manufacturing and other wastes. Procurement guidelines are guidelines issued by the EPA pursuant to Section 6002 of RCRA: (1) Identifying items that are or can be produced with recovered materials and where procurement will advance the objectives of the Act; and (2) Providing recommended practices for the procurement of such items. Recovered materials are waste materials and by-products that have been recovered or diverted from solid waste, not including those materials and by-products generated from, and commonly reused within, an original manufacturing process. Unreasonable price is the price for products containing recovered materials which exceeds alternatives made with virgin materials by 10 percent or more, and which the requirements office initiating the acquisition substantiates as exorbitant. 623.474 EPA guidelines.
