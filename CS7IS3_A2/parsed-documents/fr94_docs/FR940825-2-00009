ACTION: Notice of Final Results of Antidumping Duty Administrative Reviews. SUMMARY: On December 30, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published the preliminary results of two administrative reviews of the antidumping duty order on stainless steel hollow products (SSHP) from Sweden. We have completed these reviews and determined the margins for Sandvik AB, AB Sandvik Steel, and Sandvik Steel Company (collectively, Sandvik) to be 3.65 percent for the period May 22, 1987 through November 30, 1988, and 1.33 percent for the period December 1, 1988 through November 30, 1989. EFFECTIVE DATE: August 25, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: David Mason Jr. or Richard Herring, Office of Countervailing Duty Compliance, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482&hyph;3389. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background On December 3, 1987, the Department published in the Federal Register an antidumping duty order on SSHP from Sweden (52 FR 45985, as amended, 57 FR 52761). On December 5, 1988, pursuant to the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (53 FR 48004) of the order for the period May 22, 1987 through November 30, 1988, Sandvik requested that the Department conduct an administrative review. On December 19, 1989, pursuant to the Department's notice of ``Opportunity to Request Administrative Review'' (54 FR 52436) of the order for the period December 1, 1988 through November 30, 1989, Sandvik again requested that the Department conduct an administrative review. On December 30, 1993, the Department published the preliminary results of these administrative reviews (58 FR 69332). We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminary results. On March 16, 1994, we received comments from Sandvik. The Department has completed these administrative reviews in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act). Scope of Reviews The merchandise covered by these reviews is stainless steel hollow products, including pipes, tubes, hollow bars and blanks of circular cross section, containing over 11.5 percent chromium by weight. This merchandise is currently classified under subheadings 7304.41.00 and 7304.49.00 of the Harmonized Tariff System (HTS). Prior to January 1, 1989, this merchandise was classified under subheadings 610.5130, 610.5202, 610.5229 and 610.5230 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). Although the HTS and TSUSA subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, the written description of the scope of these reviews remains dispositive. Analysis of the Comments Received Based upon our analysis of the comments received, we have changed the results from those presented in the preliminary results of these reviews as discussed below in the comments section of this notice. In addition, where we found clerical errors, we made appropriate corrections. Comment 1: Sandvik contends that the Department should grant a level of trade adjustment in those situations in which sales to distributors are compared with sales to end-users. In support of its argument, Sandvik states that 19 CFR 353.58 (1994) provides that, when comparisons at the same level of trade are not possible, the Department will ``make appropriate adjustments for differences affecting price comparability.'' Sandvik notes that the Department has correctly made comparisons of merchandise at the same level of trade, where possible, and that it should make a level of trade adjustment where sales to distributors are matched with sales to end-users.
