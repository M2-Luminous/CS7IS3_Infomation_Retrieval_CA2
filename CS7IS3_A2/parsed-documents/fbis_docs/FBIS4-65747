The six members were charged with illegal possession of arms and with being associated with secret Greek groups seeking to change Albania's territory. The charges, which are considered to be equal to treason, were made against Theodhoros Bezanis, Iraklis Sirmos, Konstandinos Kiriakos, Evangelos Papakhristou, and Konstandinos Tsiavos [five names as heard]. Greek minority circles believe the charges are unfounded because no arms other than hunting rifles were found in the possession of the six men. They also believe the Albanian Government is taking this action to create more problems in its relations with Greeks and to warn Omonoia what will happen if it publicizes its opposition to Tirana. Today's Albanian press did not carry any reports on the arrest of the six members, and there has been no official reaction so far. Responding to a question on the arrest, Government Spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said Greece's stance toward Greek Albanians and the activity of the Albanian authorities is firm and well known. He said: We want the protection of Greeks within the framework of Albanian and international law. Venizelos noted that the government has accepted the proposal for a meeting between the foreign ministers of the two countries, but added that it would be more meaningful if a meeting of experts was held in advance. He stressed: A top issue is respect for the human rights of the minority and for Albania to become a just state. Referring to the visit by Yasushii Akashi, the UN secretary general's representative, to Skopje [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] and his meeting with [President Kiro] Gligorov, the spokesman noted that this visit must be evaluated along with developments in UN mediator Cyrus Vance's initiative.
