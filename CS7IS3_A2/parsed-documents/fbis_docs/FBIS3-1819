The 443 small bricks of heroin have an estimated street value of NT$10 [new Taiwan dollars] billion (US$377.34 million), police said. Police identified the drug dealers as Chang Chi-ching, 28, and Chang Ming-hui, 32. Both have close ties with international drug rings, according to an officer at the Taipei city police headquarters. Police began an investigation of the two late last year after discovering they might have ties with a drug trafficking ring headed by Lin Kwang-cheng. Lin was arrested last December. Police found that the two men had developed an islandwide drug distribution network and maintained close relations with international drug traffickers. Chang Chi-ching told the police that the drugs seized in Tuesday's raid were smuggled into Taiwan from Bangkok in early February. "The drugs were smuggled into Taiwan at the Chiching fishing port near Kaohsiung on the eve of the lunar new year holiday," Chang said. He admitted that his ring used to smuggle heroin into Taiwan from Thailand's Golden Triangle and re-export the drug to the United States and Italy. Because of sluggish sales in the American and European markets in recent years, Chang said his group began to make inroads into the Southeast Asian market.
