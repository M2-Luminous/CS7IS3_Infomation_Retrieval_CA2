FR940127-2-00100 FR940127-2-00069 [Release No. 34&hyph;33490; File No. SR&hyph;CHX&hyph;93&hyph;17] Self-Regulatory Organizations; Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc.; Order Granting Approval to Proposed Rule Change Amending Its Rules Relating to Suspension of Registration of Specialists, Odd-Lot Dealers and Market Makers January 19, 1994. I. Introduction On July 28, 1993, the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. (``CHX'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') 1 and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, 2 a proposed rule change to amend the suspension of registration provisions for specialists, odd-lot dealers, and market makers. On August 19, 1993, the CHX submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal. 3 1 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) (1988). 2 17 CFR 240.19b&hyph;4 (1991). 3 See letter from David T. Rusoff, Attorney, Foley & Lardner, to Cheryl Dunfee, Attorney, Exchange Branch, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated August 18, 1993. Amendment No. 1 made certain clarifying changes to the proposal. The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release 32888 (September 14, 1993), 58 FR 49341 (September 22, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal. This order approves the proposal. II. Description of the Proposal The CHX proposes to amend four Exchange Rules 4 thereby making two primary changes to the rules governing summary suspension of the registration of specialists, odd-lot dealers and market makers. The Exchange proposes to add market makers to the list of members who may have their registration summarily suspended, and it proposes to limit the authority to summarily suspend the registration of specialists, odd-lot dealers and market makers to the President of the Exchange. 4 The CHX proposes to amend Article XXX, Termination of Registration, Rule 8; Article XXXI, Termination of Registration, Rule 14; Article XXXIV, Registration and Application, Rule 13, Interpretations and Policies .02; and Article XXXIV, Suspension and Termination, Rule 16. Currently, unlike the case of specialists and odd-lot dealers, there is no authority to summarily suspend the registration of a market maker. Current Exchange Rules dealing with market maker registration only provide for the termination or suspension of a market maker pursuant to Article XVII by the Floor Procedure Committee (or other committee appointed for the purpose by the Board) upon a finding of unsatisfactory performance. 5 The current provisions provide for an initial meeting with Exchange Officials to encourage and assist the market maker, and for a hearing prior to the termination of the market maker's registration. 5 The registration of a market maker may be terminated, pursuant to Article XXXIV Registration and Application, Rule 16, upon a finding that he violated the Constitution or Rules of the Exchange or failed adequately to fulfill his responsibilities as a registered market maker. See also, Article XXXIV, Rule 13, Interpretations and Policies .02 which provides that the registration of a market maker may be suspended or terminated by the Equity Floor Procedure Committee in accordance with the provisions of Article XVII. The Exchange is replacing the current provisions governing the suspension of market maker registration with new summary procedures for the termination of market maker registration. 6 These new summary procedures provide that whenever it appears to, or is called to the attention of, the President of the Exchange that a registered market maker is violating any of the Rules of the Exchange or the federal securities laws or is conducting market maker business in an unethical manner, the President shall, without the necessity of previous notice, suspend the registration of such market maker pending the opportunity for a prompt hearing on the apparent violation in accordance with Article XII of the Rules of the Exchange. The procedures further provide that notwithstanding the opportunity for a hearing, upon imposition of the summary suspension of registration, the Exchange shall provide notification thereof to the Commission. The affected market maker 7 may immediately file a request with the Commission for a stay of imposition of the suspension of registration. 8 The proposed rule concludes by stating that the Floor Procedure Committee may suspend or terminate any such registration based upon a finding, after an opportunity for a hearing, in accordance with Article XVII, that the market maker has not satisfactorily performed his responsibilities as defined in the federal securities laws and the rules and policies of the Exchange. 6 In this regard, the Exchange proposes to eliminate the language in Article XXXIV, Rule 13, Interpretation .02, and Article XXXIV, Rule 16 and replace it with new summary procedures to be described in Article XXXIV, Rule 16. 7 In Amendment No. 1, the CHX replaced ``the affected odd lot dealer'' with ``the affected market maker.'' See footnote 3. 8 The proposed rule text provides that this may be done in accordance with such procedures as the Commission may provide.
