Publishing Houses Eye Throwing Themselves Into the Market In the past, mainland publishing houses only put out books in accordance with the plan, not paying attention to market attitudes and the interests of readers, with the result that after new books were published, nobody was interested in them, warehouses were overstocked, and readers also did not buy books that they really needed. Now, a publishing house's profits are linked with its books sales volume, and as many publishing houses are starting to eye throwing themselves into the market, great changes are brewing for China's publishing houses. Best Selling Books in 1993 According to a recent survey, the best selling books on the mainland fall primarily into the following categories: 1. Steady selling trend for well known foreign best-sellers. In 1993, various bookstores' stocks of well known foreign best-sellers were generally low, while sales of stock items had not yet fallen. Hangzhou City bookstores in the first half of the year saw a 24 percent increase in this aspect of their sales compared to a similar period in 1992. In addition, the majority of well-known foreign works come in two types, those that contain little that is Chinese in essence, and those editions that are popularized and simplified. The selling trends for these two types of editions are impressive, with the latter a result of their low cost and the fact that they are favored by college students and working class people. Five Great Works by the "Shaanxi Army's Eastern Expedition" Among the modern popular novels, the novels of people like Su Tong [5685 4547], and Liu Zhenyun [0491 7201 0061] are selling comparatively well. Shaanxi author Jia Pingao's [6328 1627 0425] novel Ruined Capital [Feidu], Chen Zhongshi's [7115 1813 1395] novel White Deer Country [Bailu Yuan] and the novels Ardent Destiny [Reai Mingyun], The Last Hun [Zuihou Yige Xiongnu], and Eight Li of Kindness and Hatred [Bali Qingchou] by several other authors from Shaanxi Province, constitute the Five Great Works by the "Shaanxi Army Eastern Expedition," which all at the same time have won initial success in the Chinese literary world. Jia Pingao's novel Ruined Capital has both been called a "modern day Jin Pingmei," and received attention at home and abroad, and allegedly the reprintings of the book now exceed 500 thousand copies. 2. Acrobatic opera novels are making a comeback. While acrobatic opera novels have generated a greatly expanded group of readers, many people view this type of book as addictive; particularly, the acrobatic opera novels Jinyong and Gulong, which to this day remain best-sellers at local newsstands. 3. On the spot business literature and financial and economic type popular novels are popular. For example, the twenty odd novels of the Hong Kong female writer Liang Fengyi [2733 7685 0308] such as Nightmares of the Rich [Haomen Jingmeng] and Hua Kuijie are selling very well. In China, where the number of readers has mushroomed, there are few readers who still dislike this type of book. 4. Literature about foreign lands is in great demand. Following in the path of such novels as A Beijinger in New York, and A Chinese Woman in Manhattan, the novel Luqia: A Beijing Girl in New York is selling well. In addition, the books of a number of Taiwan and Hong Kong authors such as Xi Murong [1598 1970 5554], San Mao [0005 3029], and Qiong Yao [8825 3852] have already become big sellers. 5. Biographies of famous persons are still very popular. Biographies of famous persons, such as Historical Selections of Mao Zedong, At the Wedding of Chiang Kai-shek, The Biography of Zhou Enlai, and My Father, Deng Xiaoping are all in great demand. A number of biographies of famous foreigners, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, and Charles De Gaulle are also unable to keep up with demand. 6. Specialized books are more and more in demand. There is a tremendous amount of demand for this type of book, and as long as the contents are practical, the quality is high, and the editing is not disorderly, they will sell very well indeed. For example, books of an economic genre such as The Complete Book of World Trade, Dictionary of Accounting, Real Estate Investment, A Guidebook for Brokers; medical type books such as Color Atlas of Chinese Medicinal Herbs; books on historical relics such as Illustrated Dictionary of Chinese Bronze Mirrors, and scientific type books such as An English-Chinese Scientific and Technical Dictionary. Though these books are high-priced, because of their practical use, they are also books that specialists must be equipped with, hence they are very much in demand. 7. Daily living type books and various types of juvenile and children's reading material. When it comes to daily living type books such as A Handbook of Family Medicine, Use and Maintenance of Household Electrical Appliances, and various types of cookbooks, books on cosmetics, or weaving, though there appears to be much duplication in the published items, each edition seems to be selling quite well. Various types of books for juveniles and children compiled to develop the intellect and increase knowledge are also selling very well. New Symbols of Striding Towards the Market: Authors Signing Agreements and Competitively Priced Manuscripts Authors signing agreements and competitively priced manuscripts are two to the most recent signs that the mainland publishing world is striding towards the market. Publishing a good book requires having a good manuscript, yet over the past several years the many of the payments for books for authors on the mainland have been from 30 yuan per thousand characters, to 50 yuan per thousand, with the highest figures reaching around 100 yuan. In the current situation, when the economy is developing so rapidly, levels of consumption are extremely high, and these types of fees for books written have made it very difficult to attract writers. Some writers, to make ends meet, have had no choice but to abandon the pen and go into business. For some period of time, writers went overseas, and this has resulted in a lack of good manuscripts, hence salacious and low-grade works have flooded the market. Without a good source of manuscripts, publishing houses have been very hard pressed. Some publishing units have broken through traditional manuscript standards, and adopted an approach calling for superior prices paid for superior manuscripts, vying for a good draft over a period of time, and capturing the market. In October of 1993, the Shenzhen Youth Magazine House and the Guangdong Province Periodical Commercial Development Company sponsored a public competition for outstanding manuscripts, an activity genuinely directed towards entering into market competition for the manuscripts of mainland authors. On October 28, 1993, the mainland's first time ever outstanding manuscript competition was launched in Shenzhen. There were more than 30 manuscripts entered, and among them were some 14 on-the-spot type literary works, occupying an overwhelmingly dominant position. In addition, there were also novels, movie scripts, examples of prose, essays, academic works, specialized papers, and popular historical material. Some well known writers such as Zhang Xianliang [1728 6343 0081] participated in the competition, though a large number were up and coming young writers. The China Pacific Insurance Company's Shenzhen Branch supplied guaranteed insurance for the guaranteed minimum price of the competitively priced manuscripts. The units participating in the competition included numerous domestic and foreign publishing, television, and radio organizations and entrepreneurs. The very first to strike a deal was author Shi Tiesheng's [0670 6993 3932] short story "Others" [Bieren] and the young theorist Wang Donghua's [3769 2639 5478] social science treatise "The New Academics" [Xin Daxueren] which were bought by the Shenzhen Airport Lounge Company, Ltd. for 8000 yuan and 80,000 respectively. One privately run enterprise head offered an opening price of 3000 yuan per thousand characters and purchased a manuscript by Liu Xiaoqing [0491 2556 1987] titled "From Movie Star to Millionairess," and other manuscripts also by and large were sold to industrial and commercial enterprises. When it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts, mainland authors and publishers have differing views. Does Putting Literature on the Market Foster an Impulsive Spirit in Literary Circles? Peoples' Publishing House head and editor-in-chief Xue Dezhen [5641 1795 7201] is rather in agreement with this. He states that the price of a manuscript in the final analysis must be regulated by the unseen hand of the market. He believes that though competitively pricing manuscripts using this method meshes with the market, it is an assault on mainland publishing circles' traditional approach involving the planned economy and administrative fiat, and will be very beneficial for increasing the quality of cultural products and promoting a change in the thinking of publishing circles. Art critic Ma Ye [7456 0048] thinks that the essential significance of the competitive pricing of manuscripts lies in the fact that it has made it possible for a market for culture to be established in China. Let those men of letters who have abandoned literature engage in business return to their own heartfelt occupation, and compete in the "ocean of literature." He disclosed that the original manuscript of Jia Pingao's new work Ruined Capital was bought by the Beijing October Art Publishing House for 150 yuan per 1000 characters (the printing impression manuscript price was separately calculated), and if it the deal had been done using competitive pricing, this would have had an altogether different effect on the author, on the publishing house, and on the social effect and benefit of the work. Some authors express concern and wearied bewilderment when it comes to competitive pricing of manuscripts. Six writers, including Zhang Jie [1728 3381] and Cong Weixi [0654 4850 3556], withdrew en masse from the reviewing committee for this effort at competitive pricing of manuscripts. Author Liu Xinwu [0491 1800 2976] believes that a market for literary manuscripts should not be the basic method to solve the problem. Literary works, though they possess the properties of a commodity, at root also fall into the category of spirit, and whether or not putting literature on the market fosters an impulsive spirit in literary circles, it gives rise to money worship and cultural philistinism. There are also writers who hold that after market behavior has played itself out, whether or not this is contrary to the initial intention, it pulls down the market for literary manuscripts into the vulgar realm of an arena for commodity transaction. Confronting the concerns of literary and art circles, one figure from the publishing world points out that when it comes to literary manuscripts, two mechanisms should be established: First, the state should provide protection, and second, things should be allowed to move towards the market. It is reported that at the conclusion of this activity involving the competitive pricing of manuscripts, the organizing committee established a permanent organization in Shenzhen for dealing in manuscripts, which will become a collection and distribution center for mainland manuscripts. Zhou Hong, the First "Indentured" Chinese Writer? In fact, at the same time as the Shenzhen manuscript competitive pricing market was closing, the China Youth Publishing House and the author Zhou Hong [0719 3163] signed an agreement which has caused no small amount of rumblings within publishing circles on the mainland. Some people believe that Zhou is in fact the mainland's first "indentured" writer, because the contract stipulates that for the next three years, Zhou must fulfill obligations for writing books in accordance with the overall plan of the China Youth Publishing House. If the publishing house does not agree with a selected topic, Zhou has no right to write about it. One older writer commented: "For the writer, the most important thing is that when he writes, he must have freedom of mind, and a distinctive individuality; if he is only working in accordance with another's intentions, what will he be able to produce?" But there are also those who hold that because the publishing house handles everything, the writer has no fear problems back home, and can write while setting his or her mind at rest. Changing the Situation of "Read a Manuscript, Do Not Worry, Return the Manuscript, Do Not Pay Money, Agree on Eating from the Common Pot, Printing Takes Three and a Half Years" The China Youth Publishing House Director Hu Shouwen [5170 1343 2429] states that they "purchased" Zhou Hong with the primary intention of upsetting the balance of the publishing houses still under the old system. Because its interests are bound together with those of the writer, the publishing house will change the past cycle and rhythm of the type "read a manuscript, do not worry, return the manuscript, do not pay money for it, make an agreement on eating from the common pot, print after three and a half years," and stimulate reform. He comments that this publishing house will by stages and in groups "purchase" writers, hoping to have a plan to promote the mainland's own writers who are in great demand, such as San Mao, Qiong Yao, and Jin Yong, and guide and capture over the long term the market for popular literature that the old line publishing houses have felt beneath their notice. Zhou Hong's collection A Warning to the Chinese People was the most popular and in demand set of books in China for the first half of 1993. As for his status as "indentured," Zhou says that this stems initially from the need to subsist, but he hopes that other writers do not walk this path, "because literature after all requires a group of people who resolutely refuse to bend to the popular will." Centers for Buying and Selling Book Numbers: A Strange Birth From Mainland's Publishing Circles According to international practice, to issue a book it must have a number, and the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" are the symbol of the right to publish that the government gives to publishing houses. They are issued by the China ISBN Center free of charge and supplied to publishing houses for their use. The buying and selling of book numbers happens when a publishing house takes a "Chinese Standard Book Number" subordinate to that house and sells it to a non-publishing unit or another publishing house. This in essence is an illegal publishing activity. The buying and selling of book numbers had already emerged in China in 1984, and in recent years has become more and more prevalent. According to relevant administrative department statistics, book numbers sold by publishing units over the course of a year constitute some 10 percent of the total books published in the mainland. Figures from the Xinhua Book Stores and departments that publish scientific research believe that the real number is higher than this. The factors that have generated this buying and selling of book numbers have two primary aspects: First, publishing house editors have little power, publishing funds are seriously inadequate, and houses have a book number but are often powerless to publish a book; second, a "second channel" of distribution is rapidly developing, and some portion of the newly formed collective, and individually owned book businesses, are one by one switching from retail to wholesale, and from wholesale gradually getting involved in publishing, hence book numbers something that are in high demand among these businesses. Some publishing houses, to solve the issue of funding, will take their own book numbers and sell them for several thousand yuan up to 10,000 yuan to collective and individually owned book businesses, and these businesses, as long as they pay around a 10,000 yuan "management fee," can hope to turn a generous profit of from 10-fold to several tens-fold. This is virtually becoming a market in the buying and selling of book numbers. Because the buying and selling of book numbers is lucrative, more and more non-publishing units and individuals are becoming interested. Those buying and selling book numbers have gone from the original collective and individually owned book businesses, government units, and individual writers, and expanded to nearly all levels of society, including bookstores, printing plants, and educational institutions. "Brokers of Culture" Emerge In Accordance With the Times The trading in book numbers has given rise in publishing circles two a situation that has caused concern to many: A group of "brokers of culture," who reap unfair profits through selling book numbers, has emerged in accordance with the times; this group panders to the market and panders to vulgar popular taste and vulgar literary style books and periodicals. According to a survey, of the pornographic and salacious books and those with "political problems," from 80 to 90 percent had book numbers that were purchased. In addition, the buying and selling of book numbers disrupts the normal order of publishing house administration, books are manufactured in a rough and slipshod manner, quality is seriously reduced, and it reduces the number of planned books that a publishing house can produce, hindering the publishing of good books and literary works. The China Xinwen Publishing Office has issued repeated injunctions prohibiting the buying and selling of book numbers. From 1989 to 1990, dozens of publishing units had their house number revoked because of buying and selling of book numbers. In September of 1993, as the whole society was engaged in an anticorruption initiative, mainland publishing circles again proposed the "resolute rooting out of the corrupt behavior of buying and selling book numbers." But whether or not this practice, with its strange origin, can really be eliminated on the mainland will await conscientious implementation by publishing circles and strict supervision by every level of society. The Fraud of "Foreign Book Numbers" When the "Chinese Standard Book Numbers" were a hot topic, some foreign publishing organizations also looked at mainland practice, using pleasing phrases such as "to assist mainland publishing houses in resolving funding difficulties," and "to assist mainland authors in giving expression to their intellectual achievements." They also peddled so-called "international book numbers," and "Hong Kong book numbers," and reaped unfair profits from this. Most of those engaged in this sort of activity were figures who in recent years have left the mainland to live in Hong Kong. They register in Hong Kong a fictitious local publishing house, and because they have no way to publish and issue hot-selling books, they use differences between the mainland and Hong Kong's local publishing system, and take worthless local Hong Kong book numbers to the mainland to sell at a high profit. They normally go through two channels: The first is to send a large number of book number purchase order lists to relevant departments and writers; the second is to engage in selling book numbers for excessive profit through representatives on the mainland. The China Xinwen Publishing Administration Department has taken measures to curb profiteering in "international numbers." According to a public announcement by Chinese authorities: There are around 10 Hong Kong publishing organizations engaging in illegal buying and selling of book numbers in China, including such outfits as the Tianma Book Company, Ltd. and the South Pacific Publishing House. Fraud involving "foreign book numbers" has meant that many mainland authors who have been successful for many years only to have their works exchanged as "illegal publications," and there are even some people who, wanting to publish a book, buy a book number, and then borrow money, sustaining irreplaceable losses. Disseminated news stories have warned mainland writers "to be careful and protect against being duped," while the China Xinwen Publishing Office has also issued to various locales "Notification Relating to Prohibition of Sale of Hong Kong and Taiwan Book Numbers on the Mainland." It is reported that at present activity in illegally profiteering in "international book numbers" has already been somewhat curtailed. "Sweeping Up Pornography" and "Cracking Down on Illegal Publishing" Since July 1987 when the mainland first launched an extensive "anti- pornography" campaign, its seems that every year an anti-pornography or "attack illegal publications" campaign is undertaken. However, because management of the publications market is chaotic, printing houses put profit making first and pornographic publications have the attraction of high profits, resulting in the fact that there is an incessant wave of pornography, and the creators of pornographic materials are constantly changing their appearance and adopting new countermeasures. Since early in 1993 an extensive anti-pornography campaign has been underway, and this has forced illegal smuggling activity around various coastal locales to be more and more underground and secretive. Many areas have formed "transprovincial" and "transnational" trust type underground organizations, which have even been expanding into black market operations. Bookstalls Primarily Hitting "Edge Balls" A large number of bookstalls, meaning the proprietors, when offering pornographic materials for sale in the midst of a bustling metropolis, adopt the tactic of hitting "the edge ball." The front cover titles are brimming with the seduction of violence and lewdity, but in reality the contents often stop short of this, and they cannot be equated with "pornography." For example, "Husbands and Wives Talk About Sex and Love," "Robbers of the Flesh in Action," and no small number of picture albums of the human body, collections of portraits all have extremely seductive cover titles, while the contents cannot be considered to have "exceeded the boundaries [of decency]". Early in 1993, the amorous novels of the Qing and Ming periods all the rage on the mainland were part of this situation. These books to a lessor or greater extent all have vigorous men and amorous females, and because they do not involve questions of publishing rights, some publishing houses reproduce large numbers, and most also attract readers with covers that advertise things like "Qing period bawdy novel." Sometimes one book will be out in editions from several publishing houses. In addition, books related to Jin Pingmei such as Jin Pingmei Words and Expressions, Fan Jinlian and Li Pinger, and the Western Gate Day [Ximen Qin] are also of this ilk. Something that is different from hitting "edge balls" occurs in some areas of Guangdong, were some pornographic publications under names like "New Wave novels," "Three Level novels," "Modern novels," or "selection of best-selling books," actually have contests that are really quite obscene. The majority of these books draw materials from foreign pornographic publications, and rearrange things through piecing together and clipping and pasting. Almost every two or three weeks a new set of "new wave novels" appears at bookstalls, and among this variety of items, the quantity of pornographic material is high, a ferocious force, making people surprised that this is happening in China. Why local authorities in Guangdong are not controlling this is even more strange. In June and July of 1993, relevant departments on the mainland again launched an anti-pornography campaign. In Beijing alone there were eight cases that were investigated, with proper actions taken against the "production of pornographic materials, "trafficking in pornography" and engaging in illegal publishing activity. Seven "nests of wholesalers" were ferreted out, more than 230,000 items of contraband goods and illegal publications were seized, including more than 40 types of obscene publications totalling more than 110,000 items; some 3225 illegal videocassete tapes were seized, as were 12,700 illegal audiotapes, and any further rise in the tide of pornography has been controlled. The Xinwen Publishing Office again stresses that "sweeping up pornography" and "cracking down on illegal publications" are important matters related to the basic line, and must resolutely be maintained, constantly grasped with no letup.
