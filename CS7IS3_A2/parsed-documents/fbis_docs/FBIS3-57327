In a speech to the governors of 18 regions in the city of Orel on Tuesday, he said the main points of a statement on economic, crediting and financial policies the government and the Bank made last May had been implemented, but this did not lead to curbing inflation as planned. On falling inflation at the end of 1993, Gerashchenko attributes this to an artificial underfunding of the national economy. In his words, money supply was reduced from 60 percent at the end of 1992 to 30 percent last year. The CBR president called for economic policy corrections and for an integrated concept of investment policy raising the possibility of subsidizing interest rates for farm credits in some cases. He suggested an issuing of government securities on a large scale in an attempt to try to narrow this year's deficit. Gerashchenko says that uncertainties about the economic and investment climate prevent commercial banks, which accumulated 4 trillion rubles of "free money" as of January 1, from investing it into the economy, an indication of a new spiral of inflation being imminent. Under the existing legislation, he said, "we cannot force them into investment." The CBR president says that incentives such as tax benefits or interest rate subsidies must be created to reverse the situation. Gerashchenko has called for seeking ways of attracting those free funds into the Russian economy.
