FR940429-0-00047 FR940429-0-00010 The annual reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to be 47 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. This annual reporting estimate takes into account the fact that the average recognition period granted to accrediting agencies is five years. The total annual reporting burden for the estimated 96 respondents is 4,512 hours. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments on the information collection requirements should direct them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503; Attention: Daniel J. Chenok. Comments must be received by May 31, 1994. Assessment of Educational Impact In the NPRM, the Secretary requested comments on whether the regulations in this document would require transmission of information that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Based on the response to the proposed regulations and on the Department's own review, the Secretary has determined that these regulations do not require the transmission of information concerning accrediting agencies that is being gathered by or is available from any other agency or authority of the United States. Where specific provisions of these regulations require the transmission of information concerning institutions or programs that is similar to that being collected by the Department for other purposes, such as for the State Postsecondary Review Program or the Department's review of institutions seeking to become certified to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs, these regulations have been modified to minimize the burden on institutions. A detailed discussion of the changes to the regulations is provided in the appendix to these regulations.
