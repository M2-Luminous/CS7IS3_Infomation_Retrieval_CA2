During the course of a year, 696,000 jobs were lost in western Germany. The number of people employed in former West Germany fell by 2.4 percent to almost 28.5 million between November 1992 and November 1993. From October to November 1993 alone, the number of people employed in the west fell by 167,000. That can be partially explained, however, by the usual seasonal drop, according to the statisticians. After seasonal adjustments, however, 67,000 jobs were still lost during this period. The Federal Statistical Office has no figures for former East Germany.
