Exactly three months after that declaration, the constituent assembly of the Center movement took place on 22 July 1992, and on 5 June 1993, the constituent conference of a political party, the Lithuanian Center Union. On 27 October 1993, the Center Union was registered at the Ministry of Justice. At present, there are over 400 members in the Center Union, which is represented in the Seimas by R. Ozolas and E. Bickauskas. LIETUVOS RYTAS presents an interview with Romualdas Ozolas, Chairman of the Lithuanian Center Union. [Racas] Of the political forces that currently exist and have representatives in the Seimas, the Center Union is the newest organization, and in addition, an organization which does not have a historical past. Why did Lithuania need the Center Union? [Ozolas] The Center Union is a political organization that came into being and now operates on the basis of liberalistic viewpoints. On the whole, liberalism in Lithuania is quite a recent phenomenon and lacks deeper traditions here. In a country where the tradition of conservatism is fundamental, basic, and oriented towards far in the future, parties with liberalistic viewpoints and their adherents truly are choosing a very difficult path. We understood this from the outset, but we made up our minds to take this step nevertheless. We believe that we had to decide to take this step for Lithuania's future: whether Lithuania will be democratic or autocratic depends on whether the political viewpoint of liberalism--consolidated to at least some significant extent--exists here. The right with its national conservatism and the left with its cosmopolitan conservatism automatically orient Lithuania towards a single party, and the battle between these two forces may determine the development of Lithuania for a long time. Since the left is--in terms of history--condemned, and the right is the position of future parties, we believe that it is improper and dangerous to repeat the political route taken by Lithuania up to 1940. So if we, understanding the prerogatives granted us by history and the necessity of resisting the pull towards repeating what was done in the past, do not carry out our duty, we, as political leaders, will not, on the whole, have justified our purpose, and as people we will not be able to rest in peace even after we are dead. I believe that in rising as a third force, liberalism can guarantee the development of a third political force in Lithuania. I find it very unfortunate that the Liberal Union of Lithuania, by responding in such a strange fashion to the economic situation, has heretofore identified persistently with the right, even though the complex of issues associated with the left and the right in Lithuania has not yet become sufficiently clear. [Racas] You are emphasizing the third, or the so-called middle way. What is it like, how does it differ from the ways that the left and the right are proposing? [Ozolas] The right as well as the left are offering guarantees to aggregate wholes. We are offering guarantees to individuals--to individual-oriented entities. Through these guarantees offered to individuals, we are trying to provide guarantees for those aggregate constituencies that could then join together and be the leading forces for Lithuania as it moved toward openness, toward the world, towards the ability--through openness--to keep in step with a dynamic world that is on the verge of the 21st century. Despite the pull towards autocracy, that world will be democratic. This is also demonstrated by the fact that the great empires have collapsed, as we had predicted. The Soviet Union and its autocratism is already gone, and after some time, a similar fate, it seems, will befall China and its imperial structure, and still later, the United States, although, to be sure, on a different basis. [Racas] You maintain that the Center Union is oriented towards individual-oriented entities. Keeping in mind that in the past elections you were unable to overcome the 4 percent hurdle, is it possible to assert that these individual-oriented entities do not yet exist in Lithuania? [Ozolas] That's absolutely correct. Lithuania is for the time being still not prepared to live through the life of the individual person. For now, group life has to be guaranteed for Lithuania: guarantees for pensioneers, guarantees for the unemployed, guarantees for students and so on. The individual person with his willingness to take a risk, his intelligence, determination, and tenacity still has so few opportunities, that even the most determined are overtaxed by what they experience. The Center Union represents that softened version of liberalism which could correspond to the self-consciousness of those who are the most daring and to their interests, as people who are determined to lead life as an individual, in growing, joining into groups or classes, and assuming a certain position in the structure of the society, in which the majority will nevertheless be comprised of those conglomerates that require collective guarantees. [Racas] Why, despite accentuation of the idea of liberalism, has the Lithuanian Center Union been unable to find common ground with the Lithuanian Liberal Union? [Ozolas] I believe that this is a question of time. The difficulties are sufficiently comprehensible in the sense that here in Lithuania everything begins with ideological viewpoints, and any difference whatsoever in these repels people from the possibility of joining forces or working together. There is a certain degree of hypertrophied seeking of identity in all the parties, so it goes without saying that this might be especially characteristic of the Liberals, who defend the freedom of the individual. And that is indeed the case. We said a very long time ago, back when the Center movement was still forming and when positions were being deliberated with the Liberals, that despite everything our paths were the same, and that sooner or later we would find a way to cooperate. We will also find a way to cooperate with other centrist or moderately oriented forces. Until all the rich and powerful people who wish to participate in political life come together, the Liberal Union will be able to represent liberalism in Lithuania more as an idea than as a concrete political effect. However, even then they will not be able to collect enough votes, and the moderate echelons of liberalism will be able to be suitable representatives for those too who will share the belief that the defense of their private life and initiative, as well as the defense and increase of their personal wealth is their life's purpose and meaning. This is why we characterize ourselves not as the representatives of the large capitalists, but rather as the representatives of the person who has wealth, as representatives of the individual, as representatives of the person who understands that wealth is not absolute, that it is only a means to live and to exist, and that it is the engine of society's becoming free. [Racas] Could you give concrete expression to who these "people who have wealth" are whom you would like to represent? [Ozolas] The structures of wealth in Lithuania have not yet manifested themselves completely and it is uncertain what they will eventually be like. We believe that we could represent people both in rural areas--large- and medium-size farmers--and in urban areas--financiers, factory owners, large stockholders, as well as the entire strata of workers in private infrastructure. In short, for that group of owners which requires a guarantee of free trade and assistance as well as defense at times when there is instability in the country. What will be especially difficult and crucial will be the reconciliation of the guaranteeing of interests of large- and medium-size capital. [Racas] When the Center movement was being founded, its ranks included many people who were well-known then: K. Motieka, S. Kasauskas, M. Laurinkus, A. Januska, etc. How would you explain the fact that now they either do not participate at all in the activities of the Center Union or have suspended their work in this organization? [Ozolas] I believe that this is related to the fact that participation in politics is a very difficult duty. Moreover, everybody has a lot of individual interests, everybody today is accumulationg starting capital for themselves, and some of the people mentioned are doing so as well. This is why I fully understand Mr. Kasauskas, who is concerned with the development of his personal business, I understand Mr. Motieka, who wants to put the activities of his firm in order so that he can be independent. Sometimes I think that when I leave politics it will be as a completely poor man, whereas my friends and many people in Lithuania will have in reality achieved the ideal for which I am working in politics. That is a paradox, but working in politics is what I have decided to do. [Racas] Members of the Center Union work in various government structures and frequently express differing opinions and so politicians sometime say that a multipartite structure has developed within the Center Union itself. Isn't there a danger that your party will split up? [Ozolas] Even parties that are less democratic than ours are threatened by divisions and differences of opinion. The way in which diversity of opinion is formulated in our party and the way in which we manage to act on this diversity as we coordinate differences of opinion is very satisfying. In surmounting the differences of opinion that we indeed do have, we manage to coordinate them not with respect to the sole category of current economic needs, but rather with regard to what will happen in the distant future. When difficulties arise, we work on the principal question: does our general line correspond to this or not? If it corresponds, then we don't argue about the details. This is why a split is truly not a threat to us for the time being, even though to our critics, the details usually seem to be especially significant. I want to emphasize where our threshhold of confidence lies: working individually and on one's own responsibility up to the point where it is clear to everyone that the person might be in a position to go outside the viewpoints of the party. If the party believes that the person has nevertheless crossed this threshhold and that his viewpoints no longer correspond to the viewpoints of the party, then we raise the issue whether this can continue to be reconciled with the norms of the general work of the party. [Racas] Elections to local government may take place this year already. How is the Center Union preparing for these elections and with which political forces does it foresee forming a coalition? [Ozolas] We have always believed and will continue to hold to the viewpoint that no advance indications on this topic are needed. We let our sections operate freely in choosing election partners for themselves. Some sections will participate in the elections together with the Liberals, while others will join with the Liberals and the Social Democrats. They will, of course, not coordinate their programs but perhaps they will succeed in agreeing on how to act together on individual issues. [Racas] How does the Center Union view early elections to the Seimas? [Ozolas] We have a very clear opinion on this issue: for the time being, we can not support this idea, because we believe that if the elections took place this fall, they would not in the main change anything, and could possibly even make the situation in the Seimas and the country worse. This was also my opinion in 1992, when I proposed that elections not be held but rather that we work as hard as possible. [Racas] Do you expect to overcome the 4 percent hurdle in the next elections and will you try to do so alone? [Ozolas] Without a doubt. We will go into the elections on the basis of what is there and will also look for who can agree with us on the principal issues. Even if such agreement would only happen in the distant future, and even if for tactical reasons certain distinctions were to remain. If our positions coincide and if the other party can take part in joint political activity and can assume the task of taking care of a certain domain, that party will be our friend and participate alongside us. We see possibilities for cooperation with the Social Democrats, Nationalists, Democrats, and this does not even mention the Liberals. The question is whether the politicians of today will be able to overcome their mentality, step beyond their personal interests, and join and unite for the benefit of our country.
