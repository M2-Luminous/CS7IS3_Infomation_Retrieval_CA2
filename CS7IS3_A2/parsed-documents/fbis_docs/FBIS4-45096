Engineer Nehavandi said: The amount of livestock in this province exceeds the capacity of the pastures and the fuel for 70 percent of the rural people is procured from the wood of forest trees. He added: In addition to this, the conversion of pastures for low-yield dry farming and improper plowing on slopes has destroyed the plant cover and the good fodder. With the destruction of the pastures and forests, the soil in this province is eroding rapidly. Among the damaging effects of the destruction of natural resources in this province, he cited the harmful floods of the last few years in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad and the excessive rural emigration to the cities. Of the 16,000 square kilometers of total area in the province of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad, 230,000 hectares is agricultural lands and the rest is forest and pasture.
