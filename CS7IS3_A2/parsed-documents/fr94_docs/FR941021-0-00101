FR941021-0-00101 FR941021-0-00020 The text of §600.103 Deviations has been deleted and a cross-reference to DOE's deviation provisions in §600.4 has been added. The deleted text entails directions to Federal agencies about the degree to which OMB will permit deviations from the provisions of the Circular. These provisions are binding upon Federal agencies by virtue of their inclusion in Circular A&hyph;110 and do not need to be provided for in agency implementing regulations. DOE deviation provisions in §600.4 make reference to the fact that OMB approval may be needed for certain types of deviations. Additional cross-references to the deviation provisions of §600.4 are in §§600.125(d) and (i) on Budget and project reviews, and §600.140 Procurement standards. In §600.121(b) on Financial Management Standards, references to §600.121(f) and §600.181 are added to identify exceptions to the financial management provisions of this subparagraph. Section 600.149 has been added to cross-reference the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act provisions in §600.116. D. Provisions From the Current Financial Assistance Rules In this rulemaking implementing OMB Circular A&hyph;110, the basic approach is to replace the current text of Subpart B of 10 CFR part 600 with the appropriately modified text of Circular A&hyph;110. However, certain portions of Subpart B have been retained and integrated into the A&hyph;110 language. They are as follows: In §600.112 on application forms, subparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) are deleted and replaced with the provisions which are carried over from 10 CFR 600.102. These sections are being added to provide detailed application and budgetary forms information to recipients. Subparagraph (d) has been slightly reworded and included under §600.112(a) of this rulemaking. Section 600.114(b) regarding special restrictive conditions is carried over from 10 CFR 600.105(c) and concerns the issue of a recipient placing special restrictive conditions on subawards, which is not addressed in Circular A&hyph;110. Section 600.121(f) on financial management system requirements is carried over from §600.109 and concerns the issue of the financial management system required for individual recipients of awards, which is not addressed in Circular A&hyph;110. The language at the end of §600.122(h)(2) on Payments beginning with ``Before withholding any payment'' is carried over from §600.112(g)(3) and provides 30 days notice, and an opportunity to cure the noncompliance or indebtedness within that time period, before withholding of payment occurs. Such a provision is not addressed in Circular A&hyph;110. Sections 600.123(j), (k), and (l) cost-sharing provisions are carried over from §§600.107(a), (b), and (c). The provisions of §§600.123(j) and (k) are continued because of the concern that the requirements for cost sharing be specifically stated (so that all applicants clearly understand the provisions they are operating under) and justified (so that any required cost sharing is really a program need). Section 600.123(l) is continued to address program income, patent rights, rights in data and foregone fees in the context of cost sharing, provisions which are not included in Circular A&hyph;110. The language at the end of §600.125(e)(4) on pre-award costs, beginning with ``For continuation awards,'' is carried over from §600.103(g)(2)(ii). This language permits costs incurred more than 90 days before the beginning of a continuation award to be charged to that continuation year, without the need to receive prior approval from DOE, should the award be made. As always, pre-award costs are incurred at the recipient's risk that the award may not be made. This is, in effect, a waiver of Section XXX .25(e)(1) of OMB Circular A&hyph;110, and is a permitted agency option under Section XXX .25(e) of the Circular.
