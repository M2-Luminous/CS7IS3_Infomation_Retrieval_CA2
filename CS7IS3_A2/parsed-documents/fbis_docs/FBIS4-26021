It now sees any UN sanctions as an act of war. Li Shaowen has a commentary: Pyongyang is toughening its stand in the wake of mounting pressure. It will not reverse its decision until the nuclear issue has been solved fairly through dialogue and negotiations. A North Korean Foreign Ministry statement issued on Monday [13 June] charges the IAEA with committing an act of grave encroachment on its dignity and sovereignty. The United States responded immediately. The State Department said on Tuesday [14 June] that Washington has worked out a draft resolution calling for UN economic sanctions. Also on Tuesday, North Korea's UN ambassador said its government has informed the United States of its decision to withdraw from the agency. It will also order the remaining two agency inspectors to leave the country. North Korea and the IAEA have been differing over the nuclear fuel rods replacement. The agency accused Pyongyang of blocking a full inspection of the refueling process. The United States suspected it transferred plutonium from the Yongbyong nuclear reactor for its weapons program. On 10 June, the IAEA adopted a resolution urging North Korea to open its military facilities and suspended the agency's assistance to it. The United States, South Korea, and Japan agreed on imposing UN economic sanctions on Pyongyang. Washington has been lobbying support for the measures but failed to win any agreements from the international community. Russia has called for an international conference to find a solution to the issue. On Monday, President Boris Yeltsin discussed the latest development with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton by a telephone call. They also discussed ways to settle it through political means. China is opposed to sanctions imposed on North Korea. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen has stressed the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and regional stability as two of the goals in the fundamental interest of Asia-Pacific countries. China has time and again called for dialogue to resolve the dispute and appealed to the international community for restraint from taking hasty actions. The door is still open for a political solution. North Korea has been calling for the resumption of talks with the United States on the issue before considering further inspections. It has threatened to withdraw from the IAEA and has not done yet. What is more, it is still a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. All this indicates that only dialogue can bring about a resolution. Further confrontation and hostilities will just intensify the already tense situation and will cause a greater threat to regional peace and stability. After all, talks, however tough, are better than extreme actions.
