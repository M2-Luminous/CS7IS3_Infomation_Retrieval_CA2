Both sides are placing great hopes on this round. Sergey Prikhodko, a Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, was interviewed by our correspondent: [Begin Prikhodko recording] We are very hopeful. It appears to us that contacts between experts from the two delegations on the eve of the talks have helped to achieve further progress toward agreement on outstanding questions. We hope that agreement on the technical questions that experts have not yet resolved will be achieved during this round, thereby creating real prospects for the initialling of the entire range of agreements on military questions. [end recording] Disagreements still remain on the use of the Russian radar station at Skrunda and the status of Russian military pensioners.
