Fujii said he told U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen that the record 15.25 trillion yen stimulus package adopted in February is proceeding "steadily" and "the economy is gradually showing brightness." He was speaking to reporters after emerging from a 30-minute talk with Bentsen at the Treasury Department ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized nations in the afternoon. Fujii said he also explained that a policy accord newly reached by the coalition parties endorsed the direction for "comprehensive" tax reform to be decided in June and enacted by the end of the year. He did not say whether he told Bentsen about the scale and other details in continuing the 5.47 trillion yen cut in income and residential taxes included in the February package for only fiscal 1994 that started April 1. Bentsen was unavailable for comment on the talks. But he previously said the single-year tax plan is not enough for Japan to boost domestic demand and reduce trade surplus, and has called on Japan to take further fiscal measures. Fujii said he heard no particular requests from Bentsen on the matter during the talks. While citing improvements in the economy, Fujii said he also told Bentsen that Japanese economy is "not as weak as" the projections released last week by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF said in its twice-yearly world economic outlook that Japan's economic growth in terms of real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected at 0.7 percent in 1994. The Japanese Government is projecting a 2.4 percent growth for fiscal 1994. Fujii declined to comment on currency exchange rates, saying the two financial leaders agreed not to make any public comment. When pressed later by reporters whether exchange rates were raised at the meeting, a Japanese official said only Fujii made an overall presentation of the Japanese economy "from various points." Japanese officials briefing reporters said Fujii spent most of the 30-minute session with Bentsen trying to explain the current condition of the Japanese economy. They said Fujii assured Bentsen that the new cabinet to be formed under Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata will continue to keep policy unchanged toward deregulating the Japanese economy and carrying out economic reform. Regarding the stalled trade talks with the United States, Japanese officials said Fujii emphasized the importance of Japan-U.S. relations in suggesting Japan's desire to resume the so-called "framework" talks as soon as possible. Fujii also explained that Japan's trade surplus has started to decline, noting the Japanese current account surplus shrank in yen terms last year, the officials said. Japanese officials said Fujii also pledged Japan's cooperation with the U.S. in extending aid to Russia.
