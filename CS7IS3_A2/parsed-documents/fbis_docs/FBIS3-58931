After a 45 minute meeting at Downing Street of the Cabinet subcommittee, which oversees Hong Kong, chaired by Prime Minister John Major, both Mr Hurd and Mr Patten warned the Chinese that time was running out. Mr Hurd said "no decisions" had been taken on the "timing or content" of the second part of the legislation -- which mostly concerns the format for future elections in the run-up to the hand over of Hong Kong to the Chinese in 1997. "That legislation needs to be in place by July this year in order that the preparations for the elections in 1994 and 1995 can be made in an orderly way. We are entirely ready to resume discussions with the Chinese on the points which remain in disagreement. Obviously there is limit to the time that can be spent in discussion before legislation has to be tabled on the second part." Mr Patten said: "We would very much like to see a resumption of talks. We are still prepared to negotiate and I very much hope the Chinese are as well." He was speaking after China attacked the Governor again at the weekend over the way he has conducted negotiations, which have currently reached a stalemate. Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, said: "The series of performances by Patten recently show that he has a `doomsday mentality.'" Mr Patten was flying back to Hong Kong tonight to try to bring the Chinese back to the negotiating table. The first part of the legislation, which is largely uncontroversial, is currently going through Hong Kong's ruling legislative council. Mr Patten has revealed he was obliged to go ahead on the first part without China's help.
