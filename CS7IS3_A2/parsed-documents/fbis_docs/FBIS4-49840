More than 600 people, including Chen Xitong, member of the Politbureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), Chen Muhua, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), and Chen Minzhang, minister of public health, attended the ceremony. Founder of China's modern pediatrics, Zhu was also an educator and honorary president of the Beijing Children's Hospital. A native of Wuxi city in east China's Jiangsu Province, he graduated from the Beijing Union Medical College in 1927 and obtained a doctor's degree from the State University of New York of the United States. In 1931 he went to the United States to study pediatrics, majoring in the prevention of children's measles through placental globulin, and was highly praised by TIME magazine at that time. Zhu's achievements in that study are still helping pediatricians in many hospitals around the world today. He returned to China in 1933 and with others set up the private Beijing Pediatrics Hospital in 1942. In the 1960s, he and other Chinese pediatricians invented a new vaccine for measles and promoted it across the nation. The vaccine effectively reduced the occurrence of and mortality rate from children's measles in China. His work Practical Pediatrics, which was first published in 1943, was highly praised by fellow pediatricians around the world. In 1993, that book was awarded a national best prize. He also set up a training seminar, through which several generations of pediatricians in China were trained. In 1991, the ministry of public health set up the "Zhu Futang Prize" in his honor, an award to recognize outstanding pediatricians in China annually.
