The message coming from the seminar indicates that in order to promote reform, opening up, and economic development in central and western parts of China, the utilization of foreign capital in China will be inclined to inland provinces during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan. The seminar proposed that to support the development of reform, opening up, and economic construction in the central and western regions, the focus of the country's utilization of foreign capital will be tilted to inland provinces during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan to increase the strength of construction projects in the central and western regions, help boost economic construction in inland provinces on an overall scale, narrow the economic gap between the inland provinces and the coastal regions, quicken the pace of all reform undertakings in China, and promote the cooperation and development of complementary projects. It is known that three projects Gansu Province has procured have been listed in the state's foreign capital utilization plan. The three projects are a 30,000-line program-controlled telephone system, with an investment of $47 million; comprehensive treatment of atmospheric pollution in Lanzhou, with an investment of $100 million; and a key water control project in the Shule He Valley, with an investment of $150 million.
