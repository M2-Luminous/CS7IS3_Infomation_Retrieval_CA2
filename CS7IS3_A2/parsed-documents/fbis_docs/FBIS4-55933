"It would be much better for us to give up arguing on this artificial problem and to concentrate on our national interests," the Romanian minister adds. Showing that taking what is best from one side or another "does not mean however that we have deceived one side or the other or that we were hostile to one side or thrown into the arms of another," Gheorghe Tinca states in the mentioned interview: "I am militating exclusively for our national interests and we must find out how we can better serve these interests. Two are the fundamental criteria: performance and cost. That is why I think that we should foster ties with the entire world, benefiting on all planes, but especially as regards technical progress". As for the budget allotted to defense, the Romanian minister views it as enough as regards preservation of the country's defense capacities. "I am glad that special attention was given to social aspects, such as housing the militaries, where we are facing major problems. As for Army equipment with top military technique, even if we had three-times the budget of the country, it wouldn't have been enough for gaining that sophisticated weaponry that we are all dreaming of, for which many years are to pass and even huge expenses to be made". "The issues confronting the Romanian Army, the real ones regarding reform, modernization, qualitative changes are only beginning and are implying a long and thorough process," Gheorghe Tinca concluded.
