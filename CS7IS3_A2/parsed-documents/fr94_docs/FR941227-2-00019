FR941227-2-00019 FR941227-2-00014 Office of the Secretary Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS); Specialized Treatment Services (STS) Program AGENCY: Office of the Secretary, DoD. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: This notice is to advise interested parties that Wilford Hall Medical Center (WHMC) has been designated as the first national STS facility for liver transplants. The STS Program establishes new requirements for CHAMPUS beneficiaries to obtain some highly specialized health care services from selected military and civilian treatment facilities. These designations will be based on the highly specialized capabilities of those selected facilities. The purpose of such designations is to concentrate patient referrals for certain highly specialized procedures which are of relatively low incidence and/or relatively high per-case cost and which require patient concentration to permit resource investment and enhance the effectiveness of quality assurance efforts. EFFECTIVE DATE: April 1, 1995. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Martha M. Maxey, Health Care Policy Analyst, program Development Branch, Office of the Civil Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, (OCHAMPUS), Aurora, Colorado, 80045&hyph;6900, telephone (303) 361&hyph;1227. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On November 5, 1993, (58 FR 58964), the Department of Defense published a final rule on the STS Program. Included in the final rule was a provision that a notice of all military and civilian STS Facilities be published in the Federal Register annually, including a listing of the several procedures subject to nationwide catchment area Nonavailability Statements and the highly specialized procedures subject to 200-mile catchment area Nonavailability Statements. Based on this provision, notice is given that WHMC is designated as the national STS facility for liver transplants. Dated: December 21, 1994. L.M.
