FR941011-2-00063 FR941011-2-00033 [Project No. 2493&hyph;006&hyph;WA] Puget Power Sound and Light Company, Notice of Proposed Restricted Service List for a Memorandum of Agreement for Managing Properties Included in or Eligible for Inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places October 4, 1994. Rule 2010 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure provides that, to eliminate unnecessary expense or improve administrative efficiency, the Secretary may establish a restricted service list for a particular phase or issue in a proceeding (18 CFR 385.2010). The restricted service list should contain the names of persons on the service list who, in the judgment of the decisional authority establishing the list, are active participants with respect to the phase or issue in the proceeding for which the list is established. The Commission is consulting with the Washington State Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation (hereinafter, ``OAHP'') and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (hereinafter, ``Council'') pursuant to the Council's regulations, 36 CFR part 800, implementing section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 470f), to prepare a memorandum for managing historic properties_i.e., those included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places_that may be affected by a license issuing for Project No. 2493. The MOA, when executed by the Commission, OAHP, and the Council, would satisfy the Commission's section 106 responsibilities for all individual undertakings carried out in accordance with the license until the license expires or is terminated. The Commission's responsibilities pursuant to section 106 for Project No. 2513 would be fulfilled through one MOA which the Commission proposes to draft in consultation with certain parties listed below. The executed MOA would be incorporated into any order issuing license. Thus, we propose, as an initial consideration, to restrict the service list to OAHP and the Council, with whom we propose to execute the MOA. Puget Power Sound and Light Company, moreover, as prospective licensee for Project No. 2493, and various Native American groups are invited to participate in consultations to develop the MOA and to sign it as a concurring party.
