Security Council in connection with its resolution on Gorazde, adopted last night. "Russia is convinced," Vorontsov noted, "that there is no alternative to the political deblocking of the Bosnian conflict. In addition to urgent measures, called upon to stop the military escalation, we need perspective political steps, projected into the future, which would ensure a breakthrough towards the settlement of this sanguinary conflict. This is the purpose of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's initiative, envisaging a summit meeting of Russia, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations. It is high time for them to work out a joint political approach to the solution of the Bosnian conflict and to make it known to the conflicting sides so that it would be clear to them that it is necessary to reach an agreement and not to skip over from one crisis to another," the Russian delegate noted. He pointed out that in the present-day conditions it was primarily necessary for all the sides to immediately conclude under the aegis of the U.N. PROFOR [UN Protection Force] an agreement on a ceasefire in Gorazde and on the entire territory of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which should be scrupulously observed. "The Bosnian Serb leadership must assume a commitment to stop attacks and to withdraw its forces from Gorazde, to ensure conditions for the deployment of U.N. troops in that city... At the same time, all provocative actions in Gorazde and around it, as well as in other safety zones must be stopped," Vorontsov stressed. He said that the Security Council "cannot and shall not put up with attempts to undermine the political process by adventuristic and provocative actions, no matter who is behind them." The Russian representative drew attention to the concern expressed in the resolution in connection with the abuse of the status of safety zones and pointed out that it was necessary to specify the concept of such areas. He expressed Russia's readiness to strengthen the safety zones. Vorontsov stressed that the idea of lifting the embargo on arms deliveries to the conflict zones "runs counter to the efforts to achieve an early peace and is apt to add fuel to the blazing conflict, which is liable to spread to neighbouring countries".
