Therefore, there are conspiracies. Installing the device at the Iranian Embassy in London -- which, as you heard, our Foreign Ministry explained to the people -- by Britain, that old, decrepit, fallen, and defeated politician, is one of the plots. That "Satanic Verses" book written by that despicable person, whom I do not want to name, was another, and so on. These are the conspiracies the arrogant world is hatching now. International forums and organizations are under its control. Decision-making centers are under its thumb. With great regret, certain governments of Islamic countries are in its service. It can control the ebb and flow of the resources of many Islamic countries. This is the situation that the arrogant world has created. It is scared of Islam, so you see how it treats Muslims in Bosnia, Palestine, Algeria, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and other Islamic countries, and inside Islamic countries. There exists an evil triangle: on the one side is world arrogance, led by America; on the other, the residues of the collapsed East, and the third side is Zionism, which by its nature is an ally of the other two sides of the triangle. They have created this situation in the world of Islam. What Islam and the Koran offer as a solution is that victory is the triumph of right, and God's triumph is success. Deviation from the path of God brings failure and wretchedness. Jihad, alertness, self-sacrifice, selflessness, and solidarity are among what we see liberating nations, and their inception is from Islamic Iran, the land of Islam. That is why the world of arrogance has risen against it. We should recognize such conspiracies. God be praised, our nation is aware of such conspiracies and is still brave. We should go on knowing that God's victory is with us, God's triumph is with us, and the last word is said and will be said by Islam, God willing. [crowd chants: "God is great," "Death to America," "Death to Israel," other indistinct slogans] [passage omitted] I wish to say prayers to plead with God to remove the difficulties facing the Islamic world. I also wish to pray for the speedy recovery of those suffering illness, particularly for Ayatollah Khaza'ali, who is hospitalized and is suffering from a heart ailment. May God cut off the hands of blasphemy. May God turn the evil of oppressors onto themselves and may He assist the suffering Muslims, particularly in Bosnia, Palestine, and other regions. May God assist the dear leader of the revolution. [passage omitted]
