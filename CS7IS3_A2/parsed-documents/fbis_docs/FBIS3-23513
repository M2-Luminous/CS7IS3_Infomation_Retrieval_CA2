Filippov under the rubric "Aviainform": "Accident of a `Stealth'"[.sup]1[/]] [Text] The new YF-22A fighter suffered an accident on 25 April 1992 at the U.S. Edwards Air Force Base (California) during plant testing. The ATF program, under which the aircraft was being developed to replace the F-15, was partially classified, but for a certain circle of specialists it was no secret that the work is being conducted in order to create an advanced tactical air-supremacy fighter. The requirements posed toward it are also convincing in that regard--high effectiveness in aerial battle outside of visual contact with the enemy, use in good and bad weather conditions and in day or night, and support for double the number of aircraft-sorties per day with a reduction in support personnel. The aircraft should also have supersonic cruising speed in non-afterburner engine operating mode, low detectability and the possibility of being operated from runways 450--600 meters long. Lockheed and Northrop, with experience in the development of the F-117 and B-2 Stealth aircraft, were selected first for the realization of the project in 1986. After the first flight tests of the experimental aircraft (the YF-22 and YF-23) in August and September of 1990, however, the working design engineering for the pre-series-production aircraft was entrusted to Lockheed. The firm's product had advantages in maneuverability, controllability and detectability indicators. The latter quality was attained thanks to the fact that essentially all of the achievements of the Stealth technology--low-reflecting shapes, radio-absorbing materials and electronic-warfare gear, among others--were employed on the fighter. The radar signature (EPR) of the YF-22 in some aspects from the forward hemisphere, according to some assessments that leaked to the press, is about one percent of the EPR of the F-15. This, in the intent of the designers, should reduce by 5--10 times the effective range of missiles against it. Engines with non-controllable air intakes and flat nozzles fitted with a system to divert the thrust vector have been installed on the aircraft. They develop thrust equal to roughly 156 kN in a static afterburning mode. An excellent aircraft by all measures, whatever one may say. The failure that occurred, however, has somewhat reduced the optimism of its advocates. That day, going around after a missed approach, the fighter unexpectedly dropped to the runway and caught fire after several cycles of powerful vibrations on the vertical plane. Test pilot Tom Morgenfeld, even though he sustained burns, was able to get out of the cockpit in time. The precise cause of the accident has not yet been established, but specialists have already advanced a number of options. The assumption arose that changes in the magnitude and direction of the thrust vector in afterburner mode of engine operation could occur. Such a situation had not been studied before. U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff General McPeak holds a different opinion. Insofar as it was established in the initial stages of study that the stabilizer of the YF-22A has larger angles of deflection when the landing gear is down than when it is up, it is namely for that reason that the electronic control system should be subjected to careful checking. General McPeak at the same time does not conceal the difficulties in determining the cause of the accident, owing to the destruction of a considerable portion of the aircraft during the half-hour fire. The flight data recorders and the data of telemetric measurements, all of which remained intact, save the situation. It has been established that the vibrations of the aircraft on the vertical plane began after the pilot, when going around, turned on the afterburner and retracted the landing gear. Significant vibrations in the stabilizer, typical of the unsteady operation of the electronic control system, were recorded at that time. The deflection of the nose of the aircraft from the trim position reached 20� upward and 5� downward for obviously that reason as well. The landing was also at an angle of attack greater than that allowed. Specialists have determined that the speed of the fighter was within allowable limits, and no signs of a separation of the airflow on the wing were observed. Many, however, feel that the possibility cannot be dismissed of the consequences of flaws or specific features of the behavior of the aircraft that had simply not been studied in this stage of testing. Turning on the afterburner in conjunction with controlling the thrust vector, for example, had only been done before at high altitude and, naturally, not during the process of retracting the landing gear. The possibility of the appearance of aircraft rocking owing to the imprecise actions of the pilot with the control stick, which on the YF-22 is mounted on a side panel and has a range of motion of just three quarters of an inch form the neutral position, had not been checked out. Answers to all of these questions would seemingly be provided by more profound study, both of this particular incident and by further testing of the undoubtedly successful craft. As for this particular copy, it is not subject to restoration, since 20--25 percent of its structural elements were destroyed by fire. The report of the U.S. Defense Department that this accident will not entail serious delays in the deadlines for the completion of testing sounds entirely justified. More than three quarters of the planned program of test flights had already been made successfully before it happened, after all, and the characteristics of the aeroelasticity of the aircraft had been obtained and the interference of the weapons systems had even been measured. Data had been obtained even earlier regarding vibration and acoustic loads on a special aircraft. The second of the two YF-22 aircraft built, however, is evidently not suited for flights, and the flight testing will be able to be renewed only after the building of an experimental F-22 in 1995.
