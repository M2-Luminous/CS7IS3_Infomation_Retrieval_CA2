[Begin recording] [Correspondent Richard Newton] At a press conference in Bloemfontein, Mr. Lekota said that although his opponents had not done that well, they would still be involved in decision-making. [Lekota] I will consult with my colleagues, and I would like to suggest to them that we should insist on close consultation in whatever we do with the parties that exist in this region. [Newton] Mr. Lekota added that support for his party had come from across the spectrum. [Lekota] Many white Free Staters voted without regard to color, and voted therefore for the African National Congress.
