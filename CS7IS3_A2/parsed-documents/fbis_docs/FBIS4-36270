Officials have not ruled out the possibility of a lightning tour of the region, especially Syria and Israel, by Secretary of State Warren Christopher after the NATO meetings in Istanbul next week. [passage omitted] Lebanese Ambassador Dr. Riyad Tabbarah met last Friday with Robert Pelletreau, U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs and his deputy Dan Kirtzer [as published]. It has been learned from informed sources that the U.S. side told the Lebanese side that "New York is not the right place" to discuss the escalation of violence and "the Israeli war" against Hizballah, an indication that Washington was not prepared to support Beirut's complaint against Israel at the Security Council. It repeated that the appropriate place was "the negotiating table." [passage omitted] Sources have described the contacts between Ambassador Tabbarah and Pelletreau and Kirtzer as being "a frank dialogue" particularly in connection with the negative U.S. position on Hizballah, portraying it as a threat not only to Israel but also to Lebanon, and as a tool in Iran's hand. [passage omitted] Yesterday Damascus denied the existence of an agreement with Israel providing for the cessation of national and Islamic resistance operations against the Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon or that "it made a deal behind the backs of the Lebanese." Informed Syrian sources have told AL-HAYAH that "Syria has not agreed with the Israelis to stop the firing of Katyushas on northern Israel, and denied the existence of any deal under which the resistance would only fire Katyushas on the occupied strip." They emphasized that Syria "has made no agreements behind the back of the Islamic resistance or the Lebanese Government, and it cannot possibly become the protector of Israeli security," but they pointed out that "the resistance does not shell Galilee unless the Israelis attack civilians, as happened last July." In Beirut, Lebanese President Ilyas al-Hirawi held consultations with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad on the political dimensions of the Israeli aggression launched by the Israeli Air Force last Thursday on a Hizballah base in the area of 'Ayn Kawkab in the Ba'labakk hills. AL-HAYAH has learned that the unannounced contacts between the two presidents took place last Friday evening and included a general assessment of the situation in Lebanon and the region in the light of the frozen peace negotiations and the need for cooperation to consolidate the internal situation in the face of Israeli aggression and not to allow its results to be used as a way of undermining national unity. The Lebanese-Syrian contacts occurred as Iranian Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati was on an unscheduled visit to Damascus, prompted by the latest developments in Lebanon. As regards reactions to the Israeli raid, the position taken by the state in embracing the resistance and declaring a day of general mourning for the victims of the aggression to stress internal solidarity and control of the situation and prevent any negative effects, was welcomed by most Islamic and Christian spiritual authorities, and Hizballah was also responsive to it. AL-HAYAH has learned that Hizballah's leadership showed appreciation of the delicate situation and did not break the official and political consensus. In fact, it has been eager to reaffirm its willingness to draw a distinction between its position regarding the Israeli raid and response to all the efforts aimed at keeping the situation under control. It is noteworthy that, from the first moment of the aggression targeting it, Hizballah's leadership acted responsibly and overlooked its tense relations with the government and its opposition to the government's policy, as though it was seeking a new truce on the grounds that the priorities at this stage dictated that it should not open old files because it felt that that would undermine efforts to close ranks in the face of Israeli threats in the absence of any international stand and, particularly, of any U.S. stand that would deter Israel. This was emphasized by Hizballah's deputies at the meeting of the executive and legislative committees of the Higher Islamic Shiite Council chaired by its chairman, Shaykh Muhammad Mahdi Shams al-Din. The party's leadership has even responded to the efforts made by Chamber of Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri from his home in Musaylih-al-Nabatiyah, and it quickly tackled the problems which occurred between its fighters and some members of the Fijian UN contingent in the south, and also stopped firing Katyushas to spare the south further hot eruptions.
