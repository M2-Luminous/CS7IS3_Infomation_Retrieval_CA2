FR940919-0-00005 FR940919-0-00001 10. Section 400.52␣Reporting and Record Requirements Comment: One comment suggested that the language in §400.52(b)(1), regarding inaccurate reporting or failure to retain acceptable records, be changed from ``may result'' or ``may be'' to ``shall be'' to eliminate any implicit option. The penalty for not having or retaining acceptable records should be the combining of farm units and the recalculation of the APH yield. Response: Basic farm units must be provided irrespective of APH records. Optional farm units are a further subdivision of basic units and must meet separate record requirements stated in the crop policy to qualify as separate optional units. Recalculation of the APH yield will not always result in a lower APH yield. However, if inaccurately reported or acceptable records are not retained for either basic or optional units, APH yields will be recalculated. FCIC has made changes to the regulation to address this concern that are consistent with the crop insurance policies. Comment: Section 400.52(b)(4)_This provision states that the policy may be canceled and subject to false claims penalties if the production history is not accurate. Section 400.52 (a)(3) indicates it is acceptable not to provide complete production reports since assigned yields are an acceptable means to maintain continuity of yield data on file. A comment suggested that §400.52 (a)(3) and (b)(4) are in conflict with §400.52(b)(1). Response: FCIC does not agree that a conflict exists. However, FCIC has clarified these provisions to more accurately reflect their intent. Section 400.52(a)(3) allows FCIC to use previously reported production history to calculate APH yields, if the insured does not file annual production reports as required by the policy. Section 400.52(b)(1) specifies that inaccurate reporting or failure to maintain acceptable supporting records will result in the combining of optional units and recalculation of the APH yield. Section 400.52(b)(4) is a separate action that may be taken if an insured misrepresents or fraudulently reports APH information. 11. Section 400.53␣Submission and Accuracy of Production Reports Comment: One comment suggested deleting §400.53(e) since it essentially duplicates the provisions of §400.53(a). Response: FCIC agrees with this comment and has changed the provision accordingly. 12. Section 400.54␣Qualification for Actual Production History Coverage Program Comment: Section 400.54(a)_One comment suggested that the first sentence be revised because production reports for the four most recent crop years are not required to qualify for APH. The comment also suggested revising the last sentence because of the possibility of zero planted years. The comment suggested employing ``.␣.␣. will occur in the database when there are less than four actual/assigned yields in the database.'' Response: FCIC agrees with these suggestions and has made the appropriate changes. Comment: One comment noted that in §400.54(a) the term ``will be updated'' suggests that production reports are mandatory each subsequent crop year. The comment suggested that the regulation address the possibility that coverage may be based on 65 percent of the T/D yield without yearly production reports. A comment also stated that records are not mandatory, as indicated in §400.54(b), and that insureds may have approved APH yields based on 65 percent of the T/D-Yield if acceptable records are not available or not provided. The comment also stated that yields from claims will not be used (as indicated in §400.51(n)), if an insured elects not to provide records and have the APH yield based on 65 percent of the T/D Yield (also applies to §400.54(d)). Response: FCIC implemented procedures for modified APH for the 1994 crop year intending to allow producers the option of basing production guarantees on 65 percent of the T-Yield without requiring records. Not requiring records in subsequent crop years had been criticized because the use of loss records is perceived to be mandatory for APH purposes. It is also viewed as not encouraging insureds to provide records. FCIC agrees that use of loss records should be required for APH purposes. Actual yields determined from claims for indemnities will be used when calculating APH yields for the 1995 and succeeding crop years. Calculation of APH yields based on 65 percent of the T-Yield without records will be allowed only for the initial crop year of insurance. Records will be required for subsequent crop years. Comment: Section 400.54(d)_One comment suggested deleting the phrase ``to compute an approved APH yield'' because it is not required to have an actual yield for the most recent crop year to calculate an approved APH yield. The comment also suggested deleting the phrase ``at discretion of FCIC.'' Response: FCIC does not agree with the suggestion to delete ``to compute an approved APH yield'' because the phrase relates to providing actual yields (production records) in order to qualify for optional units. However, the language has been clarified to reflect this intent. FCIC does not agree that ``at discretion of FCIC'' should be removed. This provision allows FCIC a degree of flexibility concerning the impact of loss records (e.g., FCIC may need to lessen the impact a loss record has on APH yields for a catastrophic year). Comment: Secion 400.54(e)_One comment suggested deleting provisions (1), (2), and (3), because the provisions are more applicable to procedures. If not deleted, the comment suggested inclusion of the definition ``FCIC RSO Determined Yield'' and clarification that provisions (1), (2), and (3) apply only to category C perennial crops, not just item (3). The comment further suggested deleting any reference to T-yield tables in (1). Response: FCIC does not agree that §400.54(e) (1), (2), and (3) of the rule should be deleted. These provisions allow additional flexibility for those situations listed. For example, T-Yields are not published for all crops or for all counties. Therefore, the rule must allow an alternative method to calculate approved APH yields when T-Yields are not available. For this reason, the reference to T-Yields should not be deleted. These provisions allow FCIC to continue APH procedures implemented for the 1994 crop year that are consistent with procedures used in previous crop years. The term ``FCIC RSO Determined Yield'' is not used in the rule, so consequently, the term need not be defined.
