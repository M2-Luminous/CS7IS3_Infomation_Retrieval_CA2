Journalists displayed great interest in this event, since all other top party functionaries, apart from LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, as well as newly elected legislators are, in fact, unknown to the public at large. However, despite Zhirinovskiy's assurances of his commitment to "openness and freedom of speech", journalists were barred from the business part of the meeting. They could only listen to a 30-minute speech by the party leader. Zhirinovskiy said that the parliamentary group will consist of 64 legislators, 59 of whom were elected on the party list and five from one-seat constituencies. According to the LDPR leader, the group consists of representatives from "all professions, trades and social sections". "The party's position is reconciliation," he said. "The LDPR is ready to cooperate with all but will not join blocs or agreements with anybody." According to Zhirinovskiy, there are "many good lawmakers" among communists and agrarian deputies, but they are beset with "negative historic past". As for democratic blocs, Zhirinovskiy said that "there are people who treat us well". Although the LDPR supports the new constitution in every way, regarding it "good for 90 per cent", the party plans to strive for creating "a strong parliament along with the strong president", the LDPR leader noted. Zhirinovskiy underlined that the LDPR group will lend strength to parliament.
