These reports are totally devoid of any meaning, journalists were told by an official spokesman of the royal court. According to Spain's EFE agency, Zhirinovskiy had himself spoken of the existence of the invitation to visit Spain, and his close associate Aleksandr Vengerovskiy claimed that the invitation had come through diplomatic channels. Official circles in France recently reacted negatively to the intention of the Liberal Democratic Party leader to visit Paris in February. Earlier he was asked to leave Bulgaria and not allowed into Germany.
