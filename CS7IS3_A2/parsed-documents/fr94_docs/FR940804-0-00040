ACTION: Public land order. SUMMARY: This order partially revokes a public land order insofar as it affects 79.82 acres of National Forest System land withdrawn by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, for the Libby Dam Project in the Kootenai National Forest. The land is no longer needed for the purpose for which it was withdrawn. This action will permit the Forest Service to dispose of the land through exchange. This action will open the land to mining. The land has been and remains open to surface entry and mineral leasing. EFFECTIVE DATE: September 6, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Sandra Ward, BLM Montana State Office, P.O. Box 36800, Billings, Montana 59107, 406&hyph;255&hyph;2949. By virtue of the authority vested in the Secretary of the Interior by Section 204 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, 43 U.S.C. 1714 (1988), it is ordered as follows: 1. Public Land Order No. 4484, as corrected by Public Land Order No. 4535, which withdrew National Forest System land for the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers' Libby Dam Project, is hereby revoked insofar as it affects the following described land: Principal Meridian, Montana Kootenai National Forest T. 30 N., R. 26 W., Sec. 8, lot 6 and NE1/4SW1/4. The area described contains 79.82 acres in Lincoln County. 2. At 9 a.m. on September 6, 1994, the land described above shall be opened to such forms of disposition as may by law be made of National Forest System land, including location and entry under the United States mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, other segregations of record, and the requirements of applicable law. Appropriation of land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts. Dated: July 18, 1994. Bob Armstrong, Assistant Secretary of the Interior. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;19042 Filed 8&hyph;3&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 4310&hyph;DN&hyph;M
