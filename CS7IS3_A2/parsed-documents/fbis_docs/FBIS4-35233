In its editorial today, the paper adds that when he saw Iraq getting prepared to resume its normal life and the role compatible with its size, history, and capabilities, Fahd lost his mind. For he realizes that this will mean an increase in the state of deterioration in Saudi Arabia, a widening gap between the treasonous rulers and the masses there, and a decline in the importance of the subversive Saudi role on Arab and Islamic fronts. Referring to the hostile U.S. role, the paper notes that the United States is losing daily its sources of influence on the world and regional levels to the forces of freedom and progress. The paper notes that this has left the Saudi agents deeply concerned about continued U.S. protection against the wrath of the peoples that have suffered from their crimes, especially since they know well that the "American's God is the dollar." The paper says: Therefore, Iraq's certain and imminent return to the regional arena will mean that the United States will reconsider the role of Saudi rulers and will leave them alone to deal with the realities of the new situation that emerged during the Mother of Battles. The paper stresses that as Fahd watches all this, he is obsessed day and night by the nightmare that Iraq has past the dangerous stage, that it has destroyed all justifications for the blockade, and that the world is clearly coming to understand Iraq's position. On the same topic, BABIL describes Saudi ruler Fahd as a glaring example of the pseudo men afflicting the Arab nation. In an editorial, the paper says that after what he said against Iraq, this Arabist bastion and upholder of the banner of Islam, the betrayer of the two holy mosques and Judas Iscariot can only be described as a dissolute person and a pig. The paper stresses that the Arab nation's history cannot be made by dissolute persons and pigs, but faithful leaders with clean minds and hearts. Those are makers of the future and the pride of the nation. As for the first category, their lot is to rot in vice, damnation, and misfortune.
