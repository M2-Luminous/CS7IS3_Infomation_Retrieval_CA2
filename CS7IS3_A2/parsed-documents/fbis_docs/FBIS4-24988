The average annually-added timber resources had surpassed the annual consumption for the 10th year since 1984, while during 1977-1981, the country's timber resources shrank by an average of 18.7 million cu m [cubic meters] annually, the minister said. He said that China's timber resources grew by 400 million cu m on average each year during 1989-1993, while 320 million cu m of timber was cut down. During 1984-1988, the figures were 366 million cu m and 344 million cu m, respectively. The minister attributed the steady growth to the common efforts of the Chinese people. The Chinese Government made it one of its basic policies to green the country and improve its ecological environment. At the suggestion of Deng Xiaoping, the National People's Congress passed a resolution in 1981 calling on Chinese people to plant trees every year, so as to help green the country, the minister recalled. Ever since, Chinese leaders have been taking their lead in early spring each year to plant trees. Up to date, about 18 billion trees have been planted by individuals all over the country. Several large ecological projects initiated in the late 1980s also contributed to the growth of forest resources, including the shelterbelt network stretching from northeast to northwest China, 13,000 km coastal shelterbelt network and a large program to plant 6.6 million ha of trees, using 300 million U.S. dollars of world bank loans. Facing a serious ecological environment and insufficient forest resources, China will continue its efforts to green the country and increase its forest coverage rate to 15.3 percent by the year 2000, the minister said. By the year 2000, the gross forest output value will be increased to 300 billion yuan (38.4 billion U.S. dollars) from the present 140 billion yuan (17.9 billion U.S. dollars), Xu said.
