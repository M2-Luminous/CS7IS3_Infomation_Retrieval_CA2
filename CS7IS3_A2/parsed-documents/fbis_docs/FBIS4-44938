This was stated by Mr Vinode Misra, general secretary of the party, in Calcutta on Friday. He addressed a rally at Sahid Minar to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the CPI(ML). A procession was organized during the day from Deshbandhu park to Esplanade, with peasants from Bihar and West Bengal. Criticizing the "parliamentary, social democratic and opportunist CPI [Communist Party of India] and CPI(M) [Communist Party of India-Marxist]," Mr Misra said they were interested more in keeping the Left Front Government in power in West Bengal than in building up a genuine Left movement against the Centre. He, however, added that the Liberation would oppose any move by the Congress(I) and the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] to dislodge the Front Government in West Bengal. Mr Misra ruled out the possibility of inviting the CPI and the CPI(M) to the convention of the Left organizations in New Delhi on April 25 and 26, to draw a common programme of action to oppose the Dunkel proposals. He claimed the Liberation had revised its policies in accordance with the changing situation and was in a position to provide leadership to the Left movement in the country. "We are the only true Naxalite group in the country," Mr Misra asserted. Commenting on the recent clashes between the Liberation and the MCC [Maoist Communist Center (Bihar Extremist Group)] activists in Bihar, he said the former was prepared for talks with the MCC "unconditionally," to end the violence.
