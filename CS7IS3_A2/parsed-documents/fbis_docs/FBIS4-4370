Several market analysts predict that spending in the land and building sector in Malaysia will remain high and that construction will continue to experience rapid double-digit growth over the next three years. One analyst said that construction of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) at Sepang alone will cost 8 billion ringgit. The giant project will spawn many construction contracts worth more than any in the past. The analyst listed IJM Corp. Bhd. [Limited], Pelecon Engineering Bhd., Sungei Way Holdings Bhd., and United Engineers Malaysia Bhd. as the three construction companies best prepared to compete for the contracts. He said the selection of a company will be based on the company's capabilities as shown by previous accomplishments, financial and management performance, and preparedness from the aspect of capital and skills. Another analyst said that the property "counter" will continue to have bright prospects for investment portfolios because the industry will be affected by a positive synergism. He said current factors consist of six principal projects now under way: a series of roads worth 1 billion ringgit in the Kuala Lumpur area, roads and highways in the eastern part of the Peninsula (500 million ringgit), Tenaga Nasional [National Power] Bhd. electric power plant and transmission cable projects (11 billion ringgit), a Telekom Malaysia Bhd. project (8 billion ringgit), a water supply project (2 billion ringgit), a twin runway project, and KTM [Malayan Railways] Bhd. electric trains (1.2 billion ringgit).
