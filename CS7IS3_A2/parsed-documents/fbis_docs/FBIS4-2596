Zheng Guangdi, Vice-Minister of Communications, told the opening of the first meeting of Asia-Pacific Port State Control Committee that teamwork was critical to this success. About 100 maritime authorities from 16 Asia-Pacific countries are in Beijing to collaborate on port control data exchange systems and maritime surveyor training. Last December these nations, along with Vietnam and Fiji who are absent this time, signed the Tokyo Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control -- a regional treaty to safeguard marine safety and prevent sea pollution in the region. The deal unified inspection standards. If a ship clears inspection after docking in a Chinese port, it will be granted entry to the other 17 nations without repeating the same procedures. States are obligated under the agreement to check any foreign ship entering its port, along with on-board equipment and seamen, to ensure they meet international criteria and domestic laws. Lin Yunai, head of China's Harbour Superintendency Bureau, said the region faces uneven economic development which leads to legions of substandard vessels sailing into their ports, some of which have caused serious accidents. In 1990 China launched its own port State control in 12 main seaports. More than 200 Chinese officials have qualified for overall safety checks on foreign ships, and a technical training centre has been established in Dalian to foster more maritime surveyors. The number of foreign vessels inspected topped 2,000 last year, and is expected to grow by 50 per cent annually. About 10 per cent of the examined foreign ships violated international conventions, such as having obsolete on-board fire-fighting devices. They were required to fix any problems discovered. Depending on how severe the problem is, some ships may be allowed to leave the port without making the repairs, but will have to remedy the violations in a certain time period before docking again in China. If the owner cannot fulfill the requirements, the ship will be detained. Some violators may face fines.
