The district nursing officer, Sister Winnie Fadzai Mavedzenge, last week said incidences of sexually transmitted diseases among schoolchildren, which recently represented about 60 percent of recorded cases, had been "reduced tremendously." She attributed the reduction to a vigorous anti-AIDS awareness campaign which sparked off a "condom riot" at Gutu-Mupandawana growth point as people dropped unprotected sex. "People are coming on their own to collect condoms which we have flooded in all night spots at the growth point," she said. Cde. Mavedzenge said STD had tumbled down to fourth on the list of problem diseases in Gutu after acute respiratory infections, injuries, and skin diseases since the launch in 1990. The Ministry of Health and Child Welfare went on the offensive following reports of mounting STD and HIV cases in the district of nearly 200,000 people. Under a recently unveiled knowledge, attitudes and practices programme, public health officers studied socio-economic profiles of vulnerable groups such as schoolchildren housed in illegal boarding camps before prescribing durable solutions. "We told the heads of schools that all pupils not housed in proper boarding places had to go back to their villages where they fall under their parents' authority," she said. In 1989, Gutu was shocked when the then district medical officer, Dr. David Blankhart, said that at least 100 patients in Gutu Mission Hospital had tested HIV positive. Although his statistics were holy disputed, the spiral of infection continued to rise sharply as no fewer than 2,000 STD cases were recorded per year in the district between 1991 and 1993. Sister Mavedzenge, however, said since the launch of the campaign, numbers of "ladies of easy virtue" had dwindled considerably at Gutu-Mupandawana owing largely to a rapidly disappearing clientele.
