Spokesman. After four days of debate here over the presence of Serb troops in the U.N. exclusion zone around Gorazde, Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. envoy to the former Yugoslavia, was preparing to return to his headquarters, Akashi's spokesman told reporters. "There will be no talks or meetings here in the Palais de Nations this afternoon. We will be returning now to our hotels and making arrangements to return to Zagreb," Spokesman Michael Williams said. The planned talks were to have begun on Thursday [2 June], but were postponed because a few dozen armed Serbs were reported still to be in the three-kilometer zone, as a result of which Bosnian Muslim leaders announced a boycott. During the next two days, the U.N. applied pressure on Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to withdraw the remaining troops from the zone immediately and salvage the peace talks. The U.N. peacekeepers then declared that there were no armed Serbs remaining in the zone, but later announced that some were indeed still present in the western portion of the zone. Williams said Akashi had received assurances from Karadzic that U.N. peacekeepers could take over the Serb position in the zone and had invited vice-president of the Muslim-led Bosnian Government, Ejup Ganic, to the talks. But shortly afterwards, the spokesman announced that Ganic had announced a boycott and the talks were canceled. Reports quoted Bosnian Government sources as saying that Ganic will send Akashi a letter explaining his government's reasons for not entering the negotiations while armed Serbs remain around Gorazde. The talks between Serbs, Muslims and Croats were intended to establish a total cease-fire in Bosnia and represent the latest move by the international community to bring an end to the two-year-old civil war which has claimed some 200,000 lives in the former Yugoslav republic. Earlier last week, the Muslim-led government in Bosnia said it would not attend the peace talks unless the Serbs withdrew their troops from around Gorazde.
