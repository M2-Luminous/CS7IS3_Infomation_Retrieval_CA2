[Havel] It seems to be the culmination of a crisis that has lasted on the Slovak political scene for some time now. It is difficult to know how it will develop. However, it is probable that early elections will take place, and, until then, it is hoped that some kind of less conspicuous but efficient government will be formed rather soon, which I imagine will be a semicaretaker government, one that would bridge the period and contribute to calming down the situation. It is in the interest of both the Slovak citizens and all of us who are not indifferent to developments in Slovakia. [end recording] [passage omitted]
