FR941020-2-00153 FR941020-2-00087 Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Notice of establishment of the Single Engine-IMC-with passengers ARAC Working Group. SUMMARY: Notice is given of the establishment by the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee of an ARAC working group to examine the feasibility of conducting single-engine passenger carrying operations in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) under Part 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. This notice informs the public of the activities of the ARAC and seeks the public's participation. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Quentin J. Smith, Jr., Executive Director for Air Carrier Operations Issues, Flight Standards Service (AFS&hyph;200), 800 Independence Ave. SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone (202) 267&hyph;8166, FAX: (202) 267&hyph;5230. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has established an Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee (ARAC) (56 FR 2190, January 22, 1991; and 58 FR 9230, February 19, 1993). One area that the ARAC deals with is air carrier operations. Other working groups in this area have dealt with issues such as autopilot takeoff minimum altitudes, fuel requirements, controlled rest on the flight deck, noise abatement, and flight crewmember flight/rest/duty requirements. The Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group is being established to evaluate the safety aspects and overall feasibility of allowing passenger carrying operations in IMC with single engine aircraft. The Single Engine-IMC-with passengers Working Group will forward its recommendations to the ARAC, which will then determine whether to forward them to the FAA. Specifically, the Working Group's task is as follows: (1) Review the Canadian policy authorizing single engine IMC operations in turbine-powered airplanes and make recommendations for adoption. (2) Re-examine existing policies for commercial IMC and/or night operations by single-engine aircraft. (3) Determine the conditions and/or limitations which should be met before commercial air transport IMC and/or night operations by single-engine aircraft could be permitted. (4) When considering the applicability of such operations, include both airplanes and helicopters (both turbine and reciprocating engines), passenger carriage (FAA), passenger/cargo carriage (JAA). (5) Consider and dispose of any petitions for rulemaking or exemption on this subject.
