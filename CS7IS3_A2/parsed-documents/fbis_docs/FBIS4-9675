A police source told ACAN-EFE today that the 54-year-old tourist was in that Alta Verapaz Department town when 20 peasants started chasing her because allegedly she had stolen a child. Diane, who is from Florida State, was able to find refuge in the town's court building, which was later partially destroyed when the enraged peasants attacked it with rocks, sticks, and other objects and set court files on fire. The incident took place Tuesday. The Army was sent to the town and gained control of the situation, according to volunteer firefighters. The source noted that the U.S. woman suffered a broken skull, her right arm was also broken, and was hit and stabbed in several parts of her body. After receiving first aid in San Cristobal Verapaz, the woman was admitted to a Guatemala City hospital because of the seriousness of the wounds. Diane was looking for a place to stay in the town when she was attacked by the peasants, the source reported. This attack comes 22 days after another U.S. woman, Melisa Carol Larsen, 37, was almost lynched by Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa peasants who accused her of forming part of a band dedicated to the abduction and trafficking of children. Carol Larsen was protected by the police and this brought about serious street demonstrations that resulted in 32 wounded persons, 52 arrests, and a small police station burned. This woman was set free a few days later when a court was unable to establish that she had been involved in the abduction of children. The Attorney General's Office revealed today that so far in 1994 it has received 66 files on child-stealing cases. A police source has informed ACAN-EFE about the arrest of three Guatemalan women accused of abducting as many children in this capital.
