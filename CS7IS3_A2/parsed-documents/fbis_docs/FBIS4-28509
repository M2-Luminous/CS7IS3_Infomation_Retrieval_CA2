The main opposition Democratic Party (DP) and its former chairman Kim Tae-chung welcomed the visit by the former U.S. President, noting that it was first proposed by former party leader Kim Tae- chung himself. The DP said it hoped that Carter could help find a breakthrough in the nuclear deadlock. The ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), however, sounded a note of caution, saying the visit could throw the issue into confusion as the United States and its allies are working to impose U.N. economic sanctions on North Korea. When the news of Carter's planned trip reached Seoul, Kim Tae- chung was said to have expressed "unreserved welcome." "It really is good," Kim Tae-chung was quoted by his aides as having said. "Let's hope that the North Korean nuclear issue could be resolved through this occasion." The Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia and Pacific Region said it hoped that Carter's trip would provide an opportunity to resolve the mounting tension on the Korean peninsula over the nuclear row. The visit will help to maintain nuclear transparency and normalize relations between the United States and North Korea in a package deal, the foundation said. Noting that U.N. inspection of a key radiochemical laboratory at Yongbyon was realized following a visit to Pyongyang by American evangelist Billy Graham, the foundation said it hoped for progress in negotiations on settling the nuclear issue. The ruling party said Carter's visit in effect means a reopening of negotiations and expressed concern that it could muddy the current situation as the international community makes a concerted effort to secure nuclear transparency in North Korea. In particular, the Carter visit could work unexpectedly against the move in the U.N. Security Council to slap Pyongyang with economic sanctions. Some DLP officials privately said "it is laughable" for members of the opposition party "to rejoice unreservedly," claiming Carter's visit proves "the excellent and far-sighted opinion of Chairman Kim Tae-chung." Rep. No Chae-pong said, "We all know that the Kim Tae-chung side had been in contact with Carter in the past. "What I don't understand is that they (Democratic Party) are trying to use the national security problem as a domestic political issue." Another DLP lawmaker pointed out that Carter had planned to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea and had been laughed at for his naivete. "Unless he discarded his fixed ideas of the past, he could only be an obstacle to South Korea's efforts to resolve inter- Korean questions through dialogue," he said.
