M. Bezikova, Leningrad Institute of Technology Central Weather Bureau, G. I. Kuznetsov, and V. M. Gropyanov, All- Union Institute of Refractories; UDC 666.762.62.046.44] [Abstract] A new lime refractory production process that utilizes titanium oxide as the sintering additive was proposed. TiO[.sub]2[/] was selected because the eutectic temperature of CaO-TiO[.sub]2[/] is 2010 K and because calcium titanates are resistant to atmospheric hydrolysis. The refractory is made by pulverizing pure or esp. pure calcium carbonate to a particle size of 100-150 �m and adding 2-6% TiO[.sub]2[/] or 2-4% titanium ferrite. (Optimum additive percentage was determined empirically.) A 5-% aqueous solution of sulfite waste liquor with a density of 1.15 g/sq cm is used as the binder. The green mass is then pressed into briquets and fired at 2020 K. The lime refractory material has an apparent density of 2.75-3.03 g/cu cm, apparent porosity of 3.4-9.8%, compressive strength of 60-140 N/sq mm, and a loaded deformation temperature of 1610 to 1700�C or higher.
