He was speaking to reporters in advance of World AIDS Day, which will be observed tomorrow here and abroad. Ramon said his ministry, which this year allocated NIS [new Israeli shekels] 900,000 for AIDS information campaigns and an additional NIS 4 million for testing of carriers and screening the entire blood supply, will have to increase its publicity programs when peace comes. He was pleased to report that only 145 HIV carriers were discovered during the first 10 months of the year; if this relatively slow pace continues, there will be 174 newly discovered HIV carriers in all of 1993, compared with 201 last year. The decrease, however, could be attributed by fewer individuals voluntarily going for testing. The ministry estimates that there are one or two undiscovered carriers for each known carrier, and some voluntary groups claim this figure is too conservative. A worrisome statistic that demands intensification of the ministry's information campaign is that half of those infected with HIV this year are between 15 and 24. The share of women among the carriers is climbing; for every two men who are infected, three women become carriers. By the year 2000, HIV infection is expected to be nearly equal between the sexes. Carriers can expect to live no more than five to 10 years after initial infection by the virus. Since women can infect their babies (in the womb or via the birth canal), the number of infants with HIV is expected to increase around the world. A total of 43 Israeli children have been infected by their mothers; six of them developed AIDS (three of them died) and the rest are carriers. [passage omitted]
