FR940607-2-00094 FR940607-2-00063 Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room. Copies of the filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the NASD. All submissions should refer to File No. SD&hyph;NASD&hyph;94&hyph;26 and should be submitted by June 28, 1994. IV. Commission's Findings and Order Granting Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Change The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the NASD and, in particular, the requirements of section 15A(b)(5), which specifies that the rules of a national securities association provided for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and any other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the association operates or controls. As discussed above, the present proposal sets subscribers fees at $9.75 per terminal which is below the $10.00 terminal ceiling that the Commission, in 1982, found to be reasonable for subscriber access to last sale reports for over 1,000 Nasdaq/National Market securities. The Commission believes that the present proposal is consistent with the 1982 order because subscribers now may access last sales reports in over 20,000 securities, which nearly 4000 are Nasdaq/National Market securities. The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the 30th day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the Federal Register . The Commission increase is consistent with the 1982 order. The Commission also believes that accelerated approval of the present proposal is appropriate because, since April 4, 1994, subscribers have been receiving last sale information at no additional charge in the expanded universe of securities that recently became subject to last sale reporting requirements. It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) 8 that the proposed rule change is hereby approved. 8 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(2) (1988). For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority. 9 9 17 CFR 200.30&hyph;3(a)(12)(1991). Margaret H. McFarland, Deputy Secretary.
