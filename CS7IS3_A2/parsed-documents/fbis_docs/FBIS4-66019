Discounting the need to ascribe blame for the present difficulty to any particular group or groups, Koc stressed that the effects of the "economic measures plan" recently announced by the Tansu Ciller government should be realized by the middle of 1996. Koc said, "If everyone carries his share of the burden in a spirit of unity and solidarity, I am confident that the Turkish nation will overcome this problem." Koc, in a written three-page statement, issued a call for unity and solidarity to enable Turkey to overcome the economic and political crisis it finds itself in today. The 70-year-old Koc pointed out that he has experienced everything from the National Salvation Struggle under Ataturk's leadership to the Inonu, Bayar, and Menderes eras that culminated in single party regimes with military and coalition governments. Koc cited these as examples of hard times that Turkey had to endure. Pointing out that Turkey is entering another period of hard times, Koc said, "There is widespread devastation from the terrorism in the southeast. There are economic problems waiting to be solved. Our country is facing foreign and domestic dangers. We have been in economic and political turmoil for the past 10 years, but on similar occasions in the past we have surmounted the difficulties. This time, however, we have entered a heretofore unprecedented economic crisis." Koc continued his statement by saying, "In order to resolve this situation, the Ciller government announced on 5 April that it had prepared an `economic measures plan.' This is a good plan, but the results will be realized gradually over a two-year period, provided that the plan can be put into effect immediately. Public opinion has not yet reached a consensus on how we should overcome the present crisis. There is no point in assigning blame for this crisis. The Ciller plan may have some shortcomings--the details have to be worked out--but our president, prime minister, party leaders, and assembly members must support and adopt it. The press and television must also contribute to this effort by pointing the public in the right direction. It would also be beneficial, after soliciting the views of the labor unions, the Turkish Union of Chambers and Commodity Exchanges [TOBB], and the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association [TUSIAD] to make the requisite foreign contacts in order to regain our country's prestige abroad. For example, what steps will be taken with regard to tax reform, budget reductions, state enterprise [KIT] privatization and/or closure, and minimization of the state's share of the economy? These questions require input and support from the party leaders. There is no possibility of success if the whole country is going to be taxed while the government continues to waste money on unprofitable state enterprises. If taxes are used to make up the deficits of these state enterprises, you can forget any possibility of success. If the plan is to be successful, the burdens must be borne and shared equally. There must be no turning back after implementation begins. If the implementation is equitable and all sectors are consulted, and if everyone pays his taxes, I am convinced that free market forces will ensure the success of the plan and no further sacrifices will be necessary. The Turkish nation is a great nation. Any sacrifice is justified if you believe it is for the good of the nation. If each one of us does his duty in a spirit of unity and solidarity, the Turkish nation will overcome the present difficulty."
