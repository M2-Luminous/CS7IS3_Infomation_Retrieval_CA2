In an interview with the ASAHI SHIMBUN in the United States, the chairman of the Kim Tae-chung Peace Foundation for the Asia-Pacific Region said Washington will never allow North Korea to acquire nuclear weapons. Kim voiced optimism on resolution of the nuclear dispute because Pyongyang's overriding goal is not to possess nuclear weapons but to establish diplomatic relations with Washington. Therefore, the United States should tell China that it intends to normalize relations with North Korea in order to secure Chinese cooperation, Kim said. The former South Korean opposition leader has been visiting the United States. Since China does not want to see a Japan armed with nuclear weapons, the United States would be able to obtain Chinese cooperation, Kim added. As long as Washington does not provide clear assurances to North Korea through diplomatic channels, it will be difficult to resolve the nuclear row, he said. North Korea is suspicious about U.S. intentions because Washington has failed to offer any detailed plans, Kim said, adding that Pyongyang is worried that when the nuclear row is cleared up, the United States will take issue with North Korean human rights absues, chemical weapons, terrorism and arms exports to the Middle East. North Korea refuses to accept complete inspections of its nuclear facilities because if it did, it would lose "the card" for a third round of high-level negotiations with the United States, Kim said. Once Pyongyang's nuclear card is used, the attention of the United States and the international community will shift to human rights and other issues, he said.
