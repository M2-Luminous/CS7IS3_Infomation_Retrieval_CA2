This question has been conspicuous in recent years. A ready-made answer is often presented: "The collapse of communism in East Europe has brought the era of the laborer to an end." This sinister answer links laborers to communism, as if laborers and their defense are confined to communism. One of the greatest acts of political deception in this century has been America's promotion of the lie that socialism has been defeated and that the interests of laborers, as defined by socialism, are an illusion that will never materialize. They argue that this is because a market economy will give the laborers only what they deserve. Apart from this, nothing else is "part of the jurisdiction" of the economic system. This leads to the assumption that the poor segments of society must endure poverty because they must accept it as their fate in life. However, the chance for the United States to continue this deception was short-lived, even shorter than expected by its most sworn enemies. This is because the "market economy," which replaced communism in East Europe, actually created misery, crime, social and moral decadence, and cultural and political degeneration. Thus, those who were deceived by slogans of "democracy" and "human rights" were soon disillusioned when the human being there became the cheapest commodity under the market economy. Thus, the overwhelming majority of people in East Europe and the Third World discovered that capitalism is the AIDS of the age because it spreads poverty, social degradation, and injustice. As the true leader of all the social classes and segments that have been economically destroyed by the U.S. invasion, it was natural for the working class in those countries to resume their struggle and to swiftly turn into a revolutionary force working for the removal of misery and degeneration. The year 1993 truly marked the beginning of world struggle against U.S. capitalism's attempts to conquer the world and turn the middle class into a poor working class. Such attempts have polarized the world into a poor majority and very tiny rich minority. Socialism has restored its vitality and managed to isolate the capitalist and bourgeois forces. The conviction that social justice cannot be achieved under capitalism has won more supporters, because the working class in eastern Europe and some parts of western and central Europe has freed itself of the illusions of capitalism and the market economy. Just as late 19th century witnessed the decadence of capitalist thought, the late 20th century will witness the defeat of capitalism as a way of life. This raises the need for a socialism that respects the freedom of human beings, recognizes the private sector within a socialist understanding, coexists with religion, and entertains strong and clear nationalistic traits reflecting the true interests of peoples and nations. Such a formula will overcome the weaknesses of communism and capitalism at the same time.
