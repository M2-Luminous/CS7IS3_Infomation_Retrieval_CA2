PDC presidential candidate Engineer Eduardo Vallarino pointed out that his political party had firm plans to renounce his candidacy, however, a lack of understanding prevented it. The candidate made this statement during a political campaign event in western Panama: [Begin Vallarino recording] This morning, we greeted and exchanged views with members of the Arnulfist Party here in Chiriqui. The talks that failed, however, were the ones we held at my residence in the past few days. First, we invited the Arnulfist alliance and then Carles' alliance to try to reconcile, to unite them. Our position was that, if we managed to get them to reach an agreement to establish a great civilist alliance, we would support that civilist alliance. This was not possible because neither candidate was willing to yield to the other. In view of this, we simply had to put an end to our efforts. I repeat, in order to achieve this, we said we would be willing to renounce our candidacy at a very high political cost to our party. The unwillingness of the two candidates to renounce their candidacies created a mathematical impossibility: there can be no great alliance with two leaders. This frustrated the talks.
