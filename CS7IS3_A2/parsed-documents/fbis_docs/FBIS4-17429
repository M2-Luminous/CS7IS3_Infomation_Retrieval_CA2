He disclosed that [words indistinct] was proposed to the members of the CIS economic union within the framework of the convention on the establishment of a single CIS payments union signed on 15 April this year in Moscow. Movsisyan said the idea of establishing a universal currency for the CIS similar to the European ECU [European Currency Unit], envisages the creation of a financial reserve at the CIS Interstate Bank. Each republic would make a pro rata payment into this reserve, based on its GNP. The deputy minister believes that this would enable the CIS states to survive the payments crisis, and would also be an effective way to establish exchange rates between the soft currencies of the CIS and to make them convertible among each other.
