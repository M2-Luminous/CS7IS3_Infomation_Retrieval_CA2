On 5 July all these general officers will retire as a result of time in service. Then the picture will change. According to the military leaders, moving high command figures is a constitutional act and, furthermore, a prerogative of the president and commander in chief of the FAN. They added that relieving the general command posts and the defense minister is part of the normal military procedure. They added that this clearly shows the normal atmosphere reigning at military headquarters and confirms that such changes cause no disruptions in the business of state, as long as such changes are in accordance with current military regulations. If otherwise carried out, said changes might create an unnecessary crisis within the armed institutions. One high-ranking Army officer pointed out that seniority -- which some politicians have tried to overcome so many times before and has recently been treated with very little respect -- still has its place within the FAN. As we all know, the High Command and the commanding general officers of the Armed Forces are, firstly, Vice Admiral Radames Munoz, whose command post is at the Ministry of Defense; Division Generals Miguel Angel Andara Clavier and Ismael Antonio Guzman, inspector general and chief of the Joint General Staff of the FAN, respectively. Commanding the services are Gen. Jorge Isaac Tagliafierro de Lima, the Army commander; Gen. Freddy Yanez Mendez, the Air Force commander; Gen. Pedro Romero Farias, of the National Guard (GN); and Vice Adm. Julian Mauco Quintana, the Navy commander. The first three commanders are to retire on 5 July. They belong to the class of 1964, each in his own command academy. Munoz Leon is a graduate of the "Gran Mariscal Ayacucho"; the old Venezuelan Naval Academy in Maiquetia. As such, he -- like his fellow commanders -- will have completed 30 years of active service, according to the FAN Organic Law. Regarding the commanding general officers of the individual forces, the oldest soldiers in the force are Army Commander Tagliafierro de Lima and Air Force Commander Yanez Mendez. These two officers also graduated from their forces' academies in 1964. Gen. Romero Farias (GN) and Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana (Navy), however, are still relatively new to active service. Along this same line of thought, what would happen if President Caldera were to remove the current command staff and replace the defense minister with the young and brilliant Army Gen. Rafael Angel Montero Revette, the current inspector general of the Army? In their words, "this would be the worst political decision the chief of state could make," although they are sure such a thing will never happen. Caldera, they say, is a seasoned public figure and statesman, and knows how the pieces move on the FAN chess board, to use a metaphor. They also believe that it would be even worse if the president were to decide to appoint one of the division generals -- such as Nestor Lara Estrano, the current director general of the Defense Ministry, Moises Orozco Graterol or Alberto Emerich Esquea Torres, the executive secretary of the National Security and Defense Council -- above Gen. Montero Revette. In any case, the top commanders believe that if anyone "tries to get rid of Adm. Munoz Leon," which is the new president's prerogative, the logical thing would be to appoint Andara Clavier (Air Force), the current inspector general of the FAN, as new defense minister until 5 July. Then Army Gen. Guzman, chief of the FAN Joint General Staff, would replace Andara in normal rotation. Vice Adm. Mauco Quintana, commander of the Navy, would replace Guzman. There are other formulas that they call "logical," but the wisest thing for President Caldera to do is reaffirm Munoz in his post until next 5 July, even though he is the supreme commander in the end. Munoz Leon, who would seem to be the president's current "target," would not mind going home. He thinks that command rotation is necessary, now more than ever, in times of crisis. There is a generation eager to work, to continue with the preset plans and carry out the ideas they have been kneading all their lives. It is the FAN's rotation policy at the minister of defense's office and the reverence for seniority that has honored the institution and has been a source of hope for the military command component. It has been an effective mechanism to prevent one force from prevailing over the other and the difficulties such a situation would entail. In summary, for the members of the military High Command, balance is the important thing in delegating the various Defense Ministry posts. That is, that no single force should have an advantage over the others and the men be place in accordance with their skills and qualifications and, above all, their ability to render the best possible service to the FAN, with the desire to equally distribute the missions to be accomplished.
