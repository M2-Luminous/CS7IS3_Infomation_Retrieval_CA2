He said a movement that combines left-wing, right-wing, centrist and nationalist streams can only work when there is a common aim. Such was the case of Civic Forum and Public Against Violence whose unifying aim was getting rid of communism after the Velvet Revolution of 1989. Another such unifying aim was Slovak independence. Once these goals are achieved, the big movements fall apart, he said. "The aim now in Slovakia's prosperity and ideas on how to achieve it differ. Differing views can be contained in a coalition but not in a single party... that is the fate of the HZDS," he said. "If a broad movement wants to go one way it needs a very authoritarian and autocratic policy, concentrated on the person of the leader. This is the path chosen by the HZDS," Roman Kovac said, referring to HZDS chairman and former Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar. Kovac himself was former deputy prime minister and deputy chairman of the HZDS before being expelled from the party for what Meciar called "betrayal." He was later instrumental in Meciar's downfall. Kovac said he believed the creation of the current coalition -- comprising the left, centrist groups of "dissidents" from the HZDS and the right-leaning Christian Democrats -- will help crystalline the political scene. After the September general elections he expects the emergence of classic centrist, left and right parties. Referring to a recent poll conducted after the no-confidence vote toppled the Meciar government but showing the HZDS was still the most popular party with a quarter of the respondents backing it, Kovac said "in Slovakia as in every other state there is a group of radical citizens who long for an autocratic style of government as a solution to problems. They vote Vladimir Meciar. The HZDS bloc will definitely get into parliament... but the time for broad movements is past," he told CTK. Assuming the HZDS gets into parliament but does not win an absolute majority of seats, "it's hard to say whether the party will manage to find a coalition partner," he said, adding Meciar could only become premier again if there is a "very radical change in his manner of thinking and governing." He personally reckons the HZDS will get perhaps twenty per cent of the September vote, the left wing a similar share and the centrist formations will have to compete for the remainder. Although Kovac's own party, the Alternative of Political Realism (APR), as yet scarcely figures in opinion poll results, he remains optimistic that there is room for a political center. "We want to give voters the chance... to vote for a balanced center with a liberal economic policy that pragmatically respects social needs," he said. To this end, the APR, composed of disaffected HZDS members, and the Alliance of Democrats (AD SR), led by former foreign minister in the Meciar cabinet Milan Knazko, are expected to merge later this month to form the Slovak Democratic Union (DUS).
