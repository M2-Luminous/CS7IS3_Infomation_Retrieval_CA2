Vil Sultanovich is now free. But justice has not been achieved. He agreed to meet with our correspondent precisely because he is well aware of the nature of the problem that presents itself: the correlation between human rights, the law and power... Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, officially your case has not yet been closed, even though our judicial system has, one must assume, expended quite a lot of effort on it. So, like it or not, part of this interview will have to be devoted to your impressions acquired in investigative offices, in court and in prison cells. Mirzayanov: Odd as it may seem, I turned out to be more prescient than my lawyer, Aleksandr Asnis. He believed that the court would in the end find the strength to be objective and unbiased. From Asnis' point of view, the court had every opportunity to deal with the case fairly quickly. Under those conditions we had a right to expect an acquittal. Unfortunately... People in the know warned me that once the investigation took a clear turn in favor of indictment nothing good could be expected to come of it. But I still had hopes that my case would reach the General Procuracy -- and there fall apart, because even a blind man could see that it was completely contrived. Nothing of the kind ever occurred. But then I came to realize that justice cannot be expected from the courts. That the KGB and the courts are the same in nature. That is my main impression or lesson from all this. I no longer have any illusions. About the fact that our institutions and official agencies have become accustomed to doing shoddy work and being paid big salaries for that shoddy work, just like in the courts and the procuracy... They are one and the same. And that despite the fact that what is at stake here are human beings' lives and futures. Pity our people! Nothing has changed in this country. We are all still in the hands of an inhuman regime. That is not just an impression or a lesson -- it is a conclusion. Correspondent: How did the investigation go? We at least have some impression of the trial... Mirzayanov: As I understood, it proceeded in the usual fashion. That is to say, it involved a tremendous number of violations. That is to say, just the way the investigator wanted it, and the way those who gave him his orders wanted it. My petitions were not granted even though they concerned fundamental issues like getting expert opinions from more competent and qualified experts. Oh, no -- why should they do anything to help out the one being investigated? You ask that an important witness be called, and they refuse. All terribly cynical. Quite frankly, there is no way that what went on can be called an investigation, i.e. a procedure with some connection to the law. Correspondent: Was your lawyer allowed to be present at the preliminary investigation? Mirzayanov: I had no lawyer at all until 11 November 1992. The people involved in the October events in Moscow got lawyers instantly, as if they were just waiting until they were needed. When I was in Lefortovo (my first jail time at the start of the trial) the KGB persistently attempted to "set me up" with one of their lawyers. I repeatedly refused. On 2 November I was released on the condition that I not travel. It was only on 11 November that Aleksandr Asnis, who was chosen by me, began to work with me, and the KGB only allowed him access to the case with tremendous reluctance and after persistent requests by the deputy general procurator. Correspondent: Did anything change after the investigation? Mirzayanov: And how! The most important thing: the lists of information containing state secrets. They were not even included in the case file! Correspondent: Excuse me for going back to an unpleasant subject, but our justice system plunged you (their term, incidentally) into prison life. Why do you think that was done? Mirzayanov: Out of habit, I believe. Many people, very many, are "plunged," as you put it, into that. Either as a show of force, or to demean them. Either answer fits. But I have various impressions of prison. Yes, the filth is incredible and there are rats in the corridors, drunken guards and beatings. People stay in jail for three or four years without coming to trial. Some cells hold 100 people, four times more than their normal capacity. I remember that I spent my first days in jail in a box that measured 16 square meters, and there were 50 of us in there. We were given nothing to eat or drink. The lowliest farm animals are better treated. You cannot actually eat the stuff they do serve in prison. And the prison talk... And the shock at what you are seeing and hearing, at the fact that you are standing right next to a murderer. Or at finding out that there are prisoners among you who were sent there for psychiatric evaluation. But then I got lucky. The women had me transferred from the holding cell to a "luxury" cell with just four cots in it. But even there we had to sleep in shifts. I was the seventh prisoner in the cell. Incidentally, sleeping in shifts is something that has to be learned. I didn't get it right away. But, generally speaking, people in prison are ordinary people. They do not divide themselves up into the guilty and the innocent. They are friendly. They are willing to help you out, though there are plenty who want to provoke you, too. People treated me normally, respectfully. People my age do not last long under those conditions. I was surrounded mainly by young men, under the age of 40. No one insulted me or made me get up and move when I sat down. And in my cell all the guys looked out for me, giving me tea and sugar... I remember the members of the State Committee for the State of Emergency. In Lefortovo I was right next to Lukyanov and Pavlov. They got fed, that's true! Their meals were brought in from a cafe. Even booze. Well, the other prisoners got supplied at the same time, anyway. As soon as they were released, the very same day, the usual prison food returned. They say the prison spent its whole five-year budget feeding the State Committee for the State of Emergency prisoners. I would like to say that getting to know prison is not something that ennobles a person, but it does bring you closer to the truth. Correspondent: Vil Sultanovich, tell us frankly: if it had not been for the noisy media campaign... Mirzayanov: Yes, yes, you are right. Everything that happened after I was thrown into Matrosskaya Tishina was the result of the pressure brought to bear on state structures by the press and television. I also want to thank the public officials who came to my defense. But the whole horror of this is that it took the extraordinary efforts, energy and emotion of many people, it took a tremendous amount of righteous but, of course, extra-legal pressure just to put a single trial on a civilized footing. That could have been accomplished quite simply using law and logic. Correspondent: Do you feel that the Paris International Convention on Chemical Disarmament signed in 1993 is defective? After all, it makes no reference to binary weapons... Mirzayanov: It is not just defective... I do not know how the Americans feel about it, but from a professional standpoint I find it completely oriented toward the past. It does not guarantee any sort of secure future. It not only does not ban binary weapons, it does not even ban any kind of research in that field. The Convention only requires that existing stocks of toxic agents be destroyed. Correspondent: Binary weapons are particularly tricky due to the fact that their components are non-toxic chemical substances that are manufactured on an industrial scale for other purposes. And, of course, the "binary" formula in such cases is a closely-guarded secret. God forbid that such relatively simple technology spread around the world, finding its way into the hands of various dictatorial regimes. In your opinion, is it not necessary for Russia and the United States -- the two powers that currently have such weapons -- to begin developing joint measures to limit their proliferation? It would probably be necessary to exchange information on binary weapons and for both countries to pass a number of laws on this issue... Mirzayanov: Definitely. Cooperation should occur in any form dictated by the current situation. If, of course, both sides really want to disarm chemically and not just get rid of some old junk. Unless there is that kind of cooperation, the USA and Russia simply will not be able to keep the peace. The ease with which binary weapons can be manufactured makes it possible for them to be obtained even by countries that are not technologically advanced, secretly and with impunity. That is a tremendous temptation. We must sound the alarm. It is for that reason that I attach great significance to this opportunity to speak via your newspaper, and I hope that the deputies of the State Duma will approach ratification of the Paris International Convention with great caution. Correspondent: What do you personally intend to be doing in the near future? After all, you lost your job in January 1992 after your first statements to the press. As in the past, the system in the "new" Russia punishes dissidents harshly. Mirzayanov: The issues I have raised are far from being resolved. An international ban on binary weapons, adoption of measures to prevent their proliferation and a ban on research in the field are all goals that will require a great deal of effort to attain. After getting some personal experience with the terrible conditions under which prisoners are held at the Matrosskaya Tishina Investigative Detention Center, I cannot remain indifferent. Right now my name is somewhat well known, and I want to take advantage of that fact to campaign for improvement of prison conditions. Correspondent: There is no doubt that your public activities will be beneficial. But how are you going to support yourself financially? Mirzayanov: I will try to find work, and I will be asking anyone I can for a job. I could work as a consultant, an analyst or an experimenter -- I have had my doctor of sciences degree for almost ten years. But I would not shun any job. If I have to become a street vendor to support my family, then... Correspondent: Did you receive any financial support during all your tribulations? I do not mean just moral support... Mirzayanov: Of course. I was helped out by relatives, and friends, and public organizations. Particularly tangible aid came in the form of a prize from the Cavallo Fund in the United States; that helped me hang on for almost a year.
