Meanwhile, the Army, television, and church continue to hold strong positions. Both the president and the police have lost the confidence of 8 percent of those people polled over the past month. The survey was conducted at the end of March, which was after our article on corruption in the Poznan police department appeared and after the president dismissed Marek Markiewicz from the post of chairman of the National Radio and Television Broadcasting Council. Those who were polled also have somewhat less confidence than a month ago in the two trade unions--the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement and Solidarity (a fall of 3 percent, but the change is within the statistical margin of error). The confidence ratings of the Sejm, the senate, the government, the Army, television, and the church have not changed. * * * The poll was conducted on 23-29 March, utilizing a random, representative sample of 1,197 adult Poles.
