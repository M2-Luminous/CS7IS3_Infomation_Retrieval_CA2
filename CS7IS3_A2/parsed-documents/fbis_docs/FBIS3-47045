On the issue of the consumption tax, around 60 percent of the pollees expressed conditional approval. The SDPJ organ SHAKAI SHIMPO conducted a survey of all Diet members belonging to the SDPJ-Goken Minshu Rengo [Democratic Alliance to Safeguard the Constitution, the SDPJ's floor grouping in the Diet] from late November to early December. Results of the poll were published in the 1 January issue of the paper. Valid answers were received from 112, or 74.3 percent, of all pollees. To the question "which parties should the SDPJ join hands with in the forthcoming regrouping of political parties?" (more than one answer possible), 30.4 percent favored the JNP, topping the list, followed by 29.5 percent opting for Sakigake, and 28.6 for the United Social Democratic Party. Both the Komeito and Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] received minimal support at 3.6 and 1.8 percent, respectively, indicating the strong antipathy toward these two parties. While none of the pollees cited the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP] or the Japan Communist Party as possible partners, as many as 21.4 percent of the SDPJ Dietmen polled preferred to cooperate with "certain LDP members." As to the decisive political value in the regrouping of the political parties (more than one answer possible), 42.9 percent said the crucial issue would be whether a party "gives priority to human rights, welfare, and the environment, or to development and economic growth," followed by 41.4 percent stressing whether it "favors dominant power for the consumers [seikatsusha, consumers in the broad sense] or for the state," and 39.3 percent attaching importance to whether it "defends the Constitution or attempts to amend it." With regard to the "steering of the coalition government," a considerable majority, 53.6 percent, favored "enhancing unity in the administration while gradually realizing the SDPJ's political ideas." On the other hand, those attaching more importance to the coalition, asserting "the party's basic policies should be further revised to support the coalition government more forcefully" made up only 18.8 percent, while 17.9 percent favored cooperation outside the framework of the cabinet, and 0.9 percent advocated secession from the coalition. According to the poll, 58 percent expressed the opinion that the consumption tax "should be tolerated somehow," far exceeding the 22.3 percent who opted for "abolition" of the tax -- which was a SDPJ electoral promise -- or the 11.6 percent who favored "changing this to a specific-purpose tax." SDPJ Deputy Secretary General Masanori Goto wrote in the SHAKAI SHIMPO that "Our stance is different from that of the Komeito and Shinseito. The image the SDPJ wants to create has become quite clear. I think the `social democratic label' will be the key word in the regrouping of political parties."
