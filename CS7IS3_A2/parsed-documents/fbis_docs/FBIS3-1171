The parties are the National Party, Democratic Party, African National Congress, Pan-Africanist Congress, Freedom Front, Minority Front, Dikwankwetla [strong], Worker's List Party and Soccer Party. The IEC said in a statement the payments made varied from just over R48,000 [rand] to about R1.2 million after the parties had submitted either an acceptable opinion poll indicating their support or a list of signatures from supporters. It added the money was for the exclusive purpose of conducting election campaigns, and the parties had complied with section 74 of the Electoral Act. "An amount of R11 million, half of the R22 million available in the fund, will be distributed among participating parties before the election and the balance afterwards," the IEC said. Parties that have not yet applied had been given until 4.30 PM on Friday, March 25, to submit lists of signatures as required by the Electoral Act. "If they supply adequate and proper lists, money from the electoral fund will be paid to them," the statement said.
