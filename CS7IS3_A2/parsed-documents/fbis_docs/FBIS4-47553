The issues of obtaining hybridomata and monoclonal antibodies to the antigens of various types of mycoplasma and their uses for the microorganism diagnostics, isolation, and identification are addressed. In so doing, different approaches to fusing the cells and producing the MCA-producing hybrids are studied: using the sendai virus of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for fusing the myeloma and lymphocyte cells, fusion in a uniform electric field, and electroacoustic methods. As a result of the study, MCA-producing hybridomata for M. arginini are produced, and two MCA-producing clones are obtained. The findings confirm that production and utilization of MCAs to mycoplasma makes it possible to carry out species-specific identification and diagnostics of these microorganisms.
