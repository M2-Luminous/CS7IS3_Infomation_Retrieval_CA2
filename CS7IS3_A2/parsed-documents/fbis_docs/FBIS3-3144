In 1989 and 1993, 30 or so deputies from the Fujian deputation submitted a joint motion first to the Second Session of the Seventh NPC and then to the First Session of the Eighth NPC, and had it included in the agenda of both NPC Standing Committees. Zhang Binsheng said: The Xiamen SEZ was established in 1980. Viewed from the angle of the legal system, a SEZ only exists as a result of a stipulation by policy and takes the form of a special zone in the economic sense with an unclear legal status but no legal distinction from other localities. Practice has shown that the authority and credibility of some special economic policies implemented in a SEZ would be in doubt if these policies are not affirmed by any forms of corresponding legislation. After the NPC adopted a resolution in 1981 to empower Fujian Province to formulate separate economic laws and regulations for its SEZ, the provincial people's congress has done a lot of work in enacting a number of economic laws and regulations for getting economic development off the ground in its SEZ. Because of too much red tape and the legislative progress' lagging behind the needs of practical development, however, the provincial authorities had found some specific problems lying beyond their reach in terms of powers and pace. In view of this reality, the Xiamen SEZ's application for local legislative power was placed on their agenda. On the significance of Xiamen's application for local legislative power, Zhang Binsheng said: The most important point is Xiamen's desire to become a pilot zone for making legislations related to Taiwan. NPC Chairman Qiao Shi had repeatedly stressed the need to move ahead with local legislation first and to set up experimental zones for legislation. If Shenzhen is called an experimental zone for legislation related to Hong Kong and Macao, then Xiamen would be the most ideal place for setting up a zone for experimenting with legislation involving Taiwan. Zhang Binsheng went a step further and said: Once the issue of "three exchanges" between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait is settled, Xiamen will be the top choice for a direct shipping port. It has a unique advantage in cross-strait relations that should be given a greater role. Being the mainland area with the highest concentration of Taiwan investment as well as the mainland port most frequently visited by Taiwan compatriots at present, Xiamen has seen the endless emergence of Taiwan-related legal affairs, including those of an economic nature such as trade, economic exchanges, and investment; a floodgate of civil legal relationships such as Taiwan- related marriages and estate inheritances; as well as criminal cases such as sea smuggling and airplane hijacking which have begun to crop up in recent years. As these Taiwan-related legal affairs are rather concentrated in Xiamen, the granting of local legislative power to Xiamen is thus an issue concerning not only Xiamen itself but whether Xiamen will have a chance to play a greater role and make greater contribution to the great cause of reunifying the motherland. He said: This year is important to promoting and achieving a breakthrough in the reform of the economic structure in an all-round way. The extent, range, and difficulty of new reform measures are all unprecedented. Xiamen as a SEZ should take the lead in establishing a socialist market economic structure and following international practice and play a demonstrative role for the whole country. This is another important reason to give legislative power to the Xiamen SEZ. Zhang Binsheng said: The people in Fujian and Xiamen have been expecting to obtain local legislative power for Xiamen and have understood their great responsibility. If the on-going NPC session will adopt the decision, people in Xiamen will certainly cherish and properly use this power. In recent years, Xiamen has been making long-term and annual plans for legislative work, has made a lot of social investigations, and has gained experience. The Xiamen City People's Congress Law Committee and the city government's legislative bureau have always considered it their main task. Xiamen has adequate legislative organizations and legal personnel. The legislative forces of Xiamen and Fujian can certainly handle the heavy task of local legislation properly with the assistance of experts from the central authorities and Beijing and by absorbing the advanced experiences of the Shenzhen SEZ. Besides, the Fujian CPC Committee and government have always supported Xiamen in obtaining local legislative power. He said: Xiamen has accumulated some experience in legislation. Eight laws and regulations drafted by Xiamen have been adopted by the Fujian Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee. In addition, Xiamen has formulated more than 200 standardized administrative documents [xing zheng gui fan xing wen jian 5887 2398 6016 5400 1840 2429 0115].
