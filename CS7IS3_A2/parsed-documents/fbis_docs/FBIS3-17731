The statement was adopted on Friday by Russia's lower house. Yaragi Mamodayev, chairman of the government of national confidence dissolved by Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev, told ITAR-TASS that the resolution "was wise if somewhat over-politicized." Mamodayev praised the desire of the Russian lawmakers to resolve the problem strictly by peaceful means without turning to force. "That is what our government has been fighting for, and as we see now, not in vain," he said. On the other hand, Mamodayev criticised the resolution for its appeal to the opposition forces in Chechnya. "We always insisted that our compatriots should not be divided into pro- and anti-president forces. On the contrary, we always called for consolidation around the idea of building the Chechen state," he said. In its resolution, the State Duma suggested that President Yeltsin take measures to achieve a political settlement in relations between federal state bodies and the authorities of the Chechen Republic. The resolution empowered the Russian Government to hold consultations with representatives of Chechen state bodies and political movements in order to overcome the current social and political problems, and to draft a powers-sharing treaty between Moscow and Groznyy. The Duma called for the signing of such a treaty under the conditions that the Chechnya Republic hold free elections and recognise itself as a subject of the Russian Federation. According to Mamodayev, it is unlikely that the present Chechen leadership will agree with the resolution. "For Dudayev himself to recognise that Chechnya is a part of Russia would be `political harakiri'," he said. Official Groznyy is surprisingly calm. Neither Dudayev nor any of his supporters commented on the resolution during the weekend. Whatever their response might be, ITAR-TASS has learnt from a reliable source that a rather highly-ranked Chechen delegation is getting ready to leave for Moscow, apparently to continue the negotiations with Russia which started last week.
