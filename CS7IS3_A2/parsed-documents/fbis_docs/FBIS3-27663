Mustafizur Rahman hosted a banquet on Thursday [24 February] evening in honor of the visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen . Qian Qichen arrived here on Thursday at 14:00 for a four-day official goodwill visit to this South Asian country. Bangladesh is the second leg of his five-country tour including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Iran. At the welcoming banquet, the Bangladesh foreign minister said, "China is a valuable friend of Bangladesh. We cherish this friendship." The Bangladesh foreign minister praised China in its modernizing drive and economic reforms. He believed China will play an increasingly important role in global trade and economic relations. The Bangladesh foreign minister also briefed Chinese guests on the ongoing market-oriented economic reforms and poverty-alleviation efforts in his country. In his speech, the Chinese vice-premier said, "Under the personal care of the leaders of our two countries, the two sides are carrying out fruitful cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific and technological, cultural and other fields and have supported each other and cooperated closely in international affairs." Qian said that developing countries should strengthen coordination and cooperation to preserve peace and stability, promote common economic growth so as to establish a new international political and economic order. Qian also praised Bangladesh for its unremitting efforts in promoting good-neighborly and friendly relations among the SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] countries and in enhancing regional cooperation. Qian described the recent allegations about the so-called "China threat" and even China's expansion into the Indian Ocean as absurd and utterly groundless. "We have made it clear on many occasions that China unswervingly pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and will never seek hegemony," he said. He stressed, "China is and will remain a force for preserving world peace and stability."
