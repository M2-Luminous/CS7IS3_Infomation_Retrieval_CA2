The politician also mentioned the irregularities that emerged in last Sunday's elections. [Begin recording] [Calderon Sol] It has been proven that the Salvadoran people do not want the radical left. It has been a vote to reject them. I do believe they have won a political opening for democratic opposition and an opportunity to demonstrate their adherence to the system. We hope they can finally join the country's political life. [Unidentified reporter] Is there going to be a vote recount? Are you going to call for a vote recount to see if you can [words indistinct]? [Calderon Sol] We are not interested in discussing the first round. If a runoff election is needed, we will support it because we want a clear, impressive, and marvelous mandate. We know we are going to have 70 percent support or more, perhaps 75 percent. It is going to be a clear, definitive, five-year mandate. [Reporter] What were the most serious problems surrounding the elections? [Calderon Sol] I believe it was the situation at the voting centers, the lack of information for voters, and the logistics problems that existed that day. The real problem was the lack of information for voters. [Reporter] [Question indistinct] [Calderon Sol] On the contrary, we have a month to tell the truth to the Salvadoran people. I believe the Supreme Electoral Tribunal will be forced to do an evaluation and correct the mistakes that were made. That way we can have a massive turnout in the next elections, and I am sure that all the Salvadoran people will accompany us. [end recording] That was a portion of the statements made by Dr. Armando Calderon Sol, presidential candidate for the ruling ARENA. Meanwhile, at the vote counting center, there is speculation about the number of deputies' seats that could have been won by the various political parties after certain percentages were made known. According to unofficial figures made available so far, ARENA would have obtained 40 deputies; the FMLN, 20 deputies; the Christian Democratic Party, 16 deputies; Democratic Convergence, three deputies; the National Conciliation Party, three deputies; and the Unity Movement, one deputy. These are unofficial figures that could change once the total number of votes obtained from each of the departments is made available.
