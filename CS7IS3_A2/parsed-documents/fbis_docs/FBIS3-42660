On the Results of the Moscow Meeting of the American and Russian Presidents"] [Text] High-level meetings rarely take place without results. The immense diplomatic mechanism works on preparing for them and it must prepare at least something for the leaders of the countries to sign. Thus the latest Russian-American summit meeting ended with the signing of 12 agreements, which the propaganda organs of the two countries announced with a great deal of ceremony. To say that the meeting was meaningless would be a great exaggeration. Among its results was the signing of the Russian-Ukrainian-American agreement on the elimination of nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory. For quite understandable reasons, this agreement is of extremely special significance, although the fact that it was signed by three and not two participants (just Russia and Ukraine) is an immense minus for Russian diplomacy. The agreement could quite easily have been reached without the United States, the more so since, as it turns out, Russia will still have to pay for it--by delivering energy sources to Ukraine free of charge. And the United States, as usual, added to its assets an unconditional success while getting off with vague promises. As for other results of the meeting between Yeltsin and Clinton, one can hardly classify them as paramount. The United States made the greatest concessions to Russia in questions of trade and the confirmation of human rights as a permanent value. As we know, the Russian economy is certainly not now in a condition where the warehouses are crammed with finished products and the store shelves are groaning under the excess of domestic goods. If that were the case, one could understand and appreciate the official optimism: Really, Russian goods are finally breaking through, like the Japanese, to the American market. But that, alas, will not happen. And the fact that the economic agreement that was reached will help with the sale of Russian uranium and aluminum in the United States by no means evokes rapture. We know from experience that a breakthrough of particular raw material goods or semimanufactured products from Russia into the world market leads to making a group of wheeler-dealers with questionable reputations and a certain circle of high-level bureaucrats rich. Such "achievements" do nothing for the development of the economy. Official commentators link the joint Russian-American human rights declaration to potential possibilities of protecting the human rights of the Russian and Russian-speaking population in the former Soviet republics, especially the Baltics. Perhaps this is indeed the case. But it is fair to ask: Can it be that the governments and parliaments of the countries where Russians are subjected to persecution and discrimination have never heard of human rights before? Did they not sign the documents of the Council on Security and Cooperation in Europe regarding this? The American President flew into Moscow with the news that NATO, after studying the new alignment of forces in Europe, was radically changing its strategy. At one point, at the dawn of perestroyka and the "new thinking," there were statements in the spirit of the need to disband military blocs and create some kind of single system of collective security in Europe and throughout all of the Northern Hemisphere--"from Vladivostok to Vancouver." Then after the Warsaw Pact was disbanded these good intentions were replaced by discussions of the "NATO's new role" outside Europe: in the Persian Gulf, the Mediterranean Sea, Africa. And now this new role has finally become clearcut: "Drang nach Osten," to the East. In order not to frighten the tender liberals and not to confuse those in Russia who have long been asking to be taken under NATO's wing, the new doctrine speaks incomprehensibly about a "partnership for peace." It is in keeping with the spirit of the times and it does not threaten anyone. But if you remove the pretty verbal packaging, the bare military essence remains: The NATO bloc is moving toward Russia's borders. Elementary common sense tells us that if the "partnership for peace" really did not have anti-Russian content we might have expected a different scenario: First the NATO bloc would have looked for ways of establishing a partnership with Russia, for with all of its weakness it is still the largest military power, and only after that would the vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe have been filled. When he arrived in Russia the American President probably had his doubts about the kind of reception he and his idea of a "partnership" would receive. How obviously glad he was to see that this idea did not elicit a great deal of resistance from the Russian leadership. Let us recall something else: NATO's position in the former Yugoslavia and particularly its soft attitude toward Croatia, its readiness to open up military warehouses to the Muslims in Bosnia, and the threats of strikes on Serbian positions. The Russian president had enough common sense to remind Clinton that Yugoslavia is being handled by the UN and nobody invited NATO with its role of "peacemaker." The more so with threats in the spirit of the Cold War. Regarding this question one must think that Russia is finally capable of taking a firm stand. It is difficult to sum up the overall balance sheet of the meeting that was held. Here one inevitably has to take into account that the U.S. position has become one of the cards in the Russian domestic political game of solitaire, and when agreeing to this meeting with Clinton the president of Russia somehow wanted to take advantage of his arrival to demonstrate the strength of his foreign connections and powerful support from the West. This he managed to do: Clinton did not favor other political figures of Russia with his attention, nor did he even speak before parliament. At the same time, the impossibility of having the positions of Russia and the United States coincide completely, which was revealed during the course of this meeting, will lead to other reflections. The period of Russia's "getting used to" its neighbors on the continent and the planet is ending. There are difficult times ahead when protection of national interests will require changes both in the overall style of the "diplomacy of smiles" and the content of the Russian foreign policy. It is good that this coincides with the beginning of the work of the new parliament, which should make a significant contribution to the creation of such a policy.
