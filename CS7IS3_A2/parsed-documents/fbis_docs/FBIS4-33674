Brazil believes that one way to prevent the presidential summit organized by U.S. President Bill Clinton from ending in another declaration of principles would be to propose concrete projects for action and promotion of hemispheric integration, Amorim said. One of the projects, Amorim said, could be the creation of a specific fund within the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) to help finance economic integration processes in the continent. "Integration processes are essential for our country, and it is important to have the resources with which to carry them out," Amorim said during a news conference he gave on the occasion of the 24th OAS General Assembly, which has been taking place since 6 June in Belem do Para, northern Brazil. According to Amorim, who mentioned this proposal to Strobe Talbott, U.S. under secretary of state, during a meeting they held on 6 June, the IDB was created precisely as an instrument of support for Latin American integration. The resources from this fund could help the integration processes that have been developing in the past few years, such as the Common Market of the South (Mercosur), the Andean Pact, the Group of Three, and the Amazon Integration Treaty, among others. Another proposal that will be made by Brazil for the Summit of the Americas, which will be held from 9 to 10 December in Miami, Florida, is to create mechanisms for financial and technical cooperation in the field of human rights defense. Human rights conditions could improve with financial and technical cooperation agreements to improve the living conditions of prison inmates and strengthen the judicial system, Celso Amorim said.
