This is fully illustrated by the attitude of the puppets toward the U.S. Forces in South Korea, the article says, and goes on: Now countries and nations all over the world are lifting up loud voices demanding the dismantling of the U.S. military bases in their territories. But only the South Korean puppets are running the gamut of folly, entreating for the permanent occupation of South Korea by the U.S. Forces and "protection by the nuclear umbrella". When the anti-American sentiments ran high in South Korea, the United States said it would withdraw its forces from South Korea in order to lull them. If the South Korean puppets had an iota of national conscience, they should have welcomed its intention to take back its aggression forces to their den across the ocean. They, however, entreated the United States not to withdraw its forces from South Korea and even staged the drama of "a cabinet resignation en bloc." They pay a colossal amount of fund for the maintenance of the U.S. forces. The United States pays the rent to the countries where its aggression troops are stationed for the use of bases. However, it does not pay a penny for many military bases in South Korea but uses them free of charge and receives billions of dollars from the puppets every year in burden sharing. To justify this mean act the South Korean puppets talk volubly about "protection by the nuclear umbrella". But it is an outburst which can be let out only by those obsessed with flunkeyist treacheries. The Kim Yong-sam traitor clique is meaner than any other preceding rulers in serving the U.S. master. Promising a larger burden share than the preceding "regimes", the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique entreated the U.S. to permanently leave its forces in South Korea and made it shelve the "U.S. troop cutback plan". They are trying to keep the aggression forces in South Korea at any cost and slay the fellow countrymen in the North with their help. But this is a foolish act of tightening the noose around their own neck. How can they be safe, the traitors who pay to the master the expenses for the maintenance of the aggression forces by empting the pockets of the people, imploring them to slay fellow countrymen, while leaving the land and the people under their jackboots query. The colonial puppet regime dependent on the United States, which has no sovereignty, will meet its doom, rejected by the people.
