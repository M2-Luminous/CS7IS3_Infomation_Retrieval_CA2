They agreed that the organizational work should be speeded up in view of the official opening. In this respect, the Spanish Government will provide the offices until a new building be built. While awaiting the meeting of the management committee and of the budget committee -- the two management bodies of the office, which will open in the second half of March -- the initial staffing for this year will be limited to 20 individuals. This figure could rise to 50 next year and reach 220 to 260 when the office is fully operational. Given the numerous preparatory tasks for setting up of the office, it is estimated that the first application for a Community trademark can only be made at the office 18 to 24 months after the regulations have come into force. The Council adopted the regulations at its 20 December 1993 meeting, 13 years after the first proposal on Community trademarks was made. An important step has been made on the way to the full materialization of the internal market. For the first time, a new title of industrial property on a European scale has been created. This title, which will be good for 10 years and will be renewable, will be delivered by the office established by the regulations, the headquarters of which will be in Alicante, Spain.
