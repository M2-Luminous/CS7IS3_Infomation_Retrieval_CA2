FR940610-2-00010 FR940610-2-00007 b. A list of references is contained in section 1.3 and Annex F of Part 1 of the specifications. 7. Objectives. The objectives of the SDTS are to: _provide a common mechanism for transferring digital spatial information between dissimilar computer systems, while preserving information meaning, and minimizing the need for information external to this standard; _provide, for the purpose of transfer, a set of clearly specified spatial objects and relationships to represent real world spatial entities, and to specify the ancillary information necessary to accomplish the transfer; _provide a transfer model that will facilitate the conversion of user-defined to standardized set of objects, relationships, and information. 8. Applicability. a. This standard is intended for use in the acquisition and development of government applications and programs involving the transfer of digital spatial data between dissimilar computer systems. b. The use of the FIPS SDTS applies when the transfer of digital spatial data occurs or is likely to occur within and/or outside of the Federal government. c. The use of the FIPS SDTS does not apply to the transfer of digital spatial data files which are not intended to represent spatial entities as digital geographic or cartographic features. d. FIPS SDTS is not intended to facilitate product distribution of spatial data in a form designed for direct access by application software specific to a particular data structure, class of computer platform, or distribution media. e. Nonstandard features should be used only when the needed operation or function cannot be reasonably implemented with standard features alone. Although nonstandard features can be very useful, it should be recognized that the use of these or any other nonstandard elements may make the interchange of digital spatial data and future conversions more difficult and costly. f. Use of this standard or a FIPS approved SDTS application profile, such as the SDTS TVP, is required for Federal Government implementations of this standard. FIPS SDTS implementations not requiring full functionality are designated as application profiles. Application profiles, requiring all three parts of the FIPS SDTS, are limited subsets designed for use with a specific type of data and/or application. The SDTS Topological Vector Profile (TVP) is an application profile. 9. Specifications. The FIPS SDTS, in four parts, provides specifications for the organization and structure of digital spatial data transfer, definition of spatial features and attributes, data transfer encoding, and Topological Vector Profile. Specifications of this FIPS have the following characteristics: a. ability to transfer vector, raster, grid and attribute data and other ancillary information; b. common set of terminology and definitions for spatial features; c. internal description of the data types, formats, and data structures such that the information items can be readily identified and processed in the recipient system; and d. media independence and extendibility to encompass new spatial information as needed. 10. Implementation. The implementation of this standard involves three areas of consideration: acquisition of FIPS SDTS implementations, validation, and interpretations of the standard. 10.1␣Acquisition of FIPS SDTS Implementations. This revised standard becomes effective December 30, 1994. 10.2␣Validation. Conformance to FIPS SDTS is applicable whether implementations are developed internally, acquired as part of an automated data processing (ADP) procurement, acquired by separate procurement, used under an ADP leasing arrangement, or specified for use in contracts for programming services. Conformance criteria, based on application profiles, will be developed for use in validating the conformance of FIPS SDTS implementations. Validation of implementations for conformance to FIPS SDTS conformance criteria, policy, and procedures are under the authority of the FIPS program. 10.3␣Interpretation of FIPS SDTS. Resolution of questions regarding this standard will be provided by NIST. Questions concerning the content and specification should be addressed to: Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: FIPS SDTS Interpretation, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, Telephone: (301) 975&hyph;3271.
