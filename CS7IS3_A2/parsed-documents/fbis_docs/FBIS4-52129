FBIS4-52129 "dreas089__a94011" FBIS-EAS-94-089-A Daily Report 4 May 1994 ANNEX Japan Guideline Targets Areas for Deregulation Guideline Targets Areas for Deregulation OW0805125194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 May 94 Morning Edition p 1--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY OW0805125194 Tokyo NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN Japanese BFN [Text] The government has disclosed a guideline for deregulation measures to be mapped out before the end of June. The guideline focuses on such fields as importing procedures, authorization system, and distribution rules. As tangible measures, the guideline calls for review of 51 regulations in 16 categories, including a step-by-step abolition of the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, a removal of ban on holding companies, and expansion of farmers' direct rice supply to consumers. The government intends to hammer out drastic deregulation plans to relax Japan-U.S. trade frictions through liberalization of the domestic markets and correction of disparity in Japanese and international prices. However, some ministries are likely to oppose implementation of the comprehensive deregulation guidelines. The deregulation guideline is prepared as the foundation for intragovernment negotiations to finalize deregulation measures. The guideline is roughly divided into two sections on distribution and import regulations. Subjects for policy review add up to 27 regulations in 10 categories of distribution rules, and 24 regulations in six categories of importing rules. On 12 and 18 May, the guideline will be introduced to government agencies by the Administrative Reform Promotion Council's Subcommittee for Promoting Imports, Improving Market Access, and Reforming the Nation's Distribution System. Regarding the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law, which is provided for protecting smaller retail stores from new large-scale stores, the government has relaxed opening-hour restrictions for large-scale stores effective 1 May. However, business circles are calling for abolition rather than relaxation of the law. Under such circumstances, the government decided to study possibilities of future abolition of the law on a step-by-step basis. Since changes in business-hours restriction must be coordinated with local watchdog bodies, the government intends to remove the rule from the books. Local legislation authority for controlling the size of new retail stores will be limited by the revised law in this connection. With respect to restriction on establishment of holding companies, the government intends to abolish Article 9 of the Antimonopoly Law so that venture companies and financial institutions can open new businesses more smoothly. If the ban on holding companies is lifted, companies would become able to smoothly found or merge subsidiaries depending on their business strategies. While the Fair Trade Commission [FTC] is wary of the system because it may give excessive market controlling power to major companies, Western multibusiness companies are demanding the holding company system in Japan. The government is also planning an early abolition of resale price support contracts for pharmaceutical and beauty products. In 1992, the FTC reduced items for resale price support contracts from 51 to 26. At that time, the price support system was left for such products as lipsticks, lotion, and cold medicine until the next policy review in 1998, but the government intends to frontload the policy review. In addition, the government plans to deregulate self-service in gas stations and farmers' direct rice sales to consumers. Before the end of June, the government is supposed to work out a package of deregulation measures to "promote imports, improve market access, and reform the nation's distribution system," as well as those to deregulate the "housing and real estate" and "telecommunications" sectors. Deregulation is being promoted in view of not only U.S. demands for market liberalization, but also the Japanese business sector's wish for removal of all business restrictions.
