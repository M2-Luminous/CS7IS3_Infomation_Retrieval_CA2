The amendments, consisting of eight articles, are seen as the Palestinian new and final draft agreement. AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT has obtained the full details of the eight Palestinian proposals. They are: 1. The al-Nabi Musa area near Jericho should be under Palestinian control. 2. Entry to the Gaza-Jericho region should come under the jurisdiction of the Palestinian authority along with the maintenance of security, with acceptance of electronic inspection. 3. The al-Maghtis area should be annexed to Jericho in the transitional period and the Palestinian flag should be hoisted there. 4. The Musa al-'Alami project should have Palestinian identity and should come under Palestinian sovereignty. 5. The Jericho area should be linked to al-Qurunful mountain. 6. There should be agreement and coordination regarding the King 'Abdallah bridge. 7. There are no problems regarding the crossing bridges with Egypt and there is coordination on that, but where joint projects in the Dead Sea area are concerned, the Palestinians should have the right of approval, and the same thing would later apply with Jordan. 8. The international crossings (borders) should come under international supervision. [passage omitted]
