This emerges from a letter in DDP/ADN's possession from the NPD party executive to party members dated 10 January. According to the letter, the congress is to begin at 1000 in the Volkshalle in Ehringshausen. The Lahn-Dill branch of the DGB [German Trade Union Federation] has already announced a counterdemonstration and rally, permits for which have already been applied for and approved, according to a spokesman. The counterdemonstrators intend to gather at 0900 at Ehringshausen station. The police in Giessen also expect the party congress to go ahead in Ehringhausen, but do not rule out that the meeting may be held elsewhere. The NPD had named various places in Thuringia and Hesse during the run-up to the congress, apparently in order to confuse the counterdemonstrators. Giessen police said they would be responding flexibly. [passage omitted]
