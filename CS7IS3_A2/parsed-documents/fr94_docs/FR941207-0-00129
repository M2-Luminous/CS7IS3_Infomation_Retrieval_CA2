The record indicates that in many cases, designated entities and entrepreneurial principals will have limited capital to contribute to the applicant's equity and that nonontrolling investors will be unwilling to advance funds to enable the designated entity (even one with management expertise) to reach the 25 percent threshold. Thus, without some modifications to our rules, designated entities could face insurmountable difficulties in arranging financing. We therefore conclude that we should modify our rules to address petitioners' concerns, while balancing the need to ensure meaningful equity participation by ``qualifying'' control group members. 64. Specifically, we will retain the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for the control group, but we will require only 15 percent ( i.e., 60 percent of the control group's 25 percent equity contribution) to be held by qualifying, controlling principals in the control group ( i.e., minorities, women or small/entrepreneurial business principals). For example, if the applicant seeks minority or women-owned status, the 15 percent equity (as well as 50.1 percent of the voting stock of the applicant) must be owned by control group members who are minorities and/or women. If the applicant seeks small business status, 15 percent of the equity must be held by control group members who, in the aggregate, qualify as a small business. 35 The composition of the principals of the control group determines whether the applicant qualifies for bidding credits, installment payments and reduced upfront payments. The 15 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 10 percent ( i.e., 40 percent of the control group's minimum equity contribution) may be held in the form of either stock options or shares, and we will allow certain investors that are not minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs to hold interests in such shares or options. Specifically, we will allow the 10 percent portion to be held in the form of shares or stock options by: (1) Investors in the control group that are women, minorities, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2) individuals who are members of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities or women or individuals who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks or small business size thresholds); (3) existing investors of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior to December 31, 1994; or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors. 35 For instance, if a preexisting company wants to qualify as a small business control group, its gross revenues and total assets will be added to the gross revenues and assets of each of its controlling shareholders and to those of all affiliates. The resulting sum must be under $40 million in gross revenues and $500 million in total assets. The gross revenues and total assets of the company's preexisting, noncontrolling shareholders will be ignored, however. 65. The Commission also adopted an alternative to the 25 percent minimum equity requirement for minority and women-owned businesses, which permits a single investor to hold as much as 49.9 percent of its equity, provided the control group holds at least 50.1 percent. Several petitioners have expressed similar concerns with respect to the need to revise the 50.1 percent requirements. Therefore, in tandem with, and for the same reasons as, the modifications to the 25 percent equity requirement, we make similar modifications to the rules governing the 50.1 percent minimum equity requirement. Accordingly, where a minority or women-owned business uses the 50.1 percent minimum equity option, we will require only 30 percent of the total equity to be held by the principals of the control group that are minorities or women. The 30 percent may be held in the form of options, provided these options are exercisable at any time, solely at the holder's discretion, and at an exercise price equal to or less than the current market valuation of the underlying shares at the time of short-form filing. The remaining 20.1 percent may be made up of shares and/or options held by investors that are not women or minorities under the same criteria described in paragraph 64 above. That is, the 20.1 percent portion of the control group's equity may be held in the form of shares or stock options by any of the following: (1) Investors in the control group that are minorities, women, small businesses or entrepreneurs; (2) individuals who are members of an applicant's management team (which could include individuals who are not minorities or women, or individuals who have affiliates that exceed the entrepreneurs' blocks and small business size standards); (3) existing investors of businesses in the control group that were operating and earning revenues for two years prior to December 31, 1994; or (4) noncontrolling institutional investors. 36 36 For our purposes, we define institutional investors in a manner that is similar to the definition that is used by the Commission in the attribution rules applied to assess compliance with the broadcast multiple ownership; rules. We modify that definition slightly, however, to fit this service. Specifically, we expect that investment companies will be important sources of capital formation for designated entities. Accordingly, we adopt a definition that specifically includes venture capital firms and other smaller investment companies that may not be included in the definition of investment companies found in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3 (which is cited in our broadcast rules at 47 CFR 73.3555 Note 2(c)). Specifically, we define an institutional investor as an insurance company, a bank holding stock in trust accounts through its trust department, or an investment company as defined in 15 U.S.C. 80a-3(a) without reference to, or incorporation of, the exemptions set forth in 15 U.S.C. 80a&hyph;3(b) and (c); provided that, if such investment company is owned, in whole or in part, by other entities, then such investment company, such other entities and the affiliates of such other entities, taken as a whole, must be primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or in distributing or providing investment management services for securities. See ยง24.720(h). 66. In addition, the control group minimum equity requirement will be reduced three years from the date of license grant as suggested by Lehman Brothers, but the control group must still retain voting control ( i.e., 50.1 percent of the vote). According the control group the option to reduce the equity requirement accommodates the needs of designated entity licensees to raise capita as they build out their systems. Significantly, the three-year mark corresponds with the end of the no transfer period under our license holding rule. In the case of a licensee that has chosen the 25 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control group will only be required to hold 10 percent of the licensee's equity after three years, with no further equity requirements imposed on the control group. Similarly, in the case of a licensee that has used the 50.1 percent minimum equity option, the principals in the control group will be required to hold 20 percent of the licensee's equity, and no further equity requirements will be imposed on the control group. 67. After reviewing the record, we are persuaded that these changes will afford the control group greater flexibility in raising the necessary equity for participation in the entrepreneurs' blocks. In particular, we are allowing that 10 (or 20.1) percent of the equity can come from sources that otherwise would not qualify for the control group. In making these limited changes to the control group equity requirements, we believe the amended rules will: (1) promote investment in designated entities generally; (2) attract and promote skilled management for applicants; and (3) encourage involvement by existing firms that have valuable management skills and resources to contribute to the success of applicants. 68. With respect to our decision to allow investment in the control group by investors of preexisting firms, the business involved must be a going concern that has been in existence for a reasonable period of time prior to adoption of our rules in order to avoid any sham arrangements. Specifically, the business involved must have been operating and earning revenues for at least two years prior to December 31, 1994 to qualify for this provision. While we want to relax the control group equity requirements slightly, we also recognize there may be an incentive for nonqualifying investors to purchase substantial interests in ``preexisting'' businesses unless we place some restrictions on those investors. As a practical matter, however, we realize that the identity of noncontrolling investors in such businesses, particularly if they are publicly-traded companies, will change regularly. We intend that the allowed equity (10 or 20.1 percent) portion should be held by existing investors in such a company although we will not place limits on who qualifies as such an investor. We emphasize, however, that we will scrutinize any significant equity restructing of preexisting companies that occurs after adoption of our rules. We would presume that any change of equity by an investor in a preexisting company (that is in an applicant's control group) that is five percent or less would not be significant, and the burden is on the applicant to demonstrate whether changes in equity that exceed five percent are not significant.
