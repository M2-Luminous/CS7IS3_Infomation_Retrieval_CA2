In a report on the FC's role and place in overcoming critical situations on Tuesday, Shumeyko also pointed to a lack of organization by the parliamentary committees, leadership and its staff. He said the constitutionally-enshrined power of the Council for law making was its "most powerful weapon". To invigorate Council activity, Shumeyko proposed amending articles 104 and 105 of the federal constitution to enable the Council to bring bills in the Federal Assembly both the through the lower house and independently. This, he said, can help relieve the State Duma of the burden of law making and distribute bills evenly between the two houses to help on the legislative process. Shumeyko pointed to what made the Council and Duma different from each other. Unlike the Duma which is the arena of power struggle and compromise between different political and party interests, he said, the upper house represents the interests of Russian autonomies and regions. In his view, Russia is undergoing a cultural rather than economic or political crisis. Shumeyko said that as the supreme legislative body, the Federation Council was designed to exploit the idea of statehood and patriotism to strengthen rather than overhaul the existing establishment.
