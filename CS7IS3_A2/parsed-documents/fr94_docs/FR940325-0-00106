FR940325-0-00106 FR940325-0-00016 (ii) The authorized official shall identify services previously provided by the resources in their baseline condition in accordance with §11.72 of this part and compare those services with services now provided by the injured resources, that is, the with-a-discharge-or-release condition. All estimates of the with-a-discharge-or-release condition shall incorporate consideration of the ability of the resources to recover as determined in §11.73 of this part. (c) Range of possible alternatives. (1) The possible alternatives considered by the authorized official that return the injured resources and their lost services to baseline level could range from: Intensive action on the part of the authorized official to return the various resources and services provided by those resources to baseline conditions as quickly as possible; to natural recovery with minimal management actions. Possible alternatives within this range could reflect varying rates of recovery, combination of management actions, and needs for resource replacements or acquisitions. (2) An alternative considering natural recovery with minimal management actions, based upon the ``No Action-Natural Recovery'' determination made in §11.73(a)(1) of this part, shall be one of the possible alternatives considered. (d) Factors to consider when selecting the alternative to pursue. When selecting the alternative to pursue, the authorized official shall evaluate each of the possible alternatives based on all relevant considerations, including the following factors: (1) Technical feasibility, as that term is used in this part. (2) The relationship of the expected costs of the proposed actions to the expected benefits from the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources. (3) Cost-effectiveness, as that term is used in this part. (4) The results of any actual or planned response actions. (5) Potential for additional injury resulting from the proposed actions, including long-term and indirect impacts, to the injured resources or other resources. (6) The natural recovery period determined in §11.73(a)(1) of this part. (7) Ability of the resources to recover with or without alternative actions. (8) Potential effects of the action on human health and safety. (9) Consistency with relevant Federal, State, and tribal policies. (10) Compliance with applicable Federal, State, and tribal laws. (e) A Federal authorized official shall not select an alternative that requires acquisition of land for Federal management unless the Federal authorized official determines that restoration, rehabilitation, and/or other replacement of the injured resources is not possible. 16.

(a) General. (1) This section contains guidance and methodologies for determining: The costs of the selected alternative for restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of equivalent resources; and the compensable value of the services lost to the public through the completion of the restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition of the equivalent of the injured resources and their services to baseline.
