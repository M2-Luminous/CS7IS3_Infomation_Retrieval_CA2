He said the SNA was strongly opposed to any form of terrorism and supported international agreements on terrorism and banditry. The spokesman went on to say that the SNA was making comprehensive investigations to bring to justice those responsible for the banditry and kidnappings which had been committed in the country this year. In the investigations, the SNA had already got answers to several terrorist incidents and the identities of those responsible had been submitted to international organizations dealing with the fight against banditry and terrorism. The SNA spokesman said the Somali people had just adopted the course of unity and coexistence. He finally called on peace-loving Somali people to jointly counter those opposed to peace who were busy committing terrorism to harm peaceful coexistence.
