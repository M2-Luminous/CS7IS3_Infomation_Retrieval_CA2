He said: "The separation has existed since olden times, and there is nothing for Yemen to lose from this separation." In an interview in Jeddah al-Shayif told AL-HAYAH that "unity grants no superiority over anyone." He accused "those who made the Pledge and Accord Document" of planning not only to separate the south from the north, but to establish five separate regions, each divided into several governorates with their own resources, independence, and sovereignty, to be united temporarily under the Council of Ministers and then become independent later." Al-Shayif described Yemeni unity as "abnormal; it does not reflect the will of the two parts of Yemen. And it has never been in the interests of the Yemeni people or friendly states in the region." He expected "the ties of unity binding north and south Yemen to split soon at the end of the current tragic events." He said that "the current deterioration in conditions between the two parts is the result of developments which are not new. They are the result of the Gulf crisis caused by Iraqi President Saddam Husayn, whose ambition was to seize the Arabian Peninsula as a whole. And when the scheme aimed against the region's states and its friends, they [Yemeni leaders] invented the unity between the two parts with a view to destroying Yemen and its people. The outcome is the infighting and dispute which everyone is watching and which is harmful to Yemen." He said that "by allying with the communists, they tried to sabotage Yemen's relations with its friends and brothers." Al-Shayif accused those he called "Shiite leaders" of "cooperating with the communists to openly instigate subversive actions in Yemen in order to attribute them to Yemen -- government and people." He noted that "the aim is for Yemen and its people to be held responsible for what the communists did in order to divide the people of the one march in Yemen and the Arabian Peninsula." He said: "As for the Socialist Party and the other parties allied with it, they caused the disaster." He added: "We felt sorry for our colleagues who were fooled by the methods of deception and did not wake up until recently, that is, until the introduction of the Pledge and Accord Document by the dialogue committee." He said that those who formulated this document "are members of the parties allied with the Socialist Party, nothing of which is left except its name, as socialism has died in the world as a whole." He pointed out that members of the dialogue committee composed of the leaders of the parties allied with the Socialist Party "are running affairs in Yemen, even though they do not enjoy the support of honorable Yemeni citizens." He said that leaders of the Socialist Party "have reached that level only with the help of leaders of the General People's Congress and some of its members, who are working behind the scenes to serve the Socialist Party." He criticized the Yemeni Reform Grouping, the General People's Congress, the House of Representatives, and the Presidential Council, which he said "lack authority, as affairs are run behind the scenes by elements from the Shiites allied with the communists." He said that he had warned of the danger of what is happening at a meeting of Yemeni tribal chiefs held under him a few months ago. He said that "what is happening in Yemen at present is that the ship is steered by the dialogue committee arising from Shiite sources, which pushes everyone to implement its members' schemes." He stressed that "if the situation continues as it stands, we will find ourselves compelled to intervene and obliged to take a decisive initiative, even if hostile groups interpret it as aimed against our comrades in destiny. What we are interested in is to tackle the general situation, in which our comrades in common destiny are interested."
