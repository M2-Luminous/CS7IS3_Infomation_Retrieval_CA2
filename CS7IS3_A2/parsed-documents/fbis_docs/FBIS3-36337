The ombudsman is empowered to examine complaints by citizens and formulate recommendations for the resolution of disputes. In the context of Russia's law reform the State Duma has appointed Sergey Kovalev, the well known defender of rights, to be the Russian Federation commissioner for human rights. From our files. Sergey Adamovich Kovalev was born in 1930. He graduated from Moscow State University's Biology Department in 1954, is a specialist in cell membranes, and has published around 70 scientific works. He began his public activity with the defense of genetics and articles against Lysenko's doctrines. He was an active participant in the dissident movement in the sixties and seventies. In 1974 he was sentenced to seven years for political activity and after serving that sentence he was exiled to Kolyma for three years and spent the following three years under surveillance in Kalinin. In 1990 he became a Russian Federation people's deputy and chairman of the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee. He is now chairman of the Russian President's Human Rights Commission on a voluntary basis. [Kovalev] It is very important that the ombudsman or the commissioner for human rights, as it says in the new Russian Federation Constitution, has no executive powers [vlastnyye polnomochiya]. However, state organs are obliged to examine his recommendations on complaints of human rights violations. The prestige of this service derives from the thoroughness of its investigation and the well balanced nature of its conclusions. Perhaps the only element which needs to be introduced into the law to enhance the effectiveness of our work is a norm on the right to publish our recommendations and the obligation of state institutions to give a public explanation of their response if they disagree with our conclusions. This guarantee of publicity will help society to understand the most complex conflicts between people and the state. The new service is designed to protect human rights primarily against the state in the form of a specific official or a whole department. It is not a rival to the court or the prosecutor's office. The philosophy of this institution is to seek peaceful solutions in disputes between the citizen and the state, the gradual development of relations of trust between them, and accordingly the enhancement of the prestige of the agency [vlast] which has been created to guarantee the rights of the individual. I believe that for Russia the introduction of the service of the people's defender is especially timely. [Sharapov] Might it not be that there will be an endless stream of complainants coming to you as they used to go and see "Kalinin, the sage of all the people"? [Kovalev] That is inevitable although there are various devices to filter such streams. One, which I admit I do not like very much, is that of exhausting the other means first, in other words, this service is the court of last resort when all the others have been tried. I believe that given our bureaucracy this is not the best way. The urgency and social significance of the dispute may be important criteria although such parameters are difficult to formalize. In some countries there are "specialist ombudsmen" on ecology, army matters, and so forth. Perhaps such a system will one day take root in Russia, too. However, it is important to understand that human rights are a federal prerogative and the commissioner for human rights must operate at federal level. You will agree that it would be absurd if there were different norms in this sphere in the different oblasts of Russia with each demanding its own ombudsman. However, this does not mean that in the Russian regions there will be no representatives of the service of the commissioner for human rights. [Sharapov] Is it really the case that anyone who has a grievance against the authorities, including people in detention centers, can appeal to you? [Kovalev] Prisoners traditionally form a considerable proportion of those who appeal for justice. It goes without saying that all statements will be examined. I believe that if the essence of a case is set out clearly and concisely all the necessary papers will be demanded when our service examines the case. There are extensive areas of human rights which still seem to be in the shadows as far as social consciousness is concerned. For example, the rights of Russian citizens outside its borders. Our Human Rights Commission together with the Foreign Ministry is now drafting proposals to resolve this problem. There are sometimes the most unexpected clashes in the human rights sphere. For example, one Russian Federation Supreme Soviet budget virtually empowered local organs of power to levy a payment for education on citizens leaving Russia. The Russian Federation Supreme Soviet Human Rights Committee had simply overlooked this little gem which is contrary to all international norms. I think that the Russian Federation human rights cpmmissioner's service will consider the whole range of problems of the protection of rights in Russia. [Sharapov] But for work to begin it seems that the State Duma must adopt a law on the service of the Russian Federation commissioner for human rights? [Kovalev] Yes, and this would be a constitutional law needing the vote of two-thirds of the deputies for adoption. The ratification of the office of the human rights commissioner by the country's representative organ emphasizes the origin of this office which, I repeat, is independent of the authorities. The president can and must have consultants in the human rights sphere although our service is designed primarily to protect people from abuses by state officials or structures. Of course the office of the human rights commissioner presupposes the cessation of party and other political activity, especially activity as a deputy. The situation in the Duma today is complex and it will not be easy to get the law through. However, the factional structure of the Duma may make it possible and already is making it possible to reach agreement on the most diverse questions. I hope that this factor, together with the ombudsman's lack of executive powers, will reconcile deputies. Especially since they are the people's representatives and our service is designed to protect the rights of the people.
