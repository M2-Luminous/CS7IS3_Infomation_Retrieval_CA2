A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said most-favoured-nation (MFN) trade status was "a reciprocal and a mutually beneficial trade arrangement." "Any move which runs counter to this will undermine the foundation for the economic and trade relations between the two countries and will have adverse influences on Sino-U.S. relations," she said. The comments followed confirmation by a senior U.S. official Wednesday that Washington may settle for imposing limited sanctions on Beijing to express displeasure over its human rights record, rather than carrying out its threat to withdraw China's MFN status. China has consistently condemned U.S. President Bill Clinton's 1993 decision to make "significant overall progress" in human rights a condition for this year's renewal of MFN. Clinton must make a decision on the issue by June 3. U.S. businessmen, who have invested some eight billion dollars in China, have warned the President that even attaching conditions could draw a visceral response from Beijing. Foreign ministry spokesman Wu Jianmin said China had taken note of support from U.S. businessmen, congressmen and journalists for the unconditional renewal of MFN, saying this was a "positive" development. "We hope the United States government will make a sensible decision," he told a weekly news briefing. He said the two sides seek to resolve their differences through dialogue on a equal footing, indicating that there was in any case only so much Beijing could do to satisfy Washington. "The U.S. can only do what is permitted by its laws. The same is true of China. China can only do what is permitted by China's laws," Wu said. He said it would be "inappropriate" to give details of any ongoing diplomacy, but added that "the channels for contact between the two countries are always in place.
