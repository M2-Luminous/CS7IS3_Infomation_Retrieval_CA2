FR941222-1-00006 FR941222-1-00003 POSTAL RATE COMMISSION 39 CFR Part 3001 [Docket No. RM95&hyph;1; Order No. 1038] Express Mail Market Response Rate Requests: Rules of Practice and Procedure AGENCY: Postal Rate Commission. ACTION: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. SUMMARY: In response to a petition filed by the Postal Service, the Postal Rate Commission proposes to re-enact its rules of practice allowing expedited consideration of Express Mail market response rate requests. These rules expired recently pursuant to a sunset provision. Re-enactment will insure the continued existence of a flexible ratemaking mechanism for consideration of changes in Express Mail rates between omnibus rate cases when required by market conditions. DATES: Comments should be filed by January 23, 1995. ADDRESSES: Comments should be sent to Charles L. Clapp, Secretary of the Commission, 1333 H Street NW, 20268&hyph;0001. Comments will be available for inspection and photocopying at the Commission's Docket Room. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Stephen Sharfman, Legal Advisor (202) 789&hyph;6820. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: On August 15, 1994, the Postal Service filed a petition for institution of a rulemaking to re-enact Commission rules of practice and procedure on Postal Service requests for changes in Express Mail rates in response to market conditions. These rules were the outcome of Docket No. RM88&hyph;2, Express Mail Rulemaking. That rulemaking, like this one, was instituted at the Service's request. The rules that were finally issued differed from those initially proposed by the Service. They are codified at 39 CFR 3001.57&hyph;3001.57c. They took effect August 16, 1989. At that time, they were identified as experimental rules and issued subject to a five-year sunset provision. That period has expired. As the Service notes in its recent petition, the original impetus for adoption of these rules was a period of intense price competition in the expedited (overnight) delivery market. Postal Service Petition at 2. Prior to their adoption, rates for Express Mail service could be set only by filing a formal request under rule 54. Rule 54 requires detailed information on costs, revenues, elasticities of demand and entails numerous procedural stages. See 39 CFR 3001.54. Fulfillment of these requirements generally means that decisions on rate change requests require the full ten months allowed by the statute. This effectively forecloses prompt responses to frequent price changes. See generally 54 FR 33681 (August 16, 1989). As rapid price changes were the hallmark of expedited delivery competition in the early-to-mid 1980s, it was believed that a flexible ratemaking mechanism would allow the Postal Service to respond more effectively to market conditions. In support of its petition for re-enactment, the Postal Service acknowledges that it has never invoked the market response rules. However, it asserts several reasons for their retention. One is that the overnight delivery market remains competitive, primarily on price. Another is Express Mail's emergence as a low-cost alternative for household users and small- and medium-volume businesses not eligible for discounts from other carriers' published rates. A third is preservation of Express Mail's contribution to institutional costs. The Commission's initial review of the Service's petition leads it to agree that the Express Mail market response rules should be retained. Interested parties are invited to comment on the appropriateness of this action. The Commission directs W. Gail Willette, Acting Director of the Office of the Consumer Advocate, to participate to the extent necessary to fulfill her responsibilities under 39 CFR 3002.7 and part 3002, Appendix A. II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the PRC hereby certifies that this notice of proposed rulemaking is not expected to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required. III. List of Subjects in 39 CFR Part 3001 Administrative practice and procedure, Postal Service. 1. The authority citation for 39 CFR part 3001 continues to read as follows: Authority: 39 U.S.C. §404(b), 3603, 3622&hyph;3624, 3661, 3662. 2. Sections 3001.57 through 3001.57c are added to Subpart B to read as follows: §3001.57 Market response rate requests for Express Mail service_purpose and duration of rules. (a) This section and §§3001.57a through 3001.57c only apply in cases in which the Postal Service requests an expedited recommended decision pursuant to section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act on changes in rates and fees for Express Mail service, where the proposed changes are intended to respond to a change in the market for expedited delivery services for the purpose of minimizing the loss of Express Mail contribution to institutional costs recommended in the most recent omnibus rate case. These rules set forth the requirements for filing data in support of such rate proposals and for providing notice of such requests, and establish an expedited procedural schedule for evaluating Market Response Rate Requests. These rules may not be used when the Postal Service is requesting changes in Express Mail rates as part of an omnibus rate case. Further explanation concerning these rules can be found at 54 FR 11394&hyph;413 (March 20, 1989), 54 FR 251342&hyph;42 (June 13, 1989) and PRC Order No. 836.
