FR940721-2-00028 FR940721-2-00020 Financial Assistance: Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation AGENCY: Idaho Operations Office, Department of Energy. ACTION: Notice of intent. SUMMARY: The U.S. Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(A) and (D) it plans to negotiate Cooperative Agreement DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;94ID13303 with Stone & Webster Engineering Corporation, Boston, Massachusetts. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Linda A. Hallum, Contract Specialist, (208) 526&hyph;5545; U.S. Department of Energy, 850 Energy Drive, MS 1221, Idaho Falls, ID 83401&hyph;1563. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The objective of the project is continue tests to evaluate the supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) pilot plant developed under Cooperative Agreement DE&hyph;FC07&hyph;88ID12711. The pilot plant configuration was developed to treat corrosive wastes and waste with high solids content. DOE has no recent, current, or planned solicitations under which this proposal would be eligible. The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory continuation of an activity funded by DOE and for which competition for support would have a significant adverse effect on continuity or completion of the project. DOE and commercial implementation of SCWO technology will reduce the volume of hazardous and mixed waste currently stored and generated in the United States. SCWO technology is recognized as a high potential alternative technology to incineration, providing cleaner effluents and with less institutional barriers than incineration. The award will be for one year at a total estimated cost of $700,000. Cost share is anticipated to be 10% of the project costs. Statutory authority for this award is Pub. L. 93&hyph;577, Federal Non-Nuclear Energy Research and Development Act of 1974. The Federal Domestic Catalog Number is 81.103. Dated: July 11, 1994. R. Jeffrey Hoyles, Director, Procurement Services Division. [FR Doc. 94&hyph;17785 Filed 7&hyph;20&hyph;94; 8:45 am] BILLING CODE 6450&hyph;01&hyph;M
