With his statement that he wants to continue the Christian-liberal government coalition in Bonn after 16 October, he has given the party the opportunity to pursue the election campaign for itself. Without constantly having to answer the question about its loyalty to the coalition, the FDP now can announce its positions emphatically and loudly. With this, Kinkel primarily makes concessions to the critics in his own camp who have repeatedly called for the party to acquire a profile, and not without reason, by the way. After all, the FDP has lost its traditional role as the only party that can provide a majority. What the new "public relations work" of the liberals can be like became basically clear when it was affirmed that the solidarity surcharge would be reexamined after three years. The rejection of a higher petroleum tax is a move to distance itself from the Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]. The basically positive commitment of the partner also challenges the CDU/CSU. In particular, in economic and in financial policy, the junior partner will try to distinguish itself from the senior partner. Apart from the fact that the liberals have basically set the course for a continuation of the government coalition, the coalition statement has not yet been formulated. And one remembers that it is to become a "conditioned" election statement. In any case, Kinkel said yesterday that anyone who wants to prevent a red-green formation or a grand coalition must vote for the FDP. There was no mention of a Social Democratic-Liberal coalition.
