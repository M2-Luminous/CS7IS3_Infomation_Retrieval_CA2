Rybkin noted that the president assured legislators that the chief executive will give every kind of support to the Duma. Describing the talk with the president as detailed, substantive and constructive, Rybkin stressed that Yeltsin expressed readiness for constant cooperation with the state Duma. Meetings between the Duma speaker and the president will be regular, at least once a month. Rybkin informed deputies that the talk focused on cooperation between the chief executive and the state Duma in law-making activities. The president stressed that the division of powers does not mean their estrangement, Rybkin said. "We shall be guided by this principle during our work at the state Duma," the speaker stressed. According to Rybkin, they also discussed material and technical aspects of the state Duma's work as well as working and living conditions of legislators. The speaker noted that the president reaffirmed: Lawmakers will be provided with all necessary things for their work. Rybkin informed deputies that all buildings and services of the former parliament will be transferred to the Russian parliament fully or for temporary use. The president instructed the business administration to hand over all necessary services to financial and economic administrations of the Duma. This question was also settled in principle with the Russian Government, Rybkin added. He told parliamentarians about his two-hour talk with Viktor Chernomyrdin, which was held also on Thursday. The premier said that the Duma will receive back the institute of comparative jurisprudence, one of the most important institutions which will be returned to the lower chamber. The question was also raised about completing all repairs at the building of the former townhall which is now occupied by the state Duma. The president informed the speaker that he gave appropriate instructions to the government to complete repairs at the earliest. Rybkin also said that the Duma would receive an appropriate number of other spacious buildings and installations in the capital, although he did not specify which ones. He only noted that buildings are good both in floor space and quality and in no way inferior to the previous ones. The speaker informed deputies that a working staff of the state Duma would be formed. He told lawmakers that the president, on his suggestion, signed a decree disbanding the temporary staff of the Russian Parliament and establishing a permanent staff of the state Duma.
