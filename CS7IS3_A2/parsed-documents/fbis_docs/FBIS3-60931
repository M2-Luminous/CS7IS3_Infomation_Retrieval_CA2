The explosion injured nine persons and caused considerable damage. The store's windows shattered into fragments injuring various persons, including two children. According to witnesses, the cart was left by two men and a woman shortly before the explosion. A branch of the same store located in Lima's Miraflores District was attacked with a car bomb last November, shortly after one of its owners was released by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Four Chileans affiliated with the MRTA were arrested on that occasion. They will be sentenced, probably to life, today or tomorrow, it was reported on Tuesday by Daniel Espichan, special prosecutor for cases of terrorism. Today's attack follows the detonation of three car bombs that were placed in Lima beginning 28 December and which resulted in one death, 40 injured persons, and the destruction of numerous stores and houses. The National Police attributed these and other attacks to the Maoist Shining Path band.
