So what will he do now? "I really do not know," replied the youngest of the Great Old Men who were defeated at the last, stormy PRI convention. It took place at the Parco dei Principi Hotel, transformed for the occasion into a slaughterhouse of the resentment experienced by at least three generations of PRI members. With a majority of only six votes, the meeting decided the PRI's return to the center. However, on this cold and uncertain, late-January Monday morning, Giannino's tearful farewell was not the only split which took place within the sober walls of the nondenominationalist club. Indeed, following such a close-fought victory, what feelings does a leader experience -- including from a human point of view -- when he sees some of his most loyal co-workers suddenly turning their backs on him? "We are very happy," one of the lady assistants of the resuscitated secretary said smilingly. Giorgio himself also expressed his satisfaction at "the political result, but only at this political result" obtained by the PRI. [Proietti] No doubt, it will not be easy for you to heal certain wounds... [La Malfa] Did you attend our platform conference at the Piccolo Eliseo? If you did, then you must have realized how outdated the debate was within our party. This is why I am very happy with the final result achieved by our National Council. I managed to put some order and clarity back into a party that was losing its bearings. This is also why I was particularly disappointed by the behavior of some people whose intelligence I respect. However, those who are leaving -- and I believe there are not many -- are only looking for a seat outside the PRI. [Proietti] Does that include Bruno Visentini and Giovanni Ferrara? [La Malfa] I bear them no grudge. Bruno Visentini was the only person I informed of the turn beforehand. Not even my closest co-workers knew about it. I had to tell Visentini, though, if only out of a sense of respect for him. It was Visentini who had supported my reelection to the post of secretary. [Proietti] What about your formerly heeded adviser Ferrara? Would you rather not talk about him? [La Malfa] I am disappointed in Giovanni because of his lack of understanding for my political proposal. Despite being a very sharp political thinker, he refused to listen to my reasons.... [Proietti] What is your reply to Bogi and Battaglia's bitter accusations that you are, basically, a turncoat? [La Malfa] I believe their opinions speak for themselves. On the other hand, we each strive in our own way to safeguard our political life. I lived through a dramatic experience, that of bribe city, because I am convinced that politics are not something personal, and that, in any case, public opinion must be listened to. [Proietti] Why, then, did you accept being reelected as a secretary? [La Malfa] It was apparent to me, also at the Cusani trial, that people are able to draw distinctions between different types of suspects. So when I had to decide whether to go back into politics, I asked myself on what conditions I could do so, and I decided I could attempt going back by renouncing something even more significant, namely, by not standing for a seat in parliament. [Proietti] How did you reach your decision to return to the center? [La Malfa] The first difficult choice was that of returning to politics after the bribe city mishap. This happened when the local election results in the fall, especially in Rome and Naples, revealed an alarming fact: In the capital, the fascists had mustered a relative majority, whereas the winner in Naples was a representative of the PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] opposed to [Alessandra] Mussolini. I was concerned because that result was often interpreted in a distorting fashion, as apparent from the latest election in Catania, where the fascists won by a large majority in the provinces. Only [Pact for Italy leader Mario] Segni is standing up to them. So I asked myself: What sort of Italy will emerge from the next general elections? [Proietti] Initially, however, you had approached AD [Democratic Alliance]. [La Malfa] Yes, [PDS Secretary Achille] Occhetto showed some courage, among other things, by giving a negative historical judgement on the PCI's [Italian Communist Party] past history. However, when I understood that the PDS leader was aiming to build a left-wing coalition without worrying too much about who was in it, and without giving any thought to the platforms, I also asked myself: How can we possibly join forces with Communist Renewal which was still singing hymns to Cuba at its congress? [Proietti] But AD also included the PRI with Visentini, Bogi, and Giannino. [La Malfa] My friends who have joined AD will soon understand that it makes no sense to remain in an alliance which is leading them to embrace Bertinotti. I doubt also whether businessmen like Averna and Marzotto will be able to stand such company. [Proietti] Of course, the businessmen. What about [Forza Italia leader Silvio] Berlusconi? [La Malfa] I believe that he is plunging into politics to strengthen the right. This, however, is madness. Besides, it would not harm a businessman like him to be a little more reserved. Agnelli always refused to identify a major productive force such as Fiat with any single party. It is most distressing to imagine what Italy would really be like if it were governed by [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, with Berlusconi acting as a mediator between the MSI [Italian Social Movement] and the League, and Bertinotti in the opposition. But the same applies to the reverse situation. This is why the PRI is going back to the center -- to build a third pole and to prevent the right from winning.
