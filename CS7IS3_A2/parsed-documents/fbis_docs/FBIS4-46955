Parliament Has Presented a Bill to the Executive Power"] [Text] The deputies supported by a majority of votes the statement of the Kazakhstan parliament of no confidence in the socioeconomic course of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of Kazakhstan. In connection with this event our correspondent met with a member of the Committee on Interparliamentary Communications of the Supreme Council, a corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Kazakhstan Sultan Sartayev and asked him several questions. [Cherepanov] Sultan Sartayevich, what do the members of parliament see as the groundlessness of the government policy? [Sartayev] It seems to me that we have strayed a long way from the discussions to the effect that "it is necessary to conduct reforms." As today's reality shows, there have been no deeply considered economic transformations. This is stated unequivocally both by our economists and by our esteemed colleagues from nearby foreign countries. Therefore the majority of the deputy corps have decided that the government has exhausted its reform possibilities, and that was the point of departure for the essentially unprecedented statement. [Cherepanov] In your opinion, what was the principal mistake or, if you will, omission of the creators of our economic policy? [Sartayev] First of all that we are unable to intelligently dispose of foreign credits and check to make sure whether they are used as intended for target programs or thoughtlessly wasted. After all, according to press reports a considerable amount is being awarded to the republic. Second, the bank credit system in its present form is clearly working against the commodity producer. Everyone knows that production cannot develop without a long-term financial policy. This policy is destructive to the state. The reforms will not move a step forward without support from small- and medium-sized business. But as far as I know, they are the ones being bypassed in the distribution of credit, which gets to those that have already blazed a trail to the market and have become strong enough. Apparently we must fully revise the legislative acts, releasing the entrepreneur from the economic fetters. This is apparently a task for a renewed government. I have not misspoken here. I think that the president--and here the deputies agree with me--must distance himself from the present Cabinet of Ministers. [Cherepanov] The appearance of the statement coincided in time with the creation of the "shadow" government headed by Supreme Council Deputy Vitaliy Roze. What do you think about that? [Sartayev] The appearance of the "shadow" will to a certain degree serve as a catalyst for a more rational, weighed policy on the part of our present government. But I must say that with the presidential form of rule its appearance in and of itself is nonsense. [Cherepanov] This is probably not the last act of disagreement of the deputies regarding serious questions of state policy. [Sartayev] Many analysts predicted that the new Supreme Council would be "tame." Fortunately, the predictions were wrong. If the parliament were to unanimously approve everything proposed by the executive power without discussing it or delving into its essence, no progress would be forthcoming. This statement shows that the deputies have seriously undertaken to improve the economic, social, and legal policy. Let me emphasize once again that the Supreme Council must revise the entire tax and credit system and banking legislation in order to avoid a repetition of the situation in which the reforms run up against a blind wall.
