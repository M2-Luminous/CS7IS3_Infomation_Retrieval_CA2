According to the newspaper, however, President Aristide said he would not want this force, which would come to chase away the military, to remain in the country. Today, President Aristide seems to have reconsidered his decision, or at least has denied having made it. Rothschild Francois has further details: [Begin Francois] Indeed, in a statement just made by President Aristide on the premises of Trans-Africa in Washington, he stated that he never asked for U.S. military intervention in Haiti as a solution to the crisis. Mr. Aristide, speaking before a group of reporters, following a lunch in his honor hosted by Rindall Robinson on the premises of Trans-Africa, stated: We are not seeking a military occupation in Haiti, adding that if he asked for military intervention in Haiti, the parliament would dismiss him in accordance with the Haitian Constitution. The president said, however, some action could help free the nation from the bandits now occupying the political scene in favor of a return to democracy in Haiti. The president-in-exile said some quick, determined action could be taken to chase out the military, within the framework of the Governors Island agreement. Aristide said he would not give details on what he calls quick action. He says the international community knows what to do in this case. Mr. Aristide favors sending the UN technical mission to Haiti, as provided for in the Governors Island agreement, and his own immediate return. He also asks that the reform program outlined in the Governors Island agreement be applied. How long should the international community stay in Haiti? The president-in-exile stated that, according to the Governors Island agreement, the international community would spend six months, which would be renewable. We are ready to work with the international community to reach these objectives, he said. He pointed out that the above four steps represent the process for the return of democracy to Haiti. President-in-exile Aristide indicates that following the restoration of democracy in the country, there would be national reconciliation, which would help establish political stability, necessary to progress in Haiti, and also that this situation would help build a nation based on unity and offering hope. Then Haiti would be able to take care of its refugees and stop the boat people from going to Miami, Florida. Aristide also said that when he was in power, the situation in the country was correct. Let us listen to the statements President Aristide just made in Washington, during which he said that he never asked for a military intervention in Haiti to solve the crisis: [Begin Aristide recording, in English] We do not seek military occupation. If I were to ask for military intervention, I would be impeached under my Constitution. [In French] Be clear, because I am clear. I did not ask for a military intervention. I did not ask for a military intervention. [repeats] There is my answer, after correcting your question. We are working toward the restoration of democracy, which implies a country where reconciliation must shine like the sun, where justice must be the sun that without revenge, without violence pleases everyone. Because from there, we can live in a state of law. Everyday, during these 32 months, we have tried our best to explore the horizons of this peaceful strategy. That is why, while we are pleased to see the application of the embargo, and hope it will be completely kept and respected. We are also hoping -- within the scope of the agreement signed on 3 July 1993 -- that some action will be taken so we do not have to pay for the luxury of getting lost in statements when actions are necessary and indispensable, to save the lives of those who are eaten by pigs after being killed by the military, the lives of those who are eaten by dogs after being killed by the military. This was reported by those who visited Haiti within the framework of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. In this context, united with the international community, united with the U.S., Canadian, French, Latin American, and Caribbean friends, we would like to walk together in order, along with the Haitian people, to save lives, the life of every man and of every woman.
