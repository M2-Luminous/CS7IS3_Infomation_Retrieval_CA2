FBIS4-54152 "dreas102_m_94005" FBIS-EAS-94-102 Daily Report 26 May 1994 Thailand Editor Ends Radio Show as Protest Against Army Editor Ends Radio Show as Protest Against Army BK2605085094 Bangkok THE NATION in English 26 May 94 pp A1, A4 BK2605085094 Bangkok THE NATION English BFN [Text] Suthichai Yun, editor-in-chief of THE NATION Publishing Group, will halt all his political programs on radio to underscore the "lack of freedom of expression" on the country's radio stations. The decision came after the Army Territorial Defense Department "requested" the publishing group to delete all political comments from radio FM 96, which was leased to a private company, PK Advertising Co. and sub-contracted to the Nation Publishing Group to produce news and commentary programs. "Since we can't have the freedom to comment freely on the country's political, military and social affairs, we have decided to pull out all our commentary programs from the radio station," he said, adding that non-political programs will be back on the air today, "to keep our communication channel with our listeners open and to deliver the vital message that this is the best we have to offer the public under the circumstances". Suthichai said he had decided to stop all his radio programs -- including his morning and evening political talk shows on FM 97 owned by the government-run Public Relations Department -- "to protest against this government's failure to live up to its promise to respect the people's right to information through radio". He said radio commentators in Thailand still get "thinly-veiled threats" for their frank, critical remarks against government agencies and the military. "Radio producers and commentators are often threatened with termination of their contracts if they report or comment frankly on current affairs. Since government agencies still own and control all the 400-odd radio stations, they still consider the frequencies their own mouthpieces. Nobody is allowed to criticize the government agencies which own those frequencies," he said. "This government has not done anything to return radio stations to the people. I feel it is time to show how serious the problem is. I will not resume my radio commentaries until such time that we have the freedom to express our opinions frankly, freely and professionally," Suthichai said.
