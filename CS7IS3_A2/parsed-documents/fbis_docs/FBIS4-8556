Here is Mirjana Protic reporting from the Assembly building: [Begin Protic recording] Fifteen minutes ago, the Federal Assembly Chamber of Citizens adopted the Federal Assembly declaration concerning the air strikes on the Serbian positions in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Yugoslav Assembly declaration states: The Federal Assembly of the FRY resolutely condemns the NATO armed attacks under UN auspices that caused destruction and casualties among the civilian population. Having carried out these armed attacks, the United Nations has abandoned its impartial peaceful role and openly sided with the Muslim side in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Federal Assembly expresses extreme concern about the (?unselective) consequences these attacks may have on ending the civil war and on reaching a just political solution in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. It is known that the clashes have escalated because the protected zones, particularly the one in Gorazde, were used by Muslims for attacking Serbian positions. The United Nations has not ensured disarmament within the protected zone which it was obligated to do, nor did it react to Muslim military actions coming from the protected zones, nor did it exert influence on the Muslim side to stop armed activities. Behaving in that way the United Nations has taken on itself the risk and responsibility for all possible consequences that cannot be predicted at the moment. It is regretful that the very United Nations that is obligated by its Charter to keep peace and international security is taking a step that causes the war to escalate and threatens the peace process. The Federal Assembly warns that the policy of pressure, ultimatums, and armed attacks against the Serbian side does not lead to a peaceful solution of the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Federal Assembly calls on the United Nations to stop immediately aggressive actions against the Serbian people, to abandon double standards toward the participants in the civil war in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina, to resume dialogue on ceasing all military activities, and to seek a solution exclusively in a political way, through negotiations, respecting the interests of all sides. The FRY will continue its hitherto constructive policy of active participation in the peace process. However, the FRY will not and cannot be indifferent toward actions that represent armed attacks on the Serbian people in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina and will continue to monitor closely the further development of the situation. Thus concludes the Federal Assembly declaration that has just been adopted at the session of the Chamber of Citizens. [end recording]
