FR941230-2-00043 FR941230-2-00034 Fish and Wildlife Service Notice of Availability of the Technical/Agency Draft Recovery Plan for the Relict Darter for Review and Comment AGENCY: Fish and Wildlife Service, Interior. ACTION: Notice of document availability and public comment period. SUMMARY: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces the availability for public review of a draft recovery plan for the relict darter. The relict darter is apparently endemic to the Bayou du Chien drainage. Within this drainage the fish is now known from five sites in Graves and Hickman Counties, Kentucky, and it is known to spawn in only one Bayou due Chien tributary in Graves County. The species has been and continues to be impacted by water quality and habitat deterioration resulting from channel dredging, siltation contributed by poor land use practices, and by other water pollutants. The fish's limited distribution also makes it vulnerable to toxic chemical spills. The Service solicits review and comments from the public on this draft plan. DATES: Comments on the technical/agency draft recovery plan must be received on or before February 28, 1995 to receive consideration by the Service. ADDRESSES: Persons wishing to review the draft recovery plan may obtain a copy by contacting the Asheville Field Office, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 330 Ridgefield Court, Asheville, North Carolina 28806. Written comments and materials regarding the plan should be addressed to the Field Supervisor at the above address. Comments and materials received are available on request for public inspection, by appointment, during normal business hours at the above address. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Mr. Richard Biggins at the address at telephone number shown above (Ext. 228). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background Restoring endangered or threatened animals and plants to the point where they are again secure, self-sustaining members of their ecosystems is a primary goal of the Service's endangered species program. To help guide the recovery effort, the Service is working to prepare recovery plans for most of the listed species native to the United States. Recovery plans describe actions considered necessary for conservation of the species, establish criteria for recognizing the recovery levels for downlisting or delisting them, and estimate time and cost to implement the recovery measures needed. The Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq .) (Act), requires the development of recovery plans for listed species unless such a plan would not promote the conservation of a particular species. Section 4(f) of the Act, as amended in 1988, requires that a public notice and an opportunity for public review and comment be provided during recovery plan development. The Service will consider all information presented during a public comment period prior to approval of each new or revised recovery plan. The Service and other Federal agencies will also take these comments into account in the course of implementing approved recovery plans. The primary species considered in this draft recovery plan is the relict darter ( Etheostoma chienense ). The area of emphasis for recovery is the Bayou du Chien drainage in Graves and Hickman Counties, Kentucky. The protection of this only existing population, reestablishment of spawning populations in other tributaries, life history studies, habitat restoration, and public education are among the management actions outlined in the plan. Public Comments Solicited The Service solicits written comments on the recovery plan described. All comments received by the date specified above will be considered prior to approval of the plan. Authority The authority for this action is Section 4(f) of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(f). Dated: December 21, 1994. Brian P. Cole, Field Supervisor.
