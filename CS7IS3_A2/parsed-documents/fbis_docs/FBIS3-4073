"China's total debts for 1994 will come to nearly 130 billion yuan, which seems big," said Zhao Haikuan, honorary director of the Finance Institute of the People's Bank of China. "This is the result of a change of accounting methods this year, and the change will not affect the actual size of the debt," he said. "We formerly regarded what we borrowed as revenue income and included expenses on debt servicing in total expenditures; the shortfall between revenues and expenditures was regarded as the hard deficit," he said, who is also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Many experts and scholars at home and abroad expressed disagreement with this practice. To more clearly reflect the balance between the country's normal revenues and expenditures and the scale of debt, starting from this year, the country is using a different method of calculating the deficit, Zhao said. Income from borrowing will no longer be included in total revenues. The entire deficit will be covered by issuing treasury bonds, instead of by loans from banks as was the case previously. As a result, the amount of the debt goes up accordingly, Zhao said. This year 48.081 billion yuan for servicing domestic and foreign debts due for repayment will be covered by issuing treasury bonds and 14.245 billion yuan of new foreign loans will be used for the construction of key projects. "All these factors lead to a seemingly big increase in the total debt," Zhao said. However, Zhao pointed out, due to various factors, deficit is also a serious problem in China. To some extent, it will have a great impact on China's economy, which should be given due attention and should never be ignored, he warned. On how to reduce deficit, Zhao said that from a long-term point of view it is imperative to bring money supply under strict control. Excessive issuing of currency is caused by too large an amount of deficit and vice versa. He suggested that the state appropriately slow down the economic growth rate, pay more attention to efficiency and reduce the scale of investment into fixed assets. In Zhao's view, the country's investment into fixed assets is not compatible with its national strengthen. In addition, tax collection should be strengthened to avoid tax evasion, and administrative spendings should be cut, Zhao added.
