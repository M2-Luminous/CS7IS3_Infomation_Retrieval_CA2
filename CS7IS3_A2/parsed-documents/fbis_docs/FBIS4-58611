FBIS4-58611 "drnes087__s94005" FBIS-NES-94-087 Daily Report 7 Apr 1994 RESALAT Reports on Majles Sessions RESALAT Reports on Majles Sessions 5 Apr 94LA0133A Tehran RESALAT in Persian 7 Apr 94 p 5 94LA0133A Tehran RESALAT Persian CSO [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. Last Tuesday the Majles met in open session chaired by Mr. Movahedi-Kermani. Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and Chaldean minorities, and Rowhani, deputy from Mahallat and Dalijan, gave speeches. Then Mr. Movahedi gave a short speech in which he offered condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far Sadeq (peace be upon him). Then the Majles took up its agenda, and we direct the attention of our esteemed readers to the details of the proceedings. Shamshun Maqsudpur, Deputy From the Assyrian and Chaldean Minorities In the area of food production, Iran can become a major exporter. The first preagenda speaker at last Tuesday's open Majles session was Maqsudpur, deputy from the Assyrian and Chaldean minorities. He offered congratulations on the new year and discussed the priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan and its administrative weaknesses. He said: Economic experts and the nation's executive officials agree that the deadend arising from oil revenues must be resolved by increasing oil export activities. Under current circumstances agriculture is certainly the most important sector for achieving this objective, and it therefore demands special attention from the government. He discussed the fact that Iran, which has the necessary resources, can achieve self-sufficiency in food production and can even become a major food exporter. He added: Last year, despite the limitations in this area, agricultural exports made up 40 percent of the nation's nonoil exports, and the agricultural sector accounted for 24 percent of the gross domestic product. We are already very close to self-sufficiency with regard to several very important products, yet only 25 percent of the arable lands are being used. Continuing, he cited some of the important problems and priorities in the Second Five-Year Plan, including the need to alleviate the problems with ownership of agricultural lands; the need to change the system of utilization and to gradually get away from the limitations of the traditional system; the need for technical determination of cultivation methods for crops, which for years have alternately been subject to severe fluctuations on the consumer market; the need to increase investment in the industries affiliated with agriculture, emphasis on research and the education of farmers; the encouragement of agricultural exports; the guarantee of investment in the agricultural sector; and finally the need to procure judicial security in the country. Continuing, he added: The need to give attention to agriculture is also important in the political dimension. For years the imperialist forces have used food as a weapon of war to impose their political views and they have imposed food boycotts on some countries. The possibility of using this weapon is still strong. Continuing, the speaker said: There is no doubt that achieving the aforementioned objectives will require a revision of the organizational structure and the creation of unified management organizations. It is hoped that in the studies now being done to bring about change in this country's administrative system, attention will also be given to this important matter. Continuing, the deputy from the Assyrians said: The procedures provided in the Second Five-Year Plan for the government's executive agents are being implemented. The executive agents in terms of organizations are the ministries, and the government organizations and institutions. The organizational positions in each of them are held by human beings. Therefore if a comprehensive and appropriate management program composed of truly skilled and committed agents for implementing the programs does not emerge, this plan will undoubtedly be the subject of articles in the magazines. He discussed the fact that so far no revolutionary steps have been taken to solve the problem of the bureaucracy and reform the administrative system and structure. He said: The nation's administrative problem is not merely a matter of malfunctions in the law or too many regulations. The major problem is considered to be the way the laws are implemented and how some executive officials deal with the public. It is in this regard that unaware or counterrevolutionary individuals appear with their filthy intentions to sow discontent. In the same regard, the deputy from the Assyrians added: An example of nonrevolutionary dealings with the people by some officials is the hostile takeover of the property owned by the Tehran Assyrian Society on Azadi Street. About a year ago, in the middle of the night these urban lands were confiscated by the District 10 Municipal Office without informing the owner and obeying the Lands Possession Law. After this land was confiscated and the vegetation was destroyed, a sign identifying it as a place for cultivating municipal flowers and plants for the District 10 Municipal Office was erected, but instead of a place to grow flowers and plants it became a parking lot. Repeated contacts by the society's officials with the district municipal office have so far brought no result, despite repeated promises and the failure to implement the Urban Lands Possession Law. Several letters to the Ministry of the Interior have also gone unanswered. Maqsudpur said he brought this matter up in the Majles reluctantly and that he had no choice other than to ask the minister of the interior to issue the necessary order concerning this matter. In conclusion the speaker asked the minister of education and training to implement the measure enacted by the commission in charge of schools for religious minorities and the written commitment from Education and Training District 5 to close the afternoon shift at the Her Holiness Mary Educational Complex, because in the afternoons the classroom space under discussion is badly needed to carry out supplementary programs for students. Mostafa Rowhani, Deputy From Dalijan and Mahallat Isn't it a shame that Muslim girls in France are expelled from school for wearing Islamic attire? The final preagenda speaker was Rowhani, deputy from Mahallat and Dalijan. During his speech he offered congratulations on the new year and condolences on the martyrdom of Imam Ja'far Sadeq (peace be upon him). He said: According to the experts, in the years 1371 [21 March 1992-20 March 1993] and 1372 [21 March 1993-20 March 1994], 31 of the 40 known natural and unnatural disasters in the world took place in Iran. According to the published statistics these losses total R1,000 billion. Therefore, in view of the losses from the period of the Islamic revolution and the imposed war and the various disasters, it will be difficult to make up the losses, and one must pray for the success of the nation's highest officials. Continuing, the speaker added: The First Five-Year Plan, with the implementation of infrastructure and essential work in the various organizations, has concluded more or less successfully. We have come close to self-sufficiency. The year 1373 [21 March 1994-20 March 1995] will be a year to welcome the Second Five-Year Plan. With guidance from our great leader, it will find reconciliation with God and the people. Rowhani noted that we will endure all hardships to please God. He added: Some people have compared life to a battlefield, and they consider it a struggle to survive. Some people compare life to a playing field and consider life a matter of cooperation and competition. The need for competition entails two things, individual freedom and social order. This was the content of the exalted leader's New Year's message, who advised the nation to strengthen its work ethic and to observe social regulations in all affairs. Perhaps this is the very thing that is needed for society to take on the form of a playing field where everyone has the right to compete and where positions and jobs are given based on individual talent and effort to those who have shown themselves more worthy in social competition. If someone violates the law, he is punished and is not exempt from Islamic punishments. Islamic justice is implemented, and the executive officials find the mechanism to implement justice, which is the elimination of racism and improper discrimination, because the exalted leader wants social justice to be carried out, and this goal will be achieved with the implementation of the commands of Islam. Continuing, the speaker said: Isn't it a shame that today, despite the fact that everyone is free to choose how to dress, in France Muslim girls are expelled from school for the crime of wearing Islamic attire, and are deprived of education? The deputy from Mahallat and Dalijan also said: The experts believe that in the year 1372 Iran's economy went through one of its most difficult years in the process of moving away from an economy relying on the market, and it suffered many pressures caused by economic adjustment. The fluctuating foreign exchange market increased so much that it was almost unprecedented in all of Iran's history. It is hoped that last year an historic lesson was learned by the nation's foreign exchange management. Of course, the repayments and extensions of the period allowed to meet financial commitments in the year 1372 was a great success, and in the year 1373 the government will find an opportunity to solve its economic problems. Rowhani discussed the fact that the exalted leader of the Islamic revolution and the chiefs of the three powers all follow the school of Imam Sadeq (peace be upon him), they understand the exigencies of the time well and they have never abandoned their simple way of life. He added: Those who are close to them know that their way of life is even simpler than it was before the revolution. He discussed the approval of the project to set prices and supervise basic goods by the Economic Council and the president of the republic in the year 1372. He called on the minister of commerce to implement this project as soon as possible. The speaker also added: Our people do not complain about shortages, because our production is good, but they complain about discrimination and distribution. At the end of his speech he issued memos to the officials concerning his electoral district. Legislation Bill Appending Note to Article 1 of Police Force Law The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles session was the report from the first consultation of the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission concerning the Bill Appending a Note to Article 1 of the Police Force Law, the general form of which was not approved and was rejected. Concerning this a replacement said: "All the executive organizations, which due to the necessity for lawful authorization have a unit to protect and guard their assets, resources and installations, will be exempt from Note 1 with approval from the Council of Ministers." It is worth mentioning that the Councils and Domestic Affairs Commission rejected this bill, for which the most important reasons are as follows: 1 - The basic conflict between the proposed bill and the philosophy of the law consolidating police forces, enacted by the Majles, which was aimed at consolidating forces and centralizing the police security forces. 2 - The conflict between the proposed bill and the nation's general policies on the need for unity and a single organization for the police and security forces. 3 - So far the note to Article 1 of the police force law requiring the merging of the police guards in the government organizations with the police forces has not been implemented nor has it elicited praise or blame due to the fact that the Employment Law is still before the Majles. Therefore, to approve this bill would be to change the earlier Majles measure too soon. 4 - It is necessary that all the armed forces be connected to the General Armed Forces Command Staff so that this can be achieved by merging the organization security forces into the police force and putting them under its mantle. Approving this bill would be in conflict with that policy. 5 - Maintaining order and security in accordance with the law is the responsibility of the police force. According to Paragraph 5, Article 4, the mission and duties of the police force as enacted in 1369 [21 March 1990-20 March 1991] is to protect the classified sites and points, and approving this bill would be in conflict with the previous measure. Motion To Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel The second item on the agenda was the urgent Motion To Supervise Government Employee Foreign Travel, the general form of which was approved. Concerning this motion, the opposing deputies took the view that the aforementioned motion was already given Note 13 of the 1373 budget bill, and that there is no need for a new law. The supporters emphasized that the budget is for one year and cannot be a permanent law. It is worth mentioning that a number of the deputies sought to eliminate the motion's urgent status. Discussing this proposal, Mohammad Reza Bahonar said: Since we have a law for the year 1373, the aforementioned motion should therefore be an ordinary motion that will have a second consultation, in order to be comprehensive and well-considered. It will be worked on for a year in order to be implemented in the year 1374 [21 March 1995-20 March 1996]. After talks by opponents and supporters, the proposal to remove the urgent status was put to a vote and approved. Motion To Protect and Utilize Wetlands The next item on the agenda was the report from the first consultation of the Agriculture Commission concerning the Motion To Protect and Utilize the Wetlands of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the general form of which was approved. Amendment to Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law The fourth item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Judicial Affairs Commission concerning the Motion To Amend Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law, enacted 5/17/1372 [8 August 1993], which was approved by the deputies. Article 1: Article 17 of the Judicial Courts Appeals Law enacted 5/17/1372 is amended as follows: Article 17: In cases where a court's final verdict is in conflict with religious law or the law, even if it has been affirmed by the Supreme Court, within 30 days of the verdict's announcement the national public prosecutor may request one review from the Supreme Court. A special branch of the National Supreme Court will be designated to deal with these cases. Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 Budget Bill The next item on the agenda was the report from the second consultation of the Accounting Court Commission concerning the Motion To Append a Paragraph to Note 15 of the 1372 National Budget Bill, of which Article 1 was approved. Article 1: Because of the special procedures in the educational system, Payam-e Nur University may again spend 65 percent of its current expense and allocated credits and also 25 percent of its development credits based on the Law on Procedures for Conducting Financial Affairs and Transactions of the Universities and Institutions of Higher Learning and Research, without adhering to the government's other general regulations. Report on the Research and Investigation of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization The final item on the agenda was the report from the Culture and Islamic Art Commission concerning the research and investigation of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, which was read by the commission expert as follows: After the report on the request for research and investigation of the financial resources of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization by Mr. Bani-Hashemi, the respected deputy from Mashhad, the respected Majles approved the continuation of the research and investigation. The Islamic Guidance Commission appointed Messrs. Seyyed Kia'i-Nezhad, Seyyed Hashem Bani-Hashemi, Seyyed Ahmad Musavi, and 'Ali Zadsar to deal with the matter and to report the result. The aforementioned council appointed Mr. 'Ali Zadsar as the group's chief. It then printed an announcement in the press asking everyone to send any documents or papers on this matter to the Islamic Guidance Commission. The resources for the research and investigation consist of: (1) resources from the public; (2) a careful study of the written documents and evidence; (3) statements from officials; (4) an inspection of the building; and (5) consideration of the views of the experts concerning the aforementioned resources. It is noted: (1) no documents or evidence of any kind were sent to the commission by the people; (2) there were no telephone contacts or personal visits by any real persons or legal entities; (3) all the documents and financial evidence from the beginning to the end of the building's operation were studied and nothing negative of any kind was found; and (4) all the relevant documents, financial, planning, technical, bidding and other things are included in the report. Detailed discussions were held with the respected representative of the vice regent for pilgrimage affairs and with the respected minister of culture of Islamic guidance, the respected chief of the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization, and the builders of the building, and all of those dear ones answered the questions from the members of the council and cooperated. In a careful and lengthy inspection of the building all the members of the council learned the details and the quality of the building: 1 - The money to build the Haj and Pilgrimages Building was provided in the organization's annual budget, and was spent in numerous years after Majles approval. Therefore, there was no extra money, because the annual Haj and Pilgrimages surplus was deposited into the president of the republic's account and was spent as determined by the respected president of the republic. 2 - According to the views of His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), the Haj and Pilgrimages Organization sells the expenses of the pilgrimage to the pilgrims, meaning that the haj sales are final and not on account. Therefore it owns the money and will be authorized to spend it. 3 - With the registration of the respected pilgrims in the year 1363 [21 March 1984-20 March 1985], R270,000 was collected from each pilgrim and they were sent in accordance with a timetable authorized by His Holiness the Imam (peace be upon him), and in this regard written documents were submitted. 4 - The construction of the building took almost 85 months and it cost almost R7 billion. According to the views of the experts and the value of money at that time, the price is appropriate. If exact numbers and figures are needed, the applicant may report to the Islamic Culture and Guidance Commission and see them. 5 - The construction of this great building was done with decoration suitable for the position of the Islamic Republic of Iran, because Islamic Iran is the center of the Muslim world. 6 - The collection of the difference in the year 1372 and the sending of people who were not on the priority list was a bitter experience. The respected haj officials determined that they would declare plainly that as long as one pilgrim remained from the year 1363, they would not agree to any other motion or proposal and that they would reject the collection of differences, although the decision to collect the difference or not collect it is the decision of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and if the government authorizes that such a thing be done, that definitely makes it possible. In conclusion, with thanks to the officials, it is hereby announced that this report is late in appearing, but its submission was delayed because of the presence of the 1373 budget bill on the Majles agenda. Letter From More Than 158 Deputies Concerning Armenia's Downing of the C-130 Aircraft Respected speaker of the Majles: With greetings and congratulations on the New Year to all compatriots, in the final days of the year 1372, when our compatriots were praying at the court of God and were hoping for peace, tranquility and stability in all the world, the hand of criminality came out of the sleeve of the deluded Armenian army and shot down a C-130 aircraft carrying the innocent families of Iranian diplomats, and as the merciless slaughter of the people of the Republic of Azerbaijan continued, it revived the habit of killing people and waging rebellion. Therefore, with condolences to our dear compatriots, and especially the bereaved families, and with protest against the silence of the international organizations, especially the so-called Human Rights Organization, in the face of this air piracy by the army of Armenia, which is the main perpetrator of this open and terrifying crime in the Karabakh area, we demand an expeditious answer for these crimes from the Government of Armenia, and we demand that the Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran pursue this matter seriously.
