It asked members of the House of Representatives their prediction on the schedule of the next general election and under which electoral system -- the present multiple-seat constituency system or the new system combining single-seat constituencies and proportional representation -- they are preparing for the election. Results of the survey show that only a few respondents have ordered their local offices to prepare for full-fledged election campaigns, assuming that there will be "an election in the near future." Such a result shows that both ruling and opposition party members have judged that there is little possibility of a dissolution of the lower house to conduct a general election after the passage of a motion of no- confidence against the Hata Cabinet at the end of the current Diet session. However, most Diet members who have started preparations have been doing so for the multiple-seat constituency system in order to be ready for early dissolution. This result illuminates the Diet members' anxieties. Lower house members or their staff in charge of local offices were surveyed from 1 to 7 June. Among questions asked in this survey are: 1) have you put up posters or reserved halls to hold rallies with a possible election in mind? 2) details of orders given by Diet members to their offices; 3) under which electoral system are you preparing, multiple-seat constituency, or single seat constituency systems? 4) likely schedule of the election; 5) in case of an election, under which electoral system will the election be conducted? With regard to the schedule of the election, one Diet member (Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], from the third district of Hokkaido) indicated his prediction that the election will be conducted "in July under the multiple-seat constituency system." However, an overwhelming majority of office staff said that they have not been "informed by Diet members that an election will be conducted in near future," (according to the office of a Japan New Party member from the 11th district of Tokyo). Since the possibility that the LDP will cooperate with the Social Democratic Party of Japan in submitting a no-confidence motion is diminishing, the prevailing view among Diet members throughout Japan is that "the prospect of dissolution has become remote." Thus, the level of tension in relation to a possible election appears to have subsided in comparison to a recent period. Concerning preparations for the election, a majority said they have been preparing for the "multiple-seat constituency" or both "single and multiple-seat constituency systems." It seems that the respondents have no other choice but to give priority to preparing for election under the multiple-seat constituency system because they must be ready for a possible Diet dissolution, and also because redistricting of single-seat constituencies has not been completed.
