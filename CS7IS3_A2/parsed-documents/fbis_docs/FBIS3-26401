Robert Lamb, the U.S. State Department special Cyprus coordinator, told a bicommunal press conference that he hoped the past week he had spent on the island would be "historic." He said "we have a unique opportunity. No one sees the CMBs as an end in themselves. There is obviously more work to do. The solution is still in front of us," but the package "can lay the foundation stones." U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali suggested last May a three-point peace plan, or confidence building measures. The measures, aimed at building trust between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, envisage the transfer of the Turkish- held fenced area of Famagusta to the U.N. Administration and reopening of the now defunct Nicosia International Airport. Both sides on the island now accept the U.N. plan but have strong reservation over it. Expressing his cautiousness, Lamb said, "The level of trust between the two sides is low, each side is skeptical about the other's commitment to the package." He added that the "party leaders in the Greek Cypriot side are more negative this time than on the Turkish Cypriot side which is different from when I was here four months ago." The message he sent to party leaders across the divided island was that "There may be things that you see are shortcomings, but this represents an opportunity." He described the package as "very positive and balanced." However, asked about the problems he encountered this week, he said, "Frankly I came up with fewer difficulties than I expected," both President Glavkos Kliridhis and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash showed willingness to discuss the package. Lamb said, "There's been agreement on the principles and what we have to do now is to go through a process of refining these principles so that each side understands exactly what the other side expects from them," Lamb said. On a timetable for the completion of the talks, the U.S. official said, "We don't want artificial deadlines ... [ellipses as received] We're not going to push either community to do something they are not comfortable with. On the other hand that's very different from delay," he said. Local press reports said today U.N. Secretary General Ghali is about to send a letter to the leaders of the two communities, asking them to start indirect talks here in Nicosia on the peace plan. The U.N.-sponsored peace talks, which have been on and off for nearly twenty years, have so far failed to yield any concrete results. The island country has been divided into two parts since 1974 when Turkish troops intervened in northern Cyprus, with the Turkish Cypriots in the north and Greek Cypriots in the south. The U.S. official is expected to leave the island today after one week's visit to the island.
