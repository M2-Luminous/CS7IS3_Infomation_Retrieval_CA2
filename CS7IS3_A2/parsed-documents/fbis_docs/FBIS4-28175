The composite stock price index, a yardstick of local stock prices, nose-dived more than 15 points in the morning session to 914, breaking the psychological mark of 920 points at the outset of the session, but the early losses were partially recouped in the afternoon session, thanks to bargain-hunting strength. The index fell 8.54 points to close at 921.72 yesterday. The stock market closed at 930.26 last week. During last week, the price index lost 15.02 points, which was equal to about 1.02 points, which was equal to about 1.02 percent drop in going market value of stocks listed on the exchange. Market analysts said the plunge in share prices for two consecutive days -- Saturday and yesterday -- was caused by investors' concern about the North Korean nuclear issue, which took a sharp turn for the worse when the United States, in coordination with Korea and Japan, moved to place sanctions against North Korea as Pyongyang has failed to abide by the IAEA's inspection procedures. The allies also weighed possible military options. Most investors, both institutional and individuals, remained on the sidelines with some investors resorting to panic selling. Such volume leaders as trading, banking and construction-related issues, which remained steady until Friday, lost ground as did other blue chip issues. Some telecommunications and oil-related issues, however, were actively traded in the morning session, thanks to enthusiasm in selective buying. Stock brokers said that share prices will likely remain depressed for the time being with possible technical fluctuations as long as tension on the Korean Peninsula remains unchanged.
