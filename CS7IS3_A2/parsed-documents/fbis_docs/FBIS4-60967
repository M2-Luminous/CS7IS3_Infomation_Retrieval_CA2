It states, in particular, that financial transactions between the CIS countries have become considerably more complex as a result of the introduction of national currencies. The Russian ruble is used as a single currency for many trade deals between states; the CIS countries look to Russia for loans to execute their transactions, thereby increasing the Russian budget deficit. The prime minister thinks that the way to ease financial difficulties lies in the broader use of national currencies, and also proposes setting up a collective currency for the CIS countries, in which it is proposed to carry out all transactions in a CIS interstate bank.
