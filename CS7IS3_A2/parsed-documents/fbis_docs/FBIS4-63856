Is that not a provocation vis-a-vis Kiev? [Meshkov] We are currently witnessing how the Ukrainian Government is trying to fan the conflict. The present leadership in Kiev is trying to hold on to power somehow. However, it lacks social support and is no longer in control of the situation. That is because its policies have failed in almost every respect. This particularly applies to the economy, and the situation is all the worse because a people that inhabits a state with enormous potential has been condemned to vegetate in poverty. [FOCUS] Your movement is accused of Russian nationalism, separatism, and even political adventurism.... [Meshkov] On the contrary, the aim of our policies is to protect the Crimea from nationalist excesses. [FOCUS] But the Crimean Tartars are afraid of your flirting with Moscow. How do you want to solve the Tartar question? [Meshkov] Crimean citizens of Tartar nationality were treated unjustly, and that has to be put right. Unfortunately, the Crimean Republic is not in a position to bear the financial cost of a just solution. However, I would like to stress that the present difficulties do not bear nationalist hallmarks. [FOCUS] President Kravchuk has not allowed you to change the security minister and the minister of internal affairs. Your power has thus been somewhat curtailed. [Meshkov] That illustrates the kind of conditions we are working under here. The Crimean security service should work to protect the Crimean Republic even if it is considered part of Ukraine. However, I have not even received a fraction of the information that it sends to Kiev. That is why I had to appoint a new minister. Kiev's machinations aimed at preventing that move must be considered very disturbing. [FOCUS] The defense ministers of Ukraine and Russia do not want you to take part in negotiations on the Black Sea Fleet. Did you feel snubbed? [Meshkov] Even if a president is ignored, the people that elected him will not allow itself to be ignored.
