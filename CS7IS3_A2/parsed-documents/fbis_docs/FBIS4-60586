Khan said here on Sunday that India's hegemonic aspirations can only spell trouble for smaller states in the region. Addressing student-officers of PN [Pakistan Navy] Staff College here, Admiral Saeed said India's interest in seeking naval cooperation with regional countries is aimed at allaying regional apprehension about its naval buildup on the one hand and isolating Pakistan in the region, on the other. India is also trying to portray China as an "external" adversary to justify its naval expansion, now that it has retracted its opposition to US presence, he said. The Naval Chief further said that Indian Navy is reportedly working on a programme for development of nuclear propulsion capability. Seen in the context of its nuclear capability and a comprehensive ballistic missiles programme this is ominous having profound and far-reaching implications for the entire region Admiral Saeed said. He said, with the stoppage of US aid in 1990, the Pakistan Navy received a major setback when three PNC Orion Aircraft, which had been cleared for release, were withheld. Later, the US also insisted on the return of eight warships on expiry of their lease, Admiral Saeed added. He further said, despite all difficulties the country was on way to building a fairly modern and balanced fleet of a reasonable size. Admiral Saeed said, the recently acquired type 21 Frigates after being updated, would adequately fill the gap created by the return of American ships. Pakistan Navy's submarines fitted with Harpoon Missiles can deliver powerful punch, but their numerical strength is below the required level. About mine hunters, the Admiral said, Pakistan Navy's deficiency in mine countermeasures capability has been made up by the purchase of three modern mine hunters. He said that in the present strategic scenario and in the face of continuing Indian naval expansion there is no choice but to consolidate our navy through self-reliance. He added, a long term programme has been placed before the government for building a series of surface ships at the Karachi Shipyard and Engineering Works (KSEW) in collaboration with a foreign Yard. Admiral Saeed said, this would be a major step forward which would also catalyses [as published] development in various industries in the country. The Naval Chief said that the next few years are going to be crucial and to tax all our resources-financial, material and personnel. He added, if managed and harnessed well these resources will give the country the much needed maritime defence capability. On his arrival earlier at the PN Staff College, Naval Chief Admiral Saeed M. Khan was received by the College Commandant, Commodore Serfraz Khan. Flag Officers and other senior naval officers were also present on the occasion.
