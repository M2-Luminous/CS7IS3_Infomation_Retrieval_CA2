Government officials calmed the provincial governor, confirming their support for his government actions and promising that they would seek a solution to the crisis as last night similar reports noted that top-level government circles were drawing up a decree on the intervention of the Tucuman congress. Official sources unofficially reported that Justicialist Party [PJ] provincial legislators have been urgently summoned to the federal capital to meet government officials within the next few hours at Government House to seek a "political solution" before implementing a federal solution. Ortega yesterday received the support of President Carlos Menem and that of his high-ranking government officials over the "worrisome" opposition to his actions by the Tucuman PJ deputies. Menem said: "We shall see what can be done, but the people have elected them to legislate and not to block the actions of those who are governing, as is happening in Tucuman." Strongly supporting Ortega, Menem challenged: "It seems the vice governor Julio Diaz Lozano very strongly opposes the governor."
