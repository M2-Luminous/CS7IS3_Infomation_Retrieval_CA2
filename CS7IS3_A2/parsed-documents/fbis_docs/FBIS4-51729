FBIS4-51729 "dreas085_c_94007" FBIS-EAS-94-085 Daily Report 3 May 1994 North Korea `Recent' Moves by Kim Yong-sam Denounced `Recent' Moves by Kim Yong-sam Denounced SK0305112694 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1105 GMT 3 May 94 SK0305112694 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["War Hysterics" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim Yong-sam Monday [2 May] summoned officials of the "Unification and Security Policy Coordinating Council," groundlessly vilified the North over fictitious "increase of military exercises" and "ordered" the entire puppet Armed Forces to take a "round- the-clock maximum alert posture," according to a radio report from Seoul. This is a step to mobilize the puppet Armed Forces in a war against the North any moment. This shows the puppets' plan to unleash a war against the North has reached a very dangerous stage. The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique's order to the puppet Defence Ministry came in the wake of U.S. Defense Secretary Perry's recent visit to South Korea during which he had military confabs to carry out new Operation Plan 5027, a war scenario against the North. It is clear what the order is aimed at. The fact eloquently proves that the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are the very ones driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war and their reckless new war provocation moves are a main factor of an unpredictable event. The outcry of the Kim Yong-sam clique over the "increase of military exercises in the North" is no more than a trick to mislead public opinion and justify its new war provocation moves. Lurking behind it is a sinister intention to lull the strong fighting spirit of the South Korean people for ousting the Kim Yong- sam puppet clique and divert their attention elsewhere. Facts show the Kim Yong-sam clique is a group of traitors who are indifferent to peace in the country and harmony of the nation and seek confrontation and war to place the nation on the altar of big powers at the instigation of outside forces.
