Among other things, the protocol will promote contacts and consultations between the two ministries in relation to the situations and perspectives in bilateral relations. The protocol establishes that the ministries will also hold consultations within the international organizations and forums on the current international questions of mutual interest. This document gives the possibility for an exchange of experts, organization of seminars, and joint researches, assistance in the cooperation between the archive services of the two countries, and so on. Macedonia and Russia agreed that the problems in the Balkans should be overcome only through negotiations. These should also provide the framework for the solution of the dispute between Macedonia and Greece. This was emphasized today in the discussions between the delegations of the Macedonian Foreign Ministry and the Russian Federation Foreign Ministry. The delegations were headed by Victor Gaber, under secretary in the Macedonian Foreign Ministry, and Vitaliy Churkin, deputy foreign minister of the Russian Federation. In the discussions the Macedonian delegation pointed out that neither threats, preconditions, nor any kind of restriction can serve as a basis for negotiations, and it welcomed Russia's prompt efforts to create a suitable climate for the solution of the open questions in the region. When asked about the meeting of the two delegations and about Russia's silence in relation to the Greek blockade, Vitaliy Churkin stated the following: "We discussed the Balkans, our bilateral relations, and what more we could do for their promotion. We also discussed the problems you asked about. We must underline that we very actively observe everything that takes place, and not only observe, but also act the way I think is fair and efficient in the given situation." Political consultations between the two delegations on bilateral relations were also viewed, and were evaluated as very good. In so doing, latent possibilities were emphasized, particularly those on the economic and cultural plane, arising from the transitional period that both countries are in, as well as the promotion of commercial and economic relations on the level of the needs and possibilities of both countries. Plans were also made to regulate relations by reviewing the current ones and then signing new interstate agreements in the economic, health, social, and other fields of cooperation. Moreover, last night in the Macedonian Embassy in Moscow, Victor Gaber met a group of Macedonian businessmen living and working in Russia. On that occasion they exchanged opinions on the present situation in the Republic of Macedonia and the problems facing the Macedonians working in Russia.
