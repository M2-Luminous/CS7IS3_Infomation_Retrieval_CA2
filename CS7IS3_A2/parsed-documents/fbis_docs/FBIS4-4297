These bonds have ensured the supply of funds urgently needed by some enterprises to expand their scale of production and to renew their equipment and to open up a new money-lending channel for enterprises. However, along with the fact that the bonds of some enterprises have become due one after another, the cases of being unable to cash the bonds have emerged time and again. It is learned that the bonds of enterprises that became due last year are being cashed in a rapid manner through the consultation of enterprises, local financial departments, and bond issuing departments. However, the outlook for cashing this year's bonds is not optimistic. Last year, the province issued 20-odd kinds of local enterprise bonds, and most of them were of the one-year short-term bonds. Therefore, enterprises' task of repaying debts was very arduous. According to the analysis of the bonds of 52 enterprises issued by the provincial industrial and commercial bank on a commission basis, two thirds of enterprise bonds will be unable to be cashed when they become due. There are many reasons for the failure in cashing enterprise bonds, such as the poor management of enterprises, the slow selling of products, the delayed completion and commission of projects, the slow turnover of funds, and so on. Meanwhile, the weakness in the linkage between bond issuance and bond management also constitutes a major reason for the failure in cashing bonds. Enterprises should assume responsibility for investors. Motivated by the principle of being responsible for investors and adhering to the promise made before the issuance of bonds, enterprises, as bond issuers and debt holders, should make best use of the hard-won funds to accelerate the completion of projects and increase economic returns in order to ensure that the capital and interest of bonds will be cashed by the scheduled time. Banks and other bond issuance agencies should strengthen supervision over and management of bonds. At present, some bond issuance agencies in the province are careless in checking the asset credit of enterprises before their bonds are issued and take a laissez-faire attitude after the issuance of bonds. Some enterprises use these funds to repay their own debts or divert these funds for other purposes, instead of using them to renew equipment as promised before the issuance of bonds. At the moment, there is not a single organ in the province that manages bonds in a unified manner. Stock dealers, banks, financial departments, and pertinent departments of local governments should form a joint force to strengthen the dynamics of bond management in order to ensure that the bonds issued by enterprises will be cashed on schedule. On the occasion that many financial institutions are going hither and thither to resolve the problem of being unable to cash bonds, the bonds of Daqing Lianyi Chemical Industrial Plant and Nanguang Zhiye Corporation issued by the Heilongjiang branch of Guangda Bank on a commission basis have been cashed by the scheduled time. This bank's strict management of bond issuance has given us the following enlightenment. First, before the bonds are issued, a bank should conduct a strict examination of the asset credit of enterprises, as well as the managerial efficiency, project feasibility, leading bodies, and development prospects of enterprises, and an enterprise should not be allowed to issue bonds unless its bond repayment rate reaches 20 percent or higher. Second, after the bonds are issued, credit personnel should be dispatched to learn how these funds are used and how the projects are being built in order to ensure the appropriate use of these funds. Banks and enterprises should report situations to each other frequently, and banks should supervise and urge enterprises to get prepared for transferring the funds for repaying the bonds 10 days before the expiration of bonds. Relevant persons offered the following several countermeasures for resolving the failure in cashing bonds: First, for the enterprises whose efficiency is relatively good but whose funds cannot be circulated for a short while, bond issuing agencies should pay the bonds for them and the enterprises should repay the agencies. Or, new bonds can be issued to pay the old bonds. Second, those enterprises that are really unable to repay their bonds should declare bankruptcy to repay the debts.
