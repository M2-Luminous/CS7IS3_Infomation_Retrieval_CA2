FR940930-0-00191 FR940930-0-00028 (ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in California shall calculate annual required sales share based on projected California sales for the model year in question. In the second year, the manufacturer shall use actual sales from the previous year. In the third year and subsequent years, the manufacturer will use sales from two model years prior to the year in question. (d) (1) Small volume manufacturer is defined in the Pilot program as one whose average annual LDV and LDT sales in California are less than or equal to 3,000 units during a consecutive three-year period beginning no earlier than model year 1993. (i) A manufacturer with less than three consecutive years of sales in California shall use a single year of sales or, if available, the average of two years of sales in California to determine whether they fall at or below the threshold of 3,000 units. (ii) A manufacturer certifying for the first time in California shall be considered a small volume manufacturer if their projected California sales level is at or below 3,000 units for a given year. Once the manufacturer has actual sales data for one year, this actual sales data shall be used to determine whether the manufacturer qualifies as a small volume manufacturer. (iii) A manufacturer which does not qualify as a small volume manufacturer in model year 1996 but whose average annual LDV and LDT sales fall to or below the 3,000 unit threshold between 1996 and 2001 shall be treated as a small volume manufacturer and shall be subject to requirements for small volume manufacturers as specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section beginning with the next model year. (2) A manufacturer which qualifies as a small volume manufacturer prior to model year 2001 is not required to comply with the sales requirements of this section until model year 2001.
