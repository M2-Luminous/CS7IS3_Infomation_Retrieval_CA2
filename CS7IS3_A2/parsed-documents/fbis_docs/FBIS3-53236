FBIS3-53236 "drnes008_n_94001" FBIS-NES-94-008 Document Type:Daily Report 12 Jan 1994 LEBANON Defense Minister on South, Syrian Troops NC1101183394 Beirut Radio Lebanon in Arabic 1630 GMT 11 Jan 94 NC1101183394 Beirut Radio Lebanon Language: Arabic Article Type:BFN [Text] Defense Minister Muhsin Dallul says the problem with Israel is political, not security, and that no security committee will be worthwhile if the political issue--namely occupation--is not resolved. He pledged that the Army will assume responsibility for security in the south after the occupation has been ended, and that there will be no weapons in the south other than those of the Army. The minister, who was talking to the dean of editors Milhim Karam, said any linkage between the Syrian presence in Lebanon and the Israeli occupation of Lebanese territory is treason. He explained that the Syrian presence is requested by the government for pressing needs related to the reunification of Lebanon. He said the Army's main mission is to take charge of security in the south and ensure that no armed force other than the legitimate forces will be present there. The defense minister categorically denied the possibility of incorporating agent Lahd militias [South Lebanese Army] into the Lebanese Army. This matter exclusively concerns Lebanese authority, he said. Dallul said the Army must always reflect the country's pride and might. He said the Army is obtaining weapons to defend the country and serve the citizens and their security. He pointed out that Army roadblocks are established only for security reasons, not political ones. On the security situation in the country, Minister Dallul stressed that no one can prevent the judiciary from opening any file. He expected the security agencies to complete the investigations on the bombing of the Phalangist Party headquarters very soon. He praised improvements in the security services and the military establishment. Dallul described the upcoming Syrian-U.S. summit as historic and decisive for the region's crisis, especially Israel's occupation of Syrian and Lebanese territory. He expected the summit to result in major progress in the negotiations and relations with the West, notably the United States.
