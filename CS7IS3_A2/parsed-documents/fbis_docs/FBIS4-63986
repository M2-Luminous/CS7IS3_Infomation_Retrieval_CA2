But a number of essential problems must be solved for the further development of bilateral economic relations, the minister noted. For example, the transportation backup for Russian-Chinese trade remains an acute problem. Owing to the absence of real possibilities for freight transportation, 25-30 percent of contracts do not come to fruition. Therefore, the expansion of the capacity of existing border crossings and the opening of new ones is necessary, as are the more active use of transit routes through Mongolia and Kazakhstan, the creation of joint transportation and transport construction companies, and the more active introduction of container transport. In the minister's opinion, there is an increasingly urgent need for a partial revision of the terms of settlements under the 10 July 1985 intergovernmental agreement on economic and technical cooperation in the building and modernization of industrial facilities in the PRC. At the present time the clearing system of settlements under this agreement has lost its advantages and has effectively been reduced to interstate barter. At the same time the interests of Russian organizations have been significantly damaged as a result of the adoption by the Chinese side of a so-called "clearing" exchange rate of the Swiss franc [SFr] against the yuan (artificially lowered, according to the estimates of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations, by 23-24 percent) and the restriction on the range of Chinese companies supplying barter [vstrechnyye] goods in Russia. Oleg Davydov cited the problem of paying off loans granted by China to the former USSR as one question which has been "left hanging." The problem of the former USSR's debt to China on clearing transactions (around SFr808 million) and on the two state loans given in 1990-1991 to purchase consumer goods and food totalling SFr1.5 billion must be finally settled. The question of China's debts to the former USSR -- around SFr66 million provided for the construction of the Wusu-Alashanhou highway -- also needs to be resolved.
