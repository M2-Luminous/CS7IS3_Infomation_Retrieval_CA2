Levin: ``Three Quarters of a Century Later: Kaskad NPO and Siemens Resurrect Cooperation''] [Text] Who would have thought that one of the world's largest ``electronics'' firms today--Germany's Siemens--was the forefather of the recently still supersecret Kaskad NPO [Scientific-Production Association], which served for a long time as the center for design of Soviet missile and space systems and communications technology? Of course, the roots of this story go back into the middle of the last century, when the young engineers Karl Siemens and Johann Halske founded the Main Telegraph Shop in Russia. In those distant years, the Siemens-Halske Trading House did many useful things for the Russian state--it laid the world's first telegraph cable line between St. Petersburg and Kronstadt, linked practically all of the country's major cities by telegraph, and during the Crimean War of 1883-1856 it extended a telegraph line from Moscow to Odessa, and from there to Sevastopol, an object of fierce fighting. The list of interesting facts connected with the activity of Siemens and Halske in Russia also contains this: The first telephone conversation between St. Petersburg and Malaya Vishera occurred in November 1879 using telephone instruments equipped with a signaling whistle, designed by these two German inventors. Things began to go downhill for the Main Telegraph Shop Joint-Stock Company in October 1917. Two years after the revolution the joint-stock company was nationalized, the Germans were run out, and a new name appeared on the sign--Elektrotest, RSFSR Supreme Council of the National Economy, which the enterprise possessed until its renaming in 1977 as the Kaskad NPO. Work proceeded in the association under strict secrecy: This is where they designed, introduced and serviced strategic missile systems of all generations and powerful antimissile and antispace systems, and created modern computer equipment, communications apparatus and all kinds of other ``smart'' electronics. They say, by the way, that the NPO retained the traditions of Siemens, inasmuch as it always had construction and installation subdivisions occupied in the manufacture, assembly and adjustment of telecommunications systems. Conversion opened the road to searching for new forms of activity, and to cooperation with foreign firms. It was then that the ``fathers'' of Kaskad remembered their German ``relative'' and decided to restore the old contacts. Thus last year the Agreement on Providing Agency Services and on Wholesale Trade was signed between the Kaskad NPO and Siemens, while just this January a department for the sales and service of Hicom institutional automatic telephone exchanges made by Siemens appeared in the NPO. This was all communicated at a press conference held in June in Moscow's President Hotel by executives of Kaskad, the RF Ministry of Communications and Siemens. From this day forward, in addition to maintaining its ``classical'' profile, the NPO will acquire a new one--it will become the official representative of Siemens in Russia, and it will introduce Hicom-100 communications equipment--small institutional automatic telephone exchanges with a capacity of up to 64 numbers--into our communication networks. It will also introduced Hicom-300 digital institutional exchanges, which make up a modern TsSIS [not further identified] system making it possible to transmit speech, data, facsimile and teletype information, and are intended to connect from 30 to 10,000 subscribers. All of these exchanges are adapted to our networks, and are certified by the RF Ministry of Communications. Kaskad has already received more than 50 orders to install Hicom systems, including from the communications departments of presidential and government organizations, enterprises of aviation and automotive industry, and a number of joint firms and commercial organizations. In order to make development of the new market more effective, to raise competitiveness and to pursue a coordinated investment and technical policy, the association established an international joint-stock company of the same name. Many who were present at the press conference wondered if ``invasion'' of Kaskad by Siemens might damage our defense, in behalf of which the NPO is still successfully working. Resolutely rejecting this possibility, Russian Minister of Communications V. B. Bulgak assured those present that such cooperation will bring nothing but benefit. And when he went into some generalities on the topic of imports of communications equipment in the recent past, today and in the future, the minister presented a number of interesting figures. As it turns out, prior to the 1990s 65 percent of all automatic telephone exchanges and 30 percent of cables laid in the USSR were foreign-made, particularly in CEMA countries and Yugoslavia. Just in the last 10 years 1,140 exchanges were acquired from the former Yugoslavia. Today, Russia still continues to purchase 45 percent of its communications equipment on the basis of international credit, although according to V. B. Bulgak the situation will change in a year or a year and a half. Joint ventures established in our country during this time will gear up their work to full capacity, and things that had been acquired before from across the border will be produced for the most part in Russia. All right then, if Siemens EWSD automatic telephone exchanges are already being set up in Kiev, why not organize production of the same Hicom exchanges in Moscow, let's say, with the participation of Kaskad? Well, while such an idea is only food for thought, Kaskad and Siemens are beginning to work together once again, like in the times of the Telegraph Shop.
