They warned their brothers in the camp of the consequences of being dragged into this war, which the adventurers want to use to defend their flimsy, collapsing rule. Hundreds of 2d Armored Brigade soldiers surrendered, and announced they were joining the ranks of the people defending unity and democracy. The camp was seized after a small remnant of fighters fled. These persons had pledged themselves to evil, and to defending the regime of the military family ruling in Sanaa. During the attack on the camp, appeals were made to the fighters and citizens to preserve the lives of their brothers, and to preserve the those possessions of the 2d Brigade which were left in the camp after its members had fled. All these possessions are now with the Yemeni Armed Forces. After entering and touring the camp, the fighters and citizens were surprised by the fortified defenses set up by the brigade, in accordance with instructions from the military family ruling in Sanaa, which displayed the absolutely divisive mentality with which it views Yemeni unity. The family was under the illusion that the brigade and its fighters were in a hostile zone. This exposes the premeditated intentions for war this tyrannical gang held. Had it not been hostile intentions which motivated them, simple defenses would have been sufficient in a permanent military zone -- like the ones set up by units transferred from Aden to Sanaa. Immediate instructions were issued by the Defense Ministry following the storming of the camp, which called on the soldiers and citizens to preserve the lives of their fighting brothers, and to reassure those who had fled to the mountains that they were in their homeland and among their brothers. All military efforts should be directed against the hearts of the al-Ahmar gang and its clique.
