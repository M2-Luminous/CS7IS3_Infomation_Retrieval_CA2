In addition to the loans provided by the rural credit cooperatives across the country, the agricultural sector is expected to get over 35 billion yuan in loans for the whole of 1994. This means a jump of about 45 percent from last year's level of 23.8 billion yuan. According to ABC's president Ma Yongwei, the bank will be split into two banks: the Agricultural Development Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China. The former will be responsible for policy-related lendings which will ensure the state purchase of grain, cotton and oil seed and channel poverty-relieving funds to most needy areas. Free from the policy-related business, the Agricultural Bank of China will begin to operate in the way of a commercial bank. At present the bank as well as the country's banking authorities are working at top speed defining the range that policy directives will cover and the differing capital fund management for the two banks, noted Ma. He said the policy-oriented bank would be established in the first half of this year, before the summer harvest begins. This year, the People's Bank of China, The Central Bank, will stick to the credit quota system to ensure control of total bank lending. The ABC president stressed that ABC branch banks would not breach the quotas set by the bank authorities.
