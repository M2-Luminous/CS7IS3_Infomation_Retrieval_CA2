Yesterday, the parties were able to agree on two of the five points left to be discussed under national reconciliation. They deal with the reinstatement of territorial administration and the return of buildings owned by both sides. Today, the parties are discussing another point -- social communications -- particularly the future of the opposition radio, the Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel. Thus, only two points remain to be discussed -- the role of UNITA deputies and UNITA's participation in the country's government both at central and local levels. Asked to comment on the talks today, UNITA Information Secretary Dr. Jorge Valentim said peace for Angola is something that must be achieved at all cost.
