After opening an exhibition of prison agency products last night, he said that Egypt is an advanced state with an ancient civilization and respects human rights within the framework of legitimacy and law. He noted that respect for human rights is being taught at the Police Academy and at police institutions. He pointed out that some hardened inmates inflict injuries and say they were caused by police for revenge and then claim afterward that they were tortured. The minister of interior affirmed the security forces' eagerness to respect human rights and said police victims outnumbered those of the terrorists during confrontations. Answering a question on the new security strategy in light of the Arab interior ministers conference held in Tunis recently, he said there is a general agreement on views on security because crimes of violence and terrorism are now a phenomenon not only in Arab countries but in the world. The minister of interior said work is continuously developing to curb crime and arrest criminals by modernizing agencies and training personnel.
