Scekic: "Welcome Confederation"] [Text] Zagreb -- "The Social Democratic Party of Croatia generally approves of the agreement between Granic and Silajdzic reached in Washington, but it must note that the present nature of the agreement is contrary to official Croatian policies as they have been to this day. Thus it appears to have been imposed from the outside." That statement was made last Friday at a press conference by Antun Vujic, president of the party. Commenting on the agreement, Vujic said that it is almost identical to the policies of his party in relation to Bosnia and Herzegovina because the Social Democratic Party of Croatia was always in favor of recognizing the states formed on the territory of the former Yugoslavia and the borders between them. As far as the future confederation of Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that may eventually happen, the party leader stressed that it is welcome as an expression of political, geographic, and economic interests, but it must be founded on the principle of strict preservation of the sovereignty and individuality of the two states because too many sacrifices have been made, and Croatian sovereignty will not be lost easily. However, the possible confederation must not have any connection with the confederation of Croatia, because the future of the UNPA zones can not be resolved in the same package. "The international community must clearly state what obligations it has toward the integration of the so-called Krajina with Croatia," Vujic said. The merger of SDP (Social Democratic Party) and SDH (Social Democratic Party of Croatia) was also discussed at the press conference. Vujic pointed out that the merger provides the possibility of securing a new political area, and it will create a strong left on the Croatian political scene, which is very much needed.
