Supporters of the government coalition's bill said the Council had sought to take over the running the channel whereas it was meant only to ensure its objectivity. The government was also concerned at the Council's pro-Meciar bias and preferred all parliamentary parties to be represented in it. The opposition decried the bill as an infringement of democracy and a purge. The motion was passed only in a repeat vote because in the first attempt deputies had left a number of voting papers invalid. Today's edition of the trade union daily PRACA commented that the present coalition would be interested in voting "its people" onto the Television Council because transmission times for party political broadcasts are at stake before the general elections, to be held September 30-October 1.
