This was reported in an INTERFAX interview on Thursday by Eduard Khashkayev, a member of the Chechnya cabinet. In Khashkayev's opinion, the October events in Moscow resulted from "a whole series of unlawful actions committed by the Russian leadership, which was opposed by Ruslan Khasbulatov, who strictly complied with all the provisions of the then Russian Federation Constitution." Chechen State Counselor Ruslan Akhtakhanov, who took part in the conversation with the INTERFAX correspondent, stated that denying Ruslan Khasbulatov, who is a citizen of Chechnya, the opportunity to run for election to the Russian Federation Federal Assembly is regarded by the republic's population as another violation of human rights by Moscow officialdom.
