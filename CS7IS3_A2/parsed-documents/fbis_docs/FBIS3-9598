In the course of the meeting, Izetbegovic and Mesic spent a long time discussing the most topical issues concerning relations between the two countries. The Croatian delegation -- currently visiting Sarajevo on the invitation of Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic, and for the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session -- comprises representatives of several parliamentary parties. In addition to Stipe Mesic, Damir Zoric, deputy chairman of the Croatian Parliament's House of Districts [Zupanijski dom], and deputies in the Croatian Parliament's House of Representatives [Zastupnicki dom] Muhamed Zulic, Pavao Tomislav Duka, and Josip Pankretic are present. After the meeting and talks in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, Stipe Mesic, chairman of the Croatian Parliament, and Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, gave the following statements to the many domestic and foreign correspondents. [Begin Mesic recording] The Croatian delegation -- or to put it more precisely -- the delegation of the Croatian Parliament has come to attend the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly session. We come as friends. This is a historical moment which reflects the survival of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the only guarantee of peace in Europe and the world. The world is returning to its principles -- the principles of the inviolability of borders -- and this moment and the events in the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly are effective confirmation of these principles. If the borders were to be changed by force, new aggressors would appear tomorrow. Why should the Serbs alone have the privilege of living in one state and in the name of this be allowed to take other peoples' territories? There would be others who would demand this privilege, and then the world would no longer stand a chance. Therefore, the return to these principles is a guarantee of peace, and I believe that we are now much closer to peace than we were earlier because the world has realized that this is no longer about Bosniak Muslims, Croats, or Serbs. This is about European and world peace. That is why they are now solving this as their problem and not our problem. [end recording] [Begin Izetbegovic recording] [Words indistinct] Mr. Mesic who is well-known as a friend of Bosnia-Herzegovina, [words indistinct]. I remember him from our meetings in Belgrade, where he always came up with a constructive position regarding Bosnia- Herzegovina. We, of course, discussed relations between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the essential thing I can accentuate is [word indistinct] that the maintenance of a unitary Bosnia- Herzegovina is not only in the interest of Bosnia-Herzegovina but also in Croatia's interest. Mr. Mesic (?wholeheartedly) confirmed this in the course of our discussion. Of course, the talks will continue with the delegation of the (?Croatian) Parliament. We were very glad to see that the Croatian delegation is a multiparty delegation. (?We have) the representatives of (?three) parties here. [Words indistinct] and we talked about opening a Croatian embassy here in Sarajevo. [end recording]
