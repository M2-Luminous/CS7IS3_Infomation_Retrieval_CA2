Thirty American companies have set up representative offices in Hanoi and waiting for permission to operate. The spokeswoman of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Ms. Ho The Lan said she welcomed the lifting of the embargo against Vietnam by U.S. President Clinton on Friday 4th February as rumors said. Answering questions by correspondents of Reuter, KYODO, and of Australia at the regular press conference in Hanoi on Thursday, Ms. Ho The Lan said: The abovesaid event is suitable with the reality, aspirations of peoples of the two countries, and the world community, and is awaited by public opinions in recent days.

Ms. Ho The Lan pointed out that this would be a necessary step on the road to broaden contact towards the normalization of relations between the two countries. [Hong Kong AFP in English at 0934 GMT on 3 Feb in a similar Hanoi-datelined report adds: "But Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan did not welcome a State Department report criticizing Vietnam's human rights record, telling a regular press briefing that the report was `not objective.' "`I will applaud if President (Bill) Clinton decides to lift the embargo,' Lan said. `It will be good not only for Vietnam and the United States, but for the whole international community.' "`We always welcome companies of the US and other countries to invest and do business in Vietnam on the basis of equality and mutual benefit,' Lan said. "In another sign of progress toward normal relations, Lan said a US-Vietnamese meeting to discuss the restitution of assets seized by the two sides at the end of the war had been tentatively scheduled for February 15-16 in Hanoi. "`Washington and Hanoi still appear to remain far apart on human rights, however, with Lan making clear that Vietnam considered the issue its own business. Despite untold difficulties, the Vietnamese government has made great efforts in better facilitating citizens to better exercise their economic, social and cultural rights as well as civil and political rights,' she said. "`Against the background of such efforts, the annual report by the State Department issued February 1 is not objective.'"]
