In an article contributed by Dr. Safa' Salih al-'Umar, member of the National Assembly and chairman of the Arab and International Relations Committee of the Assembly, the paper adds that this has been manifested in the political and economic positions of several states that are currently attempting to clearly reformulate their positions toward several hot issues on the international scene. AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party, notes that the Iraqi people's harsh daily sufferings under the sanctions, as well as the immense sacrifices they have made during the 30-state aggression, along with the intense efforts made by Iraqis and some Arab and international parties, have all contributed toward explaining this suffering and mobilizing opposition to the continued enforcement of the sanctions within popular and official quarters. The paper argues that the financial losses several states and peoples have sustained due to the political and economic instability in the region, which is directly linked to the stability of Iraq and its regional economic, political, and security role, were also instrumental in effecting this change on the international scene. AL-THAWRAH notes that the Iraqi people's suffering has been accompanied by heroic steadfastness in the face of all aspects of the aggression, be they political, military, informational, or psychological. The Iraqi people have persisted in this steadfastness in extremely harsh circumstances, something which prompted several Western political policymakers to reconsider the usefulness of this unfair position toward the Iraqi people, as well as its potential harm for the region and their countries' interests. The paper goes on to say: The Western political policymakers have continued their efforts to maintain and foster the state of imbalance in the Arab region-- as state of insecurity and instability. Sometimes, the West uses this tactic to quietly create footholds in the region. At other times, it enters the region militarily through exaggerated publicity to maintain this imbalance by various means, such as the fuelling of local or regional wars. AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying that the objective that lies before us at present should not be confined to lifting the sanctions. We should also be able to define our positions in the post-sanctions era toward a host of national and humanitarian issues related to our progressive policy in line with the factors that we have mentioned, and in the context of the network of Arab and international relations created by changes on the Arab and international scene, changes that Iraq and its people have been experiencing over the past 10 years.
