Good morning to you. [Miller] Good morning to you, and to you, Ladies and Gentlemen. [Woyciechowski] Are you afraid of strikes? [Miller, hesitating] Naturally, a strike is not a pleasant thing to happen, and my assessment is that there are certainly reasons to have these protests and this turmoil. I reject the notion of a double-face morality which is about the fact that in the previous term Sejm, when we were in the opposition, we thought for instance that the protests by the All-Polish Trade Unions Agreement [OPZZ] were justified, whereas today, under the type of moral standards I mentioned, I would have to say that the protests by Solidarity are unjustified. The fact is though that these protests are indeed justified since the situation of many thousands of Polish families is difficult without a doubt, and in many cases it is even outright tragic. And when I hear, or read on lists of demands, that [hesitating] unemployment must be reduced, then of course I agree with that proposition, except I would like to remind you that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet that caused this unemployment of 3 million people. And when I read for instance that retirement pensions and other kinds of pensions must be raised, then I agree with that, as well, except that it is not Waldemar Pawlak's cabinet that reduced the so-called fundamental amount from 100 percent to 91 percent. I could go on and on like this, citing similar examples. So, it would be hard to expect that after three months of the government's term, these painful problems will be immediately resolved as if by some magical trick. So while agreeing that there are indeed reasons for the protests, I disagree with the way there problems are being resolved--that is to say, we are proposing negotiations, peaceful talks regarding specific measures, and we are proposing to leave protests and strikes as a last resort, not as the first one. [Woyciechowski] What is the story with the negotiations? Solidarity keeps accusing you, saying that it wants to negotiate while the government refuses to do so. Recently, the miners' Solidarity said that if the government does not begin negotiations by 7 March, then the miners will go on strike. So who wants to negotiate and who does not? [Miller] You know, at the same time as these statements are [hesitating] being conveyed to the public, six working groups including 17 trade union centers, two employer organizations, and also representatives of territorial self-governments, are negotiating with each other on the topic of citizens' social rights, I mean citizens' social guarantees. On some of these issues, agreement has already been reached--for instance, regarding the directions of amendments to [hesitating] the family-benefits system. Yesterday, a very interesting idea emerged, to initiate work on a law on family benefits--the idea is to accumulate all benefits for children and families in just one legal document. Of course this will have to be done by modernizing the law. In my view, that is the way to solve the many problems of Polish families. With regard to the accusation of not negotiating, [Industry and Trade] Minister Pol conducts many different kinds of negotiations every single day. I think that.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] But who should be involved in the negotiations: the industry minister, or the labor minister? [Miller] Exactly. I think that the industry minister should definitely negotiate these issues. But you know, I think the essence of the misunderstanding is that many trade union activists seem to think that ministers continue to be the right partners for negotiations, and not the president of a company or the manager of an enterprise. Well, this is no longer 1989, and even less is it 1980. Deep changes have occurred in the Polish economy since then. Fortunately, these changes were geared toward decentralization. That is why ever fewer decisions are up to Minister Pol for instance, and more and more decisions are up to the president of a company, the manager of an enterprise, or to managers or chairmen of economic units. [Woyciechowski] Does it mean Minister Pol is not empowered to decide on salary hikes for miners, but the decision has to be made by the mine's manager? [Miller] That is the way it is, more or less. [Woyciechowski] And are you empowered to make a decision on a raise for anybody, I mean you, the labor minister? [Miller] I am not, because what I deal with professionally is [hesitating] lessening the pain of the systemwide and economic transformations, but my main concern is assistance to the very poorest and protection to those who are suffering the most. But my feeling is that within these requests for talks and negotiations, or within the demands being made, there is a kind of, you know, a nostalgic tone .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Do you mean it is a nostalgia for communism? [Miller] Not so much for communism as for measures that are characteristic of a centralized economic system, where there is just one manager--this could be for instance the industry minister--who is in charge of thousands of different kinds of companies and who makes the most important decisions, along with the chief of the Planning Commission. But in reality, we have thousands of managers in Poland right now who have to make their decisions based on the state of their individual units. [Woyciechowski] What you just said was a tribute to capitalism. [Miller, hesitating] I am not sure whether it is capitalism. It was rather a tribute to a certain way of managing the economy. You know, my view is that .... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Tell me, three months passed since you took up the post of labor minister, and, during the three months, you never met face-to-face with [Solidarity Chairman] Krzaklewski. Was it him or you that did not want to meet? [Miller] I did meet with him. We even had a live television debate recently; we debated for half an hour. We meet with many representatives of Solidarity. Yesterday, for instance--I think this is worth putting on record--a very important event took place, namely the prime minister awarded [hesitating] the official appointments to new members of a trilateral commission for social and economic affairs. As the name itself indicates, this trilateral commission consists of employers, trade unions, and government representatives. Within the trade union group--let us say it this way--there are four Solidarity representatives who received appointments yesterday. You know, the reason I am stressing this fact is because for the first time in these transformation achievements of ours, a trilateral commission was established officially and on the basis of a resolution by the government. By the way, I must also praise here the negotiators involved in the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises, since the commission was set up kind of as a result of the Agreement on State-Owned Enterprises--and that trilateral commission consists of representatives of employers, trade unions, and the government. The commission has quite considerable powers regarding issuing opinions and it will gather at a single table representatives of different trade unions and also representatives whose social and economic interests vary so much. So that commission will be an area for coming to an agreement regarding very significant decisions--against the background of what is happening in Poland today, that fact is important to the extent that it is proof of the direction of seeking social peace. [Woyciechowski] But let us return for a moment to the strikes: Is it your impression today--now that Solidarity initiated a wide-scale strike operation, today the miners in Rybnik will be on strike for two hours--is it your impression that these strikes are politically motivated, that is to say that they are being conducted against the cabinet? [Miller, hesitating] You know, I try not to deal with such easy-sounding suspicions or descriptions. I always try to answer the question of whether there are economic, social, and standard-of-living related reasons. So in this case, my answer is: Yes, there are reasons. So to a large extent, these protests and strikes are a result of these social reasons. But judging from the nature of some demands being made, one can kind of conclude that these strikes are political in nature. [Woyciechowski] But if there are economic reasons, then why is it that Solidarity is on strike but OPZZ is not? [Miller] Because that is exactly the issue of the choice of [hesitating] the way to resolve these economic hardships: Either at a negotiating table where we would draft new laws or improve the existing ones, or else by protests and by using primarily emotions. And since you asked me about this, I will tell you honestly--I think these protests and strikes are undoubtedly a response to the existing reality, but they do not change that reality. [Woyciechowski] Are they a reaction to the reality or to the leftist government? [Miller] Well, a reaction to the reality understood mainly as the material situation of large social groups; also, partially, a reaction to the leftist government. However, I think that the reality changes at negotiation tables. In a centralized economy, in an economy that you have called communist, there was one partner on one side, and another partner on the other. Now there are many partners. There are many interests as well. Therefore, the only reasonable thing to do in such situations are negotiations during which the participants want to find more or less common points of view. [Woyciechowski] Recently, a few days ago, President Walesa declared that he would soon start the process of file-checking and decommunization. Do you fear that the president will decommunize you? [Miller, laughs] Well, our president says various things. Sometimes they border on a kind of a black humor. Poles have managed to get used to this; some get irritated, look at their wristwatches, and look forward to the end of this term of office; others are delighted. I would personally compare the president's recent statements to some kind of a black humor. You know, it is difficult to say that I am delighted with Mr. Kaczynski, for instance. He is not one of my favorite politicians. However, when Mr. Kaczynski says that if the president wants to start decommunization and file-checking, he should begin with his own office, then I must say that I really liked this statement by Mr. Kaczynski. [Woyciechowski] Did you get the impression that the president declared war on the Democratic Left Alliance [SLD]? Can this be defined in such terms? [Miller] We could hear such overtones. He will not come to the parliament, he rejects the possibility of cooperation, and so on and so forth. However, the president often changes his mind and we should wait; perhaps in a week or two, when the emotions are not so high, the president will say something reconciliatory. Well, many words were spoken unnecessarily. Incidentally, I think that nothing much would have happened if the Sejm had forwarded the constitution bill.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What did you vote for? [Miller] Unfortunately, I was not there when the ballot was held.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] What if you had been there? [Miller] I would have voted for forwarding the bill to the committees. You know, I remember something that happened in the previous Sejm. The SLD Deputies' Club tried to place on the Sejm agenda an initiative that was very important from our point of view; it was the passing of the Socioeconomic Charter. It was supposed to be kind of a supplement to the Constitution, a supplement concerning social issues, related to the living standard. At that time our initiative was rejected in the first reading. It was obviously rejected for political reasons. We felt really bad about; we felt like people who were.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] I remember that moment. However, now this Sejm actually did a very similar thing. [Miller] And they were slapped hard in the face. Now, unfortunately, the situation was similar. Therefore, I try not to forget the bad feeling we felt to prevent other people from feeling the same way. Thus, I do not think that something bad would have happened if this draft constitution had been forwarded to Sejm committees. However, we must make up our minds to it; what is done cannot be undone. Now we should not escalate this conflict. [Woyciechowski] Today's press has published the results of an opinion poll conducted by the Public Opinion Research Center. Poles were asked who is their best candidate for the post of the president. You must have seen these results. Kwasniewski comes first, with 17 percent; far behind him is Pawlak, with 11 percent; Lech Walesa has 9 percent. Is Kwasniewski the best candidate of SLD for the post of the president? [Miller] He definitely is the best candidate and I am really glad that Olek [diminutive of Aleksander] occupies such a position. You know, I have known Mr. Kwasniewski for many years. I must admit that I do not know a better expert in resolving conflict situations; I do not know anyone who has greater abilities as far as reconciliating various views is concerned. Now, if we add his brilliance and intelligence to that, then it becomes clear that he is our best candidate for that post. [Woyciechowski] Of course, what I wanted to ask you about... [Woyciechowski pauses] You understood the allusion. What about the rumors that within SLD there are other candidates for the post of the president as well? Is there a conflict there? The name of Cimoszewicz is often mentioned. Is it merely a gossip or not? [Miller] You know, SLD is very rich in outstanding persons. There is no doubt about that. However, among those outstanding figures, the star of Kwasniewski is shining the brightest. [Woyciechowski] Do you already know the name of the future deputy prime minister and finance minister? [Miller] No, unfortunately I do not. [Woyciechowski] What about the names of the candidates? [Miller] I know several candidates, at least. I have heard various names. However, due to the fact that Mr. Kwasniewski asked us not to discuss these matters in greater detail... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] In other words, you know, but you will not tell us... [Miller, interrupting] Let us not discuss this in detail, then. [Woyciechowski] Yesterday you won the lawsuit with ZYCIE WARSZAWY. It was a precedent. For the first time a politician managed to win a classical, as it were, lawsuit for libel. Could you say a few words about that? [Miller] Yes, I am very pleased with that, because this was a long story; it lasted two years, beginning in December 1991. At that time and even later on, ZYCIE WARSZAWY published made-up stories about my participation in the so-called Moscow loan, that is, the loan of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for the Polish United Workers' Party. I decided that all acceptable norms had been violated in those lies and slanders. I instituted legal proceedings. Only after two years, yesterday the case was brought to the end. ZYCIE WARSZWY is obliged to apologize to me and pay 25 million zlotys [Z] to the bank account of the Polish Red Cross in Lodz. In Lodz because I come from Lodz. I am also very happy.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Does it, then, pay to sue newspapers? [Miller] It does pay for those who have a lot of patience. Now, when I recall that two years have passed, that over those two years ZYCIE WARSZAWY... [Miller pauses] You know, this is interesting. I have often made statements on these issues; I have organized many press conferences; I have written all kinds of corrections. I thought that the editors, knowing that they are being sued, would be more moderate However, what happened was just to the contrary. Over those two years the intensity of those slanders did not wane at all. Therefore, I believe that it is good to do this in drastic cases; however, one must realize right at the beginning that this is going take a lot of time and that the compensation, especially in the financial sense, will be very insignificant, and that it may happen that the people will eventually forget what it was all really about.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] And just like today, only one newspaper published a report on that court verdict--a short report consisting of six lines, whereas at that time newspapers carried big headlines. [Miller] This is typical. When this case began, all.... [Miller pauses] Most of the press as well as radio and television newscasts, began with this information: Miller did this or did that. Now that this case has finally been finished, there is only silence. Thus, this is a reflection for me, and maybe not only for me but also for the listeners, perhaps, about the objectivity and impartiality of the mass media. Incidentally, I would like to inform you that I have also begun another trial, concerning the same, with GAZETA WYBORCZA. In this case things are far less advanced, so it will probably last not two years, but perhaps two and a half, or even three. However, I think that it will end up very similarly, because it is exactly the same problem. [Woyciechowski] Do you think the government members should get generous awards of the order of Z100 or 142 million? [Miller] Well, you know.... [Woyciechowski, interrupting] Have you received any award yet? [Miller] If I say no, then some of my government colleagues may resent it; if I say yes, then probably the listeners will resent it; they will say: well, what does this Miller think he is? I will simply tell you how much I earn. I earn Z17 million before tax and my net earnings amount to approximately 15 million. [Woyciechowski] Mr. Minister, you should go on strike. [Miller, laughs] I receive 15 million. Now, this is a matter of evaluation whether this is a sufficient salary for a minister or not. I certainly realize that there are many Poles who earn much less. There is no doubt about that. However, there are many who make much more money. I have received one award so far; it was an award for the fourth quarter; I received it just before Christmas. It was Z20 million, I think. It really helped me organize Christmas and New Year's Eve. [Woyciechowski] These are the awards that today's press mentions. It indicates that Pawlak also probably used some of the money left by Suchocka. [Miller] These are legal regulations. It all results from concrete legal acts. Well, it is difficult to imagine a prime minister who can pay this money to his civil servants, but does not want to do that. I think that there is only one problem here: none of this should be secret. This should not be enshrouded in a strange mist of secret. Let us speak about this bluntly and let the public opinion form a certain view on that. [Woyciechowski] Thank you very much for the interview. [Miller] Thank you.
