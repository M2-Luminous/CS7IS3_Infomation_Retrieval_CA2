"As its predecessor, the latest agreement will fail to work," he said in an exclusive interview with Interfax. Furthermore, Baltin said he is puzzled by Ukraine's insistence that the two countries' fleets should share the same naval base in Sevastopol. "This runs counter to common sense and has no precedent in international practice. Such a situation has already resulted in aggravating tensions between Russian and Ukrainian servicemen," the Black Sea Fleet commander said. Some Ukrainian naval units stationed in the Crimea, he noted, have been disconnected from the Fleet's energy system. "The Ukrainian Navy's debt to the Fleet has reached 4.5 billion rubles. There are no political motives in this. Politics and economics must not be confused," the admiral stressed. His fleet has no newly-built ships, Baltin complained. He deplored Ukraine's inability to finance the work of the shipyards in Nikolayev, and said he hopes that in the near future Russia will be able to provide his fleet with modern ships from Russian shipyards in the Baltic region and the Northern Fleet. In answer to Interfax's question about the fleet's attitude to the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, Baltin said: "He is a picturesque personality. From the point of view of humour he adds some color and animation to the work of the State Duma, but nothing more."
