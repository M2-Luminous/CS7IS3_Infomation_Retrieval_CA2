(``Phlx'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I, II and III below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. On April 21, 1994, the Phlx submitted to the Commission Amendment No. 1 to the proposal. 1 The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons. 1 See letter from William W. Uchimoto, Vice President and General Counsel, Phlx, to Louis A. Randazzo, Attorney, SEC, dated April 21, 1994. Amendment No. 1 deleted text requiring member firms to clear trades through the Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia in order to receive the discount. I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change The Phlx is proposing to amend its Schedule of Fees and Charges respecting the charges of non-exchange sponsored stock execution equipment 2 operated by Phlx members on the Phix floor. The proposed amendment would provide a 50 percent credit on the fees charged on each stock execution machine operated by any member firm for each 2,500 trades such member executes on the PHlx in a non-specialist account. 2 The Exchange stated that stock execution machines are terminals that route order flow to other market places. Currently, the only stock execution machines at the Phlx are Designated Order Turnaround machines (``DOT'') that route orders to the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''). II.
