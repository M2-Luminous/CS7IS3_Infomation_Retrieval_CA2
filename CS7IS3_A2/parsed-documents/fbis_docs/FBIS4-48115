IEC spokesman Pieter Cronje said on Wednesday [11 May] a better indication on how long it would take to wrap up the process would probably be determined by Thursday. The IEC would stop working only once its disbanding had been proclaimed by the president in the government gazette, he said. The task being tackled at the moment was financial reconciliation. The IEC has to submit all its financial records to the auditor-general for a final audit as soon as possible. Mr Cronje said extra costs incurred after the preliminary budget had been released had to be tallied. These costs included spending related to the Inkatha Freedom Party's participation in the elections, the extra day of voting in some areas and the printing of additional ballot papers. "This is a big operation," Mr Cronje said. IEC financial staff would probably stay on until the end of the month.
