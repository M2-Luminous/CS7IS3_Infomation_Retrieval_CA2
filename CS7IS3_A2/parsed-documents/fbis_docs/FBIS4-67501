The decision was taken as a result of work by a Russian-Japanese intergovernment commission on settling one of the most pressing far eastern problems: storage and processing of liquid radioactive waste in the Maritime Territory. Commission Member Yevgeniy Stomatyuk, chairman of the territorial committee on natural resources, told a news conference in Vladivostok on Friday that the two sides reached agreement to build a mobile facility in Japan in the near future. It will store liquid radioactive waste from Russian nuclear-powered submarines till a stationary system for utilising waste is built. The final discussion of the two projects will be held in Moscow and Tokyo at the top level. Their bilateral implementation will start in the latter part of May.
