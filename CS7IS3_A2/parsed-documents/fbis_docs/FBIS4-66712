Katyal: "PM Conveys Message to U.S."] [Text] New Delhi, March 8. The Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, was noticeably cautious in his references to the Indo-U.S. relations--while briefly dealing with foreign policy matters in his reply to the Lok Sabha debate on the motion of thanks to the President's address. While Mr. Rao pointedly mentioned the progress on economic, cultural and other fronts, he roundly talked of certain statements from Washington which had generated misgivings. But instead of elaborating on the second issue or dealing specifically with the points of disagreement, he merely repeated the implied references in the President's address -- "We look forward to working with the United States towards mutual understanding, including those issues on which such understanding needs enhancement. This will reflect the vibrant democratic and secular ideals of our two countries". Paraphrasing the President's words, Mr. Rao said there were areas where understanding was lacking and the address made the country's stand clear. Mr. Rao confined himself to recalling that the Home Minister (Mr. S.B. Chavan) had explained the government's position in Parliament the other day. Now Mr. Chavan had used strong words against Washington's stand, taking exception to the U.S. President, Mr. Bill Clinton's statement at the credential presentation ceremony of the new Pakistan Ambassador that "we share Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir". Mr. Rao, however, chose not to elaborate any of the points, dealt with by the Home Minister. In his reply to the debate in the Rajya Sabha later, the Prime Minister maintained the same cautious line. India's response, he said, had to be calibrated and "if a statement comes and next day there is clarification, you have to take it together. We are not in the habit of knee-jerk reaction." The net result of the two pronouncements is that India on the one hand made its stand abundantly clear on the "statements from Washington", while, on the other hand, it projected a posture of caution at the highest level. None in Washington was left in any doubt about the feelings of the Government (as also of the political parties and various sections of public opinion). At the same time, none in the U.S. Administration could link the Prime Minister with tough words against the American attitude to India. Even otherwise, Mr. Rao had avoided commenting on the "statements from Washington", a euphemism for Mr. Clinton's recent references to Kashmir -- contained, apart from the credential ceremony speech, in the President's address at the U.N. General Assembly and in his reply to a private American citizen, connected with a blatantly anti-India outfit -- as also his statements on Punjab. New Delhi left it to the foreign office spokesman to reply to what were regarded highly objectionable points. By recalling Mr. Chavan's strongly-worded statements, Mr. Rao impliedly provided the endorsement. That the Home Minister's off-the-cuff observations was evident from the way he repeated his points, first made in the Lok Sabha, in the Upper House -- and that, too, after the U.S. Embassy here conveyed its unhappiness, in a letter to Mr. Chavan, with a copy to the External Affairs Ministry. On March 2, Mr. Chavan (in the Lok Sabha) charged the U.S. with developing a vested interest in Kashmir and wanted the country to be on guard, adding that Washington was interested neither in helping India nor Pakistan, "they would like to help themselves". He was equally sharp in criticising the U.S. interference in Jammu and Kashmir. On March 4 (in the Rajya Sabha), Mr. Chavan, while dealing with the U.S. Embassy's unhappiness with his earlier statement, stood his ground and reiterated his charge of interference against the U.S. The exploratory talks through diplomatic channels for a meeting of the Prime Minister and Mr. Clinton are unlikely to be affected (in view of Mr. Rao's caution). That New Delhi's stand was made clear was an important factor.
