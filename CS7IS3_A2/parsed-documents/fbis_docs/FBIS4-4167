Today, as the special plane carries a full load of Central Asian (?friendship) [ha ba de 0761 1572 1795 -- language unknown], the "Silk Road" has all along been the delightful topic of conversation for both the hosts and the guests -- from the mountain city of (Bishikaike)[3024 0087 0418 0344] at the foot of the Tianshan Mountain to the "Apple City" of Almaty at the fringe of the (Yilialatao) [0122 3680 7093 2139 1152] Mountain. At various functions during his tour, Premier Li Peng has repeatedly made clear to leaders and people from all sectors of the four nations the sincerity of the Chinese people, saying: We would like to reinvigorate the ancient "Silk Road" with the Central Asian people, and let friendship endure as the universe. In speeches delivered in both Tashkent and Almaty, where he expounded on China's four basic policies in developing relations and its six-point advocation in developing economic cooperation with Central Asia, Li Peng has expressed the common feeling to invigorate the "Silk Road." There were even more praises from the enthusiastic hosts on this passageway that symbolized traditional friendship. Uzbek President Karimov said that today we have all the reasons to rejuvenate the "Silk Road" which linked the Uzbek and the Chinese people as early as 2,000 years ago. Turkmen President Niyazov also said: It is time to invigorate the great "Silk Road" which has tied together the Turkmen and the Chinese people over the past few centuries. Kyrgyz President Akayev wanted to make the new "Silk Road" a "Road of Friendship and Cooperation." Kazakh President Nazarbayev said the "Silk Road" was historic evidence of Kazakh-Chinese friendship. If promoting good-neighborly relations and developing cooperation of mutual benefit has been the objective of Premier Li Peng's four-nation Central Asian tour, the "Silk Road" has covered it all. Today, the opportunity facing us, topographical advantage, and support of the peoples have put us in a superior position to rejuvenate the "Silk Road." Because of the important contributions made through Premier Li Peng's trip, we have an entirely new time and space concept of the "Silk Road" and it has given the route a richer content. The premier said: "China will forever be the good friend and good neighbor of Central Asian nations." Premier Li Peng repeatedly stressed that the Eurasian Continental Bridge should remain open and unblocked. Improvement in transportation has become an issue of common concern to people. In view of this, China and Kazakhstan reached an understanding on developing rail through-traffic during Premier Li Peng's trip, and China and Turkmenistan indicated they would strive to achieve Beijing-Ashkhabad direct flights as soon as possible. The ancient Silk Road which once resounded with the ringing of camel bells is changing into a thoroughfare which travels through time and space. Premier Li Peng's trip will load the "Silk Road" up with more fruits of exchanges and cooperation. In addition, government-to-government economic and trade cooperation, Chinese entrepreneurs who accompanied the premier on his trip signed over 20 agreements involving cooperation in many fields with enterprise circles from various nations. If we carry out our tentative plan to build the Turkmenistan-China-Japan natural gas pipeline, 10 to 20 billion cubic meters of Turkmen natural gas will be transported through more than 6,000 km of pipelines to our country and Japan. As Li Peng said: The contemporary "Silk Road" is not only a glory path of friendship, it is also a broad road of cooperation.
