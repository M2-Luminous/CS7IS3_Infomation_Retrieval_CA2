Because the borides have an availability as a functional electronic material, rapid progress has been made in recent years. Although synthesis method and evaluation method on crystals and thick films have been studied,[.sup]1-3[/] analytical methods for the evaluation of synthesized borides are not established. We have prepared a series of oxide standards for the analysis of impurities in the boride,[.sup]4[/] and have determined the impurities in the synthesized boride crystals and thick films. A series of oxide standards containing impurities of 0.0018-0.2080% Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn were prepared by adding measured quantities of standard solutions containing the above elements to X-ray fluorescently pure B, P, Zr and Ti solutions.[.sup]4[/] After the solutions were evaporated to dryness in a crucible on a hotplate, the precursor of the oxide standards were heated with an electric furnace to 600�C for 12 hours at a constant heating rate of 50�C/hour. Calibration curves related log I/C and log E were obtained by the X-ray fluorescence method with the standards mentioned above. Where I is X-ray intensity, C is concentration of measured impurities, and E is X-ray energy. Standard deviation and coefficients of correlations of the curves were 0.0082-0.0128 and 0.990-0.999, respectively. It was found that crystals of TiB[.sub]2[/] and ZrB[.sub]2[/] synthesized by the zone refining method had less impurities than those of powder type raw materials. References 1. Y.
