Grochowski; place and date not given: "Poland's Security Is In Our Hands"] [Text] [Grochowski] Poland has accepted the "Partnership for Peace" [PFP] program at last. Why? [Kolodziejczyk] Because there is no alternative to it and because clear criteria for participating in this program--in other words, democracy, the market economy, democratic control over the Army, and clear budget provisions--were finally spelled out. I am sure these basic features will convince our neighbors, particularly those in the East, that Poland has finally entered the road to democracy and is making fast progress along it. [Grochowski] These criteria are obvious, and they were probably not the reason the U.S. delegation left the Belweder Palace in a worried state. Did you not seek a clarification of these criteria in Berlin? Did Foreign Minister Olechowski not do so in Washington? [Kolodziejczyk] There is one thing I would like to explain. Neither the president nor the foreign minister displayed any nervousness. However, we believed that, as Europeans, we have the right to say what we think of the PFP and security in general. The original version of the PFP program was very vague, and clear provisions were only incorporated at the very last moment, following sharp criticism from Warsaw. I hope we will shortly be acquainted with other PFP criteria as well, mainly the technical ones, and, of course, we will do our best to fulfill them, provided our Western partners are willing to indulge in scientific cooperation with us. But more important for me are Clinton's words uttered in Prague whereby, in the event of a clear threat, the NATO border will extend to the Bug River. That is a very tangible outcome of the offensive we waged before the Brussels summit. [Grochowski] Let us be frank. The NATO heads of state left Brussels in a satisfied state, but they left empty-handed. The Polish press said that a "Partnership for Tranquillity" had been achieved. Tranquillity for whom? Not for us! Perhaps the only purpose was to calm the consciences of Western politicians? [Kolodziejczyk] Our press reacted nervously, which is understandable, but it looks like there is a genuine desire to implement the PFP, and quickly. I am beginning to fear that we will not be able to make use of all of the offers that have already come in and are still doing so. [Grochowski] The PFP calls for a cooperation accord with NATO. [Kolodziejczyk] There is a race going on here, which I disagree with. The world's media are wondering whether Lithuania or Romania will be the first to conclude this accord. [Grochowski] Lithuania has won! [Kolodziejczyk] Poland's approach toward this matter is very serious, so we are giving ourselves several weeks' time in order to hold talks and prepare an offer of cooperation that suits our possibilities and is serious enough to be considered and implemented by the other side. [Grochowski] What are the actual advantages to be gained from the PFP? Not much is being said about them. [Kolodziejczyk] But the objective of the PFP has been mentioned, and that is Poland's incorporation into the European security system. [Grochowski] But what happens before then? [Kolodziejczyk] We must realize that we have a certain road to follow, involving many changes, starting with such prosaic ones as changing map symbols and ending with complicated technical changes. The key problem is to standardize our communications, command, firepower control, and reconnaissance systems with those in NATO. At the same time, we have to alter the Polish mentality because it is we who are entering NATO structures, and we have to adapt to the customs prevalent there. I do not think this will be difficult. We have an Army of good specialists, prepared to think on their own. But there is no doubt that it will be useful to have staff command exercises, as suggested by NATO, carried out on the basis of computer systems. All of this takes time, but the Polish Army is intellectually prepared for it, and this road is not going to be excessively long. [Grochowski] Talking about the need to adapt to NATO requirements, we often think of the Warsaw Pact, where weapons were standardized to a very large degree, and even Army organizational structures were the same. In the West, compatibility does not mean that there is only one type of weapon in all of the armies. One reason for this is that each country has its own weapons industry, whose products it would like to sell. [Kolodziejczyk] Of course. The point is not to standardize our weapons with NATO. Weapons are not even standardized inside NATO. The point is to bring our technological standards in line with NATO's. [Grochowski] Do you expect Poland to have broader access to technology that is still on Western secret lists? [Kolodziejczyk] I hope so. We have been very vociferous in this matter. It turns out that Minister Olechowski succeeded in starting concrete talks, and a technical team from the United States is arriving next week. I think it would be inconsistent if this team merely told us what NATO standards are and then left us to our own devices. We expect help, and I hope we will get it. [Grochowski] Is this NATO business not a little like a cat-and-mouse game? Everyone knows that integration with NATO requires huge funds. Yet the Polish Army simply does not have any money and is fighting for survival. [Kolodziejczyk] Indeed, the present budget does not even let us maintain present standards. We are sinking even lower, though there is really nowhere to sink to. I hope the budget is amended. [Grochowski] The National Defense Commission demanded an 800-billion zloty [Z] increase in the defense budget. [Kolodziejczyk] I appreciate the Commission's understanding of the needs of the Army, but, in fact, its needs are far greater if we are supposed to be a military partner for NATO. What is more, in subsequent budgets, defense expenditure must exceed 3 percent of the GNP or our Army will cease to exist. However, the problem possesses a broader dimension. I asked the Council of Ministers whether greater emphasis should be applied to integration with NATO political structures. There is such a possibility--after all, Spain and Portugal belong to NATO political structures but not to its military ones. That alone guarantees that NATO will endow these countries with its attention should a conflict occur. Therefore, this is a way of improving the Poles' sense of security and of gaining enough time to modernize our Army at a pace permitted by our finances. But such modernization is impossible if defense expenditure is less than 3 percent of the GNP, and there is proof of that. [Grochowski] What proof, Minister? [Kolodziejczyk] According to General Staff data, reduced military spending makes our Army's low technical standards even lower, whereas higher expenditure allows us to modernize our equipment and catch up with Western armies. [Grochowski] None of the politicians with whom I have spoken agree with the 3 percent you mention. They insist that the Army should get whatever it really needs. [Kolodziejczyk] I agree with them, and I hold them to their word. The Army needs three times the amount of money it is now getting in order to achieve by the end of the century a technical standard that prevails in Western armies. [Grochowski] I have the impression that the defense budget is viewed not in ternm of the Army's real needs, but in terms of the need to rescue the Polish defense industry. [Kolodziejczyk] It seems to me that our defense industry has gotten in the habit of staging strikes to force the Army to buy equipment it does not need. This practice leads nowhere. All it does is demoralize enterprise managers and make their products unattractive to the Polish Army and to foreign clients. Why is the Czech aviation industry functioning so well? The Vodohady plant, which I visited last week, has orders worth $300 million. The Czechs are selling fighter-trainer aircraft to various countries and displaying a flexibility and zest that are completely absent in the whole of our industry, not just the aviation industry. I asked them how they did it. They told me something to the effect that, if one does not help oneself, the government certainly will not do so. One can strike, they said, but at what cost? This therapy did the trick. Their contracts for this year involve the production of at least 50 aircraft for the Czech Army and for export. These aircraft can compete with our own "Irida" any day. They are fitted with optical-electronic equipment and suspension locks [zamki powieszenia] in accordance with NATO standards. In the meantime, there is a misunderstanding about the offer from our own Mielec aviation plant. Instead of a fighter-trainer, we are being offered a simple trainer. That is why I think it was a mistake to waste money on prolonging the life of plants that are unwilling to help themselves, and I will make sure I do not repeat the same mistake. That sounds brutal, but, with the Army's present condition, I see no other way. We must not waste money. [Grochowski] The Polish armaments industry has been thrown into deep water without being taught to swim beforehand. [Kolodziejczyk] The Czech Government did not help Czech aviation plants until it saw that these plants were helping themselves. [Grochowski] I fear that our armed forces will also come under pressure to manage on their own and make the best possible use of whatever funds they receive because there is no secret about the fact that the Army has a lot of property that is little used and very costly to maintain. [Kolodziejczyk] The idea of appointing a Military Property Agency was twice shelved by previous governments. We will make a fresh attempt to appoint this Agency, taking into account various proposals that have been presented in the meantime. If this government refuses to create this agency for whatever reason, we will insist on an alternative solution to relieve the military budget of the Z2 trillion that are currently spent every year on maintaining superfluous military property. [Grochowski] General Wilecki said that, right now, the Army is guarding what he delicately describes as sleepy garrisons. Are there many of them? [Kolodziejczyk] About 14. The description is very appropriate to the situation. Some garrisons will be not so much put to sleep as eliminated altogether, especially in the west of the country. But, at the same time, one would like to see an influx of funds to restore the infrastructure in those regions where this is necessary, especially in the eastern zone and the Krakow military district. [Grochowski] You have said in no uncertain terms that the Army cannot afford to act as a charity any longer. If necessary, the Army will vacate barracks that are not in use. [Kolodziejczyk] I am close to reaching such a decision, which is a very difficult one because it is Polish property we are talking about. I consider myself responsible for national defense. Other matters are in the hands of the members of the government, and they should at least try to cooperate with the Army on the issues for which they are responsible. [Grochowski] Another problem is that of the apartments that belong to the Defense Ministry but are occupied by people no longer connected to the Defense Ministry. How will that problem be solved? [Kolodziejczyk] The law on accommodation for members of the armed forces is almost ready, and, in early February, we will discuss it with other ministries, especially with the ministry of spatial economy, the Ministry of Construction, And the Ministry of Finance. After that, we will table it before parliament, with the request that it be passed quickly because the use of military accommodation by nonmilitary people represents a waste of Z1.87 trillion for the Army budget. Of course, we will never regain all of this money, but if the apartments in question are utilized in accordance with the law, we will at least have funds to build more accommodation. We need 13,000 apartments. [Grochowski] Is there a danger that the restructuring of the Defense Ministry and armed forces will be stopped because of a shortage of money? [Kolodziejczyk] That is a complicated issue. The armed forces and command systems must be reorganized, but, fortunately, that is not as expensive as it seems. The real problem is with relocating personnel. This cannot be done without money, and of course there is no money. The modest funds we have at our disposal must be spent on improving the technical condition and mobility of the armed forces. That also solves the problem of providing equal security for all borders because today we are in no danger of any unexpected conflict. Therefore, there is time to prepare a defense system, and there is no need to establish military garrisons of equal strength at every single border. [Grochowski] At the end of 1994, there was supposed to have been a review of the changes inside the Ministry. What were the results? [Kolodziejczyk] The review has not been finished. The results are still being assessed. Right now, those spheres that have been placed under Jerzy Milewski's responsibility are being reorganized. This has nothing to do with shifting the burden of responsibility or transferring tasks from the civilian to the military spheres, which would be contrary to the principle of democratic control over the armed forces. [Grochowski] Some politicians claim you are losing control over what is happening in your ministry. [Kolodziejczyk] To this very day, I do not accept outside interference. Everything going on in the ministry for which I am constitutionally responsible is under my complete control. These are completely unfounded rumors. If I really had no control over the Ministry, there would be no point in my staying in Warsaw and being a puppet. I will never agree to that. [Grochowski] I do not mean pressure from outside. I have in mind the transfer of too many powers from the civilian to the military sphere. [Kolodziejczyk] That is fiction. Nothing like that has happened. [Grochowski] Well, let us discuss the question of defense vice ministers. Why do you think there are enough vice ministers today? In the past, there have been as many as seven defense vice ministers, and every single one of them had his hands full. [Kolodziejczyk] There are enough vice ministers for present needs. If needs increase, we will make personnel changes. After all, we experiment all the time. But one thing is sure; we are going to create several posts of director general, a post that exists in the defense ministries of many countries. I am not joking when I say this, but we also need one under secretary of state to make sure that the government benches are full during Sejm debates. Such an under secretary would be responsible for contacts with the Sejm committees. That is something that takes up a lot of time, and the rules forbid the director of the Parliamentary Bureau to deal with it. [Grochowski] Politicians insist that all they want is to make sure that the Army remains under civilian control, as is the rule in democratic countries. [Kolodziejczyk] They are right. I agree with them. But our democracy is not yet stable, and there is still a temptation to use the Army for political purposes. All of the parties would like to influence the Army, which is a very bad thing in a transitional period such as ours. The Army must have time to reestablish itself in new forms. But once these new forms have solidified ,just as the state's democratic structures have done, and the responsibility of politicians has increased, I see no reason that any victorious coalition should not have increased control over the Army. This is not just a question of possibility but of responsibility for one's deeds, and our experience in this regard is not the best, unfortunately. [Grochowski] Right now, only a handful of politicians understand the functioning of an army. No wonder, for where could they have learned it? Is it not worth bringing them to the ministry for a little instruction, although I fear their price might be high? [Kolodziejczyk] Any politician wishing to be responsible for defense matters should first of all be taken to the National Defense Academy in order to acquire a little theoretical knowledge. Only then could he perform good practical work in the ministry. [Grochowski] You are implementing reforms that require legislative changes. Do you not fear that the Sejm might block the reforms? [Kolodziejczyk] Yes. If the Sejm presents rational reasons why the reforms should not go through, I will accept them. But if the Sejm blocks the reform for the sole purpose of playing a political game, as was the case in the past, we might reach a point where I have no further possibility of action, in which case... But, knowing how most of the members of the Sejm National Defense Committee think, I do not expect major difficulties. I do not think this Committee will play political games and set itself at a distance from defense matters. [Grochowski] You have already issued two warnings about resigning. How serious are you about it? [Kolodziejczyk] As long as there is a chance to do something, I will do it. But, if my hands are tied, I will not pretend I am still a minister. That would be alien to my mentality and character. But there is no danger of that for the time being.
