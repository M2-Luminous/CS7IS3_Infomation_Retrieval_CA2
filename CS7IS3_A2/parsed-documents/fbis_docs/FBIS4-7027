FBIS4-7027 "dreas080_c_94018" FBIS-EAS-94-080 Daily Report 23 Apr 1994 North Korea Radio Assails South for `Dumping Nuclear Wastes' Radio Assails South for `Dumping Nuclear Wastes' SK2604012594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 23 Apr 94 SK2604012594 Pyongyang Korean Central Broadcasting Network in Korean 1222 GMT 23 Apr 94 Korean BFN [Commentary by station commentator Yun Pyong-son: "Why Do They Keep Silent?"] [Text] Members of Greenpeace, an international civilian environmental organization, arrived in Samchok port, South Korea, on 12 April, at the invitation of the Environment Movement Alliance, an antinuclear movement organization in South Korea. They waged various forms of antinuclear movements, including exposure of the criminal nuclear weapons development maneuvers by the puppet clique. On 14 April, about 20 members of this organization held an antinuclear rally in Samchok together with 1,000-odd members of environment protection and antinuclear movement organizations in South Korea. They warned of the danger of leakage of radioactivity from South Korean atomic power stations, and strongly demanded suspension of construction of atomic power stations to the puppet authorities. Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have yet to reply and are keeping silent. This is nothing but a foolish trick to conceal their criminal act of dumping nuclear wastes, conceal the truth about nuclear weapons development maneuvers, and evade international denunciation. It is a universal desire of mankind to live in a world free from nuclear radioactivity. This is why the Greenpeace members carried out an anti-nuclear movement by visiting South Korea, and why the South Korean environmental movement organizations waged the struggle with them. However, the South Korean ruling bunch, going counter to the people's desire, developed nuclear weapons and indiscriminately dumped nuclear wastes into the sea, thus shocking the people. According to the material, the nuclear wastes that the South Korean puppets dumped into seas for the past seven years from 1986 to 1992 reach as much as 10 million billion and 1,000 trillion becquerels. Such an act of dumping nuclear wastes is still continuing under the rule of the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime. The puppets' act of dumping nuclear wastes is not only an antinational act of reducing the Korean peninsula and its surrounding seas into a wasteland by contaminating them with nuclear material but also an intolerable criminal act of severing the nation's lifeline and destroying nature's ecological environment. This act is also a flagrant infringement of international laws and treaties that totally ban the dumping of nuclear wastes into oceans. Moreover, one cannot think of the act of dumping nuclear wastes without having the puppet clique's nuclear weapons development maneuvers come to mind. As is known to all, nuclear weapons development maneuvers that began in the early seventies are being accelerated in a very grave stage. It is an already-exposed secret that the puppet clique brought in a large quantity of plutonium from overseas for production and stockpiling, and that the heavy-water reactor now in operation in Wolsong, and the multipurpose research reactor in Taedok, are reactors for nuclear weapons development. Today in South Korea, the disastrous situation in which people are suffering various types of cancerous diseases and losing lives, continuously takes place, and the number of cases of pregnant women giving birth prematurely after eating fish caught from the sea, and giving birth to deformed children or miscarrying, is drastically increasing. All this is not accidental. Thus, while damages from nuclear radioactivity have reached a grave stage in South Korea, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has not taken any step nor shown any response to the just demand by Greenpeace. This is because the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique is fearing that its criminal act would be exposed to the world, like a thief fearing discovery of his theft. This also shows that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique will continue accelerating the development of nuclear weapons to ruin fellow countrymen and that it will destroy the natural environment by continually dumping nuclear wastes into seas to threaten the life of fellow countrymen. As long as the Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique remains intact, the lands will be reduced into a wasteland and the people cannot evade nuclear calamities. The Kim Yong-sam traitorous clique which inflicts disaster on the people by indiscriminately dumping nuclear wastes while accelerating nuclear weapons development and contaminated environment, must be made stand before court and must be sternly judged by the nation.
