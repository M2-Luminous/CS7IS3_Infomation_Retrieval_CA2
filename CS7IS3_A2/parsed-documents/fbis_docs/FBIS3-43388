[passage omitted] President Habyarimana, in his afternoon speech, stressed that the ceremony had been postponed because the president of the Constitutional Court and many of the deputies designated by some political parties were absent. It is good to note the absence. But, it is not enough. There is also need for one to ask one's self what the reasons for the absence were. Contrary to what is said by some of our colleagues at Radio Kigali, our country has not entered the period of broad-based transition. The transitional period will only start when the broad-based government starts functioning. [passage omitted]
