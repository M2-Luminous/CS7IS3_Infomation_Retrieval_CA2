Gavrya, candidate of technical sciences; Rear Admiral A. Rudometkin; Captain 1st Rank Yu. Sinchenko, candidate of military sciences; and Captain 1st Rank (Retired) V. Khyaninen, candidate of military sciences, under rubric "Time and the Navy"] [Text] A navy is a specific "attribute" of a state's political, economic and military activity. History provides many examples of its deciding effect on the course and outcome of wars which Russia fought. And in quite recent times, in 1967, the Navy's presence in the Mediterranean helped stabilize the situation in the Near East and deterred the United States from intervening in the conflict on Israel's side. In addition, the constant presence of our naval forces in politically tense ocean areas permitted deterring the aggressive aspirations of individual states (disruption of the attack on Libya and Angola, prevention of a coup d'Ã©tat in Guinea and so on). And the involvement of ships to ensure security of Persian Gulf shipping during Iran's war against Iraq permitted us to avoid vessel losses. Despite the general trend toward a reduction in the threat of initiation of a world war, the danger of the outbreak of military conflicts and local wars presently is preserved, especially for territorial, economic, ethnic and similar motives. Preconditions existing in individual regions for the outbreak of military conflicts and even local wars may be realized under certain conditions, which is fraught with their escalation into a large-scale war and with a large number of states, including those such as the United States and Russia, being drawn into its orbit. Unquestionably, the immediate threat of nuclear war has been minimized, but there remains the danger of its outbreak because of the presence of considerable arsenals of these weapons in the hands of a number of leading states and the trend which has appeared toward their proliferation in third world countries. It is impossible not to take this into account. The possibility of a large-scale conventional war escalating into a nuclear war also is not precluded as a measure which a country subjected to attack takes in order to respond to actions of an aggressor who is disrupting the functioning of its strategic deterrence forces. Russia has no grounds to regard any country or coalition of states as probable enemies in the international situation which has taken shape today. Russia also threatens no one: It is sharply reducing the makeup and changing the structure and stationing of its Armed Forces and, in accordance with its defensive military doctrine, is limiting them to the framework of necessary defense sufficiency. As applied to the Navy, we take such sufficiency to mean the makeup, structure and stationing of fleet forces as well as that status of all kinds of support, command and control and training systems which meet the level of possible military threat from maritime sectors. They should guarantee the country's reliable defense against aggression on the part of possible groupings of naval forces and of other states in zones from where their offensive precision weapons can hit important targets in the depth of our territory. The buildup by any state (or coalition of states) of groupings of its forces on the territory of states contiguous with Russia or of groupings of its naval forces in the aforementioned zones, as well as the exceeding of an agreed upon time period for the presence of aircraft carriers and missile ships in these zones and certain other reasons may become grounds for categorizing any state (or coalition of states) as a potential enemy. In our opinion, it must be reflected in Russian Federation naval strategy that in such situations Russia retains for itself the right to retaliatory (including also adequate) operations. It should be borne in mind that militarily strong foreign states, above all the United States, are in no hurry to give up the term "potential enemy." And no small number of examples from their practical activity today indicates that the direction of their policy toward force remains unchanged. Thus, new NATO military strategy does not preclude the option of war over the Baltic countries against Russia. It is also impossible not to take note of the fact that according to a book well known in naval circles, "...From the Sea. New Direction for the Navy," written by a group of prominent U.S. naval figures and published in 1992, U.S. national security strategy openly, and even with clear pride in its Navy, emphasizes that "national interests require of the Navy not only performance of the long-range mission of ensuring strategic deterrence, a powerful military presence on forward lines, sea control, and reaction to crises in remote areas, but also conduct of large-scale offensive operations." Moreover: "To meet national security requirements with the shift in emphasis to regional problems, construction of new naval forces is oriented toward increasing their flexibility and might." Along with external factors which introduce an element of uncertainty and unpredictability to the Navy reform process, considerable difficulties also are caused by internal factors, above all economic and financial. Their influence is felt not in the last instance in building the fleet--one of the most mobile, versatile and consequently costly branches of the Armed Forces. What kind of Russian Navy do we see and what kind of navy must it become? It is difficult to overestimate the importance of doctrinal aims for orienting the direction of naval reform. What kind of navy the Russian Navy will become and whether or not Russia will retain the status of a great naval power depends on them. Unfortunately, a careful study of the published draft "Osnovy voyennoy doktriny RF" [Fundamentals of Russian Federation Military Doctrine]<sup> 1</sup> shows that despite recognition of the fact that an invasion most probably may begin from the sea, the role of the Navy in repelling it essentially is not covered; somewhat more attention is given to the involvement of naval infantry as part of mobile forces, to whom priority is given in development of arms. But functions of other components of naval forces are limited to the defense of sea lines of communication and support of mobile forces. An underestimation of experience of the last wars and local conflicts such as in the Persian Gulf, which demonstrated the helplessness of a defending country without sufficient naval forces to repel an attack from the sea, clearly tells here. Such disparagement of the Navy's role as a tool of Russian foreign policy can undermine the status of a great naval power. It is apropos here to take another look at the aforementioned book in order to see the attitude toward the Navy on the part of the U.S. Navy leadership. The Navy, "operating on forward lines, supports America's positive image, creates foundations for forming coalitions, . . . raises the spirit of allies and demonstrates American might and resolve." Take note: Not the might of the Navy, but the might of America. And further: "Operating on forward lines, naval forces inspire friends and serve as a warning to potential enemies, . . . they deter crises. . . . We will take advantage of the Navy's unique capabilities in coastal operations from sea sectors." The Russian Federation Navy also is a unique, versatile branch of the Armed Forces, possessing essentially all means of warfare and their support systems which other branches of the Armed Forces possess. This permits it to effectively defend a broad spectrum of Russia's national interests. The high mobility and combat readiness of naval forces and assets permit employing it both in peacetime as well as wartime. According to rules of international law, naval forces are not bound by the need to obtain permission from governments of any state for making a transit to arrive at a destination. They also are guaranteed access to coastal waters of any country right up to the limit of its territorial waters. This gives the Navy an exceptional opportunity to perform its functions, including peacekeeping functions, in dangerously explosive zones to keep a crisis from deepening and to stop armed conflict. The concept of "showing the flag" entered the political dictionary from naval practice. Frequently this is the sole method for the legal presence of states' force (usually with UN sanction) in regions remote from one's own territory. It is more difficult to introduce tanks and, as experience has shown, even more difficult to remove them. Only the Navy can perform the function of defending Russian citizens abroad. It appears to us that few people will be found in all the world who condemn America for decisive actions to defend its citizens abroad, when an entire squadron of ships is sent for the sake of a few persons to the shores of a country encroaching on their freedom. True, for this a state must possess corresponding naval might. Russia's adoption of international obligations for involvement together with other countries in humanitarian and police actions and in local conflicts under UN aegis logically leads to the need to have as part of the Navy (along with naval forces intended for deterrence and repulse of possible aggression from the sea) sufficiently large, oceangoing ships capable of deploying rapidly even to remote tasking areas and there performing missions with high intensity, often for a lengthy time. A need also may arise for the capability of replacing these forces. Therefore, not only naval infantry units, but also rather large ship forces with means of their logistic support must be included in the makeup of mobile forces. It is also impossible not to take account of the fact that Russia's maritime border is double that of the land border and that world naval powers continue to build up capabilities of their naval forces. One would like to believe that the peace and cooperation of leading states will continue forever, but in case the situation is exacerbated we must have guaranteed protection against strikes from sea directions. And only the Navy is capable of this mission (with appropriate attention to its construction). In addition to the above, it should be noted that developing the Navy as the most complex system of armament saturated with the most modern equipment lends powerful impetus to technical progress. Thus, results from special-purpose developments for the Navy were introduced to the national economy in the area of heat engineering, radio engineering, radio communications, atomic power engineering, and underwater equipment and devices for developing the ocean, including natural resources of the continental shelf. Thus it can be asserted that the sphere of Navy activity in the scheme of ensuring Russia's national security literally consists of 13 seas and three oceans washing its shores, and from the standpoint of protecting its interests it consists of the entire world ocean. It appears the Navy should perform the following missions: - guaranteed deterrence of potential enemies (as part of strategic nuclear forces) from initiating combat operations by maintaining combat readiness of strategic naval nuclear forces and ensuring reliability and safety of their functioning; - guaranteed repulse and disruption of aggression from sea and ocean directions under any situation conditions; - maintaining a favorable operational regime in contiguous and inland seas; - assistance to naval units of border guard troops in performing their assigned missions of protecting the state border and the maritime economic zone; - ensuring security of our shipping in various ocean areas and protecting fisheries (animal industries) and other industrial activity, above all on our continental shelf; - participation in joint humanitarian and police actions with other states; - participation of specially formed expedition groupings of naval forces (as part of mobile forces) in local conflicts under the aegis of the United Nations or other international organizations to keep conflicts from escalating to large-scale wars. Summing up what has been said, the conclusion can be drawn that the Navy's role in the scheme of ensuring Russia's national security is determined by its contribution to performance of missions facing the state's Armed Forces, and it must possess a potential that in peacetime is capable of ensuring Russian Federation security and protection of its national interests and citizens in ocean areas by deterring any state or coalition of states from using force against Russia and its allies. In case war is initiated against Russia, the Navy must be ready to repel aggression from sea and ocean directions and deprive enemy naval forces of the opportunity to conduct offensive operations (actions) in seas adjoining our territory and in other vital ocean areas.
