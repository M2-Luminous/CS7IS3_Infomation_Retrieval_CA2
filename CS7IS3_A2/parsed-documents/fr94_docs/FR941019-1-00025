Since this is a negative amount, the net current exposure is zero. To recognize the effects of netting on potential future exposure, the following formula applies: A net = .5 (A gross + (NGR * A gross )) In the above example: NGR = 0 (0/300,000) A net = .5 (2,050,000 + (0 * 2,050,000)) A net = 1,025,000 Credit Equivalent Amount: 1,025,000 + 0 = 1,025,000 If the net current exposure was a positive amount, for example, $200,000, the credit equivalent amount would be calculated as follows: NGR = .67 (200,000/300,000) A net = .5(2,050,000 + (.67 * 2,050,000)) A net = 1,711,750 Credit Equivalent Amount: 1,711,750 + 200,000 = 1,911,750 By order of the Board of Directors.
