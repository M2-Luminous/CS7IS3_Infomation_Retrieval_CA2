What would you like to say after a very long absence? [Al-Nashashibi] I would like to say that this is one of the happiest days in my life. I extend greetings to our great people, who waited for our return and with whom we have waited to meet. This day will prompt me to do all that I can to fulfill my duty in a manner that satisfies my people, my consciousness, and my God. [Mu'addi] What are the priorities in the economic field? [Al-Nashashibi] Priorities in the economic field include rebuilding the infrastructure. There is of course an emergency reconstruction program, prepared through an agreement among the World Bank, the donors commission, and the PLO, particularly the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction. This program is called the emergency program. According to that program, there are issues related to roads, transportation, water, solid waste treatment, agriculture, industry, tourism, education, and health. In my view, the private sector has to take responsibility in housing, tourism, agriculture, industry, and energy. [Mu'addi] Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, you have not taken part in the economic talks [between Israel and the PLO]. Do you accept and approve of this [economic] agreement? [Al-Nashashibi] No. [Mu'addi] What are your reservations? [Al-Nashashibi] That agreement was not based on my legitimate right to build a Palestinian national economy based on my national right to self-determination. Regrettably, that agreement considered Israel's interests at the expense of the Palestinian Arab people, who want to establish an independent economy based on the economic charter of peoples and states that gave all peoples the right to establish their national economy away from any foreign intervention. Accordingly, I think we have a legitimate right to establish this economy without having obstacles and restrictions imposed on us and this point should have been considered by the Israeli negotiators. [Mu'addi] One final question. There are reports that Yasir 'Arafat is making his arrival here conditional on the financial assistance from the donor states? [Al-Nashashibi] President 'Arafat has not made any such statements. The only condition he has set for his arrival is that he must be convinced that his mission will be successful. When conditions are appropriate, he will come here. Difficult financial conditions are one of the problems we are all facing. [Mu'addi] Mr. Muhammad Zuhdi al-Nashashibi, official in charge of financial affairs in the Palestinian Authority, thank you very much. [Al-Nashashibi] Thank you.
