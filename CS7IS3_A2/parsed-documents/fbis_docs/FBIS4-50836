These cadres were found to have accepted gifts and cash in violation of party and government discipline. Over the past few years, some of Lichuan's party members and cadres fell into the habit of throwing banquets on such occasions as weddings, funerals, birthdays, housewarmings, and so on, at which they procured gifts and cash from guests. Investigations show that by 10 March 1994, a total of 27 leading cadres at and above the deputy district director level had been involved in such activities, including four cadres at the county deputy magistrate level, 16 cadres at the district director level, and seven cadres at the district deputy director level. While five cadres had each accepted more than 10,000 yuan in cash from others, fifteen cadres, including four at the county magistrate level, had violated party and government discipline in these activities. In view of this situation, the Lichuan City CPC Committee and Lichuan City People's Government recently decided to strictly enforce party and government discipline by meting out two inner-party disciplinary warnings and two administrative warnings to four cadres at the district director level and the district deputy director level, respectively; issuing a circular criticizing seven cadres at the district director level and the district deputy director level; and reporting the cases of four corrupt cadres at the county magistrate level to the relevant autonomous prefectural party committees and discipline inspection commissions for punishment in accordance with the relevant personnel management regulations.
