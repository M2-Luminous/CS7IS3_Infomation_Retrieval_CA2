"The economy looks much better and I don't think the economy will go much worse than it is now," said Terasawa, director general of the Economic Planning Agency (EPA). But on whether the 37-month downturn has hit bottom, "I should say that I don't know yet. All the figures I have are six weeks old, seven weeks old," he said, answering questions in English after a speech to foreign correspondents. Of the uncertainties hanging over the economy, he cited the dollar-yen rate and corporate capital spending, expected to fall for a fourth straight year. "Should there be any signs that equipment investments start increasing, then I really think the economy...will catch up." Terasawa said his agency is not more cautious on the economy than the Bank of Japan. Yasushi Mieno, the central bank governor, told lawmakers earlier Monday that the economy likely has passed bottom and taken the first step toward recovery. "Each agency here in Japan, being independent, can have its own opinion," he said. But he added that he met Mieno during the day and, "it seems that his view and mine are very very close, if not almost exactly the same." Terasawa continued his recent calls for deregulation and reducing the "ridiculously profound disparities" between Japanese and foreign prices. Prices can be cut, regulations eased and multilayered distributions systems simplified without severe unemployment, asserted Terasawa, who spent more than 20 years as a businessman overseas, much of it as a top executive for Nomura Securities Co. But he did not explain how, offering only that there were "too many go-betweens" in the Japanese economy and that some people must "take disadvantages" in deregulation. He rejected a suggestion that the nation's high prices either represent profiteering or are the cost of the traditional lifetime employment system, saying, "it's not that simple." Terasawa acknowledged that it is "not easy" to overcome bureaucratic opposition to deregulation but said, "we have to do it, no matter how difficult." He declined to criticize the Ministry of Finance (MOF) when prodded by charges that the ministry's powerful bureaucrats take money out of citizens' pockets by pushing for tax hikes and stifling attempts to cut prices. "MOF is not our enemy, they're our friends," Terasawa said. "I don't think MOF people are trying to dominate or trying to lead the country" by insisting on fiscal rectitude. Asked who would push for needed changes, the Japan New Party upper house member chirped, "the Hata cabinet." He skirted the question of how long Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's government will last, but joked at the start of his speech that he hoped to keep his job long enough to see his Monday comments in print.
