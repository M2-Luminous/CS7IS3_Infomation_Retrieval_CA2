SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 10101 et seq. , provides a comprehensive framework for the development of repositories for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. Section 112(a) of the Act directed the Department of Energy (the Department) to do the following: (1) Issue general guidelines for the recommendation of sites for repositories; and (2) use such guidelines in considering candidate sites for recommendation. Section 112(a) further provides that the Secretary of Energy may revise such guidelines from time to time. Section 112(a) of the Act provides that the guidelines developed pursuant to Section 112(a) have to be concurred in by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and submitted to the Governor or legislature of the State of Nevada for their review and comment. Section 113(b) of the Act, which concerns site characterization, in effect, directs the Department to develop guidelines to be used to determine the suitability of a candidate site for the location of a repository, developed pursuant to section 112(a) of the Act. In accordance with sections 112(a) and 113(b)(1), the Department promulgated, as a regulation, General Guidelines for the Recommendation of Sites for Nuclear Waste Repositories (10 CFR part 960). In accordance with Section 113 of the Act, the Department is conducting site characterization activities at the Yucca Mountain site to provide data required for evaluation of the suitability of the site for construction and operation of a repository for disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste in accordance with the Act and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ). In view of the importance of the site suitability evaluation, the Department is seeking the views of interested parties regarding an evaluation process which can earn public trust and confidence in the suitability of the Yucca Mountain Site. The Department will use the information obtained in response to this Notice as it proceeds with the development of the site suitability evaluation process.
