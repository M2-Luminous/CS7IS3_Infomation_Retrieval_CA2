Speaking at a press conference, Dr Boesak said the ANC was determined to give its full co-operation in the NP- led government of provincial unity. "I do not believe this is the time for recrimination, threats or grudges, but for building and working together for all our people. Whatever work we do will not be for ANC members, but for the people of the Western Cape." While the ANC's Western Cape region was disappointed with the provincial outcome it rejoiced in the party's national victory. "I think the ANC has fought a valiant battle...Against tremendous odds," Dr Boesak said. Conceding a "clear NP win" in the Western Cape, he said he would again like to congratulate Mr Kriel for his party's victory. The ANC's defeat could be attributed to the brief period in which it had to reverse antagonistic public perceptions; an electorate which voted for NP leader Mr F. W. de Klerk rather than Mr Kriel; and a well-honed NP media image. Dr Boesak said the ANC's commitment to its programme of reconstruction and development was unchanged and it would work as hard as it could in the provincial government for the crucial programme to be implemented. This was not just because no other parties had a similar plan "but so the NP can see there is no subsitute for what the ANC is bringing to the people of South Africa". He did not believe there would be any tensions between the ANC and NP if the NP went along with the reconstruction programme. "But if the NP tries to block it there will be tensions." Healing the scars left by the NP's racially-tainted election campaign would be an important long-term focus for the ANC and the government of provincial unity. Dr Boesak said he had not detected any signs of an ANC backlash against the Western Cape result, which by mid-Tuesday had shown the NP leading the ANC with a 25 per cent margin. "Especially the people of the Western Cape should not for one single moment worry about what the ANC is going to do in the government."
