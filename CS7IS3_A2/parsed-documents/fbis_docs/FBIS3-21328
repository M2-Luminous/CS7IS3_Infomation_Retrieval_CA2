The process of freeing the much-protected insurance industry from the clutches of government control will accelerate with the release of the Malhotra Committee report on reforms in the insurance sector. For an industry which accounts for annual premium income of around Rs[rupees]10,000 crore, the report will be path-breaking. The recommendations have, no doubt, raised new hopes, especially among foreign companies and Indian private sector. Will their dreams materialise? A host of Indian industrial groups like the ITC group, Kotak Mahindra, the Birlas and the Lloyds group have already evinced interest in entering the insurance business, if freed from the shackles of controls. "Certainly we will look into this area...but the Government should make its mind clear about accepting the report," says G C Garg, president of Lloyds Finance Ltd, a financial services company. Throwing open the sector to foreign companies means the entry of foreign firms like American Insurance Group, Eagle Star and Sun Life. As the hitherto protected Indian insurance industry offers tremendous growth potential, foreign firms are expected to rush to this new gold mine. Garg feels that insurance is a logical extension of financial services activities where his company is involved. "Competition will improve efficiency," he said while welcoming the Malhotra committee recommendations. But will the Government accept the proposals? In fact, industrial groups started eyeing the insurance sector long before the Government finally woke up with the idea of throwing it open and Malhotra Committee was set up to find suitable ways for that. "The Government's decision was influenced by the international lending agencies like World Bank. So it won't be surprising if foreign insurance companies make a grand entry into the country," said a former LIC [Life Insurance Corporastion] chairman who preferred anonymity. After the nationalisation of 245 private life insurance companies into one entity--LIC--and the formation of GIC [General Insurance Corporation], competition was a subject unheard of in the insurance industry. Will the Government have the political courage to implement the recommendations of the committee? The trade unions have already raised their opposition to privatisation of the sector. Although the Narasimham committee submitted its report on reforms in the financial sector long ago, critics argue, the Government has not yet made any significant changes in the banking sector. Further, the Government would not have access to cheap funds of LIC and GIC. As of now, LIC and GIC are required to invest 75 and 70 percent of the funds in Government and Government guaranteed securities--where interest rate is very low--and other socially-oriented sectors as may be directed by the Government. The committee has recommended that this should be reduced to 50 pe cent and 35 percent so that the return from investments will be more. Considering the fact that LIC has funds of Rs40,000 crore, the Government stands to lose crores of rupees. "LIC policies are not attractive as far as other instruments of savings are concerned. Their rates of premium are probably highest in the world," says a report of the Indian Merchants Chamber [IMC] on reforms in the insurance sector. Industry circles generally feel that LIC has become too large an organisation having seven zonal offices, 93 divisional offices and 1,900 branch offices. Will the Government make LIC--which is now functioning with a ridiculously low capital of Rs five crore--a public limited company? It remains to be seen. So is the divestment of 50 per cent GIC's capital to the public. LIC and GIC mandarins and their trade unions still dish out the social-responsibility factor to prolong opening up of the insurance sector. "Will the private sector and foreign companies go to rural areas?" asks a former LIC official, while refusing to accept the fact that efficiency has been sacrificed at the altar of protectionism. The private sector feels that the insurance sector is still vastly untapped, thanks to poor marketing by the public sector behemoths. The recommendation of the Malhotra committee that new entrants in life insurance should be required to transact a certain minimum business in rural areas and new general insurers should write a certain minimum rural non-traditional business will offset the complaint that private sector will avoid rural areas, it is felt. Earlier private insurance companies were nationalised mainly on the allegation that these firms were misusing public funds for other purposes. The committee's recommendation that no insurance company should invest in its affiliate, whether incorporated or not, is expected to take care of the fear that funds will be misused. The IMC report has argued that prudential norms and statutory requirements recommended by the Narasimhan committee for banks should be made applicable to the insurance sector. By setting up an insurance regulatory authority in the form of a statutory autonomous board--a la the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) in the capital market-level playing ground can be assured for both public and private sectors. Indiscriminate entry of any Tom, Dick and Harry can be prevented by stipulating a minimum paid-up capital of Rs 100 crore for new entrants as is in the case of new private banks. If earlier indications are anything to go by, there is bound to be intense pulls and counter-pulls inside and outside the Government when it comes to implementation of the report. To what extent the report will be implemented, is anybody's guess.
