I was indeed astonished to hear this. The pride of Shanghai's joint-venture enterprises, this company manufactures products that sell very quickly; why has it fallen into such a predicament? This is not the only example. A medical equipment company in southern China, about which foreign businessmen had been optimistic, recently incurred a loss. Everyone was baffled upon hearing the news. The first joint-venture enterprise emerged in China in 1980, and there are more than 100,000 foreign-invested enterprises in the country. The direct introduction of foreign capital totals tens of billions of U.S. dollars, presenting a scene of rivalry for supremacy and playing an important role in China's economic life. Statistics show that the per capita output value, per capita profit and tax, as well as the labor productivity of foreign-invested enterprises are higher than those of Chinese-funded enterprises. Foreign-invested enterprises have introduced capital, technology, and advanced management methods and operational forms. This is why the people in many state-owned enterprises say: The "moon" imported from abroad is indeed rounder than our "moon"! But it is hard to understand that, following the increase in investments, the "foreign moon" is no longer "round": Some foreign-invested enterprises have incurred losses each year and seem to have an uncertain future. Are They Really Incurring Losses or Are They Pretending To Suffer From Losses? The losses incurred by foreign-invested enterprises can be classified as follows: The first are normal losses. Over the last few years, a large number of foreign-invested enterprises have started their business in China, accounting for 30 to 40 percent of the total number of enterprises in operation. These enterprises have just started operation (such as running hotels), so they are still in a debt repayment and trial production period. In addition, some foreign investors have had ambitions that were too great when they arrived in China, like a "tiger wanting to eat the sky," and their mistakes in finding markets has also affected the development and sales of their products. These enterprises account for about half of the loss-incurring enterprises, a case similar to that in developed countries. The second is abnormal losses, which are mainly as follows: Losses in accounting. Some people say: "State-owned enterprises have purposely reduced their losses, whereas foreign-invested enterprises have purposely exaggerated their losses." These remarks are not unreasonable. Last year only 25 percent of the foreign-invested enterprises in Beijing incurred losses, but they exaggerated it to 50 percent. To fully take advantage of the preferential policy of "two exemptions, three reductions," some foreign-invested enterprises have regarded the profit-making year as a loss-incurring year to evade taxes. A strange situation has even emerged in which some enterprises have registered consecutive losses or zero profits, but, in pooling capital, they keep increasing their investment and recruiting more employees. In 1987 a Xiamen joint-venture company's investment was $900,000, and its current assets amount to 100 million yuan, but the company has been infamous for its longstanding "losses." Losses caused by profit transfers. Wholly-owned foreign-invested enterprises account for about 20 percent of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises. Some wholly-owned foreign-invested enterprises (mostly Hong Kong and Taiwan invested enterprises) have made tacit agreements with enterprises outside the country by taking advantage of their imports and exports. When importing raw materials and equipment, they raise the prices on the import declaration forms; when exporting finished products, they reduce the prices on the export declaration forms, and sell the products outside the country at high prices. This transfers the profits to regions outside the country. Foreign businessmen in some joint-venture enterprises also resort to this "clandestine" method of transferring profits which should have been shared by both sides, leaving losses for the joint-venture enterprises. Foreign businessmen in some joint-venture enterprises introduce obsolete or poor-quality equipment at high prices, so that, the higher the prices, the more percentage of shares they hold, and the higher profits they enjoy. Moreover, high-priced equipment has caused an increase in the enterprises' production costs and a decrease in their profits. This also constitutes a loss. Losses due to operation and management. Quite a number of small and medium joint-venture enterprises do not have clear management responsibility or duties. Only when there is a purchase order will the director of the foreign side appear; on ordinary occasions, he will not. So some enterprises cannot even hold board of directors meetings, and only temporary measures are applied to daily operations, thus causing operational confusion and a decline in economic returns. Some foreign investors in China have merged their offices with the joint-venture enterprises, causing large-scale operations and low output. In this case, these enterprises have inevitably incurred losses. Some representatives of the Chinese side let the joint-venture enterprises take charge of the workers' welfare, but personnel from outside the country working in these enterprises have major expenses. Such a person in a Shanghai or Guangzhou joint-venture enterprise requires at least $150,000 a year for his salary and daily expenses. Some foreign investors force the joint-venture enterprises to pay the expenses of their mother companies. Furthermore, some foreign-invested enterprises have rushed to start their operations with obsolete equipment and inadequate funds. It is difficult for them to carry out technical transformation or update the equipment, and this has resulted in delays in their production and operations and has finally caused losses. The "Foreign Moon" Is Also a Moon Foreign-invested enterprises constitute a vital force in the national economy and whether they incur losses or make profits affects the entire process of utilizing foreign capital. On the whole, though some foreign-invested enterprises are incurring losses, they are not as serious as some people imagine. Some of these enterprises are improving, and we should soberly understand and appraise this situation. Press reports over the last few days indicate that 80 percent of the 4,000-odd foreign-invested enterprises operating in Shanghai are making profits. As a matter of fact, there are complicated factors causing the foreign-invested enterprises to incur losses. "Paying learning fees" in the course of introducing foreign capital is inevitable. Most of the foreign investors in China are abiding by the principle of "mutual benefit," but some of them are playing tricks to make exorbitant profits by taking advantage of the Chinese side's eagerness to introduce foreign capital and its lack of experience in international economic cooperation. The most important thing is that we should acknowledge this fact: The "foreign moon" is also a moon. When providing a preferential policy, we should be bold in "closing the loopholes" in all areas. Only thus will both sides make common development and will enterprises thrive. Tax evasion generally exists in the world (particularly in transnational corporations). Tax evasion bears a strong nature of concealment and "rationality." Tax reductions or evasions can be achieved by filing false reports on "losses." Raising the prices of low-price raw materials imported from abroad and transferring profits are common commercial methods. How should we fully utilize foreign capital and ensure the state's and enterprises' profits? An expert has pointed out that, on one hand, we should improve the relevant foreign-related policies and tax laws so that there no loopholes; on the other, we should improve the quality of the Chinese side's personnel, gather information on the international market situation (such as the buying and selling prices of commodities) and customers (such as conducting inquiries, surveys, or asset appraisals), establish intelligence or information networks with Chinese organizations stationed abroad or accounting offices which have business relations with China, to promptly close loopholes and reduce losses. In particular, qualified accountant offices or other authoritative organizations should be invited to appraise the material invested as stock by foreign businessmen, to avoid being led by the nose by foreign businessmen. The management and operation of foreign-invested enterprises should be gradually standardized, with a focus on the cautious selection of construction projects to be carried out, to prevent errors and mistakes. The introduction of unmarketable products or equipment should not be approved. We should not be overanxious for quick results in enterprises whose conditions are not yet mature. We should factually determine the expenditure standards for managerial personnel, establish a supervisory system, and train a number of foreign sales professionals and accountants for the Chinese side. In the course of operation, we should strictly practice the principle of "jointly undertaking risks and commonly enjoying profits" and prevent enterprises from "incurring losses without cause." Of course, cooperation in all fields is necessary to change the situation of losses in foreign-invested enterprises.
