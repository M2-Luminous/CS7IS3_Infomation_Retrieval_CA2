FBIS4-16292 "drsov073_v_94002" FBIS-SOV-94-073 Daily Report 14 Apr 1994 Lithuania President's Comments After Council of Europe Speech Noted President's Comments After Council of Europe Speech Noted WS1504085594 Tallinn BNS in English 1614 GMT 14 Apr 94 WS1504085594 Tallinn BNS English BFN [Text] STRASBOURG, 14 Apr, BNS -- Abolition of the death penalty and relations with Russia dominated the questions that Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas was asked after his speech in the CE [Council of Europe] Parliamentary Assembly Thursday [14 April]. There were also questions about the status of Poles and sexual minorities in Lithuania, as well as about the private TELE-3 TV station. Answering a question on Russian transit to the Kaliningrad region through Lithuania, Brazauskas said he and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed that the problem would be discussed after a package of bilateral agreements between their countries is signed. The Lithuanian president claimed Russia's demand "to open an unrestricted corridor" through Lithuania is hardly understandable. Commenting on Russia's statements about the "near abroad," Brazauskas said it would be best if Russia would explain itself the meaning of the concepts "near abroad" and "zone of influence." If a zone of influence means cultural and economic cooperation, Lithuania has interests in Russia, where some 100,000 Lithuanians live since the times of Stalinism, he said. Discussing the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Baltic states, Brazauskas said the problem and Russia's admission to the CE are interrelated. In his view, the problem will be resolved this year. Discussing the irreversibility of independence processes, the Lithuanian leader said he is an optimist and thinks that times of interfering with the internal affairs of a another country have passed. Brazauskas confirmed that capital punishment still exists in Lithuania. The Lithuanian leader said three persons have been executed during his term of office, and two more convicts are on death row. The president noted that a virtually Soviet-type criminal code is still effective in Lithuania, but a new one is ready, according to which the death penalty would be applied only in special cases, such as cruel murder of several persons. Brazauskas expressed hope that the Lithuanian parliament will adopt the new criminal code this year. Answering Polish representative Janusz Szymanski's question about the status of the Polish minority in Lithuania, Brazauskas said the rights of ethnic minorities in Lithuania are protected by the Constitution and other laws. The president also noted that the number of Poles in Lithuania is 270,000, but not 400,000 as was indicated by the Polish lawmaker. There is no international aspect in the status of the Polish minority in Lithuania, and all minor problems that do occur are successfully resolved by the governments, Brazauskas said. In his words, such problems, if they will occur, can be discussed during his upcoming meeting with Polish President Lech Walesa in Vilnius 26 April. Estonia's representative asked about Lithuania's contribution to the creation of a Baltic peacekeeping battalion and its functions. Brazauskas said the battalion is primarily meant for maintaining peace in other "or maybe our regions." The president said a Baltic peacekeeping battalion should be ready for action after about a year. Brazauskas said sexual minorities is not a problem requiring special attention in Lithuania. The president said he never dealt with any such problems, except knowing that punishment for homosexuality has been abolished in Lithuania. A representative of Iceland asked whether it is true that the private TELE-3 TV is being closed down in Lithuania. Brazauskas answered that two out of three TV channels in Lithuania are commercial and nobody intends to close them down. "But transmitter rent has to be paid." Brazauskas denied allegations that government positions are too widely represented in the Lithuanian press. "We have so much freedom that we don't even know how to make use of it," the president said. He noted, however, that the press "works hard, reveals much evil and helps the government."
