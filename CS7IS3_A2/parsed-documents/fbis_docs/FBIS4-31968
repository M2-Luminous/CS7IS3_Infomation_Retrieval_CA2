Delegation Head Frank Swaelen told Serbian Minister Without Portfolio Vekoslav Sosevic that the E.U. viewed as unacceptable the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia, says a statement released by the province's information secretariat in Pristina. Sosevic and representatives of the Kosovo district informed the C.S.C.E. delegation that all political disputes in the province stemmed from years of separatist activity of Albanian extremists and their aspirations for the creation of an Albanian state in Serbian territory. They explained that this was why ethnic Albanian parties in Kosovo-Metohija were refusing dialogue with Serbian authorities, although one had been offered many times. These political groupings will persevere in their separatist aspirations and will continue to avoid a dialogue with the Serbian authorities as long as there is the least sign of support from individual international factors, said Sosevic. Swaelen told reporters after the meeting that the C.S.C.E. wanted to examine the possibility of reincorporating Yugoslavia in the C.S.C.E., (its membership was suspended in the summer of 1992) and to this end was collecting information about the situation in Serbia's provinces of Kosovo-Metohija and Vojvodina and the region of Raska (Sandzak) which is shared by the Yugoslav Republics of Serbia and Montenegro. He said he was optimistic about the chances of a dialogue between Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo-Metohija. After the delegation's meeting with ethnic Albanian representatives on Thursday, the vice-president of the most influential ethnic Albanian party -- the Democratic Alliance of Kosovo -- Fehmi Agani said that the talk was informative rather than anything else and the representatives had informed the C.S.C.E. delegation of their well-known stands. A strong ethnic Albanian separatist movement has been active in Kosovo-Metohija for decades. it is openly advocating the province's secession from Serbia and Yugoslavia and annexation to neighbouring Albania.
