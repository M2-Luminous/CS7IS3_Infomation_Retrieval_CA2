Mr. Owada will succeed Yoshio Hatano, who has served nearly four years. Foreign Minister Hata decided to appoint Mr. Owada who has an experience as the former vice minister to the post because there is a great possibility that Japan will become a permanent member of the UN Security Council. Mr. Owada is father of the crown princess. Originally, there was a plan to appoint him as ambassador to the United States or ambassador to the UK. Moreover, Foreign Minister Hata decided on the following personnel changes: Ambassador to Thailand Hiroaki Fujii will succeed Hiroshi Kitamura as ambassador to the UK; Consul-General in San Francisco Atsushi Tokinoya will succeed Yukio Sato as North American Affairs Bureau chief; Ambassador to the ROK Yutaka Kawashima will succeed Tadashi Ikeda as Asian Affairs Bureau chief; and Consul-General in Los Angeles Koichi Haraguchi will succeed Kazuo Ogura as Economic Affairs Bureau chief.
