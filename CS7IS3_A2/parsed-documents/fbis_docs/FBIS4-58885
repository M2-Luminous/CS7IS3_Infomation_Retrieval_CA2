[passage omitted] The arrangements for the summit were made after a meeting held between Lebanese President al-Hirawi and U.S. Ambassador in Beirut Mark Hambley. Responsible Syrian sources in Damascus have stated that the two presidents discussed and held consultations on the new developments in the region and the results of Christopher's visit and the Israeli proposals and ideas he brought with him on the peace process, withdrawals from the Golan, dismantling of the settlements, and especially the Lebanese question. They also discussed the position of the two countries regarding the current contacts for the resumption of the negotiations in Washington, which is what Christopher is now working for, particularly since the final signing of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The two sides also reviewed the situation in Lebanon and bilateral relations. The arrival of President al-Hirawi, Speaker Birri, and Prime Minister al-Hariri was sudden and came after a meeting in Beirut between President al-Hirawi and the U.S. ambassador who delivered a message to him from Washington on the peace process. According to Lebanese sources, the message dealt with the situation in southern Lebanon and called on Lebanon to seek a settlement with Israel, disarm Hizballah, and put an end to the Lebanese resistance against Israel and its collaborators. Presidents al-Asad and al-Hirawi reaffirmed coordination of their positions and effective moves to face the negative consequences of the Gaza-Jericho agreement. The sources believe that the U.S. message upset the Lebanese leaders who immediately went to Damascus to discuss the situation. The message warned that Israel might continue its scorched-earth policy and carry out more score-settling operations unless the Lebanese officials quickly cool the situation in the south and unless they rejoin the peace process.
