He is blamed for failing to promptly make available the full text of the Geneva communique to parliamentary members. The parliamentary opposition regards this as the head of state's political retaliation against parliamentary vice speaker Rusudan Beridze, who oversees the work of the staff. Similar statements were made by the Republicans and Charter 91, who are Ilya Chavchavadze Association factions. The parliamentary majority, in fact, agreed with the decision of the head of state and the parliamentary speaker on releasing Hamlet Chipashvili from his duties.
