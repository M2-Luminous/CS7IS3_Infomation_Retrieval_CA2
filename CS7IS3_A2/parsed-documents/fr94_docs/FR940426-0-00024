FR940426-0-00024 FR940426-0-00005 9 CFR Part 91 [Docket No. 93&hyph;106&hyph;2] Ports Designated for the Exportation of Animals AGENCY: Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, USDA. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: We are amending the ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' regulations by adding Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas to the list of ports designated as ports of embarkation and by designating DFW Quarantine as the export inspection facility, for horses only, for that port. The Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport and DFW Quarantine appear to meet the requirements of the regulations for designation as a port of embarkation and an animal export inspection facility, respectively. We are also revising the listing for a port of embarkation in Los Angeles, CA, that has changed its name and telephone number. These actions update the regulations and add a port and an inspection facility through which horses may be processed for export. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 26, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: For information concerning the Texas port, contact Dr. Lisa Ferguson, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 760, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7511. For information concerning the California port, contact Dr. Michael David, Senior Staff Veterinarian, Import-Export Animals Staff, National Center for Import-Export, Veterinary Services, APHIS, USDA, room 761, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, MD 20782, (301) 436&hyph;7511. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Background The regulations in 9 CFR part 91, ``Inspection and Handling of Livestock for Exportation'' (referred to below as the regulations), prescribe conditions for exporting animals from the United States. The regulations state, among other things, that all animals, except animals being exported to Canada or Mexico, must be exported through designated ports of embarkation. To receive designation as a port of embarkation, a port must have export inspection facilities available for the inspection, holding, feeding, and watering of animals prior to exportation to ensure that the animals meet certain requirements specified in the regulations. To receive approval as an export inspection facility, the regulations provide that a facility must meet specified standards in ยง91.14(c) concerning materials, size, inspection implements, cleaning and disinfection, feed and water, access, testing and treatment, location, disposal of animal wastes, lighting, and office and rest room facilities. On November 12, 1993, we published in the Federal Register (58 FR 59962&hyph;59963, Docket No. 93&hyph;106&hyph;1), a proposal to amend the regulations by designating the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas as a port of embarkation for horses. DFW Quarantine in Lewisville, TX, was proposed as the export inspection facility for that port, for horses only. We also proposed to make changes in the regulations indicating the name and telephone number changes undertaken by the export inspection facility currently listed as Steifel Bros. Livestock in Los Angeles, CA. We solicited comments for our proposal for a 30-day comment period ending December 13, 1993. We did not receive any comments. The facts presented in the proposed rule still provide the basis for this final rule. Therefore, based on the rationale set forth in the proposed rule, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule without change. Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866. In 1992, there were over 73,000 horses exported out of the United States. Approximately 60,000 horses (82 percent) were exported to Canada, mostly through northern land border ports, while about 6,000 horses (8 percent) were exported to Western Europe by way of John F. Kennedy Airport in New York. The remaining exports included about 3,700 horses to Latin America, about 3,500 horses to Asia, and a small number of horses to Australia, New Zealand, and Africa. Horses exported to Latin America generally were shipped through Miami, while exports to Asia generally were shipped through Los Angeles. Although we do not know how many horses will be exported out of the United States through the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, we do not expect the number to exceed 5,000 horses annually. Further, we believe that only a few entities will engage in the export of horses from Dallas/Fort Worth and that they all will be small entities, having 100 or fewer employees. We believe, therefore, that this action will have no significant impact on horse exports from the United States. Moreover, we expect any impact to be beneficial, since the proposal establishes an additional, possibly less expensive, port for the export of horses from the United States. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Executive Order 12372 This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. (See 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V.) Executive Order 12778 This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule: (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule. Paperwork Reduction Act This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq. ).
