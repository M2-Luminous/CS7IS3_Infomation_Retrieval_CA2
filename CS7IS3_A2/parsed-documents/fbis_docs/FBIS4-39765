During his conversation with journalists Thursday he reminded that while working over the draft the State Duma and the government found an internal reserve in the budget totaling 8.5 trillion rubles. The funds have been primarily channeled to support the Army (3.5 trillion rubles) -- for the construction of houses for servicemen and for conversion. Rybkin underlined that this article is viewed as "a protected one", that is, it will not depend upon the level of revenues collection. The amount intended to finance the transfer of social facilities from the budget of enterprises to the budget of RF [Russian Federation] constituent members has been doubled. Rybkin noted that they had found an opportunity to increase financial support for science and education. He also reminded that the State Duma passed a decision to create a special supra-budget fund into which additional incomes from privatization will be forwarded (from July 1 privatization will be done with money as opposed to cheques). The government foresaw that a total of 1.2 trillion rubles received from privatization would be channeled into the budget, meanwhile experts of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy estimate that this sum should be no less than 15 trillion rubles. All money from this supra-budget fund will be forwarded to build houses for servicemen, Rybkin stressed. "If the Federation Council has this information at its disposal and if they want to participate in the law-making process then the success will be ensured," believes Rybkin. "The nation has no more money than there is in the country in reality, one should cut one's coat according to one's cloth," Rybkin said. He expressed the supposition that "someone wants to destruct [as received] the budget in order to spend when and how much he wants, including both the currency incomes and foreign economic activity." At times, according to his estimate, "somebody skillfully exploits the dissatisfaction of the deputies" and this is "disgraceful politicizing," he believes. At the same time Ivan Rybkin has no doubts that the State Duma will vote for the draft budget in its third reading which will probably take place in a week. This will be a formal voting, he said, because the third reading implies only juridical clarification of the law's wording.
