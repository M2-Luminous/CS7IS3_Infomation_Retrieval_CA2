He said today on Hesse radio that Germany could not avoid concessions within the framework of EU [European Union] harmonization. It was "completely unrealistic" to imagine that European partners would endorse the German Government's political principles on arms exports drawn up in 1982. Within the EU, sensible compromises would therefore have to be achieved that were in line with moral considerations and took account of international obligations, Bohl said. But there was no question of this opening the door to unrestricted arms exports, he said.
