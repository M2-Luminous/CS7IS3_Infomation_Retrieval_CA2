FBIS3-48799 "dreas019__a94015" FBIS-EAS-94-019-A Document Type:Daily Report 28 January 1994 ANNEX Japan * Local Government Ties to Construction Sector * Roots in Local Assemblies 942B0010A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN in Japanese 4 Oct 93 p 2--FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY 942B0010A Tokyo ASAHI SHIMBUN Language: Japanese Article Type:CSO [Unattributed article: "General Contractors Produce Corruption: Prefectural Assemblies' Overall Shift to Government Party; Supervisory Function Declines; Also Fear of Checking `Decentralization'"] [Text] Following after the governor of Ibaraki Prefecture, the governor of Miyagi Prefecture has also been arrested on suspicion of receiving bribes from general contractors. Beside the criticism of whether there was not, in the manner of placing orders for public works, a foundation which spawned corruption, these scandals involving public works ordered by prefectures are also inviting observations as to whether the oversight function of prefectural assemblies was functioning in a healthy manner. It can be said that the basis of local government is being shaken because the so-called "phenomenon of a shift to the government party" of prefectural assemblies has become a nationwide trend, and the number of governors who are retired officials from central government agencies has risen. If things go on like this, the "decentralization of power" which the Hosokawa government espouses can also fade. Governor Shuntaro Honma of Miyagi Prefecture, who was arrested on suspicion of having accepted bribes, aided by such things as Recruit-scandal distrust and helped also by the defeat-by-default of the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP], was elected in March 1989 with the endorsement and support of the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], the United Social Democratic Party [USDP], and some conservative members of the prefectural assembly. But four years later, in February 1993, the parties supporting him had increased to four: the LDP, SDPJ, Komeito, and the Japan Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and he defeated by a great margin a candidate endorsed by the Japan Communist Party [JCP]. This kind of phenomenon is seen in every region throughout Japan, and as will be clear from the table, even though there are differences in the combinations, in general, it has become normal for all parties other than the JCP to share in the relationships of endorsement and support of the current governors of urban and rural prefectures.

gubernatorial election of 1991 he received the endorsement and support of three parties--the LDP, Komeito, and DSP--and of the Ibaraki Rengo, so, including the SDPJ, which voted independently, it was, in fact, a sharing by four parties. In the gubernatorial election on 26 September to choose his successor, four conservative parties: the LDP, Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Japan New Party, and new Sakigake [Harbinger] party, cooperated, transcending the government-opposition party framework, and elected a former Home Affairs Ministry division chief. But the former mayor of Mito City, who did not receive party support, was catching up with him, and the turnout dropped below 40 percent, so criticism of the central political parties by the people of the prefecture stood out sharply. Why does "a shift to the government party" advance apart from voter consciousness? Professor Hitoshi Abe (political science) of the University of the Air says, "Every party gains a great benefit by a shift to the government party because the volume and speed of information related to prefectural government is incomparably greater than that of opposition parties, and its "influence" regarding administration is also effective." But, on the other hand, he points out that an assembly's supervisory function toward prefectural government certainly declines. Following the arrest of Governor Honma, a certain governor in eastern Japan said, "One can point out two problems in the arrest of two governors. One is the individual problem of the evil or flaw in ethical view of being elected many times. The other is the fact that governors are leaders who can act promptly in response to situations. In addition to being chosen by direct election, they have exclusive control of such things as the authority to compile budgets and to manage personnel. Concentration of authority leads to a trap." At a press conference on 28 September, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, who has served as governor of Shiga Prefecture, also pointed out the dangerous nature of the corruption that lies dormant in the "position of governor," saying, "If one lowers one's guard for a moment, one will be led astray. It is a battle with one's own heart." Of current urban and provincial governors, 27 have a background in central government agencies or in government-related agencies. Although one cannot condemn them wholesale, one expects there are many cases in which "connections with the central government" were used as selling points when running for election. It is surmised that, to that extent, it was expected by constituents that the governors would have skill in such things as attracting large national projects. Concerning the influence that general contractor corruption exerts on "decentralization," a Ministry of Home Affairs executive says, "The view is spreading that corruption would advance even further if we delegated power from the central government to the provinces." It seems that the scandal this time involves substantive questioning of local autonomy and the proper nature thereof.
