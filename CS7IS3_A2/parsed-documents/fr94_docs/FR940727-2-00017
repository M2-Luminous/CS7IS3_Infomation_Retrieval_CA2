The purpose of the proposed testing is to determine the biological activity of several among 16 nonindigenous strains of Bacillus thuringiensis against the Colorado potato beetle on potatoes and among 17 nonindigenous strains of Bacillus thuringiensis against Heliothis species on cotton. Potato testing will take place in New York and Wisconsin over a 3&hyph;year period with 0.11 acres per year per strain being evaluated. Treated potatoes will be destroyed subsequent to testing. Cotton testing will take place in Florida and Mississippi over a 3&hyph;year period with 0.66 acres per strain per year being evaluated. Cotton treated with these strains will not be processed into food or feed items. Following review of the Ciba-Geigy Corporation application and any comments received in response to this Notice, EPA will decide whether or not an Experimental Use Permit is required.
