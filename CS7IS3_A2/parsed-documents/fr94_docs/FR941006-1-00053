FR941006-1-00053 FR941006-1-00010 III. Deletion Procedures The NCP provides that EPA shall not delete a site from the NPL until the State in which the release was located has concurred, and the public has been afforded an opportunity to comment on the proposed deletion. Deletion of a site from the NPL does not affect responsible party liability or impede agency efforts to recover costs associated with response efforts. The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assist Agency management. EPA Region II will accept and evaluate public comments before making a final decision to delete. The Agency believes that deletion procedures should focus on notice and comment at the local level. Comments from the local community may be the most pertinent to deletion decisions. The following procedures were used for the intended deletion of the Radium Chemical Company site: 1. EPA Region II has recommended deletion and has prepared the relevant documents. 2. The State of New York has concurred with the deletion decisions. 3. Concurrent with this Notice of Intent to Delete, a notice has been published in local newspapers and has been distributed to appropriate federal, state and local officials, and other interested parties. This notice announces a thirty-day public comment period on the deletion package, which starts two weeks from the date of the notice, October 15, 1994, and will conclude on November 15, 1994. 4. The Region has made all relevant documents available in the Regional Office and local site information repositories. The comments received during the notice and comment period will be evaluated before any final decision is made. EPA Region II will prepare a Responsiveness Summary, which will address the comments received during the public comment period. The deletion will occur after the EPA Regional Administrator places a Notice in the Federal Register . The NPL will reflect any deletions in the next final update. Public notices and copies of the Responsiveness Summary will be made available to local residents by the Region II Office. IV. Basis for Intended Deletion of the Radium Chemical Company Site The Radium Chemical Company (RCC) site is located at 60&hyph;06 27th Avenue in Woodside, Queens County, New York, in a light industrial/residential sector. The site consisted of a 1-story brick building (and a part of a second brick building which shared a wall with this building) bordered on the west by 27th Avenue and on the east by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), a major roadway into New York City. Founded in New York in 1913, RCC initially produced luminous paint for watch dials and instruments. Later, the company manufactured, leased and sold radium-226 in the form of implant sources to hospitals, medical centers, and research laboratories. In the late 1950's, RCC transferred its operations to the present location in Woodside, New York. The radium and radon devices were stored on-site in lead containers in a brick vault room. Eventually the demand for radium sources lagged as they were replaced with advanced radiotherapy techniques using cesium and cobalt sources. Subsequently, many leased radium sources were returned to RCC and were stored on-site. In 1983, the State of New York suspended the RCC operating license due to various disposal and safety infractions. RCC attempted to obtain permission to begin operations again in 1986, but was denied. The New York State Department of Labor issued its first Stipulation and Order against RCC on October 17, 1987, for the removal of the radium sources and decontamination of the building. The owner was unable to finance the remediation and, subsequently, abandoned the building. This resulted in a second Stipulation and Order, issued on July 20, 1988, determining that the facility could not be maintained and that it was de facto abandoned by RCC. Remaining on-site were a large number of radium-containing sealed devices, some of which were suspected of releasing radium and radon gas. The amount of radium-226 at the site was established to be 110 Curies (Ci). Also on-site were hundreds of containers of laboratory chemicals, many of which were reactive, corrosive, flammable, and/or potentially shock-sensitive. In July 1988, at the request of the State of New York, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undertook a limited emergency removal action under CERCLA, et seq., to secure the facility and remove the radioactive sources. EPA provided 24-hour security and initiated measures to stabilize the site. By August 1988, EPA had erected fencing around the perimeter and installed remote monitoring surveillance, a foam fire suppressant system, special vents, and other safety measures. In February 1989, EPA contracted with Chem-Nuclear Systems, Inc. to remove the radium sources and other hazardous materials from the site and transport them to approved disposal facilities. The removal action was completed in October 1989. Approximately 120 Ci of radium in the form of sources, contaminated debris, and loose radium salts and luminous compounds were removed from the site. This material was disposed of at facilities located in Richland, Washington and Beatty, Nevada, both operated by U.S. Ecology. On February 10, 1989, at EPA's request, the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) issued a Public Health Advisory to alert the public, EPA, and the State of New York of a serious threat to human health, based on the threatened release of radium-226 from the RCC site. In an August 1989 special NPL update, EPA proposed the RCC site for the NPL based on the ATSDR advisory. On November 21, 1989, the RCC site was added to the National Priorities List. EPA completed a Focused Feasibility Study (FFS) of the site in April 1990. Excessive levels of Rn-222 and Ra-226 remained in the RCC facility, along with various radium contaminated hazardous chemicals. On June 21, 1990, EPA signed a Record of Decision (ROD) selecting a remedy for the RCC site. The ROD called for the following remedial activities at the site: decontamination of the RCC facility; dismantlement of the RCC building; excavation of contaminated soils and subsurface structures; and transport and disposal of wastes to an approved waste disposal facility. The EPA community relations activities at the site included a public meeting in May 1990 to present the results of the FFS and the preferred alternative for remediation of the site. All public comments received were addressed. A major concern of the public was the disruption to the local businesses caused by street closings. EPA held subsequent meetings with the local business owners to determine the least obtrusive method for achieving our needs.
