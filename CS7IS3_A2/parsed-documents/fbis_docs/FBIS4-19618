Indeed, if the Netherlands were one big university, the D66 [Democrats 66] would be the biggest party and [D66 leader] Hans van Mierlo would be the unchallenged leader. This was revealed by a representative sample conducted among the future generation of intellectuals by Specifiek Universitair Magazine (SUM). Another remarkable fact, especially in comparison with the 60's, is that the PvdA [Labor Party] would be wiped out. The figures: The D66 gets almost 30 percent of the student votes, the VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy] 19 percent, the GroenLinks [Green Left] 13 percent, the CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] 12 percent, and the PvdA only 5 percent. The students make a fairly conscious choice. Almost half of them determine their choice based on a party's ideas and principles. This is what should alarm the PvdA most. [passage omitted]
