FR941012-0-00088 FR941012-0-00011 In the preamble of the proposed rule, OSHA explained that this exemption was included due to the regional nature of the use of cable logging systems. State plan States in the far west that have the most significant cable logging activity have developed very detailed cable logging standards. Many commenters testified that the hazards of cable yarding in those states have been adequately covered by the specific state standards (Ex. 2&hyph;18, 2&hyph;19, 2&hyph;20, 2&hyph;21, 2&hyph;23, 5&hyph;17, 5&hyph;27, 5&hyph;39, 5&hyph;45, 5&hyph;74 through 5&hyph;92, 38J, 38K). However, some commenters discussed the need for increased regulation of cable yarding operations on the national level because they assert there is increasing use of cable yarding in non-western regions of the country where no State standards exist (Ex 5&hyph;19, 5&hyph;20, 5&hyph;36). After careful consideration of the comments, OSHA has decided to retain the exclusion for cable yarding operations in this final rule for several reasons. First, the State logging standards that address cable yarding are detailed specification standards that adequately address the unique hazards associated with the construction and use of cable yarding in those particular States, that are all western States. For example, those standards deal with construction of cable yarding systems on steep slopes that are predominently in those western States. Those State cable yarding standards will not be affected by the Federal logging standard. Second, there is no evidence in this rulemaking record that those standards are not addressing particular hazards associated with cable yarding in those States. Third, OSHA agrees with the APA that the prevalent use of cable yarding is in those States that have their own standards that include requirements for cable yarding. None of the commenters representing non-western logging establishments indicated that cable yarding is being performed in their area or by their member companies. Fourth, OSHA believes there is not sufficient information and data in the record regarding cable yarding activities in non-western States to determine at this point whether the various cable yarding regulations of the western States would be appropriate to apply nationwide. For example, logging in western States is usually clear cut logging while selective cutting is more prominent in non-western states (Ex. 2&hyph;1). Other logging conditions vary across regions, such as tree size and type, weather, and terrain. For example, logging operations in western States are three times more likely to be on steep slopes, where skidding may be impossible (Ex. 2&hyph;1). OSHA believes that these differences might affect what would constitute appropriate cable yarding rules for non-western States. Therefore, OSHA believes this issue requires further study before the Agency promulgates a national cable yarding standard. However, OSHA emphasizes that the exclusion of cable yarding is only for the construction and use of the cable yarding system itself. Other parts of the logging operation taking place where cable yarding systems are present will be covered by this standard. Just as this standard extends the pulpwood logging standard to cover the same hazards experienced elsewhere in the logging industry, OSHA believes that these same hazards need to be covered by this standard when cable yarding operations are being performed. For example, the hazards for loggers felling trees exist regardless of how the trees or logs are moved about the work site. To this end, the Agency has included in the final standard the felling of the trees and the other operations that are conducted in conjunction with the use of a cable yarding system. It should also be noted that the use of yarding machines with winches for playing out and retrieving cable is not considered cable yarding for the purposes of this standard. Therefore, this operation is covered by this final logging standard. In this type of log retrieval, a yarding machine plays out cable, to which is attached a choker sling that is secured to a tree or log. Once the sling is attached to the log, the cable is wound onto the drum and the tree or log is then yarded by skidding while attached to and supported by the cable on the winch. This system of yarding is oftentimes used when logging is being conducted along a roadway or other area where access to the area where the tree is felled is not practical and the area where the yarder (skidder) is operating is on the roadway or in an accessible area.
