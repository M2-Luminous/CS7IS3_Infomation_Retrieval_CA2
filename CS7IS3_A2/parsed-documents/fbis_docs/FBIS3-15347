I cannot give you his name right now because he is afraid for his life and that of his close relatives living in Lithuania. The visitor brought me Saturday's issue of the city newspaper KLAIPEDA (issue no. 38, 26 February). On page one the newspaper carried a photograph of Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov, former chief of the political department of the Baltic Fleet's coast defense division, when he was in Klaipeda. The comment under the headline "'Enemy of the People' Detained?" read like this: "It has been learned from unofficial sources that Vitaliy Leonidovich Yegorov, former chief of the political department of a USSR division stationed in Klaipeda, was detained in Klaipeda yesterday. "A. Grublis, chief of the Klaipeda department of the Lithuanian Republic's security service, stated that nothing of the kind has happened. Nevertheless, when the newspaper had been prepared for the press, those same unofficial but reliable sources gave another guarantee that V.L. Yegorov had been detained and taken to Vilnius where he will be charged with antistate activity during the putsch in August 1991. If these facts are confirmed an international scandal can be expected because V.L. Yegorov is a Russian citizen who is backed by some fairly influential politicians." "Vitaliy Leonidovich rang me late at night and said that he had been forced to hide because they wanted to arrest him. He asked me to go right to the president to request protection for a Russian officer and citizen," my visitor told me. Colonel Vitaliy Yegorov has served a number of years in the coast defense division and I have often had occasion to meet with in the course of my work. Criminal proceedings were instituted against him and Major General Ivan Chernykh, former division commander, two years ago after the events of August 1991. In April 1992, division commander Ivan Chernykh was unlawfully arrested by the Lithuanian prosecutor's office but was released that same day after firm actions by the Russian military and diplomats. I took part in the talks and the newspaper gave a detailed account of this unlawful act by the Lithuanian authorities. Now, three years later, Col Vitaliy Yegorov, another Russian serviceman, has been declared an "enemy of the people" in Klaipeda. Of course, this comment in the Klaipeda city newspaper might have passed unnoticed. But the point is that it appeared right after the parliamentary address by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in which it was stated that Russia has in its possession a great many facts proving that our fellow countrymen are being subjected to discrimination in neighboring states. And it is Russia's duty not just to talk about ending such practices but to do something about it. This publication also appeared after the State Duma adopted the decree on the amnesty which applied among others to the participants in the events of August 1991... Clearly someone had good reason for creating this fuss over the Russian President's statement and the State Duma's decision. They chose for this a target which has become customary in the Baltic region -- a citizen of the Russian Federation and a colonel in the Russian Army. It bears a familiar hallmark...
