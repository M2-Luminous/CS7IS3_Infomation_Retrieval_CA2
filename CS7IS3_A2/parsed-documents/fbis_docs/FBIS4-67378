In her words, contamination of territories located nearby the Siberian chemical plant in Tomsk-7 exceeds the background contamination several times, in some places it is 3000 becquerels per sq.meter. "Discharges of radioactive water from the plant into the Tom river have resulted in its contamination with radionuclides Cobalt- 60, Zinc-65, Manganese-54," said Khotuleva. As she said, the Radioecological Research Center conducted an independent investigation of the consequences of the accident at the Siberian chemical plant which occurred on April 6, 1993 and found out that the territory was additionally contaminated with a short life cycle radionuclides, Ruthenium-103, Niobium-95, and Cerium-144. Ecologists are concerned over the fact that liquid radioactive wastes are being pumped into the underground water layers for storage for a long time already. As Khotuleva declared, a total of 40 Mn cubic meters of liquid wastes, including those which contain plutonium have been pumped under the ground since early fifties till now. "Nobody can rule out possibility that these radioactive materials can appear in reservoirs and in water supply systems intended for drinking," said she.
