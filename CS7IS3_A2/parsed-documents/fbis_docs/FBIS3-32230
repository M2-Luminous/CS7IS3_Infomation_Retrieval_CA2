Such was the case today, because there was none of that anywhere in the country. I think the public force has displayed a temperate attitude in controlling demonstrations, but I also think that there have been regrettable and condemnable (?acts) executed probably by agitators, extremists, and people who [passage indistinct] that prompted the Workers Front to declare a national strike." Through you, I want to thank the country for its behavior. I want to thank the large number of Ecuadoreans who, as I saw on television, did everything possible to go to work in the early hours. "That is what Ecuador needs; that is what the government demands from the Ecuadoran people; that is what the government does to benefit the Ecuadoran people: work." Our efforts are directed at finding ways to develop the country. "To achieve this, sometimes we must take on the responsibility of adopting harsh, drastic measures." However, most Ecuadoreans today showed their willingness to work. The transportation workers went to work in large numbers early today while there were still no demonstrations on the streets. As of now, there are virtually no demonstrations. According to information furnished by the Police, at least 50 percent of the transportation vehicles are circulating. If you have different information, we could estimate an average and reach an agreement about this. I am not claiming that this was the case throughout the day. "There were times when there were obviously no means of transportation on the streets, but now, if you go out into the streets, you will see that there is increasingly more traffic circulating." "That is good, because it will allow those who found it difficult to get to work this morning to return home more easily." I want to tell the country that the government is pleased. It is thankful to the Ecuadoran citizens for their behavior. There have been no tragic developments in the form of violence, loss of life, or major destruction. These types of actions, no matter how legitimate they might be, are not the best way to achieve goals because they actually cause irreversible losses for the country. "What the country loses in one day of paralysis cannot be recovered by redoubling efforts over the following days. The loss remains." Genuine opposition in a genuine democracy is not destructive, it is not negative. Opposition is a basic, significant element that is inherent to the democratic system. It is unacceptable, however, when it is accompanied by a negative position, a position closed to reasoning or dialogue, much less to a violent position. The government has the serious responsibility of managing the country. Our society has had a sick economy. "We have had to adopt measures directed at making the Ecuadoran economy healthy again. This will benefit everyone. We think we have a qualified economic team." We have been attacked for certain reasons and from various fronts. The sectors that have attacked us, however, admit that we are handling economic policy correctly. After lowering inflation to less than 30 percent in a year and six months when the previous government could not do it in four years, we have rights. "We have managed to lower interest rates, and we have maintained a stable exchange rate. We have the right to tell the country that our economic performance is adequate, that it is well directed, and that we will maintain it as long as we do not reach the clear conclusion that it is not working well, that it must be changed or readjusted." I received a report about half and hour ago. As for detainees, the Police force reports that 17 adults and 16 minors were arrested in Quito, and (?two) were arrested in Puerto Viejo. There were no other arrests. "These persons will obviously be turned over to the proper authorities to see that they are tried in keeping with their accountability." As for violence, several people have been injured by stones. As for the complaints filed before the Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees, the government presented its position through legal channels. We think that the sole measure adopted by the government -- because we cannot talk about measures -- was to increase gasoline prices. This measure was in keeping with current regulations and in keeping with the hydrocarbons law that was reformed days ago. "We think that this was done legally and technically. We think this measure will solve the most serious budget problems that were facing the Ecuadoran state and seriously affecting the economy. With the awareness that things are being done correctly and hoping that they will yield results, the government is neither inclined nor has it any reason to think of backing down or withdrawing this measure. "You mentioned possible subsequent acts, uprisings with unpredictable consequences, but I dare say that today's strike gives us an idea of what future actions could entail. We have held talks with the FUT [United Workers Front], and despite today's developments, we are willing to continue meeting with its leaders to discuss certain points that were touched upon during a meeting with the president of the Republic last week, and even to discuss overall aspects of the handling and development of our governmental policy and the FUT's actions, presence, and responsibility in the development of national life." Obviously, we have the same willingness toward the Indians. I have read about an Indian mobilization scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. It is said that there will be no violence; that the mobilization will be limited to certain actions on the streets and highways. The National Transit Council two days ago adopted a measure for Ecuadoran families that is much more constructive than any salary compensation. It refrained from increasing transportation fares. Instead, it increased subsidies to promote the modernization and development of transportation laws. This is a very important social measure. "All the effects that the national government plans to achieve through the correct application of the economic policy, which will be facilitated by the decision made last week, constitute a social policy, because it is directed mainly at ensuring that the state has the resources it needs to create jobs through public projects and to meet Ecuadoreans' education, health, and social welfare needs." "The subsidy is not granted to transportation workers but to the population. The transportation workers are paid so the population will not have to pay higher fares. Consider what an increase of 50 sucres in urban transportation means to each person and each family over the course of a week or a month." The government cannot promise that there will be any measure regarding the salaries to neutralize the effects of the action taken last week. It is easy to say we will give compensation, but that is irresponsible. We must look at the overall picture, we must look at the interrelationship between economic and social aspects. This should never be neglected.
