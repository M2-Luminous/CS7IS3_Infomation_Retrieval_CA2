During his speech, he said that the DPRK and the United States released a joint statement on the principles which the two sides discussed and reached agreement on in the talks and that talks and contacts have taken place to implement the joint statement. Referring to the details of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement, he said that based on the principle of the joint statement, on which the agreement was reached, we have up until today taken practical measures to fairly resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and made sincere efforts to implement the joint statement. He went on to say: The DPRK has unilaterally, temporarily suspended the effectuation of its declaration on withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and resumed dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency. Even under special circumstances, to implement its promise to prove the transparency of its nuclear activities, the DPRK has completely frozen the movement of nuclear materials in its territory and even accepted inspections for guaranteeing the continuity of safeguards. In particular, to fundamentally bring an end to suspicions over our nuclear development, we have even taken a bold decision to replace the existing graphite-moderated atomic reactors with light-water reactors even at the cost of the independence of our nuclear power industry. However, we have not seen any corresponding practical action by the United States [kurona urinun miguk chuguro puto silchonjoguro houngul patchi mothayossumyo], and the recent situation is developing toward the extreme opposite direction. This is completely due to the insincere, unjust acts of the United States, the dialogue partner. He stated a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released a statement on 31 January in connection with the prevailing situation. He introduced the details of the statement.
