According to him, he notified President Yeltsin and Premier Chernomyrdin accordingly. Their attitude to his decision was "sympathetic". "I discussed it with the president, and he understands the situation perfectly." When Chernomyrdin asked him about his attitude to the possibility of giving this job to the prominent economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy, Gaydar said that he "would warmly welcome his candidacy". The Finance Minister, Boris Fedorov, "will take his own decision in the next few days", Gaydar said (Interfax's note: evidently he meant Fedorov's joining Russia's reorganized government). "We discussed this situation in detail with Chubays and decided that it would be expedient to continue his work in the government, at least till the time, when the privatisation program to be concluded before July 1st, 1994, is implemented," said Gaydar. "We hope that the government's policy will not be drastically altered after all," Gaydar noted. According to Gaydar, the Social Security Minister, Ella Pamfilova, has said that "under the circumstances she cannot assume responsibility for the social policy, since she cannot be responsible for the economic policy". As Gaydar said, the Russian Choice faction in the State Duma supported Gaydar's decision and "expressed its readiness for a constructive dialogue and cooperation with the government". Gaydar believes that "the presence of our colleagues in the government is sensible and prudent in a number of directions, particularly in all that is connected with international politics and privatization". "At the same time we must grant government members the opportunity to consider everything once again and decide to what extent they are capable of following the policy they and ourselves view as responsible, and take a decision concerning our participation in the new government proceeding from this," Gaydar said. According to Gaydar, he has no claims on the post of chairman of the State Duma's planning and budget commission, and the Russian Choice faction will support the Yavlinskiy bloc's candidacy for it.
