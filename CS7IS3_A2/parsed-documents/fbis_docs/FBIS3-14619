The columnists are unanimous that the split indicates an erosion of U.S. influence in the Council and growing sympathy with Iraq. Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 19 March carries on page one a 500-word article by Taha al-Basri entitled: "The Blockade Is Bound To Be Eroded." Al-Basri writes that the heated debate within the UN Security Council over the statement it normally releases after every review of the blockade "is tangible proof that the unusual Iraqi steadfastness and the wise leadership of struggler President Saddam Husayn have borne fruit and that the blockade will sooner or later be eroded." The article adds that after more than three years of U.S. absolute domination of the Council "differences have emerged for the first time, splitting the members into two groups." The article continues: "Events of the past three days have clearly shown that a large majority of the members are now convinced that Iraq has the right to demand the lifting of the blockade after it has fulfilled its obligations under the Council resolutions." The article concludes: "By doing so, the member states are defending: first, the interests of their own countries; and second, the clear right that Iraqi diplomacy has been trying to explain to them all along." The paper also publishes in its "Standpoint" column on page two an 800-word article by 'Isa Isma'il al-'Abbadi entitled: "UN Majority is With Iraq." Referring to the split within the Security Council, the article says: "Most big powers, especially France, China, and Russia, and the overwhelming majority of the world states have realized that the United States and Britain are playing a dirty political game that has nothing to do with UN resolutions and regulations, but has a great deal to do with their narrow-minded interests and their calculations to harm the Iraqi people and the other world nations, which have been affected by the unjust blockade that has been imposed on Iraq for more than three years." The article adds: "The U.S. and British Administrations must understand that the world around them is changing and that Iraq has rights and is an influential factor in the region and the world." Concluding, the article says that the world, which is speeding toward the 21st century, aspires for "balanced relations based on common interests, common concern for human progress, and justice." The paper further publishes in its "Attention" column on page tree a 500-word article by Hasan al-Kashif entitled: "After the Non-Resolution." This item too refers to the split within the Security Council and the failure of the member states to come out with the usual periodic statement. It notes that this "non-resolution on the blockade has come as a big resolution to end the United States' new world order," thanks to Iraq's steadfastness and sacrifices under its great historic leader Saddam Husayn. It has also proven, the article adds, that "Washington is not suitable for the role of arbiter, because it has not discarded the garb of pirate and colonialist and is still influenced by the tendencies of domination, plunder, and even invasion and occupation." The article says that by supporting the "clear, firm facts" the UN Security Council members "have regained their role, position, and the respect of world nations and governments, which believe in peace, stability, justice, and fairness. "As for the Arabs," the article concludes "they are put before a test for the umpteenth time. They should either act as Arabs or remain mere followers of U.S. policy and thus fall behind the honest stands by governments of even non-Arab states. This is what we do not wish for any honest Arab." The paper also publishes in its "Windows" column on page seven a 150-word article by Diya' Hasan entitled "The Split Has Occurred and the Rest Will Follow." The columnist notes that the important thing is that a split has occurred in the UN Security Council and that the majority has not given an easy "yes" this time. The article adds that despite the decision to continue the blockade for two more months, this time the decision did not come "by a mere hand signal from America's Madeleine Albright," but following a grueling debate lasting more than two days. The article adds: "The good thing about what happened was the anxiety expressed by some Security Council member states over Tariq 'Aziz's message to the Council, because it vehemently asserted Iraqi rights and pointed to the duties and obligations of the Council, which the Americans and British considered rather excessive under the prevailing logic in the world organization; that is, the logic of superiority and hegemony. But the message was intended to break the back of that useless logic." The article concludes that the Iraqi message succeeded in creating the split, which will be further widened if the member states also act according to their own national interests. Baghdad AL-THAWRAH in Arabic 21 March 1994 publishes in its "Standpoint" column on page two an 800-word article by Sabri Hammadi entitled: "What Does This Split Mean?" Hammadi says the split in the Security Council must have disturbed and embarrassed the U.S. Administration, proving that the Council is no longer "a mere section of the U.S. State Department devoted to serving the aims and interests of the United States and its pampered protege, Israel. Here are three permanent member states in the Council saying no to U.S. hegemony and defending their interests and prestige as big powers." The article adds: "Of course, we do not want to exaggerate by considering the split that occurred as the desired change in the Security Council that will put an end to U.S. tyranny and monopolization. What took place was, however, the beginning of a new phase in the relationship between the permanent member states." The article concludes: "True, despite its significance, the clear split within the Security Council did not achieve the objectives aspired by Iraq, but it must also be said that what happened was a serious and promising start for a more just and fair international stand responding to Iraq's rights and legitimate demands."
