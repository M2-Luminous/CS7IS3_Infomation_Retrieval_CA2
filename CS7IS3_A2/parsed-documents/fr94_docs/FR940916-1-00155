FR940916-1-00155 FR940916-1-00016 (b) Intermediate speed passenger or commuter service utilizing equipment delivered on or before January 1, 1995 shall adhere to the Class 2 brake system test standards for conventional passenger trains described in §§232.411 and 232.413. (c) For all high speed passenger service and all intermediate speed passenger and commuter service utilizing equipment delivered after January 1, 1995, railroads shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written Class 2 train brake system test procedures that are tailored to the specific intermediate or high speed technology employed. Railroads shall use the process described in subpart J of this part to develop the Class 2 test procedures. Railroads shall conduct all Class 2 brake tests on intermediate and high speed passenger and commuter trains in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant to this paragraph. §232.505 Running test. Railroads operating intermediate and high speed passenger and commuter trains shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written running test procedures. Running tests shall be conducted in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant to this paragraph to determine the condition of the train brake system as soon as the speed of the train permits. §232.507 Single car or single passenger train set test. (a) Railroads operating intermediate speed freight trains shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request written single car test procedures tailored to the specific brake technology used. The single car test procedures shall meet or exceed the procedures for the single car test on conventional freight trains described in subpart G of this part. Railroads shall use the process described in subpart J of this part to develop the single car test procedures for intermediate speed freight trains. Railroads shall conduct all single car tests on intermediate speed freight equipment in accordance with the procedures developed pursuant to this paragraph. (b) Intermediate speed passenger or commuter service utilizing equipment delivered on or before January 1, 1995 shall adhere to the single car or single passenger train set test standards for conventional passenger trains described in §232.417. (c) For all high speed passenger service and all intermediate speed passenger and commuter service utilizing equipment delivered after January 1, 1995, railroads shall develop and make available to FRA upon request written single car or single passenger train set test procedures that are tailored to the specific intermediate and high speed technology employed. Railroads shall use the process described in subpart J of this part to develop the test procedures. (d) Railroads shall conduct single car or single passenger train set tests at the intervals given in subpart G of this part. (e) Railroads shall use the process described in subpart G of this part to change the interval between required single car or single passenger train set tests. Subpart G_Single Car Test, Periodic Freight Brake Test, and Single Passenger Train Set Test Requirements §232.601 General requirements. (a) All railroads shall conduct comprehensive periodic freight brake tests, single car tests, or single passenger train set tests to demonstrate that single car or unit train brake systems function as intended. (b) Railroads shall develop, implement, and make available to FRA upon request detailed written test procedures for all periodic freight brake, single car or single passenger train set tests that include the following: (1) Step-by-step instructions for performing the test. (2) Description of any special test equipment or test devices required to perform the tests. (3) Expected results or range of acceptable values for each step of the test.
