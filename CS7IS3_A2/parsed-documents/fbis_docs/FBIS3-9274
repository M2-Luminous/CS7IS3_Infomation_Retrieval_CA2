In accordance with the required procedures, Siemiatkowski's candidacy should be presented to the prime minister by the chief of the Defense Ministry [MON] Piotr Kolodziejczyk. Negotiations concerning a "reflection of the coalition arrangement in MON's civilian section" lasted several months, with some long breaks. All signs are that Minister Kolodziejczyk, who seemed to be unshaken in his conviction in the beginning and who was accused by the chairman of the Sejm National Defense Commission, Jerzy Szmajdzinski (SLD), of "speaking not with his own voice but with the Belweder's" regarding the coalition minister, changed his mind after all. It seems that Kolodziejczyk, who, until recently, categorically opposed "attempts aimed at placing a political commissioner in the ministry," has come to appreciate (under the coalition's pressure because he recently met Aleksander Kwasniewski, among others) the need to establish the post of under secretary of state, who would relieve him of the need to contact the parliament and would also be in charge of the military justice system. Last week, Siemiatkowski also met the MON chief. We found out from circles close to the General Staff, which is the main commanding organ of the Armed Forces of the Polish Republic, that the Army's leadership cadre tends to take a distanced position on the skills of the new deputy defense minister, who so far has had little to do with the Army, except for his membership in the Sejm National Defense Commission. During a recent interview for our newspaper, General Tadeusz Wilecki, who is the chief of the General Staff, emphasized his disapproval of "attempts to adapt MON structures to specific people."
