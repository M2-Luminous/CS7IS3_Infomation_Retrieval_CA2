We could foresee that slogans of Zhirinovskiy's party would be approved by poor people who comprise the majority of the Russian population -- some 70 percent. By the way, such populist ideas will always attract simple people even if they are pronounced by the devil itself. "Russia's Choice," however, has not received the votes it could receive because the elections had not been organized properly. In my opinion, they were let down by their self-assurance of being the only candidates to the new power organs. As for me, the situation in Russia is not tragical at all: The legislature's membership perfectly demonstrates the situation in the state. It is evident that the counterbalance of forces in the Russian Duma will spark heated debates. Meanwhile, the Russian president, who is authorized with great powers, will not allow the opposition forces to show their actual force. In addition, the State Duma will hardly affect the state policy of the Yeltsin team. At the same time, we should not underestimate the elections in Russia. It is symbolic that Russian super-radicals received the majority of seats in the legislature. We should remember that such things could happen in Belarus as well. It seems likely that independent candidates of the Zhirinovskiy type -- at least four in number -- will appear. The victory of the Zhirinovskiy party will cause a chain reaction. This fact should be considered during the election campaign in Belarus. As for the Party of People's Accord, we have got some electoral experience. We have nominated First Deputy Foreign Minister Tarazevich to the Belarusian Supreme Soviet in the Zhodino electoral district. However, the elections failed due to the fact that only 46 percent of the voters participated in them. In my opinion, a 50 percent voting limit should be annulled otherwise elections will never be held. I cannot assess the report presented by People's Deputy Lukashenko. Indeed, corruption is eating our society from top to bottom. The facts revealed by Lukashenko were not surprising neither for politicians, nor for law enforcement officers who provided the deputy with this information. To my mind, Eduard Shirkovskiy, chairman of the Belarusian Committee for State Security, or the State Office of the Prosecutor, or at least the Supreme Soviet Control Chamber should have reported on this issue. Furthermore, in order to account for the accusations, the officials whose names are mentioned in this report should have secured access to these facts before they were brought to the Supreme Soviet deputies. We should learn to behave in a civilized manner. I do not oppose the activities of this legislative commission. This commission should investigate the moral-ethical side of the issue, and coordinate its work with the activities of law enforcement bodies. Only law enforcement officers can assess and make conclusions on the issue.
