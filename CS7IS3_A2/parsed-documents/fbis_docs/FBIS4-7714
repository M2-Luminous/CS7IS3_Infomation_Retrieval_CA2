Their talks focused on the obligations of the Srpska army and UNPROFOR; General Milovanovic and Rose made press statements following the talks. "We met today to improve the initiated peace process on the territory of former Bosnia-Herzegovina. We discussed many issues including obligations for the army of the Srpska republic as regards the peace process, but also UNPROFOR obligations in the restoration of peace in this area", Milovanovic said. "We also had talks on the so-called safe areas and the obligations that UNPROFOR has to fulfill in Srebrenica and Zepa. We dwelt on the problem of Gorazde, which is also one of the safe areas according to UN Security Council resolutions," Milovanovic said. He stressed that they also discussed the issue of Sarajevo as regards building on what was agreed on 9 February, saying that the implementation of the agreement was proceeding well. General Rose said that at the meeting today they discussed the principles of defining the territories and borders of the safe areas. Commenting on the situation around Gorazde, Rose said that reports coming from that area were scanty, but he thought that there had been no important changes on the ground. "We must not rely on media reports alone, CNN for instance. Military observers are on the spot, and I agreed with General Milovanovic that I should go to Gorazde on Wednesday [6 April] and see for myself what is really happening there", Rose said. Their meeting was also attended by the speaker of the people's assembly of the Srpska republic, Momcilo Krajisnik, and vice president of the Srpska republic Nikola Koljevic.
