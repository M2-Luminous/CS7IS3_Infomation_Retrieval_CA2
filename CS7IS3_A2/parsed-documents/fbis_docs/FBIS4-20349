The deepening of economic structural reform, the steady expansion of the open policy, and, in particular, the CPC Central Committee's call for the creation of a socialist market economy have all given the landlocked province of Sichuan a historic opportunity to develop its economy. Its success has been enormous. However, Sichuan is still some distance behind the provinces along the southeastern coast. How to accelerate Sichuan's economic development? The reporters posed this question to Comrade Xiao Yang, governor of Sichuan, during an interview. [QIUSHI] There is a famous couplet written on scrolls and hung on the pillars of Wuhou Temple in Chengdu. The second line reads, "When one fails to size up the situation, one will err by being either too lenient or too strict." This shows the vital importance of judging the hour and sizing up the situation. Governor Xiao Yang, what can you tell us about Sichuan's economic development strategy in the new era? [Xiao Yang] As a local government, the principal mission of the Sichuan government is to implement and carry through with the CPC Central Committee's line and policies and come up with specific policies in light of the reality. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and rural stability is the cornerstone of social stability overall. With its 90 million peasants, Sichuan is a leading agricultural province. It is imperative that in economic construction the basic position of agriculture be strengthened and consolidated. Accordingly Sichuan must make agriculture its top economic priority at all times. In Sichuan, agriculture is highly developed and rests on a firm foundation. While Sichuan accounts for one-sixteenth of the nation's arable land, it feeds one-tenth of its population. Its per capita grain consumption is 800 jin. Be that as it may, there is still widespread rural poverty here and a vast majority of the localities have not achieved a moderately comfortable standard of living. A basic task of economic construction in Sichuan, therefore, is to enable its 90 million peasants to achieve just such a standard of living. Failing that, we cannot say Sichuan has a decent standard of living. Accordingly, developing an agriculture that is "high-quality, high-output, and high-profit" and achieving rural industrialization will decide whether or not Sichuan will attain a comfortable standard of living by the end of this century. Given the reality in rural Sichuan today, we must pay special attention to the adjustment of the mix of agricultural products. We must work hard to increase the output of both agricultural byproducts and cash crops to meet market demand and enhance peasants' incomes. At the same time, we must tackle farmland capital construction with urgency, building and maintaining irrigation works and practicing water and soil conservation and soil improvement, thus raising the productive capacity of agriculture. The fundamental way to develop the rural economy is industrialization. Traditional agriculture may meet the peasants' basic need for food and clothing, but it cannot bring about a comfortable standard of living. To achieve that objective calls for a mighty effort to develop township and town enterprises. Hence our decision to give the development of township and town enterprises a prominent place in the economic development plan of the entire province, making it a strategic focus of the drive to revitalize the rural economy, accelerate economic development, and enhance the province's overall strength. The development of township and town enterprises mainly involves using agricultural resources as the base and utilizing what is available locally. That means taking agricultural byproducts such as grain and pork, which the province turns out in large quantities, and putting them through multiple processing. These days, for instance, over 60 million pigs are slaughtered province-wide each year, giving rise to two major industries, the multiple processing of pork and pigskin. Not only are counties and regions along the Chengdu-Chongqing railroad well-equipped in these trades, but even the counties in the hill country and mountains surrounding the basin have considerable development potential as well. Accordingly we have set a goal of more than 50 billion yuan for the increase in output value by township and town enterprises each year for the next several years. If that comes to pass, township and town enterprises will have an annual output value of about 250 billion yuan by 1995, making Sichuan much stronger economically and bringing the achievement of a comfortable standard of living closer to reality. Meanwhile, by placing new demands on infrastructural development, the substantial development of township and town enterprises is bound to greatly fuel the development of related industries and facilitate the modernization of the countryside over time. Not only is Sichuan a large province, but it is also a multi-nationality province with enormous inter-regional differences. Of its population of 110 million, 7 million are members of 55 minority nationalities. Geographically, Sichuan includes both impoverished hill country and primitive mountain areas as well as fertile plains. A mix of plains, grassland, plateau, hills, mountains, and big rivers gives Sichuan a complex geographical milieu. In terms of climate, it includes both subtropical areas with their distinctive four seasons and a frigid zone covered with snow year round. Turning to economic and social development, it boasts a developed region centered on Chengdu and Chongqing as well as minority-inhabited areas such as Liangshan, Ganzi, and Aba, which are relatively backward both economically and culturally, not to mention the old liberated areas, minority areas, border regions, and impoverished areas. Per capita annual income exceeds 400 yuan in the affluent areas but ranges from 200 to 300 yuan in the impoverished mountain areas. Take Liangshan Prefecture, for example. The outskirts of Xichang Shi has a high-tech corps capable of putting a satellite into space, yet many illiterates and semi-illiterates can be found around the launching center. Some areas still languish in the era of the matrilineal society with its slash-and-burn culture. In a province like Sichuan, populous, vast in size, home to multiple nationalities, and featuring distinct regional characteristics and significant disparities in the level of economic and social development from region to region, we cannot practice subjectivism or over-simplify things by trying to impose a uniform policy across the board as we make economic policies. Instead, we must liberate our thinking and truly proceed from reality so that our ideas are in line with the objective world. Only by conducting in-depth studies and clearly understanding the situation can we work out a plan that is right for each locality. [QIUSHI] After obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation in Sichuan, how did you go about formulating a regional economic development strategy? [Xiao Yang] Sichuan is called Sichuan because there are four rivers in the province. Social and economic development takes place along the rivers. Sichuan is actually a riverine economy. In building a socialist market economy, we try to exploit the resources of all areas fully and go all out to develop commodity production and commodity circulation by putting industrial advantage to work so as to spur social economic development. When we talk about regional economies, we refer to, first of all, the three-gorge economic region in eastern Sichuan, including the Chang Jiang basin downstream from Chongqing. Next is the Panxi economic region in southern Sichuan, specifically the region upstream from Chongqing all the way to Yibin. The third economic region is the western Sichuan economic region. The fourth, the minority nationality economic region, including Aba and Ganzi, among other places. By developing Sichuan's economy based on these four economic regions, we can work out a policy appropriate to the realities in each region and give them a substantial measure of balanced power so that each region can maintain its relative independence. The idea is to have the various regions develop jointly on a basis of equality and mutual benefit, exploiting their strengths but downplaying their weaknesses. By offsetting one another's weaknesses, the regions can promote economic development province-wide. [QIUSHI] How will the various economic regions bring out their own strengths? [Xiao Yang] Besides doing a good job in infrastructural construction, including energy, transportation, and communications, the regions must start out by furthering their mainstay industries by taking advantage of their existing strengths. Mainstay industries should be the locomotive that will drive the development of related industries and the tertiary sector. The result should be a sound industrial structure dominated by the mainstay industries where related industries and the tertiary sector also have their proper place. Take the three-gorge economic region of eastern Sichuan, for example. Centered on Chongqing, this economic region features such mainstay industries as metallurgy, machinery, automobile, petroleum, and chemical industry. Right now, Sichuan is dependent on finished petroleum products shipped into the province from outside. That will not do in the long haul. We must start with the oil refining industry. Ship crude oil into Sichuan on Chang Jiang for processing here. That way we can develop the province's oil refining industry and chemical raw materials industry. The Panxi economic region in southern Sichuan includes such localities as Panzihua, Luzhou, Yibin, and Zigong. Here the mainstay industries are metallurgy, natural gas, and chemical industry. The rare metals processing industry should also be developed. The western Sichuan economic region is based on Chengdu and has these mainstay industries: electronics, automobile, and heavy machinery and equipment. With its considerable strength in these industries, this economic region is capable of rapid development too. Given their ample reserves of lignite, places like Aba and Ganzi in the minority-nationality economic region are in a position to develop the coal-mining industry and coal chemical industry. By accelerating the exploitation of such resources as minerals, hydropower, electric power, Chinese medicinal materials, and tourism, the minority economic region should develop pasture land properly and improve forage grass and livestock breeds in order to develop livestock husbandry. Meanwhile, the development of the transportation system in minority areas should be accelerated and enterprises that handle minority trade must be given aid so that they are properly run and minority areas gradually embark on the road to prosperity. [QIUSHI] How should we solve problems relating to the industrial structure and investment funds in order to build up our mainstay industries as the engine that would drive economic growth in all regions? [Xiao Yang] If we are to grasp the opportunity and build up our mainstay industries, we must expand their scale, upgrade them, and raise their standard. Take pains to optimize the industrial structure and product mix. Avoid thoughtless investment and project duplication and really bring about an essentially export-oriented strategic economic pattern with a comprehensive infrastructure and a rational industrial structure. Toward that end, we must continue to deepen reform; transform the operating mechanism of state enterprises; establish and nurture an open, unified, and orderly market system; overhaul government functions; create and strengthen the macroeconomic regulatory and control system; and speed up the development of mainstay industries and the adjustment and optimization of the industrial structure. The biggest problem right now is a shortage of funds. And there is only one way to solve it: self-accumulation and opening the province to the outside world across the board. As far as Sichuan is concerned, the strategy of all-round openness involves heading to the east, to the south, and to the north at the same time; combining the utilization of foreign capital with foreign trade and the development of foreign economic relations; and taking advantage of the opening of the coast to tap the international market. "Heading to the east" means taking advantage of the opening of the ports along the Chang Jiang to act in concert with the development of Pudong in Shanghai. It also means opening Sichuan to cities on the eastern coast connected to us by rail. "Heading to the north" means opening Sichuan to the neighboring countries via border-trade cities in Xinjiang. "Heading to the south" means looking for land or sea entry/exit points in places like Guangxi and Yunnan to expand our trade with Southeast Asia. We plan to introduce from abroad a number of projects that have a high technical content and high added value through the establishment of Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign contractual joint ventures, and wholly foreign-funded enterprises. In particular, we are going after the creation of a large number of the "three kinds of enterprises that are either wholly or partially foreign-funded," enterprises that have a high starting point and operate on a large scale. We should exhaust all avenues to channel funds, technology, projects, and managerial experience into Sichuan for use in developing its economy. [QIUSHI] Some people lament that Sichuan is a "bitter sea without bounds." They are full of gripes and have no confidence that Sichuan would achieve fast economic growth. How do you see it? [Xiao Yang] Sichuan is a landlocked province more than 2,000 kilometers from the coast or the border. As far as opening-up and attracting foreign capital are concerned, Sichuan is no doubt at a disadvantage compared to the coastal provinces. But we should also be aware of our own strengths. We are trying to put together a socialist market economy. That means we must first of all have a market. We are a populous province with a large volume of consumption, so the market potential is immense. Suppose per capita consumption goes up 30 yuan. That would mean an additional 3 billion yuan in the province, creating a market for ourselves as well as a forum for the open policy. In this sense, we should say, Sichuan has a relative edge. Provided we break with the traditional way of thinking and practices and end the isolation imposed on us by the "basic mentality," Sichuan's economy will be able to orient itself to the world. It is not right to gripe and complain. Yet it is imperative that we genuinely identify the ways in which Sichuan falls short. To a certain extent the gap between Sichuan and the coast is mainly a result of our lagging behind in the formation of a market mechanism and the development of principal players in the market. What we must do at the moment is to work hard to nurture the market system and develop a non-state economy even as we search for a more rational and more effective operating mechanism for the state economy, go all out to transform the operating mechanism of large- and medium-sized state enterprises, and make the most of the state economy as the leading player in the economy. We must apply ourselves to the development of the urban-rural shareholding cooperative economy and push ahead with the "transformation, renovation, leasing, sale, and merger" of small- and medium-sized industrial and commercial state enterprises that have lost a good deal of money. Develop the Sichuan economy even more rapidly and close its gaps with the coastal provinces by deepening reform and opening Sichuan more and more to the outside world. Apart from its economic muscle and foundation, Sichuan also boasts a scientific and technical army consisting of 1.4 million people, something no other coastal province or municipality has, with the exception of Shanghai. The people of Sichuan are hard-working and intelligent. Once their thinking is liberated and their intelligence and talents are fully tapped and put to work, they will perform many miracles. Sichuan enjoys an edge in resources as well. It also has a large number of backbone enterprises that run the gamut of the industrial line-up and that came of age during the three-front construction and the 15 years of reform and opening up to the outside world, constituting a formidable industrial base. With all these advantages, Sichuan's economy will achieve another quantum leap provided we carry through with the party's line, principles, and policies firmly and unwaveringly, adhere to economic construction as our focus, further deepen reform and broaden the open policy, and vigorously create a socialist market economy. I am fully confident about that.
