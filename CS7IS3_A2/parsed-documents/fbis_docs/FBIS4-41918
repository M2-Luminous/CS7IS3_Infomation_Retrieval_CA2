Ukraine's National Bank on 18 June set an official exchange rate for the U.S. dollar -- 17,500 karbovantsi [K] for $1, which is K1,000 higher than the preceding rate (of 8 June). In this way, the exchange rate of the karbovanets continues to be smoothly regulated and brought closer (although not really fast enough) to the true rate of exchange prevailing on the market. At the same time, last week revealed a quite interesting trend: When the exchange rate of the karbovanets was carefully set at an unreasonably low level, its exchange rate with regard to the dollar fell increasingly deeper, but, as soon as the National Bank started lowering the rate, a different phenomenon began to be observed on the market. On the currency cash market, for example, the position of the karbovanets became somewhat more steady from 10-17 June -- both with regard to hard currencies and the Russian ruble. By way of example, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar ranged at purchase between K45,500 and K46,500 for $1 and at sale between K46,400 and K48,000 for $1. This is on average 2 percent lower than what the dollar cost last week. The rate of the Russian ruble ranged between K21,000 and K22,600 (at purchase) and between K22,500 and K25,000 (at sale) and decreased by comparison with the last week's rate by between 2.8 and 4.7 percent. The German mark cost at purchase between K26,900 and K27,800 and at sale between K27,600 and K29,000 -- in other words, it showed over a week trends characteristic of the U.S. dollar. The Ukrainian karbovanets also gained strength at the exchanges of the CIS countries. For example, at the Minsk currency exchange, the rate of the karbovanets grew from 0.58 Belarusian rubles for K1 on 8 June to 0.68 Belarusian rubles for K1 on 16 June. Thus, the cross rate of the cashless Ukrainian karbovanets with regard to the U.S. dollar constitutes in Minsk K39,411.8 for $1. At the Moscow Interbank currency exchange, the rate of the karbovanets grew from 4.30 Russian rubles [R] for K100 on 8 June to R4.55 for K100 on 17 June. The cross rate of the cashless Ukrainian karbovanets at the Moscow Interbank currency exchange with regard to the U.S. dollar constituted in the final analysis K43,142.9 for $1. What factors affected the currency market? The currency dealers continued their speculation toward lowering the exchange rate of hard currencies. The fact that the rate is in the zone of resistance is indicated by the low activity of market entrepreneurs, but the quite steady fall in the rate of the U.S. dollar is a matter of concern for owners of small amounts of cash. This may be accounted for by the continued situation associated with the destabilization of the currency market at the end of May. Expectations of inflation also continue to intensify as a result of introducing into circulation of the K200,000 banknote. In addition to that, as is known, a decision was adopted on the procedure for issuing credits for agricultural work and on the size of credits, and this may lead to a 10-percent rise in the rate of the U.S. dollar as soon as at the beginning of July. A certain counterbalance to these negative factors is, to some extent, an improvement in the liquidity indexes of commercial banks, which is associated with the present reserved policy pursued by Ukraine's National Bank, the introduction of the system of electronic settlements, and, as a consequence, a sharp rise in the circulation of capital, the appearance of a surplus of free credit resources, and a decrease in bank interest rates. Besides, with the beginning of the vacation season, the turnover on the currency market has increased due to the natural migration of people. However, if the exchange rate of the dollar continues to be low, then, everything considered, it will be more profitable to sell dollars for rubles directly in Russia.
