FR940216-0-00107 FR940216-0-00010 In the case of gasoline subject to the per-gallon standards, and in the case of the per-gallon minimum and maximum standards, EPA believes refiners and importers will be able to avoid the situation where, subsequent to the gasoline leaving the refinery or import facility, the gasoline is discovered to violate these standards. Refiners and importers will avoid this situation in several ways. First, refiners and importers will have the results of their own tests before the gasoline leaves the refinery or import facility, and the final rule requires that these tests must indicate the gasoline meets all standards. Second EPA's experience is that refiners and importers produce gasoline subject to per-gallon standards with a ``margin-of-safety'' sufficient to ensure tests by others do not indicate the gasoline fails to meet the standards. Third, with regard to tests pursuant to the independent sampling and testing requirement, refiners and importers presumably will select only high-caliber independent labs, and will closely correlate with them, making the possibility of conflicting test results unlikely. Fourth, the independent lab results do not have to exactly match the refiner- or importer-test results, but rather have to be within a range that is specified in the final rule. Lastly, test results by regulated parties downstream of the refinery or import facility (e.g., pipelines, terminals), or by EPA, would not be a basis for concluding gasoline violates a per-gallon minimum or maximum standard unless the test result exceeds the standard plus an enforcement tolerance. Enforcement tolerances are discussed in another section of this preamble. Nevertheless, in a situation where these mechanisms fail and a refiner or importer learns, through tests by EPA or others, that a parameter value for a gasoline batch subject to the per-gallon standard violated that standard, or for a gasoline batch subject to the average standard violated a per-gallon minimum or maximum standard, the refiner or importer would be expected to correct the violation. Several commenters raised concerns over the logistics and safety of non-company employees entering refineries to collect samples. EPA agrees that in order to comply with the independent sampling and testing requirements, a refiner or importer will be required to make arrangements with the independent laboratory that address logistics and safety issues. A refiner or importer would be expected to select as its independent laboratory a company that is able and willing to commit by contract to collect samples in a manner that minimizes interference with refinery or importer operations_to collect samples in a timely manner, and comply with company safety requirements. Because refiners and importers are given the latitude to select their own independent laboratories, EPA believes these parties will be able to identify and select ones that are satisfactory.
