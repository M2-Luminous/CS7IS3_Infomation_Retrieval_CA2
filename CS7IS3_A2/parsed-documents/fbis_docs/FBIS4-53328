FBIS4-53328 "dreas096_a_94024" FBIS-EAS-94-096 Daily Report 17 May 1994 NORTHEAST ASIA Japan Hata: Ozawa's Criticism of Paper `Not Very Appropriate' Hata: Ozawa's Criticism of Paper `Not Very Appropriate' OW1705130294 Tokyo KYODO in English 1202 GMT 17 May 94 OW1705130294 Tokyo KYODO English BFN [Text] Tokyo, 17 May KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Tuesday [17 may] it was "not very appropriate" for top coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa to call the mass-circulation daily ASAHI SHIMBUN "a red newspaper" which practices "black journalism." The premier was answering questions about the controversial remarks by Ozawa, secretary general of the coalition's core party Shinseito led by Hata. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai declined to answer a similar question, saying the government cannot comment on politicians' individual remarks. Ozawa, speaking on Monday in Chiba, east of Tokyo, blasted the daily for "slandering" him, apparently referring to a 26 April ASAHI SHIMBUN story in which he was quoted as saying that "one is free to sleep with the woman of one's choice. It's none of your business." The comment was later criticized in the Diet and by some public circles as being indiscreet and demeaning of women. According to the ASAHI SHIMBUN, Ozawa made the remark when asked about the ruling parties' formation of the parliamentary group "Kaishin (Innovation)" the previous day. The Social Democratic Party (SDP) seceded from the coalition in late April after Kaishin was formed without the SDP being consulted, reducing the Hata coalition to a minority government.
