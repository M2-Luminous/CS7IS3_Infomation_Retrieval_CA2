But they certainly found it odd that anyone in a position to reside in a typical foreign executive's mansion should spend his time at home, apparently idle. The household employees also were amazed that their employer bathed in a swimming pool wearing long pants and a long-sleeved shirt, buttoned to the neck. However, what most piqued the employees' imagination was one of their employer's hands, the left one, on which the little finger was amputated. The mystery began to unravel on the afternoon of Monday, 7 March. The blond Japanese, named Hitoshi Tanabe, is 32 years old. The money with which he was paying the $1,300 to rent the luxurious eight-bedroom house is not from any inheritance or lottery prize. In fact, the source of Tanabe's funds is the dreaded Japanese Yakuza Mafia, of which he is a member. Tanabe's arrest by the Federal Police could prove decisive for exposing the Yakuza's intricate operations, and the strategy for its activity in Brazil. The "Mafioso" jailed in Brasilia, awaiting extradition, has been in the country since at least early 1993. The first warning of his presence was provided in February, by the Japanese police, after the seizure, in Tokyo, of 5.6 kg of cocaine put aboard in Sao Paulo. The trafficker who was arrested claimed that the drugs belonged to Tanabe, and that he was in Brazil to coordinate the Yakuza's activities in the areas of extorting business firms, drug dealing, exploiting the labor of "dekasseguis" (descendants of immigrants contracted to work in Japan), and the traditional trafficking in women. The "Mafioso's" presence in Sao Paulo became public knowledge in April, when JORNAL PAULISTA, directed toward the Japanese colony, printed a feature article on him. Because of the disclosure, Tanabe had to flee to Buenos Aires. He did not return until September, when he rented the Londrina mansion, residing there with his wife, Kiyomi, and his 11-month old daughter, Mary, registered as a Brazilian. However, he was constantly visiting Sao Paulo, apparently not fearing exposure. He even showed his body completely tattooed (with a brightly colored dragon on his back, and a geisha with cherry blossoms on his chest) to the prostitute, A.C.R., an 18-year old blonde. During October, they spent a night together at an apartment on the 16th floor of the luxurious Hotel Eldorado, in downtown Sao Paulo. On that day, Tanabe smoked "crack" and spoke very little. He left $100 in payment. In Londrina, the Tanabe family's life was more discreet. S.A.S., a female employee at the mansion, claims that they seldom went out, and received no visitors. However, as the police learned, it was from there that Tanabe was directing the work of the agencies recruiting "nisei" [descendants of Japanese immigrants] interested in employment in Japan. One of the contractors of cheap labor was the Okayama Tourist Agency, established in Vila Mariana, in the southern zone of the Sao Paulo capital. It was acting as a broker to send young people, paying their fare and keeping them under control. According to the social worker, Reimei Yoshioka, from the Center for Information and Assistance to Workers Abroad, there are currently about 150,000 Brazilians working in Japan on jobs arranged by the Yakuza. An Okayama employee reported that another recruitment is due to occur on Monday, 14 March. Among the youths already recruited are the brothers, F.H.T., aged 18, and G.H.T., 17. According to their stepfather, the agency promised F.H.T. a job at the Osaka airport. However, upon his arrival there, his passport was seized by the Mafia and he was assigned to bridge construction. Since he requested the cancellation of the contract, the Yakuza began deducting 1,500 yen from his salary of 2,000 yen to pay the installments on his fare, and for a "penalty." The stepfather claims that G.H.T. is working at a golf club near Tokyo. Many of these clubs serve only as a front for prostitution, according to the journalist, Marcos Lacerda, who has lived in Tokyo for three years. Author of the book "High-Tech Slum," about the Yakuza, Lacerda remarked that the Asian Mafia's mainstay is the sex industry, with an annual billing of approximately $150 billion. The journalist does not even think that Tanabe is the leader of any faction. "A Yakuza leader would never be acting foolishly in a small city like Londrina," he comments. As for the amputated finger, this is the sinister punishment imposed on those who flout the organization's rules. Besides investigating the activity of the "dekasseguis" companies, through which drugs reportedly are being trafficked to Tokyo, the Federal Police are also being informed on Tanabe's connection with the construction of a sports complex in Londrina. While the investigations are under way in Parana and Sao Paulo, Tanabe is attempting to convince the Brazilian Government not to extradite him. His allegation is that his daughter is Brazilian.
