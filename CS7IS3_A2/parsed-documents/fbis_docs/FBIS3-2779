Li Peng pointed out: The existence of disputes between China and the United States is a reality. We believe that the disputes between the two countries must be settled properly through consultation on an equal footing in the spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving differences. The problems can only be complicated by exerting pressures unilaterally. Li Peng said: China attaches great importance to the current visit by Secretary of State Christopher, hoping that candid talks may help enhance mutual understanding and facilitate the improvement and expansion of Sino-U.S. relations. Recalling Christopher's visit to China a decade ago, Li Peng said: Great changes have taken place in the world over the past decade and so has China's appearance taken on an entirely new look. However, the changing international situation have not in any way changed the importance of Sino-U.S. relations. On the contrary, the changing international situation has called for the enhancement of Sino-U.S. cooperation in various fields. China has always approached Sino-U.S. relations from the global perceptive and from the fundamental interests of the two peoples. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to relations with the United States, and has made tremendous efforts toward improving and developing such relations. In my government work report two days ago, I reiterated the Chinese Government's positive desire for improving and developing Sino-U.S. relations. Discussing Sino-U.S. trade and economic relations, Li Peng said: The Chinese and U.S. economies are strongly complementary to each other. Bilateral trade and economic relations have developed rapidly in recent years, with the trade volume reaching $27.65 billion, increasing more than 10 times over the figure for 1979. Chinese economy is developing in a sustained, rapid, and steady manner [chi xu kuai su ping wen 2170 4958 1816 6643 1627 4489] and the market has kept expanding. China's imports are expected to reach $1,000 billion over the next seven years. At present, the transport, energy, and telecommunications industries, in which the United States is a strong power, constitute the priority sectors for China's development. If Sino-U.S. relations are improved [gao hao le 2269 1170 0055], with the man-made obstacles in bilateral trade and economic cooperation removed, U.S. economic circles will find in China a historic opportunity for expanding Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations. Touching on human rights issue, Li Peng said: China and the United States have different concepts regarding human rights. China is a developing country. The population of the developing world makes up four-fifths of the world's total. It is not fair to impose the human rights concepts of a developed country on a developing country. China will never accept the human rights concepts of the United States. For a developing country, human rights are, first and foremost, the rights to survival and development. He said: "Human rights, human rights! A person must first survive before talking about rights. The disputes between China and the United States concerning human rights can be discussed on the basis of equality so as to enhance mutual understanding, but there should be no application of pressure." Turning to the most-favored-nation [MFN] issue, Li Peng: It is a mutually beneficial arrangement for the two countries to maintain normal trade and economic relations. To speak frankly, if China's MFN status is canceled, the losses incurred to the United States will be no smaller than those to China. China mainly relies on its internal market and has a strong capability of self-reliance. What the United States will lose is a vast market. We hope the U.S. side will handle this issue properly. Christopher expressed agreement with Premier Li Peng's remarks on the great importance of Sino-U.S. relations. He said: President Clinton regards U.S. relations with China as conforming to the national interests of the United States. The United States can cooperate with China on a wide range of issues, both global and regional, both bilateral and multilateral, and both in the peace, security, and economic areas. The United States and China are both permanent members of the UN Security Council, and the U.S. side is very much willing [shi fen yuan yi 0577 0433 1959 1942] to improve its relations with China. Christopher also briefed Li Peng on U.S. views on human rights and MFN. Qian Qichen, Chinese vice premier and concurrently foreign ministers; Vice Foreign Minister Tian Zengpei; U.S. Ambassador to China Stapleton Roy; Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis; and Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wiser were present at the meeting.
