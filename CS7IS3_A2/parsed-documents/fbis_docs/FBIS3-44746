Y. Sung] [Text] China has moved to allay fears that up to 400,000 Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports will not be able to resettle in Hong Kong after 1997. The State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office director Lu Ping said yesterday that while it was likely they would retain the right of abode, they would lose their Chinese citizenship under China's long-standing policy of opposing dual-citizenship. Lu said the issue needed further study in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) to protect the residence rights of Hong Kong Chinese. "If those people cannot keep their right of abode in Hong Kong after obtaining foreign passports, we have to study under which circumstances their right of abode can be retained," Lu said. "Generally speaking, our policy on this issue is flexible and we will try to deal with it flexibly." The Hong Kong government warned yesterday that up to 400,000 Hong Kong Chinese would not be able to retain their permanent residence status under the Basic Law. It also said between 10,000 and 20,000 non-Chinese, mainly Indians and Pakistanis holding British Dependent Territories Citizen (BDTC) passports, would also be denied the right to live here under the Basic Law. Lu said China would try to ensure Chinese citizens born in Hong Kong would not need to re-apply for residence if they returned. "Such people, when they return to Hong Kong, do not need go through any procedure," he said. Non-Chinese who had lived in Hong Kong for at least seven years and regarded the territory as their permanent residential place would also be granted right of abode after 1997, Lu said. But he warned their right of abode would be "examined" if they returned to live in their mother country. "Such a move means that they do not consider Hong Kong their permanent residential place and therefore there is no point for them to continue to enjoy the right of abode," Lu said. However, it is not yet known whether the seven-year criterion should apply to Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports. Rita Fan, leader of the Social Order Group of the Preliminary Working Committee, also said Hong Kong Chinese with foreign passports would retain the right of abode after China took over. She said the important thing was to define the conditions listed under Article 24 of the Basic Law. The PWC Social Order Group will meet in Beijing next week to study this issue.
