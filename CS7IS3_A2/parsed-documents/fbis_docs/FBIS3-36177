Sergey Dubinin and Viktor Gerashchenko Have Been Tasked To Respond to Them"] [Text] On 4 February the State Duma intends to hear from acting Finance Minister Sergey Dubinin and Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko. Dubinin and Gerashchenko will apparently have to report on budget guidelines for the first quarter. Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin yesterday met with the premier and apparently discussed with him plans for the lower house's work on the budget and economic course. Similar "working" negotiations with Boris Yeltsin, according to Ivan Rybkin, concerned the address the president intends to make in the Federal Assembly at a joint session of its houses on 18 February. Rybkin refused to disclose its specific propositions. Rybkin "relates calmly" to the president's address to parliament, in which the latter is accused of violating constitutional norms, in particular in electing the Duma speaker. "We have developed normal working relations with Boris Nikolayevich," Rybkin stated. Indeed, during his first few weeks in the high post the speaker has distanced himself a little from the communist majority in the Duma to which he owes his election. Intensive talks with the president and the premier will apparently have a greater impact on Rybkin's position than his party affiliation. The meetings with the premier are especially important: Rybkin can become the most active supporter of the new government's economic initiatives in the Duma. The speaker displayed "party indiscipline," which is becoming increasingly characteristic of him, when he supported the candidacy of Vladimir Podoprigora for the post of Duma apparatus chief. The leaders of the Russian Federation Communist Party, the Democratic Party of Russia, and other factions of communist orientation rejected that proposal, saying the Vladimir Podoprigora, being chairman of the Federation Council's Foreign Relations Committee, cannot be chief of apparatus in another house. In spite of the obvious juridical nonsense, however, the Duma speaker continued to insist on the Russia's Choice candidacy. No preliminary agenda for the State Duma plenary session, which is due on 4 February, has been defined yet. Faction leaders practically unanimously sent the declaration on the succession of the Federal Assembly to be reworked. As Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin stated yesterday, "before the draft reaches the stage of discussion at the session, it will undergo substantial changes." According to Rybkin, the document will be executed as a declaration without any political, let alone scandalous, implications. Members of the Duma Council failed to reach agreement on the issue of amnesty timed to coincide with the adoption of the new constitution. Fearing that any decision on the number and nature of crimes falling under the amnesty will cause censure in various parts of society, the faction leaders decided to postpone the discussion of the edict indefinitely. The same sad fate befell the Criminal Code, which was originally to be discussed as a package with the amnesty law.
