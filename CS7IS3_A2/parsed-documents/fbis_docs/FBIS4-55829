[Marek Kassa] It's a 100-year old tradition: Major celebrations this year will take place in Raclawice -- and Raclawice means Tadeusz Kosciuszko, Bartosz Glowacki, and scythe-bearers. Which of those traditions and slogans we are discussing have continued to have significance today? [Pawlak] In those years banners carried a slogan: "We feed and defend." Today, we write on our banners: "We manage, feed, and defend," which somehow reflects the essence of our actions today. [passage omitted]. This 200th anniversary of the Kosciuszko insurrection coincides with celebrations of the 100th anniversary of the peasant movement and the creation of a party that began to work in the age of partitions, when prospects of freedom were bleak. [passage omitted] [Kassa] In your opinion as prime minister and leader of the Polish Peasant Party [PSL], is there a chance to begin to think about the unification of the peasant movement, which continues to be split in Poland? [Pawlak] To a large extent, the recent elections have prejudged the situation. Integration is taking place at the moment but in a different manner. I think that it is important that in our actions we seek respect for a different look at the future, at the way the peasant movement is organized. In the PSL we do try to pay attention to this matter, whereby different milieus can have a significant participation in activities and decisionmaking. This is connected with a broader cooperation with political and unionist milieus. Involvement of all the sides is required here. This is also an indicator for those politicians who work in rural areas, so that we can interplay together in this sphere of essential interests of both the countryside and Poland. During my foreign trips, I am often struck by the fact that in external relations in many countries I encounter an unequivocal stand, irrespective of the fact whether it is a government coalition or the opposition. In foreign relations they represent one stance. This should teach us both in internal and external relations. [Kassa] Your government and you personally were heavily criticized for the organization of the 50th anniversary celebrations of the battle of Monte Cassino. President Lech Walesa said that the organization had failed and the current government had a different option. [sentence as heard] In this way he indicated that it was no accident that the organization of these celebrations was not a success. [Pawlak] I think that we are concentrating on the emotional and technical side. I would begin with my own personal reflection on the anniversary itself. In my view, Monte Cassino shows that you can fight for Poland and for the future in different places in the world. [passage omitted] As far as the organizational and technical level is concerned, I am glad that different milieus became involved and I do not think that this pinching of the government should disturb anyone. It is important that in addition to what the government organized there were independent social initiatives. Everyone should become involved in such situations, events, meetings, and celebrations which concern our widely understood national tradition. We will soon have the 50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, and I can say today that I would like to expect such activity in organizing it by various milieus but now, at the moment, when there is still time to organize many useful activities. I would only like to point out to the fact that the whole ceremony was organized by the organizational committee consisting of different structures and representatives of different milieus. The government supported it, first and foremost, from the financial side and granted over 3 billion zlotys for the organization of this ceremony securing the money for the former servicemen's' lodging and partly for transport. A very important and useful thing was the involvement of different local milieus. I could see that the former servicemen had a completely different approach to it. In their approach you could notice a military approach going back to the time of the battle, irrespective of the fact whether the resources were sufficient or not. These celebrations were simply organized to the best of those people's abilities. And a paradoxical final of the meeting was when it started to rain heavily -- the Italians say that this is a blessing from heaven -- and maybe this rain reconciled all those present there and showed that you have to look forward on such occasions and look for the things that unite, especially in the face of such experiences and circumstances as the battle of Monte Cassino. [Jelenski] Minister Michal Kulesza, the government plenipotentiary for administration reform, has resigned, accusing your government of halting local self-government reforms and aiming at the centralization of power. Does it mean that you are, using such an inappropriate word, the first brakeman of the Polish Republic? [Pawlak] I value cooperation with Mr. Kulesza very much. I think that his different approach to these matters was also important at the time when we were seeking the best solutions, but I also value the opinion of local self-governments. This is, I suppose, where we should start: During the meetings with local self- governments you could not find such unequivocal opinions as regards the reforms Mr. Kulesza had been putting forward. Centralism is not the point here because we are far from it, and our suggestions that more prerogatives be transferred to provincial governments and give them greater say in coordination of regional administration prove that we are aiming at the decentralization of decisions, that they be as close to the grassroots as possible. But neither do we want to transfer responsibility from local self-governments to the center, especially in a situation when they have no chance to fulfill their tasks. The situation in education can be a symbolic example, where, as you know, there was a decision by the previous political arrangement whereby the whole of issues connected with education be transferred to local self- government parishes as of 1 January. We treated this matter very democratically, I believe. Well, local self-governments were to take resolutions themselves if they wanted or did not want to take over schools. It turned out that in such a situation the opinion was not at all unanimous, because everybody knew the reserves and financial capabilities. [passage omitted] [Jelenski] You have been working with Grzegorz Kolodko, deputy prime minister and head of the Finance Ministry, for almost a month now. How does the cooperation look? Earlier on, fears were fairly widespread that you have, putting it mildly, fairly divergent views on the creation of the Polish economy. [Pawlak] When I put forward a nomination to the president for the appointment of Deputy Premier Kolodko, there were even these reports about the fact that these contradictions reach back to the period of the creation of the coalition, which is not altogether true. And I think that a very important matter that is worth stressing is the fact that Deputy Premier Kolodko [words indistinct] approach to his activities. And I think that he has a similar approach. He speaks here of this formula of escaping forwards, and so the seeking of solutions through looking to the future. And we will surely be striving to resolve today's problems quickly -- tomorrow there will be new problems, new tasks, new challenges. And this creates conditions, both for there to be a good and considerable level of activity, and this creates good conditions for many people, especially in the economic sphere, that of enterprises, for development, for a dynamic look ahead. And I would not hide the differences, but would also not treat it as a problem. The differences might be a motivating factor, if we are but capable of exploiting them so as to find better solutions. [Kassa] Over the last few weeks it has been possible to observe that the tensions in relations between the government coalition, and the parliamentary coalition, and the president have decreased. Do you judge that this gives an opportunity for us muddling through up to the presidential elections with such an arrangement? [Pawlak] I think that the relationships are multifaceted. It all depends on the matters we are dealing with. And, assuredly, there will still be various interesting events here in the future. But I hope that this approach -- the seeking of compromises, the seeking of solutions -- will bear fruit in the fact that we will be able to exploit these relationships and these often differing views for the seeking of such decisions and such activities as, nonetheless, perceive this complicated and specific situation in Poland [sentence as heard] And it seems to me that in this respect a view of this in such a way as to weed out all these decisions and stances that ensue from concern for the future is also necessary here, irrespective of which side they come from. [Jelenski] The strikes by Solidarity are probably the most important component of political and social life in this country at the moment. In your opinion, has the government succeeded in putting an end to the last wave of strikes? And is an understanding with the trade unionists possible? Let us recall that a Solidarity demonstration is planned for Warsaw on 27 May, and that the union continues to claim that the government does not want an accord. [Pawlak] The strikes are an important component, surely, of our public and political life, but surely not the only one of these important or most important factors. Here, the situations are very complicated, and a moment ago you spoke of relationships with the president. And within the coalition there are, after all, dependent on the matter at hand, various approaches at times, various methods and proposals for solutions. And if this was solely a matter of strikes and solely a matter of negotiations with Solidarity, then perhaps it would be easier to find solutions here that could satisfy everyone. But this situation is far more complicated. And I think that the strikes at the moment... [pauses] A tendency towards a certain calming of the situation is seen at the moment, as regards the strike situation. I am aware of the fact that in many concrete situations there are reasons and that there are causes that give conviction to many people that it is necessary to reach for very radical methods of protest. But also, many people have convinced themselves that a method for a solution of these difficulties is not so much protest as well-organized work, and the seeking of effective solutions, both for internal use and for expansion and activity outside. And as to the main problem, then I think that this main problem is the approach to the termination of the strikes. For, after all, as regards the postulates, and these detailed branch postulates, they have been signed in accords with both the brown coal sector and the hard coal sector. General postulates have become the subject of the decisions of the trilateral commission. A timetable for their implementation has been adopted, these main ones regarding the taxation of incomes are already being implemented. The matter of the control of remuneration -- here there is a clear divergence as to the time and rate of departure from these administrative methods, but as to the aim there is full agreement. And the government has also made a clear declaration in this respect. The point is just that, in departing from one set of solutions we should not bring about economic destabilization. So, if we look at problems instead of postures a good perspective may be seen. There is a problem getting out of the protest calmly, without losing face. I think Solidarity had a few good opportunities to end the whole strike action at this stage with some success. Now the situation is becoming a little blocked, because there is too much concentration on positions, so to speak, and too little regard for the problems; but I hope we are able to resolve the matter calmly. All that is needed here is an accommodating approach by both sides. It is difficult for us to accept the formula, that we enter into negotiations with Solidarity only, and leave aside the other trade unions, which have after all been taking part in these negotiations, in agreements -- for in a moment we will have similar demands from the other trade union organizations. I think it is also a matter here of mutual respect in the trade union milieu. We must recognize the fact that there are several important trade union organizations, respect their position, their views in specific situations, and with this kind of approach there will be no problem with finding solutions. I stress once again that to end the whole process positively, we need good will on both sides, and sometimes it is hard to find a good solution which would fully satisfy everybody, but I hope we will bring it about.
