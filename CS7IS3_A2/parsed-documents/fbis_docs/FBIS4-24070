Reacting to the 1994/5 budget announced by Finance Minister Derek Keys, Nactu said it believed the levy, its percentage and period should have been negotiated. It was "ironic" the minister could tax workers and companies the same levy and the lack of consultation was "business as usual from the old apartheid regime style of doing things". "We don't even know how the R4 billion [rand] of transitional costs was incurred," said Nactu Assistant General Secretary Mahlomola Skhosana. Nactu had always stood for a negotiated levy towards specific programmes such as education and training in the Reconstruction and Development Programme. The R2.5 billion kick-start to the programme was a "drop in the ocean compared to the general needs of people", said Mr Skhosana. Nactu was also concerned the government would settle the R15 billion debt incurred by the former TVBC [Transkei, Bophuthatswana, Venda, Ciskei] states instead of investing it in the development programme, the statement said. Nactu welcomed the establishment of a tax commission, saying it was long overdue. "We hope the commission will act with integrity and consult every stakeholder and all trade union national centres, instead of some and not others."
