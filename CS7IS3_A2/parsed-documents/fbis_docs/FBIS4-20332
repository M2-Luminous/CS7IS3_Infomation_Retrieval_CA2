This systematic project requires more investment, and in addition requires scientific and directed logical application. To discuss such issues as the annual collection of more than 5 billion yuan in capital, its allocation and administration, etc., we visited the Permanent Vice Director of the State Comprehensive Agricultural Development Office Wu Kunlong [0702 0981 7893]. Question: What is your appraisal of the application of investment since China initiated its project of implementing comprehensive agricultural development? Answer: The nation set out on the project of comprehensive agricultural development in 1988. As of 1993, it had invested a total of 25.31 billion yuan in capital, including 6.84 billion yuan from the central financial authorities. It is the first incidence of such large-scale concentrated investment since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This project has reliable resources of capital, clear directions for its application, policies which are quite favorable, and a complete system. So party and administrative leadership have given it their close attention, the masses have welcomed it, the capital has been applied efficiently. The investment structure reflects the state's policies on industry and technology. In the 25.31 billion yuan investment I referred to earlier, 75 percent was put into grain, cotton, and vegetable oil production, 15 percent was put into the production of meat, eggs, and aquatic products, and 10 percent went into building forests and grasslands. Categorized by developmental and handling measures, 80 percent was put into construction measures, 10 percent into biological measures, and 10 percent into scientific and technological measures. The figures show that over the last six years there has been a total of 40 billion yuan in capital for state-fixed comprehensive developmental investment plus farm labor force converted into capital; this is equivalent to more than 10 percent of the gross fixed capital in publicly owned, collective, and personal investment during the same period. In this, the proportion for major grain-producing areas was even greater. For example, Anhui's gross investment in comprehensive agricultural development was 1.23 billion yuan in 1992, which was about 10 percent of the province's gross societal fixed asset investment (including primary, secondary, and tertiary industry). There is no doubt that this has been very beneficial in strengthening the reserve strength of agricultural development and regional economic development. Question: What have been the problems with the application and administration of capital recent years? Answer: There have been four aspects to this: 1) There have been too many "connecting batch" projects; they formed a base, and have affected capital turnover and efficiency. In 1993, the central financial authorities made arrangements for 1.7 billion yuan in capital, but most of this has been taken up by projects already approved, and only 140 million yuan of the capital can really be arranged for renewal. 2) Capital is being used in a scattered fashion, getting quite a ways away from the focus. 3) The capital has not come through on time, local supporting capital is hard to implement, and allocation and payment are taking too long. In some cases, units which have made application still have not received all of the year's capital by the end of year, which affects the pace of their development and their accomplishment of construction assignments. 4) Impractical repayment terms for financial capital debts makes it difficult to repay them. These problems demand our closest attention, we absolutely cannot be careless about them or lower our guard. Capital investment and administration supplement each other, so if we only pay attention to investment and not to administration, our developing goals will hard to attain, and there will be no way to be efficient. So from now on, our development department and financial department must take very seriously their administration of capital use. Question: What is this year's gross investment capital and its structure? Answer: It could increase to a total of 5.8 billion yuan this year (excluding the conversion value of the farmers' labor force). It is chiefly composed of three aspects. These are the 1.9 billion yuan central financial allocation, localities' minimum support of 1.9 billion yuan at a 1:1 rate to complete the set, and in addition, there is a 2 billion yuan loan from the Agriculture Bank. Question: What is the future of agricultural development capital? Answer: It will certainly increase. This is because agriculture must have more capital investment. In order to continue making good allocations of agricultural development capital and meet the demands of the central government's 1993 rural work conference, the 1994 financial capital budget for support of agriculture must be higher than the normal increase in financial income proposed in the "Agriculture Law." Establish a grain risk fund, to be used chiefly for central grain storage costs, and subsidize the gap between the prices for purchases and sales of grain. Increase by 1 billion yuan yearly until the year 2000 the funding for providing work as a form of relief. Increase comprehensive agricultural development capital by 200 million yuan, to 1.9 billion yuan from its present 1.7 billion yuan. Gradually find some resolution to the troublesome debts accruing from grain producing enterprises' losses. Certainly, increasing the investment in agriculture is not just the concern of financial departments; there are many aspects to it, such as bank credit, investment in construction, fund-raising by agriculture itself, importing foreign capital, etc., in addition to finance. All departments should work together -- when everyone adds fuel the flames rise high. When overall agricultural investment is increased, the capital for comprehensive agriculture development will naturally increase with it. Question: What are the possible ways of implementing out supporting capital? Answer: Implementing local supporting capital is the key to increasing investment and guaranteeing that projects will be implemented. Beginning this year, the state will require that fiscal authorities at the provincial level assume the lion's share of supporting capital. In addition, this capital must be held in reserve when making out the budget at the beginning of each year. Now, with reform of the financial system reform, the sources of agricultural development funds will certainly change, and for some provinces it may be not sufficient to just rely on that portion of the tax revenues received from occupying cultivated land which is controlled by provincial fiscal authorities. In these circumstances, it is essential to arrange that part of the capital resources be kept in reserve for contingency use. We cannot fill out our needs with bogus supporting capital, nor can we resort to makeshift solutions. We must really strengthen our management of capital. We especially must strengthen that management in advance, using capital within strictly fixed limitations. Comprehensive agricultural development funds are different from general administrative funds; we must make the usage of these two very clear, never mixing them up. In the meantime, we should strengthen our regular supervision, examination and administration, giving financial departments the authority to halt allocation at the first appearance of any violation of discipline. Comprehensive agricultural development organizations must accept the supervision of financial departments. Question: What adjustments should we make in the investment mix right now? Answer: The general breakdown of overall agricultural development investment is that 80 percent of central and local financial investment is used to improve the basic condition of agricultural production and develop such major agricultural by-products as grains, cotton, vegetable oil, sugar, and meat, etc., while 20 percent is used to develop a variety of operations in the regions which have the projects; of the special loans from the Agricultural Bank, 50 to 60 percent is used for land exploration and treatment, and 40 to 50 percent is used for production and operations. This kind of investment mix is of significant value in increasing the staying power of agricultural development and increasing the output of grains, cotton, vegetable oil, and meat. But, in the new situation of increasing the development of a socialist market economy, it will be inappropriate to keep on arranging our capital according to such quotas; we must readjust. From now on, calculating with the province as the unit, central and local financial investment should have a quota for increasing investment for improving the basic condition of agricultural production by not less than 70 percent, and no more than 30 percent into investment in developing multiple operations and leading projects. As for arranging bank credits, again counting the province as the unit, 30 percent will be used for land exploration and treatment, and 70 percent for multiple operations and leading projects. This will reflect governmental activities and suit the demands of the market economy while developing high output and efficient agriculture. Question: When will the project file system be implemented? Answer: The project file system is a means of advanced administration. It embodies the principle of selecting that which is excellent and competitive, and is beneficial to improving the efficient use of capital. Vice Premier Zhu Rongji has praised the township enterprise project file system very highly. Some places which are carrying out comprehensive agricultural development are in the initial stages of establishing this system too, and these should be vigorously expanded. Starting this year, both the State Office for Comprehensive Agricultural Development and the provincial development offices should establish their own project file, gradually changing the work of setting projects to regular work. Before applying for setting projects, each area and unit should subject projects initially selected through feasibility demonstration, and when state investment becomes possible, take the project from the file and submit it to higher authority. Permanent Vice Director Wu Kunlong stressed that each locality must do well the preparatory work involved in implementing the new system by suiting measures to their local conditions, strengthening professional training, working out detailed regulations for implementation, and link up appropriately with the original system. Only in this way will comprehensive agricultural development in China have great economic and social efficiency in investment and production, and push comprehensive agricultural development work to a new stage.
