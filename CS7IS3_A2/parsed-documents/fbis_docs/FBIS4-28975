The article says: Through the dismantlement of the U.S. military bases the Libyan Arab people showed that the strength of the people who value their national dignity and sovereignty of their country is tremendous. Today the Libyan Arab people steadfastly maintain the stand of independence against imperialism. This enjoys sympathy and support of the world progressive people including the African people. The imperialists are persisting in their pressure and interference against Libya which is advancing along the road of independence, regarding it as a thorn in their flesh. But they could not break down the will of the Libyan Arab people. The Libyan Arab people are firmly safeguarding their national dignity and sovereignty of their country under the leadership of Colonel Mu'ammar al-Qadhdhafi, leader of the great September first revolution.
