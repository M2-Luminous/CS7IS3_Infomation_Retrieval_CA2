The two leaders held a joint news conference tonight following four hours of talks. President Mubarak said that we are about to find a solution to these problems. He added that the talks covered a number of topics, including the situation in Yemen, bilateral relations, and several Arab issues. The Yemeni president voiced appreciation for Mubarak's efforts to resolve the Yemeni crisis. He said that he and President Mubarak reviewed longstanding bilateral ties, inter-Arab relations, and the current crisis in Yemen. President Salih said that he briefed President Mubarak on the Yemeni crisis and the Pledge and Accord Document signed recently in Amman. The troubles should have ended with the signing of the Amman document, but regrettably the crisis has dragged on and has resulted in military clashes, which we do not want, the Yemeni president stated. President Mubarak opened the news conference by welcoming the Yemeni president. Mubarak said: We discussed a number of topics during our meeting, including the problems in Yemen, bilateral relations, and other Arab issues. I believe we are about to resolve many problems. The Yemeni president replied by thanking President Mubarak. President Salih said: I am happy to be here in Egypt and to hold talks with my brother President Mubarak. The Yemeni president added that he and President Mubarak reviewed longstanding Yemeni-Egyptian relations, inter-Arab relations, and international issues. President Salih pointed out that the Yemeni crisis began on 19 August when differences surfaced among the three coalition parties: The General People's Congress, the Yemeni Socialist Party, and the Yemeni Reform Group. I briefed my brother President Mubarak on the details and causes of this crisis. I also briefed him on the Pledge and Accord Document that was concluded in Amman. The document was supposed to bring the crisis to an immediate end so that the leadership could resume its constitutional and executive tasks, but unfortunately the crisis continued and had military consequences, a development which we did not wish to see, President Salih remarked. The Yemeni president said: Inspired with a sense of national responsibility, the three parties of the coalition agreed to withdraw the units from their positions on the pre-May-1990 partition lines. Most were withdrawn, with the exception of a few thousand troops in certain governorates, which will be pulled out as well. But some provocations and media posturing continues, President Salih added. I have discussed this matter with my brother, President Mubarak. The Egyptian president is holding consultations to reconcile the two sides and to find a peaceful solution to the current problem. I should recall here that Yemeni unity was achieved through peaceful and democratic means, President Salih stated. The Yemeni President said: This problem should be resolved. We are eager to settle all problems through peaceful and fraternal means and find an understanding. We do not want the troubles in Yemen to fester. We highly appreciate the part played by the Egyptian leadership, government, and people and the great concern your country displays toward Yemeni unity. This is hardly surprising. Egypt played a major role in inspiring the revolutions of 26 September and 14 October and has sent us the best of its sons to assist us, President Salih noted. The two presidents then answered questions from reporters. The Yemeni President was asked if the withdrawal of military units is linked to bringing to trial those involved in recent terrorist operations. He responded: The Pledge and Accord Document calls for the withdrawal of all military units from major towns. Other units will remain in their positions whenever this is in the national interest of unified Yemen. The document also calls for measures to achieve security and stability. According to that document, those involved in acts of sabotage and violence should be arrested in accordance with a plan to be presented by the interior minister to the coalition government led by Haydar al-'Attas. The government is responsible for the implementation of the document, President Salih stated. The Yemeni president added: The leadership was supposed to close its ranks so that the Presidential Council and the coalition government could draw up plans or a detailed program for the implementation of the Amman document. Unfortunately, following the Amman meeting the brothers of the Yemeni Socialist Party returned to the commercial and economic capital of Aden and nothing was done. President Salih said: We are ready to cooperate with other Yemeni leaders in ensuring the arrest of all terrorist elements. However, we have to point out that no party is in the employment of another party. We cannot perform our tasks unless there is harmony among the leaders. This is the responsibility of the government, not the president. The Yemeni president added: The Presidential Council and the government were supposed to meet immediately to implement the Amman agreement. Unfortunately, Socialist Party leaders returned to Aden. Concerning the call issued by President Mubarak for the restoration of Arab solidarity, President Salih said: We fully support this pan-Arab stance. There is a need to restore Arab solidarity and clear the atmosphere following the rupture caused by the Gulf war. We appreciate the call made by the Egyptian president and people. Even without President Mubarak making this call, we are aware of and appreciate the efforts he is exerting with all brothers to restore Arab cooperation. Asked about the task of achieving Arab solidarity and unity, President Mubarak said: Egypt is, above all, an Arab and Islamic country. We are advocates of Arab solidarity. We have been long before I took office. The Gulf war left a trail of scars and divisions in its wake. It took a long time for the dust to settle and the healing process to begin. We have not spared any effort in restoring Arab solidarity and cooperation in various fields. I believe that today the situation is better than at any time before. We are still making an effort. We hope, God willing, that we may all come to believe in Arab solidarity and see the need to close Arab ranks. This, of course, requires effort but we are working on it because we see this as a primary commitment of the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mubarak said. President Salih was asked about his country's position on terrorism and about a recent statement made by a Yemeni official that some terrorist elements returning from Afghanistan are living in Yemen. He responded: The Yemeni leadership, government, and people are against terrorist elements, wherever they may be. Egypt's security is a part of the security of the Arab people. Yemen's security is a part of Egypt's security. No Arab country should think that it is safe from terrorist operations conducted under the slogans of Islamic or leftist extremism. We are against terror in all its forms because it yields nothing but havoc and destruction. The Yemeni president added: It is true that there are elements who came back to Yemen from Afghanistan. But most of them are Yemenis who went to Afghanistan to engage in jihad and were sponsored at the time by Western and some Arab countries. These countries sponsored them in the effort to wage jihad against the Russians in Afghanistan, and even against some Arab regimes in the Arab world. Now we are reaping the harvest of this intellectual and political terrorism. President Salih said that Yemen is opposed to terror in all its forms. He said: The elements that are in Yemen are Yemenis. Some people claim that there are Egyptian terrorists and some from other nationalities in Yemen. If these people provide us with a list of names, we will be ready, in the context of coordination and in accordance with agreements, to take all necessary legal action against anyone engaged in acts of terror in any Arab country.
