Summary of Facts and Representations 1. The Employer is a professional corporation engaged in the practice of medicine. The Plan is a defined contribution money purchase plan with 108 participants. As of June 30, 1993, the Plan had total assets with a value of $7,265,571. 2. The Plan proposes to purchase the Property from two unrelated parties, Martin Koloski and Durgadevi Soma. The purchase price for the Property will be $562,500. The Property consists of land and a building located at 30 Columbia Street, Poughkeepsie, New York. The sellers previously used the building for offices for a medical practice. 3. Following the acquisition of the Property by the Plan, it will be leased by the Plan to the Employer for its medical practice. A portion of the Property will be subleased by the Employer to other unrelated tenants. The initial annual rental for the Property is to be $62,458. The Lease is to be on a triple-net basis; thus, all expenses, including real estate taxes, will be paid by the Employer. The Lease will be for an initial term of ten years, and will be automatically renewed at the end of the term for an additional five year period, subject to the approval of the Plan's independent fiduciary (see rep. 5, below).
