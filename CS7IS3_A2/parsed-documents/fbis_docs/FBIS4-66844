Whenever a new idea is presented, especially if it calls for changes, we instinctively jump up to dismiss it. Our intelligence works to make this tendency stronger. We suddenly create a network of aspects that would be adversely effected by the new idea. After visualizing all those possibilities, this proclivity is further strengthened. The whole burden of proving something is put on the person who had proposed the change with, "What proof do you have of the benefits of this idea? What guarantee is there that A or B or C will not be decreased?" The result is further helped by another habit that we have adopted. We begin to look for various principles behind every bush even when we do not follow these principles in our own lives. The less our leaders or commentators know about that subject--new technology, patents, for example--the more these basic principles they try to apply. While looking for these theories, which we insist that we must fully explore before we put them to practice, we do not think about any restrictions or morals. We drag in unrelated and far-fetched ideas whenever we can. For example, during the recent campaign against Dunkel [GATT proposals], efforts were made to convince some chief ministers to take this issue to the Supreme Court. This is a strange argument. The argument is that although the Center has the right to have treaties, it cannot have a treaty which effects areas that are under the state list in the Constitution. Can the Center agree to a treaty which affects the basic form of the Indian Constitution? You can imagine the questions that will be raised: The form of autonomous union, what is it? What is the difference between the Indian union and other nations? If it is different, then how much so? What is its power to have treaties? How appropriate is the state list in the 7th article of the Constitution? Then, of course, there are the moral questions which we never forget. Is it appropriate that meals be patented? Is it appropriate that life be patented? Are not there contradictions in these words? Is it not the lowest deterioration brought about by capitalism? How can you treat intelligence as a commodity? Two results are clear. The debate is stretched into such questions that one gets farther and farther from the issue under debate and time is wasted. If we move on Dunkel following our usual method, we will be entangled in spiritual questions while the others are taking over patents. Supplementary Specialties: These bad results become even more complex because of the special skills that our intellectuals, bureaucrats, and politicians share. The question has not even been raised and we announce our overstated attitude. This is neither a yes nor a no and the negative or positive aspects of the issue do not affect either of these responses; it is our stand compared to the other party that decides it. If we are in the government, we say yes and if we are in the opposition, we will scream no. We would have embraced this idea gladly if we were sitting on the government side. This tendency works in the minds of people on each side. If our opponent says yes, we scream no. If the opponent is taking a moderate stand, we will declare our stand to be clear, unambiguous, and bold. We not only adopt exaggerated attitudes, but also take aggressive and extremist stands. Sit-ins, rallies, and demands to do-or-die become a daily occurrence in no time. All this happens even before one of the sides tries to explore the issue further. Once we adopt that attitude, it is natural that we kick out facts that create doubts. We rush to the facts or arguments that strengthen our stand. In addition, we do not examine that "fact" or argument; we just throw it in the air and run with it. I had given a strange example of criticizing Dunkel earlier. Making the period of a patent 20 years (our present law allows a patent to be effective from 7 to 14 years), will force us to pawn ourselves to multinational companies for longer periods. This is unfair and would be hard to bear in this period of fast changing technology. A little thinking can show that the logic works for the other side. Since technology changes fast, there will be less effect of a longer period for a patent, because a new product will leave the patented item behind. Another strong but curious example emerges in this debate. Advocating the implementation of the rights to intellectual property more strictly, the United States and other countries emphasized that this is because manufacturing companies spend a lot of money on new drug and inventions. We argued (for example in the book, Intellectual Property Rights Flawed), that invention of new drugs does not really cost much since the U.S. drug companies charge 35 percent profit over their cost. However, it means that if it does not cost as much as we are told then we can also try to invent those drugs by spending less money. Then there is the sickness of forgetting. We suddenly forget the argument that we gave only yesterday, and begin to advocate something entirely different just because the new argument protects us from change. Until yesterday, the Indian drug industry was the villain in this story. Its picture was presented in such a way that all government efforts to formulate a new drug price policy were wasted. This was the industry that was trapping us into its system of poisonous, harmful, and addicting drugs. This was also the industry that was cutting us off from our medical heritage--the Ayruvedic and Unani medicines--which are most beneficial and appropriate for us. The treatment and drugs in these systems agree with our bodies and habits. Since the ingredients for these drugs were collected from jungles, the aborigines also benefitted from them. Suddenly, all this is forgotten now. Now the argument is that Dunkel is dangerous because it will hinder Indian drug industry from competing with its Western counterparts. Until 15 December, it was said in the arguments related to GATT that many awful things will happen if the agreement is not amended. A destructive trade war will start and so forth. The agreement was not even signed and we started to express opposing fears in our debates how signing it would cause catastrophes. Therefore, I not only look for the instinct with which I began this article but also for another staple habit: It is our hobby to worry about one or the other thing. Our opposition parties oppose every position that our government takes and reduce the possibility of any astute debate on that issue and the government, by not sharing facts with the people, reduce this opportunity for debate even further. The Indian representatives tried hard to get some of the provisions during the discussions on Dunkel changed. However, they gave up this struggle last March. It was possibly done after we saw that no one supported us, but this change in stand was never explained to us. Now when the government says that we have been forced to agree with everyone because we had isolated ourselves in the past, it appears to justify something after it has already happened. This impression is even further magnified because during this time the eardrums of people have been burst from all the noise they have been hearing about the accusation that the government is working under pressure from multinational companies, IMF, the World Bank (and we do not know what else). What should we do? We have to pay a high price for this all. Since we adopt an exaggerated attitude--either yes or no--we never could even come close to those reforms which we could have implemented otherwise. Since we jump to adopt an attitude based on enmity--if someone supports something then I must oppose it. We lose the opportunity to benefit from those reforms which we could implement if we worked together. Because we take the path to violent activities in a hurry--do or die declarations, violence, and other such steps, moderate or middle-of-the-way solutions are pushed away from our reach. Our politicians' apathy toward general ideas and the weakness of the government--meaning weakness of the bureaucracy regardless of which party is in, the government--makes us lose access to those reforms which we could have had. Therefore, to change things, we have to change our form of debates and discussions. Especially, we should: - Listen more to those who work than leaders and intellectuals. - Listen to those who have studied the issue and those who have special knowledge about it instead of the status-quo commentators, people actively looking for some issue, and people's politicians. - Investigate the subject methodically before deciding on a stand and understand "facts" and arguments thoroughly. - Instead of the quick jump to "yes" or "no", we should keep our minds open for moderate suggestions.
