The killing of Palestinians by Israeli soldiers or settlers is a daily reality that has become of routine news value to the international media, and even less significance to the international community. Only a crime of the enormity of the Hebron massacre draws the attention of the big powers in the world to the suffering of the Palestinian people and Israel's disregard for all international norms and human values. This attention fades, though, sooner than the blood of Palestinians dries on the ground. Such is not the case with violence against Israelis. The killing of any number of Israelis by frustrated Palestinians has all world capitals racing to condemn "Arab acts of terrorism" and offer support for Israel. The world is serving neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis through such exercises in hypocrisy. Nor is Israel protecting its future and that of the region by failing to address the root causes of violence in the occupied territories. Israel is responsible for the 'Afula bombing as much as it is responsible for the Hebron massacre. Its policies in the occupied territories provided the settlers with the means for killing the Palestinians as they prayed in the Ibrahimi Mosque. Those same policies left the young Palestinian who carried out the 'Afula suicide attack no choice but to give Israelis a taste of what their government has been allowing to happen to Palestinians for decades. Israeli politicians condemned the Hebron massacre. So should Palestinian leader Yasir 'Arafat condemn the 'Afula bombing demands the U.S. and other world powers. The naivety and insensitivity of comparing the two unfortunate events are appalling, even though the killing of innocent people and civilians cannot be condoned by anybody or quarter. Had the international community been genuinely interested in ending the bloodshed in the occupied territories, however, it would have had taken action to end it long before the 'Afula bombing took place. That it could have done by putting enough pressure on Israel to remove the injustices to which Palestinians are subjected on a daily basis. Instead of removing the settlers, admittedly a main obstacle to the attainment of peace in the region, Israel threw a blanket curfew on the West Bank and Gaza. That deprived Palestinians from even providing for their daily needs. The suffering increased and retaliatory action became an inevitable response. The Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Chairman thus found himself unable to condemn the 'Afula attack personally. By doing so, he might have only infuriated his people whose members are being killed by Israelis by the hour. Israel, on the other hand, could affoprd to condemn the Hebron massacre because it has within its reach tens of other measures to appease its citizens. The most the PLO can do in reaction to Israeli atrocities is boycott the peace talks, and that it cannot do for long because of the pressures that Washington and other world powers would put on it. But Israel does not boycott the talks, winning world praise for not allowing "rejectionists" to abort the peace process. What it does, instead, is put two million Palestinians under siege again by closing the West Bank and Gaza totally. The negative implications of this act for the peace process far exceed those of withdrawing from the negotiation. Yet a few in the world community seem to notice; and Israel gets away with murder. Thus only Palestinian desperation grows, and the cycle of violence continues unabated. When inclination towards peace becomes the ultimate causalty we can all be sure that the peace process stands to suffer. Just when the Israelis get to realise the folly of their policies is the question that we cannot answer.
