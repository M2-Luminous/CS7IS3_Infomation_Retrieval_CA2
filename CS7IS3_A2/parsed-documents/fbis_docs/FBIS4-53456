Hosokawa and Satsuki Eda, who heads the United Social Democratic Party (USDP), agreed that the JNP will absorb the 17-year-old party and announce a joint statement Sunday. The statement will proclaim the two parties' determination to promote further political realignment and declare a clear apology for Japan's behavior during World War II. The two parties decided on the merger because of the closeness of their reform-oriented political tenets, officials said. Both parties attach importance to decentralization of power and to more active civil involvement in the political process, they said. Two of the three USDP members in the House of Representatives, Eda and Shogo Abe, will join the new party, boosting the JNP's strength in the lower house to 39, compared with 206 for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), 74 for the Social Democratic Party (SDP), 62 for Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and 52 for Komeito [Clean Government Party]. But the third USDP legislator, Yanosuke Narazaki, will become an independent. The new JNP will raise the banner of "practical idealism" after the merger, they said. The move, however, is unlikely to help consolidate the JNP's footing, which is becoming more shaky every day, political analysts said. The JNP, which is rapidly losing public support, is in a crisis of splitting as Hosokawa's leadership has been incurably damaged by his resignation from the premiership over his shady financial dealings in the 1980s. Rank-and-file party members are increasingly disgruntled about the political strategy and handling of Diet business by the top brass, insiders said. Three members left the party in April to form a new parliamentary group, Seiun, after Hosokawa reneged on a promise to merge with new party Sakigake [Harbinger], headed by former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura. Seiun's three members and Sakigake's 15 members have formed a joint parliamentary group in the lower house. One focal point is the issue of dissolving the parliamentary bloc Kaishin, created by some coalition partners after Tsutomu Hata was elected to succeed Hosokawa. The formation of Kaishin infuriated the (SDP) [parentheses as received], which was the largest bloc in the ruling coalition that supported the Hosokawa administration. The SDP walked out of the coalition, leaving Hata with a minority government. Hosokawa on Wednesday supported the idea of scrapping Kaishin, joining the growing camp in the coalition that calls for dissolving the Diet club to lure back the SDP into the coalition. But chief coalition strategist Ichiro Ozawa of the coalition's core party Shinseito has expressed strong opposition to such a move. The issue engendered a bitter controversy in the JNP over its political strategy as a growing number of party members are critical about Hosokawa's decision to join Kaishin. The members of Seiun are making overtures to JNP lawmakers to leave the party and join their group, and some analysts believe the JNP is on the verge of a major split. "The JNP's split is now a matter of time," said one SDP legislator.
