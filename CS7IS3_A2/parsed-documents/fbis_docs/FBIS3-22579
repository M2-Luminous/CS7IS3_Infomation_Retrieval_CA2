The number of people infected already runs into thousands, exceeding the usual seasonal indicators many times over. Following an initiative by the city's sanitary and epidemiological supervision center, practically all the city's secondary schools have been closed down as a quarantine measure, and store assistants are going around in gauze masks. Experts believe that the influenza virus which has taken hold in Abakan is extremely dangerous and that the illness can have serious consequences.
