The ad hoc commission has been meeting behind closed door. Our correspondent Pedro Manuel reports from Lusaka. Good evening! The Ad Hoc Commission for the Conclusion of the Electoral Process continues to work for an agreement. What the negotiators are doing is to define all issues connected with the second round of presidential elections. So far, there is total secrecy and nothing is known about the discussions, although observers feel this issue will be easy to resolve. This afternoon, while the commission was carrying out its work, the remaining members of delegations from the government and UNITA decided to meet alone, without third parties, somewhere here in Lusaka. The objective of the meeting is not known, but this is not new. Even in Abidjan, during situations of impasse, the delegations met at secret venues in search of an agreement. Taking this into account, it is very probable that today's meeting was connected with the country's governance. Although the parties are presently working on the conclusion of the electoral process, the truth is that there is an impasse with regard to the country's governance.
