FR940720-0-00103 FR940720-0-00007 The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with the way the Act approaches motor vehicle emission control. As noted earlier, section 216 defines new in the context of motor vehicles as ``a motor vehicle the equitable or legal title to which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser.'' The Act applies federal emissions standards to ``new'' vehicles. These federal standards are enforced through certification, assembly line, and recall testing. States, on the other hand, have a role in motor vehicle emission control through inspection/maintenance programs and are not restricted from controlling used vehicles. The section 209(a) prohibition of state regulation of motor vehicles addresses only ``new'' motor vehicles and engines and prohibits state regulation that occurs before sale, titling, or registration of the vehicle. 7 7 Section 209(a) provides, in part, ``.␣.␣. No State shall require certification, inspection, or any other approval relating to the control of emissions from any new motor vehicle or new motor vehicle engine as condition precedent to the initial retail sale, titling (if any), or registration of such motor vehicle, motor vehicle engine, or equipment.'' The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 take a parallel approach to nonroad standards and enforcement. Section 213 provides EPA with authority to set standards for ``new'' engines and provides for federal enforcement of such standards in the same manner as motor vehicle enforcement. Furthermore, nothing on the face of section 209(e) or section 213 indicates that Congress intended ``new'' to be interpreted differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts. Given that the preemption provisions for new motor vehicles and new nonroad engines appear in the same section of the Clean Air Act, it is reasonable to believe that Congress did not intend for the word ``new'' to be defined differently within the same section without stating this intent explicitly. 8 8 EPA recognizes that regulation of locomotives presents unique circumstances, including questions regarding interstate commerce, that require special attention. EPA is therefore deferring its definition of ``new locomotive'' and ``new engine used in a locomotive'' until a later rulemaking dealing specifically with regulation of locomotives. There is not a compelling policy or factual justification for defining new differently in the nonroad and motor vehicle contexts. State regulation of nonroad engines does not generally present any greater degree of disruption of the movement of products, engines or equipment between states than does regulation of motor vehicles. The comments provide little if any justification, in terms of relevant distinctions between motor vehicles and nonroad engines, to justify such a significant departure from EPA's established practice for regulating mobile sources. The Agency's definition of new is also consistent with case law. In Allway Taxi, Inc. v. City of New York, 9 the court held that where the exercise of local police power serves the purpose of a federal act_the Clean Air Act in that case_the preemptive effect of the act should be narrowly construed. In keeping with that principle, EPA believes that section 209(e) should be construed narrowly in order to protect states' rights, particularly in an area such as public health in which states traditionally exercise control. California's nonroad regulations will serve the purpose of the federal act by improving air quality. 9 Allway Taxi, Inc. v. City of New York, 340 F. Supp. 1120 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'd, 468 F.2d 624 (2d Cir. 1972). In Allway Taxi, the court discussed the federal preemption of new motor vehicles and interpreted the meaning of new motor vehicle as defined in Section 216 of the Act. The court noted that this definition ``reveals a clear congressional intent to preclude states and localities from setting their own exhaust emission control standards only with respect to the manufacture and distribution of new automobiles.'' 10 The court stated further that the narrow purpose in the definition is reinforced by prohibiting states and localities from setting emission standards before the initial sale or registration of an automobile. Congress specifically declared that section 209 did not preempt states from regulation of the use or movement of motor vehicles after they have reached their ultimate purchasers. 11 10 Id. at 1124. 11 Id.
