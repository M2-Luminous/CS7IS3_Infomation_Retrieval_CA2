Economists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the State Statistics Bureau said that if there are no serious disasters agriculture will grow by five percent -- and possibly by 6.5 percent. They noted that the output of cereals and cotton will see a stable growth. For cereals, the rise is expected to be 6.5 billion kg over last year. Sufficient cereal stockpiles in both state and farmers' granaries will maintain a balance between supply and demand, the experts said. The per capita income of rural people will increase by three percent to four percent, to reach about 1,032 yuan. And the total output of rural and township enterprises will grow by 25 percent to 30 percent. The economists said the expansion of the rural economy is backed by a set of government policies and measures to protect farmers' interests, increasing investment in agriculture by the state, measures to stabilize the planted grain and cotton acreages, and special government loans to support key counties producing grain and cotton.
