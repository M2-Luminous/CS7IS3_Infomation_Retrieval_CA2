A vote of censure on the finance minister's performance could be taken today during the congressional session since a majority of legislators are criticizing Sosa, as well as the other cabinet ministers, for not having declared a state of financial emergency. According to Pedro Tabata Guzman, deputy head of the Democratic Action bloc, there will soon be a need to implement exchange controls. Deputy Tabata thus responded to questions regarding this Wednesday's increase in the value of the U.S. dollar. [Begin recording] [Tabata, in progress] ...not just that measure will be recommended. I believe we will also have to recommend importation controls, but only on certain goods. Without a doubt, we will need to implement currency exchange controls. [end recording] Deputy Tabata Guzman also pointed out that the special commission appointed to evaluate the summons of Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez will also summon Development Minister Alberto Poletto and Luis Carlos Palacios, Central Office of Coordination and Planning chief. Deputy Gustavo Tarre Briceno, president of the Chamber of Deputies Finance Commission, believes the increase in the value of the U.S. dollar is a result of the prevailing distrust in the market. [Begin recording] [Tarre Briceno, in progress] ...the manner in which the intervention process was handled, the absence of a genuine and coherent economic program, and inadequate coordination between public officials result in significant distrust. All of this leads to a distrust in the banking system, which leads to withdrawals by account holders, who, not trusting anyone, prefer to purchase more U.S. dollars. That is what has caused the price of the U.S. dollar to exceed the 200 bolivares mark, and the logical consequence of all of this is more inflation. [end recording] In this respect, Deputy Tarre Briceno stressed that it is very likely the inflation rate will reach three digits.
