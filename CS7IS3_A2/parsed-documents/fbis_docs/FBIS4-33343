The PT wants the STF to declare the law unconstitutional, alleging that it contradicts the principle of equality because it does not forbid companies from contributing to the campaigns of parties or candidates of their liking. The petition pertains to Paragraph 6, Article 45 of Law No. 8713/93. The PT's decision to question the mentioned law follows an incident a week ago involving PT presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, against whom charges have been filed for having campaigned outside factories in Sao Bernard do Campo using the public address truck of the metal workers union of the Sao Paulo ABC industrial region. The PT does not like the fact that it can speak to a group of businessmen in the auditorium of the Sao Paulo State Federation of Industries (FIESP) but cannot address a group of workers using their labor union public address truck.
