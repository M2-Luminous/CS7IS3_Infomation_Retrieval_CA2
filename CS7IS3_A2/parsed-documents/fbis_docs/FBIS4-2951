We must not waver, but be determined and not slack off in our work, and we must make sure that the set target for population control is fulfilled, he said. This forum, called by the provincial party committee and government during a break amid the provincial people's congress session, is for the purpose of urging local authorities to take effective measures to do a good, solid job in family planning work while concentrating on economic construction. During the forum, the provincial party committee and government commended and presented awards to the 14 prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities that comprehensively fulfilled last year's population control plan. A written pledge on management by objective regarding population control for the year 1994 was signed by the 14 prefectures, autonomous prefectures, and cities. After the signing ceremony, acting Governor Zhang Wule addressed the forum, urging all localities to make family planning work more scientific. To this end they need to focus attention on five tasks: First, it is necessary to improve the family planning operational mechanism on a scientific management basis. Second, it is necessary to intensify working organs at the township and village levels. In the process of opening up and reform, family planning organizations must not be abolished or merged, neither must the size of staff be reduced. Third, it is necessary to launch a drive in a planned way to select a few six-good [liu hao] villages. Fourth, it is necessary to comprehensively implement procedures for performance of family planning management contracts and rigidly to curb the practice of bearing extra children in violation of discipline. And fifth, it is necessary to continue to invest more to increase the reward for family planning executive personnel, and properly solve the issue of remuneration for and recruitment of family planning executive personnel in rural areas. Having reviewed the situation in population in our province, provincial party committee Secretary Yan Haiwang said: Each year our province sees a net population increase of 300,000 or more, equivalent to the population of a medium-sized county. However, our province's arable land is decreasing by the area of a medium-sized county each year. The gap derived from this increase and decrease makes the contrast still sharper between excessive population and scarce land. Therefore we must always treat family planning as one of the tasks of top priority and devote great efforts to it. Provincial leaders also present at yesterday's forum were Sun Ying, Li Zuling, Song Zhaolong, Pu Junhe, Chen Qiling, Ying Zhongyi, and Lao Chongzhi. Some comrades from the provincial family planning sector attended the forum.
