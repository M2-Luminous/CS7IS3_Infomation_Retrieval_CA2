FR941230-2-00076 FR941230-2-00047 c. Retailers of distilled spirits in the Virgin Islands have been deprived of the benefits of free and open competition in that Topa is their only source for almost all distilled spirits and there are no alternative sources in the Virgin Islands for competing distilled spirits; and d. Suppliers of distilled spirits to the Virgin Islands have been deprived of the benefits of free and open competition, in part because Topa has inherent conflicts of interest in the representation of their distilled spirits such that the representation of one product necessarily results in diminished representation for competing products. 20. The violation alleged in this complaint is continuing and will continue unless the relief hereinafter prayed for is granted. Prayer Wherefore, plaintiff prays: 1. That the series of acquisitions of competitors through which Topa acquired the exclusive Virgin Islands distribution rights to almost every brand of distilled spirits available in the world market and its retention of those exclusive distribution rights be adjudged contracts in restraint of trade in violation of Section 3 of the Sherman Act; 2. That plaintiff have such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper; and 3. That plaintiff recover the costs of this action. Dated: December 7, 1994. Anne K.
