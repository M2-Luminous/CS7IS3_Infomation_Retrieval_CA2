Public Service and Administration Minister Zola Skweyiya said yesterday he had begun urgent consultations with all nine provincial premiers to clarify the process of transferring powers to regional public services. But -- to avoid "authority vacuums" -- provinces would have to prove they were capable of managing their public services before central government would allocate them specific powers. The undertaking follows anxiety on the part of some provincial governments about their lack of power and a proclamation in the Government Gazette which temporarily transfers all provincial and homeland government powers to Pretoria. The Inkatha Freedom Party's central committee expressed "deep disquiet" at the weekend over reports that central government would assume provinces' powers. It resolved to take whatever steps necessary to ensure that the powers claimed by KwaZulu/Natal's premier were devolved as expeditiously as possible. Skweyiya denied that government was holding on to powers which would allow provinces to run their own public services. "Provinces will first have to show they are ready to take control. We do not want chaos," he said, adding: "I understand the impatience of premiers." He was keen to hand over the powers as soon as possible. In the interim period, however, government was responsible for SA's 900,000 to 1.2-million public servants. Skweyiya said he had begun meeting individual provincial premiers, making it "very, very clear" what criteria had to met before powers were handed over. Each premier received a proposal to study. They had to go back to their provinces and study the documentation -- which included details on future personnel, assets and budgets -- before they would meet the Minister again, as well as the Public Service Commission. The proposed packages for each of the nine provinces varied according to their needs, Skweyiya said. He confirmed that not all the provinces had yet followed the example of KwaZulu/Natal, which had requested in writing that central government allocate it all the powers it was entitled to under the interim constitution. Skweyiya said he had already met the premiers of the [Orange] Free State and the Northern Transvaal. Today he is scheduled to meet those of the Western Cape, Northern Cape and PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging], and in the next two days the leaders of KwaZulu/Natal, the North-west and the Eastern Cape. The Minister said he had been impressed with the level of preparedness of the Free State, largely because, like KwaZulu/Natal, the province's borders had "remained intact". He indicated that, where borders had been redrawn and former homelands reincorporated into new provinces, he expected it would take longer before the provinces were ready to manage their own public services. However, he said the difficult process of restructuring the public service was gaining momentum. "I am happy with the pace of restructuring." The Minister denied that government would in any way renege on undertakings in the interim constitution guaranteeing public servants their jobs. "There is absolutely no intention to drive anyone out of their jobs and onto the streets". Although changes would be necessary to make the public service more representative of the new SA -- "a number of blacks" would be appointed at managerial level, and the gender imbalance would be tackled -- no one (and Skweyiya singled out white public servants) had to fear losing their jobs. He said his job was to create a single public service, at a national and provincial level, which ensured uniformity and parity, including pay.
