Writing in the 27 March Athens weekly TO VIMA TIS KIRIAKIS, Nikos Marakis notes that the long-lasting "Macedonian" issue highlighted the rule that foreign policy is not only the product of diplomatic initiatives, but is influenced by internal policy, partisan interests or even personal strategies. In fact, the decisions of Minister of Foreign Affairs Karolos Papoulias and his diplomatic advisers bear little authority because foreign policy is completely controlled by Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, whose priorities do not always coincide with those of his ministers, Marakis comments. Papandreou's decisions are dictated by a series of parameters, one of which is his expected move to the presidency in 1995, at which time the votes that Political Spring leader Andonis Samaras, a fierce opponent of a Skopje compromise, may contribute can be "precious." According to Marakis, this limits Papoulias and alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos' jurisdiction to matters that have no influence on public opinion and are unrelated to internal political processes. However, Papoulias is more likely to carry out Papandreou's directives because he is "the more obedient of the two," comments Marakis. The other alternate minister, Yiorgos Papandreou, has thus far assumed a low profile in playing the role of the prime minister's "special envoy" for Greek-American relations. The ministry's "triangle" has therefore failed to function as a group, with confrontation focusing on each individual's ability to influence the prime minister. Turning to the New Democracy (ND), Marakis reports that when the issue of sending Greek peacekeeping troops to Bosnia was discussed at a meeting chaired by ND leader Miltiadhis Evert, former ND Minister of Education Yiorgos Souflias and former ND President of the Chamber of Deputies Athanasios Tsaldharis "vehemently" argued that the party ought to oppose the move and that governmental initiatives ought to be denounced. Evert and former Minister of Defense Ioannis Varvitsiotis agreed with them, albeit expressing reservations about a direct denunciation of the government. Souflias and Tsaldharis admit that they are influenced by the rivalry with Samaras, who could outflank the ND on Skopje and steal ND votes in the June European Parliament elections. In addition, many party members believe that Evert's low-key opposition to PASOK fails to stress Papandreou's policy errors, Marakis comments. With regard to Political Spring, Marakis goes on to note that to date, Samaras has only derived political benefits from his stance on the "Macedonian" issue. Samaras, he says, believes he is the "main factor in Greece's rejection of a compromise," and does not refute the view that he is "holding captive" the entire political leadership. Meanwhile, Samaras has let it be understood that he would vote for Papandreou in an eventual presidential race if the prime minister were to follow an uncompromising policy on the name of "Macedonia." While thus offering a "bait" to Papandreou, Samaras is in fact becoming enmeshed in the question of whether the country would be led to new elections were the government to accept a compromise on "Macedonia," Marakis concludes.
