The Foreign Office gave Sudan'a fundamentalist Islamic government a deadline of Tuesday January 4 to think again. As the already strained relations between the two countries worsened, the Sudanese charges d'affaires in London, Abdul Rahman Bakhit [name as received], was summoned to the Foreign Office to explain the "totally unjustified expulsion." He left after a 35-minute meeting with Sir Michael Burton, the assistant under-secretary covering the Middle East, Near East and North Africa. Officials said he had been given a strong rebuke and was told that his explanation for the expulsion of envoy Peter Streams was "wholly inadequate." Mr. Bakhit had said one of the reasons for the expulsion was Mr. Streams' persistent contacts with opposition leaders in the southern rebel-held area of Sudan. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. George Carey, is currently on a high-profile visit to Christians in southern Sudan. Foreign Office officials said the visit had merely brought to a head a simmering situation between Britain and Sudan. In a strongly worded statement after the meeting, the Foreign Office said Sir Michael had underlined Britain's "profound dissatisfaction and regret" at the "unjustifiable" decision to expel the ambassador. Mr. Bakhit had told Sir Michael that Mr. Streams was seen as an "obstruction to attempts to improve bilateral relationships." His contact with opposition figures was also criticised. Sir Michael dismissed these explanations as "wholly inadequate" and asked Mr. Bakhit to convey this message to his government together with the request to "immediately reconsider" the expulsion if it valued its relationship with the UK. The Foreign Office said Mr. Streams was a highly respected ambassador who had reported back to it about human rights abuses in Sudan. A spokesman said: "We consider our ambassadors have a duty to report a wide range of political views." He added: "We value our relationship with the Sudanese government but we want to see progress in finding a just solution to the current war in the south." Asked if Britain was considering retaliation such as expelling Sudan representatives in London, the spokesman said: "It is clearly one of the options, but we do have to await the response of the Sudanese government." Sir David Steel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman, warned against Britain adopting a "tit-for-tat attitude" in the row with Sudan. "If you want to get to grips with the real problem, which is the application of Islamic fundamentalism to the rule of the state, you don't help dialogue by breaking off relations," he told Radio 4's "The World at One."
