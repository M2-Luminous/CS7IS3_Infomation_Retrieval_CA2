But when you have a house with three doors that lead only into this house and they deploy militarily or place barricades at these entrances, call it what you will. However, what I wanted to say is that by behaving like this and striking at the last string of the credibility that it may still have, the Lebanese government is not leading to anything. This means that it is widening the gap between it and its people. This is not good and will not lead to anything. The Lebanese government is destroying itself by this behavior, when it has many greater concerns on the national level, on security violations, current events, the Middle East peace process, and on many other (?levels.) Instead, the entire government is engaged in -- and I apologize to the listeners for using this phrase -- political inconsistencies [dhabdhabat] and practices that do not become the state in any form. [Badawi] In your view, what is the reason behind erecting military barricades today, especially in front of the Lebanese Forces positions and the Samir Ja'ja' headquarters in Ghidras? [Ja'ja'] I have no clear answer, but such practices become larger or smaller in accordance with the Lebanese Forces' political stand. This is not acceptable. The government should not have anything to do with the political stands of any political group in the arena in any form whatsoever. Otherwise, conditions become as you can see them and therefore, the credibility of the government will be destroyed and ... [Badawi, interrupting] Can we link today's operation to the news conference you held following the massacre at the Sayyidat al-Najat church and the stands you expressed at that time? [Ja'ja'] Apparently, from now on the question has become that of analyses and inferences. Yes, it is possible. I do not have any other explanation. This is the situation and these are the facts. As to the reasons, I do not know. But I know these practices harm the state in the first place. [Badawi] Dr. Ja'ja', I would like to know your preliminary reaction to remarks by General Michel 'Awn in the newspaper AL-HAYAH today. 'Awn says a federation should be established in Lebanon, or a form that is above the religious denominations, that is, a secular regime. What do you think of this. Do you not see in it a repetition of your previous proposal for federation in Lebanon? [Ja'ja'] We originally proposed the decentralization, or federation, after a careful and deep study of the Lebanese situation, the historical and the political situation in general, the sociological conditions. It was not just a remark. It was the result of a long process of fermentation in the Lebanese political situation. I hope the rest of the political groups -- before we again suffer through this and pass through this experience for the second, third, fifth and tenth time -- will really study the real situation. Eventually they will reach a clear conclusion like General 'Awn's conclusion, because this is reality. There is nothing magic about it. One reads the reality today, the other reads it two years from now, the third reads it after ten years. All this will be a waste of time. [Badawi] Thank You, Dr. Samir Ja'ja'. [Ja'ja'] You are welcome.
