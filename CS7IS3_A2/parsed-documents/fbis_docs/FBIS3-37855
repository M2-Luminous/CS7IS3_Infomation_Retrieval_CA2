The most important out of the seven elements of partnership suggested by Kozyrev is the development of European-Atlantic interaction. This interaction should be based on the transformation of CSCE into an efficient regional political organisation, and the Council of North Atlantic Cooperation - into an independent structure of military and political cooperation closely connected with the CSCE. The aim of this is to coordinate efforts made by NATO, EC, the Council of Europe, the European Union and the CIS in the field of strengthening stability and security, peace-keeping activities and defence of rights of ethnic minorities in Europe. Kozyrev suggested creating a network of complementary bilateral agreements on partnership, cooperation and consultations not only between NATO and countries of Central and Eastern Europe. "We do not rule out that Russia might become part of NATO some day, but the idea of partnership is the key problem today," he said. "The dignity and far-sightedness of the "Partnership for Peace" programme adopted by NATO leaders is that it works as if opening NATO, taking a first step on the way from changing it from a bloc into another form of ensuring security, thus fully meeting our concept of the European partnership. In perspective, we expect the opening of the communications channel "The CIS - NATO," Kozyrev said. "We want to put into practice a principle of indivisibility of security on the entire European continent," said Polish Foreign Minister Andrzei Olechowski, addressing the conference. He said that the way to such Europe without demarcation lines lies through the expansion of existing Western European structures. In Olechowski's opinion, "partnership for the sake of transformations" is necessary in relations between Poland and Russia. He called on the West to render no less assistance to Russia than to Poland. Russia should have a permanent seat in the G-7, the European Community should give Russian goods an access to the European market, and financial institutions and developed Western countries should effectively support the stabilisation and convertibility of the Russian rouble, the Polish minister said. "The whole world is aware of it, agrees with it, but is not in a hurry to offer aid," Olechowski said.
