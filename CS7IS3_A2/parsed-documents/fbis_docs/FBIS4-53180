In reference to nonperforming loans of banks, Chairman Morikawa said, "We have passed the peak for the occurrence of bad loans." He suggested that Japan's financial systems are headed towards stabilization. Relative to the public disclosure of bonds whose interest payments have been reduced or forgiven, he assumed a cautious stance, saying, "They are different from the bad loans that are now being publicly disclosed." And, he stressed his position that he intends to ask the Ministry of Finance [MOF] to review in the spring of 1995 regulations applicable to the operation of securities subsidiaries of banks. [Wada] For the time being, huge sums of nonperforming loans are the foremost problem of banks, but is there any possibility that they will lead to instability in financial systems? [Morikawa] In addition to assuming a flexible posture on the use of write-off systems, the MOF's efforts to promote an environment favorable to the disposition of bad loans, including compilation of an "Administrative Guide for the Nonperforming Loan Issue" should have a major beneficial impact. I hear that prospects are good for the recognition of sole-bidder companies to dispose of collateralized real estate. Sole-bidder companies will be of major significance in the disposition of bad loans and will have an effect on the liquidity of collateralized real estate and on the prevention of further drops in collateralized values. [Wada] What do you think of the pending question on home financing specialty companies? [Morikawa] The issue will have to be handled in a manner which calls for financial institutions to deal with each of the home specialty situations. Home financing specialists will have to dispose of bad loans and reexamine their future operations. [Wada] What are your views on the disclosure of bad loans? [Morikawa] Disclosures of bad loans by banks were initiated in March 1993 based on the report issued by the Financial System Research Council's subcommittee in 1992. I am aware of the important role played by disclosures in that they enhance the transparency of bank operations and that they lead to confidence in banks and the stability of financial systems, but we must provide sufficient consideration of their effect on the maintenance of orderly credit systems. We should verify the effects and the regularity of current disclosure actions and effect an incremental expansion in the procedure in terms of disclosure content and applicable financial institutions. Loans on which interest payments have been exempted or reduced reflect the premise that the principal will be recovered and fall in a category which differs from bad loans which are the subject of disclosures at this time. [Wada] Securities subsidiaries of city banks are expected to be established within the year, but how should we deal with reform of the financial system in the future? [Morikawa] The joint operation of banking and securities businesses has just reached its threshold. Fundamentally, such joint operations are subject to review in two to three years relative to operational restrictions. At present, rigidly enforced barriers require a review of many aspects and their merits relative to international compatibility and fairness and client convenience that were the original goals of joint operations. In April 1995, it will be just two years since the system reform went into effect. We plan to study and advocate changes in the firewall that restricts personnel actions and limits services offered by securities susidiaries. [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which loan operations which serve as a revenue source for banks have declined and attention is being focused on derivatives as a new source of revenues and profits? [Morikawa] Growth in the issuance of loans has definitely slowed, but this does not reflect a "reluctance by banks" to issues loans as indicated by some sources. All banks are working to expand loans, but the recession has prevented desirable progress. The primary source of bank revenues and profits will continue to rest with efforts to expand deposits and loans. On the other hand, it is a fact that financial systems are being decontrolled and that the management and procurement of corporate capital is becoming sophisticated, but banks' foreign operations have been expanding as well. Banks' role is to assist overall corporate financing. If needs in the area of derivatives expand, banks must have the capability to respond to those needs. [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which derivatives are traded without accountability on bank records, expose banks to the risk of undisclosed losses and could serve as a cause of market turbulence? [Morikawa] The main purpose of derivatives is to provide a system for managing risk and one's evaluation of derivatives depends on his interpretation. However, although they involve huge sums and are not cash transactions, there is the one problem of being unable to measure the size of the risk. It is important to maintain risk control in terms of credit risks versus the other party to transactions. [Wada] Can you give us your outlook for the economy? [Morikawa] In addition to public works investments and housing construction, signs of improvement can be seen in certain segments of individual consumption. However, because we have undergone last spring's experience where a rising economy was frustrated, we cannot help but become cautious about economic assessments. Corporations are negative on capital investments and we cannot assume an optimistic outlook on individual consumption. It is too early to confirm that the recession has bottomed out, as long as the tempo of the recovery does not gain momentum. However, we may see somewhat more obvious signs of a recovery assuming tax reductions and comprehensive economic measures take effect. [Wada] What do you think of the changing interest situation including rising long-term interest rates? [Morikawa] Long-term interest rates can be affected by supply and demand factors for bonds, but in the present situation it is hard to think of the economy as having started on the path of recovery on a midterm basis. Prices are very stable. I believe that there is hardly any reason for rising interest rates. [Wada] Will banks continue to be able to earn margins on interest rates? [Morikawa] The reason why banks were able to expand their margins until recently is that during the period of declining interest, they increased the ratio of short-term funds procured on the open market. However, when interest rates are stable, an expansion of bank margins is not feasible. [Wada] What do you think of the strong yen in the foreign exchange markets? [Morikawa] I am concerned about the effect of the strong yen on the economy and trends in interest rates. I feel so because a strong yen-weak dollar scenario can lead to a rise in U.S. long-term interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and a ripple effect on the world economy as a whole. Cooperative intervention by Japan, Europe and the United States has resulted in the temporary stabilization of the yen, but I hope that we see a time when it reaches a point of genuine stability reflective of sound economic fundamentals. [Wada] What do you think of the situation in which the yen is expensive in terms of corporate performance and poses difficulties for Japanese businesses? [Morikawa] There will be a major impact not only on export industries, but on industry as a whole. Businesses must shift their production base to overseas locations and replace domestic materials with foreign-produced materials. I am concerned about the effects of such shifts on employment and incomes. [Wada] What to you think of the agreement between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications on the postal savings issue? [Morikawa] I express my admiration over the fact that the two ministries reached an agreement on an issue plagued with a wide variance in positions. However, the recently reached agreement has problems. The agreement leaves much to be desired from the standpoint of the banking industry in ways such as the 1.1 percent differential in interest rates between ordinary postal savings accounts and regular bank savings accounts. We consider it to be an interim agreement and believe that talks will be reopened at the end of the year to discuss the interest rate differential for postal savings. Ordinary savings interest rates should conform to the average private industry rate and postal savings rates should not be significantly higher. Even the Provisional Council for the Promotion of Administrative Reform has produced a report stating that "government businesses augment private industry businesses," and I hope that early action will be taken on a modification of the postal savings interest rate. [Wada] Interest rates for floating deposit and savings accounts will be decontrolled effective in October. How will interest rates be established? [Morikawa] They will be established on the basis of individual decisions, but interest rates will be established under a competitive climate on the basis of factors such as interest levels prevailing in financial markets and the cost of procuring funds. Even in this situation, the existence of special treatment for postal savings poses a problem for private-sector banks in determining appropriate interest rates. [Wada] The Japanese economy is entering a slow growth phase. What do you think of a movement to restructure the financial industry, once the disposition of bad loans is completed? [Morikawa] Future economic growth will definitely be slower than in the past, and the operating environment will change because of deregulation, calling for actions responsive to the new age. Mergers are one option. Instead of limiting measures to the pursuit of advantages derived from operations of a larger scale and mergers to assist ailing operations, we'll probably see mergers that seek industry and geographical diversification. Actions will vary depending on bank territories and assets and manager decisions. A multitude of options such as mergers, joint ventures, and major reengineerings are possible.
