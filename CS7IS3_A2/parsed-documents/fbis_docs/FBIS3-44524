This is the second time within 40 days that the French Minister has expressed his willingness to improve ties with China. In his interview with a French newspaper "LES ECHOS" on November 29 last year, Juppe regretted that France and China were at loggerheads over the decision made by the French former socialist government to sell Mirage-2000 combat planes to Taiwan.
