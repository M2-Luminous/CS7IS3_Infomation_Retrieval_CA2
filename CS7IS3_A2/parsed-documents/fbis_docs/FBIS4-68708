M. Rothschild & Sons Co, and the trust company, Rothschild Trust Corporation Ltd. The first joint project within the framework of this agreement was the issuance of bank bills which representatives of the London bank arrived to present (see yesterday's issue of KOMMERSANT). Yesterday representatives of the House of Rothschild and their Russian partners held a press conference devoted to business cooperation on the Russian capital market. The plane which brought the English financiers to Russian land landed on Tuesday evening. Even earlier there were rumors floating about that the Englishmen had refused the services of the ninth directorate of the KGB and preferred to hire guards at one of the Israeli firms. And it was said that almost an entire planeload of bodyguards would fly to Moscow. However this information was indignantly denied by the bank's representative, who reported that the host side would ensure the delegation's safety. So the business meetings of the representatives of the House of Rothschild began on Tuesday, and the schedule was so full that yesterday's press conference, despite the journalists' numerous questions, was brief. But even so, the KOMMERSANT correspondents managed to ask a question which bothers many people, why a powerful financial group agreed to become a business partner of a Moscow bank which is not the largest. "We are very pleased to be working with the Russian National Bank," the president of the company Rothschild Trust Corporation Ltd., Leopold Rothschild, clearly did not want to reveal all the nuances of cooperation with the Russian bankers. According to him, the Moscow bank was the first to show initiative by proposing that the Rothschild group participate in issuing bills and the plan itself proved to be "very practical and interesting." Leopold Rothschild emphasized that the agreement on cooperation in the Russian capital market was signed for 10 years and its prospects largely depend on the success of the first project. Mr. Rothschild reported that his company's role in it is minimal. Gold will be bought with the currency transferred to the trust company's account in the N. M. Rothschild & Sons Co. bank, and it will be kept in storage and sold as needed. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT experts, this plan has a number of indisputable advantages. Thus, the Russian National Bank, like most Russian banks which do not have a license to work with gold, thereby receives the opportunity to back bills with gold assets. And selling some of the gold will be sufficient to pay off the bills (the London company will do this at the bank's instruction) and settle obligations. The only problem is that after a year (the term of circulation of a bill), gold may drop in price. Mr. Rothschild was asked the perfectly logical question of in what form the gold is to be bought. For example, will term contracts be concluded for its delivery? But the head of the trust company, who had obviously decided to avoid specific answers when possible, merely said that gold deals would be made "based on the principle of commercial wisdom" and "with maximum advantage for the Russian National Bank."
