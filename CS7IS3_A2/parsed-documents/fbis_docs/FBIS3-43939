Mr. de Klerk was warmly received by an audience of mostly first-year students at the University of Potchefstroom. Taking the stage, he accused the African National Congress [ANC] of intolerance and intimidation. [Begin de Klerk recording] The ANC has robbed hundreds of thousands, if you look back over the past ten years, of young black South Africans of a proper education by making a political battlefield of school education. They're a dangerous party, they're a reality, they're strong, they have substantial support, but there is only one party which can cut them down to size -- and they need to be cut down to size -- and that is the National Party. [end recording] From the University Mr. de Klerk went to a meeting of National Party organizers at the Potchefstroom Hall. The road show continues this morning with meetings at Klerksdorp and Rustenburg.
