It will enable individuals to exchange a wide range of information with each other and society at large via computer terminals and telephones, said Xu Zuzhe, secretary-general of the Beijing Information Industry Association. "It signals that China is in a transitional period in building its information highway," he said at a high-tech exhibition to celebrate the international telecommunications day here today. New services in telecommunications have grown fast these years, he said, including E-mail systems, which have attracted their first groups of users in Beijing and Shanghai. And China is building its first public packet switching data network, with 36,000 km being completed last year. "Auto audio services have been adapted to the fields of securities, bank systems, and wireless paging," said Guan Xuemei, general manager of the Beijing Shining Star Company, a main producer of auto audio technology. In addition, Xu's association is discussing the possibility of designing an electronic bulletin board for public rentals. The bulletin board can provide news as well as other information through a computer network nationwide. Countless information companies are rushing onto the market, including foreign firms such as the Dow Jones Company of the U.S. "The expansion of the public information market goes in line with the people's improved living standards," said Li Rujiang, vice general manager of the Shenzhen Oriental Co. Ltd. he added that in recent years, more Chinese families have gained access to telephones, personal computers, and fax facilities. Guan Xuemei said that the government's decision to speed up the development of the service industry has quickened information flow. Statistics show that the posts and telecommunications sector has remained the fastest growth sector in China -- last year it was up 59 percent over 1992.
