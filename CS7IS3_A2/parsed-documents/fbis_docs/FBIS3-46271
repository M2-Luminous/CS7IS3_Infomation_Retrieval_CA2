For the Chinese people's improved standard of living has prompted greater demand for varied, high quality products, Yu Zhen, Chairman of China National Council of Light Industry, said in Beijing. When China re-enters the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), light industries will have to make more and better products to meet the challenge of the world market, Yu said. He also called for increased growth to secure supplies of daily consumer goods. Yu vowed to seek further overseas technology and capital to help the industry meet its targets. And he predicted increased demand for wallpaper, paint and household fittings, air conditioners, health-care products and food, particularly new products in fancy packages. Yu also pledged to grant import and export licences to more companies likely to make money from foreign trade. But he stressed that quality products rather than access to the market would make firms successful. Yu expected output from light industries would rise 15 percent this year to 506 billion yuan ($58 blllion), compared to 397.1 billion yuan ($46 billion) in the first 11 months of 1992. The industry plans to develop more than 800 new products this year which Yu hoped would make up 20 percent of the industry's total output. He also called for a 15 percent increase in exports this year taking them over $34.5 billion. Exports from January to November last year were $20.1 billion. This goal should be easier to attain following the unification of the foreign exchange rate. Yu urged the industry to cut debt ridden enterprises by 5 percent and ensure 90 percent of its surveyed consumer goods meet quality standards. Last year, a third of the country's light industrial enterprises were running in the red, a proportion similar to the country's overall industrial situation. The industry's production-sales rate should reach 96 percent this year compared with 95.08 percent a year ago, Yu added. The China National Council of Light Industry will double its effort this year to co-ordinate and guide enterprise's production without direct involvement in their management and daily operations, he said.
