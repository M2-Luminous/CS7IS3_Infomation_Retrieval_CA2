The major obstacles to a conclusion on schedule continue to be the issues of transit and agriculture. Yesterday evening in Brussels, Foreign Minister Mock no longer ruled out the possibility that the talks might be broken off. He said literally that a crisis where one might go home has certainly arisen. Greek EU Chairman Pangalos said that he would deplore such a step very much. He did not want to rule out a successful conclusion of the negotiations despite the current crisis.
