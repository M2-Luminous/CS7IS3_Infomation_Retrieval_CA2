Otsenko: "The Field Is Left without Fertilizers"] [Text] The whole fall and winter, the government nurtured the villagers with promises: supposedly, from day to day the state will pay for the production supplied, it will take care of the supply of fuel, of mineral fertilizers, and other resources, before the beginning of field work. And now the time for going into the fields on a mass scale has begun. Through the lack of fuel in the winter a very small amount of organic fertilizers has been prepared. Perhaps it will be made up with mineral fertilizers. "The situation with them is also critical," says V. Tyshkevych, the assistant head of the "Ukragrokhim" association. "In past years, the farmers and our staff began to prepare mineral fertilizers for spring field work in November. In the winter, all the problem areas were worked out. Everything got done without emergencies. Now things only get started at the end of February. There was not such tension and difficulty..." Because of the state's delay in payments for plant and animal production, the farms did not have anything with which to acquire fertilizer. As a result, many enterprises held back their production, or sold their production to purchasers who were able to pay--to commercial structures and foreign firms. At an inappropriate time, on 11 February, the state decided to allot credits to the countryside. Even if all our mineral fertilizer plants work at full capacity, the demand for nitrogen fertilizers will be satisfied by May only at the 70 percent level, phosphorous at 50 percent, and potassium at 18 percent. Many farms, especially in the western region, will not be able to renew winter grain in time and to the fullest extent. A large deficit in the harvest will mean a four month halt for the Rivne production association, "Azot." It was paralyzed by a lack of funds to pay for gas and electricity. Only at the start of spring, they got going here one aggregate for producing ammonium nitrate; the rest are standing still. The farms in the south began field work first. However, the Horlivka production association, "Styrol," which services this zone, also will not help the farmers much. Of the 35 billion karbovantsi of state credits transferred to it, only 3 billion have been issued. The enterprises which produce for Ukrainian farms are supplied with mineral fertilizers, gas and electricity at lower prices. Unfortunately, many plants often do not use the energy resources for what they are intended. For example, the northern Don production association, "Azot," every day produces fifteen hundred tonnes of ammonium nitrate, but the warehouses are empty. The fertilizers intended for spring fields go for export. The Cherkasy production association, "Azot," and the Rozdol enterprise, "Sirka," unload oils for the countryside in unsatisfactory fashion. Raw material for phosphorous fertilizers were purchased in Russia for 18.3 billion rubles, but the Sumy association, "Khimprom," the Rivne "Azot," the Vinnytsia "Khimprom," and the Kostiantynivka chemical plant, are not hurrying to take care of the production of these fertilizers. The irregular natural of mutual financial payments at the intragovernmental level has left the farmers of Ukraine without potassium fertilizers. The production association, "Biloruskaliy," has broken off relations with Ukraine. The Kalush "Khlorvinil" and the Stebnytskyy potassium plants are too small, and the potassium fertilizers produced by them are of significantly lower quality than the Belarusian. The impression has been created that it is not Ukrainian bread that railroad officials are planning to eat; otherwise, they would not behave toward the countryside in such a way, like racketeers. First, they began to demand payment raised several times for a carload, since supposedly it had not been reserved 45 days in advance. Then they seemed to relent, but having loosened the reins in one case, they skinned them for other services. For example, they refuse to extend the railroad tariff which had applied up to 5 December of last year for the period of spring field work. Now, to ship fertilizers it is necessary to pay five times more. The department did not agree to establish the time for unloading cisterns with ammonia up to five days, as was the case earlier. With a lack of fuel and broken down auto transport, the farmer has to do this right away. Otherwise, there are fines. The extortion by the railroad men leads to mineral fertilizers, and in the final analysis prices for agricultural production, becoming much more expensive. We have reached spring. The country's chemical enterprises has to send to the countryside, every day, 18,500 tonnes of oils, and are unloading only a third. Last year the Almighty was merciful and gave us a harvest. What can we hope for now?
