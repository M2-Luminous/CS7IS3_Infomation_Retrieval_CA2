All the others were locked tight and sealed with several seals. But in this one room was the entire apparatus of the oblast soviet, all of the representative people's power. I could not help but think: Here it is, the last redoubt of the Tambov deputies. It was no accident that this military terminology came to mind. What has been going on in Tambov during recent months is reminiscent of fierce battles. Here the head of oblast administration, V. Babenko, has declared a real war against the soviets. But if it were only a war of words... Vladimir Dmitriyevich is conducting the siege of the Tambov "White House" on a broad scale, using the subdivisions of the militia, the mass media, and threats to cut off the deputies' telephone service. In general, the entire experience of Krasnopresnenskaya embankment has been taken into the arsenal, except that there are no devoted Taman followers in Tambov and they are not shooting at the building from tanks. Also, the plumbing works. What sins have the Tambov deputies committed before Mr. Governor? Here we must take a short excursion into the past. V. Babenko assumed the chair of the head of administratipon after the events of August 1991 which were victorious for the "democrats." The chief physician of the oblast hospital, a urologist by education, he at first conducted himself loyally in regard to the oblast soviet. Vladimir Dmitriyevich liked to emphasize the fact that there was complete peace and mutual understanding in the relations of the local executive and representative power, and that together they have only one noble goal--to show concern for the people's welfare. It is true, however, the welfare of the people was ever dwindling, and it was necessary to find a "scapegoat." And so they found one, particularly since the events of September-October thundered in Moscow. Here the power of Vladimir Dmitriyevich unfolded to its full extent, as well as that of the president's representative, V. Davituliani. The latter directly announced in the pages of the press that "it is specifically A. Ryabov (the chairman of the oblast soviet--V. T.) who bears the main responsibility for the failures in the economy, since he... subordinated the oblast administration to himself." V. Babenko found another accusation. He exposed the oblast soviet in its anti-governmental, anti-presidential and confrontational position. Mr. Babenko did not specifically decipher the manner in which this "terrible position" was expressed, believing that it was enough simply to issue the verdict: As of 22 October, to cease the activity of the Tambov Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and its agencies. It is true, the decree also spoke of one other reason for the impossibility of the oblast soviet's implementation of its functions--"due to the absence of a quorum as a result of the mass resignation of its deputies from their powers and authorities." We will return to this accusation, but for now we must remind the honorable Vladimir Dmitriyevich that no later than 11 October the session of the oblast soviet adopted by a two-thirds vote the decision not to include the question of self-dissolution on the agenda. Only six deputies supported this proposal. That is when the pressure on the deputies started. Their official statements began to come in, which were brought by special messengers from the rayons. But without waiting for the decision of the mandate commission on the correctness of these statements, the governor publicized his decree at the meeting of the minor soviet. Naturally, the minor soviet found it to be unlawful, and on the basis of the Russian Federation law, "On the Kray Oblast Soviet of People's Deputies and the Kray Oblast Administration" (no one has repealed this law even to this day), the minor soviet appealed to the Russian Federation Procurator General and the oblast procurator with the request to answer: Are such actions by the head of administration legal? The Procurator General of Russia, A. Kazannik, kept quiet in this affair. However, the oblast deputy procurator, V. Amelin, directly announced that since the minor soviet repealed the decree issued by the head of the oblast procurator's office, he finds no grounds for intervention. Although it is written somewhat ingeniously, it is not difficult to deduce the fact that the procurator's office holds the actions of the minor soviet to be correct. It would seem that this should be the end of the Tambov battles. But no, this merely egged the governor on to new skirmishes. Speaking at a press conference, he openly announced that, of all the political problems today, the question of liquidating the soviets of all levels stands in first place. And that was the beginning of it all. The financing of the oblast soviet was cut off, the automobiles were "arrested", and then the phones were disconnected. As of 1 November, the oblast soviet apparatus has been placed on leave for a month and a half. And although such a term is not indicated in any KZOT [Code of Laws on Labor], nevertheless this did not trouble the head of administration. He generously paid, out of the taxpayer's pockets, the month-and-a-half idle time of the people, many of whom, we might add, had already taken their regular vacations even before. This saga was further continued on 16 December. As described in the local press, it was specifically on this day that they were met at the oblast soviet building with sealed doors of offices and a reinforced militia guard. It is true, some people, as they say, were able to slip into the building. Deputy Head of Administration I. Filatyev assured them that all would be placed in jobs within the course of the present day. Mr. Filatyev was evidently hasty in this announcement. Even today, not all the workers have been placed in jobs. But that is not all. Who gave permission to violate the labor legislation in the most blatant manner, to nullify the presidential edict of 26 November 1993, which clearly states that a change in the staff numbers and structure of the apparatus of the Soviet of People's Deputies is not permitted in the period prior to start of work of the new representative organ? I believe that Mr. Babenko's attitude at that time was definitely influenced by the results of the elections to the Federal Assembly. They turned out to be rather pathetic for the Tambov "democrats." Having understood where the gentlemen from Babenko's command were leading the oblast, the voters gave them, in the words of Sholokhov, "a complete thrashing." People who were not subject to political twists and turns were elected to the Federal Assembly. Among them was A. Ryabov, the chairman of the oblast soviet. Here it is time to say a few words about the chairman of the soviet. Aleksandr Ivanovich worked his whole life in the Tambov area. He is a candidate of science and enjoys great authority among the people. And he entered the elections with a precise and clear program of preserving people's power, implementing social justice and protecting the interests of the people. We might add that he registered not as the former, but as the currently acting chairman, and the people appraised the true worth of Ryabov's civic courage. He won by a large margin, beating out that very same Babenko and the people from his command. This blow to his self-esteem rocked V. Babenko. He hastily announced in the press that conclusions would be drawn also in regard to the activity of the oblast agricultural administration, the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN and the experienced economic managers. Many of them did not reject their nomenclature predilections and, in essence, had dealt a stab to the back, announced the governor. The situation in the oblast is leading to poverty. Here are but a few figures. Today there are already more than 13,000 officially registered unemployed persons in the oblast. This is two or three times more than in neighboring oblasts. The volume of industrial production has declined by 10.3 percent in a year, and fewer consumer goods were produced. And here is the situation in the rural areas. Meat production has declined by 21 percent during the year, milk--by almost 7 percent, and wool--by 22 percent. The herd size of all types of livestock is declining. Investments in the national economy have declined by 32 percent, and the operational introduction of automobile roads has declined by 46 percent. The representative of the president, Mr. V. Davituliani, best summed up the truth, I believe. In a lengthy announcement regarding the situation, addressed to President B. Yeltsin, he writes that the old and new bureaucrats are hindering the reforms which threaten to take power out of their hands. "It was you, Boris Nikolayevich, who imposed this power! Did the people dream of such power when they supported you in 1991?" As they say, you can't put it any better than that! So, the problem is not in the deputies. Nevertheless, the Tambov governor continues to "storm" his "white house." Having learned that a meeting of the minor soviet was slated for 15 February, V. Babenko urgently "took measures." At 3 o'clock in the morning, under the cover of the militia, the doors to the oblast soviet were once again sealed. And this after the oblast court of arbitration found the decree by the head of administration on terminating the financing of the oblast soviet, on the upcoming lay-off of workers of the apparatus, and on the attitude toward the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN to be invalid, and after the court decision was handed down to return the building to the deputies. Nevertheless, the minor soviet did hold its meeting. It adopted a decision on measures for ensuring the safekeeping of the soviet's property, reviewed information on the arbitration court ruling, and repealed the 2 February decree issued by the head of administration, "On the System of Organs of State Power in Tambov Oblast." Almost immediately there followed a statement by the administration press service, saying that this decision is nothing other than a statement by a group of private individuals, and will not be implemented by the organs of executive power. These actions are qualified as being directed toward the destabilization of the socio-political situation in the oblast. No more and no less! Evidently, under pressure from some forces, the arbitration court also suspended the implementation of its ruling, forgetting even to specify the term of this suspension. In short, the storming of the building on Internatsionalnaya Street continues. Babenko is also not embarrassed about the tyranny in regard to Federation Council member A. Ryabov. During the days when I was in Tambov, the telephone in the room assigned to him did not work. Not to mention the fact that he had been deprived of transportation, harried and exhausted by the terrible strain on his nerves. Meanwhile, as before, people are going to the oblast soviet, as before with questions of the most vital importance. They also do not conceal their attitude toward the tyranny of the administration. This, roughly, is how N. Perepegin, an engineer and deputy of the oblast soviet, Deputy V. Drozdovich, a former scientific associate of one of the institutes, and others with whom I had occasion to meet characterized Babenko's actions. Yet the people are worried not only about the tyranny of the executive power against the soviets. The elections to the oblast duma are coming up soon in Tambov. Only thanks to the intervention of the minor soviet was it possible to double the size of this agency and to eliminate numerous violations of the effective legislation. But the gentlemen-democrats are once again bent on their own. Once again they are pushing their Tambov fellow citizens toward confrontation. For example, the mayor of the city of Tambov and leader of the "Democratic Russia" movement, V. Koval, had submitted the TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN program even at the last elections. It is quite obvious that some parties cannot be allowed to participate in the elections. In no case must the electoral commissions register representatives of the patriotic movement "Otechestvo" ["Homeland"] or any communist structures, regardless of what flag they may emerge under. Such an announcement has a wild smell about it. Then again, the leaders of the Tambov "democrats" are not only making political announcements. They are acting unceremoniously. One of the workers of the oblast soviet told me how, in his presence, in Mordovskiy Rayon the head of administration sent a militia detachment to interfere with the meeting of a candidate for deputy in the Federal Assembly, Aleksey Ponomarev, with the voters. It is a good thing that Aleksey Alekseyevich turned out to be not of the timid sort (he managed to stay in the beseiged House of Soviets on Krasnaya Presna until the last hour), and forced the zealous militiamen to leave. There is currently a fuss going on around the people's-patriotic electoral association "Rus," which unites representatives of over ten parties and movements. The association had a lease agreement with the "Avangard" House of Culture for several rooms which it needed to conduct business with voters. After several threatening phone calls, the director hastened to break this agreement. Pressure is also being exerted on the mass media. Even on 2 November, the head of oblast administration issued a decree on handing over to the administration the powers and authorities of the oblast soviet in regard to the newspaper TAMBOVSKAYA ZHIZN. The decree unceremoniously assigns the resolution of the question of handing over the newspaper's state property, as well as the question of co-foundership by the oblast administration. In this situation, the journalists have not yet flinched, but no one knows how things will be in the future. ...This year there is a snowy, frost-bitten winter in the Tambov region. In the city, which, it seems, has long ago been neglected by the politicians, one cannot even get through along the main roads. But the snowstorms are raging not only in nature. They are also devastating the souls of the people, before whose very eyes the scenes of destruction of the soviets are being played out and the will of the people is being flouted. No sooner had I written the last lines of this correspondence than I received a phone call from Tambov. A. Chubushev, section head of the oblast soviet called and bitterly informed me that the governor had made the decision to hand the oblast soviet building over to the humanitarian institute. That means there will be new battles. It is a shame that, amidst all the political battles, we are losing sight of the individual, for whom life is not sweet.
