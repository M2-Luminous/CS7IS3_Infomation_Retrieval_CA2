In a long apology of about two hours, the defendant rejected the accusation by often attacking it and frequently claiming that it did not present any concrete facts and that it is completely political and extremely (?hectic). Continuing with his explanations, the former first secretary of the Party of Labor of Albania [PPSh] explained several sections in the indictment, with which he is charged. I have not accepted and will never accept the idea that I have misappropriated and abused, Alia insisted, who is charged with the criminal act of misappropriating state property in conspiracy and that of abuse of position in conspiracy, defined in Articles 62/13 and 106 of the Penal Code. Defense Counsel Kleanthi Koci spoke in defense of his client. Koci denounced the grave violations that, as he said, were inflicted on his client. Counsel Koci, former chairman of the High Court of Appeals at Alia's time, stated that these violations are based on not knowing the constitution and having a low professional level. No, rejoined Neshat Fana, the prosecutor. It is Alia himself who tried to give political coloring to his speech. The charges against the defendant are not based on when he was president, but for the time when he was party chairman. The prosecutor continued to say that the denouncements of hundreds of families of those convicted have been entered in the investigation file. They request that the defendant be convicted as a criminal, as the one who initiated ideas on the isolation and depersonalization of the people, massive evictions, murders on the border, as a continuer of [Enver] Hoxha's deeds, etc. The indictment does not charge the defendant with such claims, but accuses him of personal errors while he was at the head of a political party. The people conducted a political trial, as Alia is trying to represent today's hearing, against him in February 1991 and March 1992. After the prosecutor's speech, Defendant Alia replied again, considering the speech of the prosecutor as a subterfuge against him. [passage omitted]
