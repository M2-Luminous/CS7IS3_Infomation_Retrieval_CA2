Some have disappeared without a trace, and there is no information as to their whereabouts," Gyorgy Kemal Ekrem, the only co-chairman of the organization not currently detained, told a news conference at his flat on Friday [10 June]. The two other HM leaders, Istvan Gyorkos and Albert Szabo, were taken into police custody on April 28 on the suspicion of having committed a crime of incitement against a community. The HM was founded in Budapest on April 12, 1994. At a news conference in late April, Ekrem, Gyorkos and Szabo said they identified partly with the ideas of Ferenc Szalasi's Arrow-Cross Party. (Szalasi -- 1897-1946 -- led the Hungarian Arrow-Cross Party-Hungarist Movement. Hitler helped him to power on October 15, 1944, and he introduced a reign of fascist terror in the country. The Hungarian people's court sentenced him to death as a war-criminal in 1946.) At today's press conference, Ekrem said one of their members was arrested by the police at the demonstration against Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman Gyula Horn for carrying a poster saying "Never Again the Jewish Terror of Rakosi and Gero." (Matyas Rakosi was general secretary of the Communist Party after the war until 1956, and Erno Gero was the second strong man. Gero headed the party at the outbreak of the 1956 revolution.) Ekrem said that another Hungarist went on hunger strike outside parliament for the release of Gyorkos and his associates, and is also believed to have been arrested, because he disappeared with the deck-chair and blanket he received from Ekrem. According to Ekrem, Gyorkos and Szabo were arrested at the personal instructions of Prime Minister Peter Boross. Ekrem said the HM was gaining in strength despite harassment by the authorities: Hungarian emigration entrusted it with the task of bringing national forces into one camp. The movement mainly seeks the support of young people, primarily approaching the "uninfected 17-18-year-olds." Ekrem said one of their recent meetings was attended by university students who have quit the Federation of Young Democrats. He added that they conceive the movement as a nation-building, cultural, and tradition-fostering organization, and that he personally rejects racism. In this point, his views differ somewhat from those of the arrested HM leaders, he admitted. The prime minister has no involvement in the legal proceedings against Albert Szabo and Istvan Gyorkos, government spokeswoman Judit Juhasz told MTI in connection with Ekrem's remarks. National Police Command spokesman Laszlo Garamvolgyi termed Ekrem's words as "wandering." There is no case of, nor has there ever been any precedent of somebody being held in custody without any information as to their whereabouts, he added.
