"I am asking for everyone to be calm, including the generals and the SAP [South African Police], because the ANC [African National Congress] is using this opportunity to try and cut our throats," he told about 500 people in the Oudtshoorn Civic Centre on Tuesday [22 March] night. "Don't let us be guilty of a hearing and sentence without tested evidence. The Goldstone report shocked the SAP and myself, because everything Mr Justice Richard Goldstone says in his report is diametrically opposed to the policies of the National Party [NP] and State President F.W. de Klerk. When Mr de Klerk received the report, I was with him and he had no other choice but to act the way he did." Mr Kriel said if the accusations contained in the commission's interim report had been ignored, the government would have been accused of a cover-up and would have placed the SA Police in an even weaker position. It was of cardinal importance to get to the truth as soon as possible. Mr Kriel said it was on his recommendations that an international investigating team be appointed -- in the interest of the SAP. The result of the investigation has to be above suspicion of any cover- up, he said. "The report should he handled as soon as possible because of the paranoia of the ANC and Democratic Party to prove the SAP is a bunch of criminals. The investigation must restore people's trust in the SAP." Mr Kriel said the Goldstone Commision interim report showed up painful shortcomings in the whole commission system in South Africa. "I am not blaiming Mr Justice Goldstone but the system lends itself to things not going right. People get a report based on untested evidence and allegations which are made public and then, people are tried in the media and not in court. That is wrong." He said the weakness of commission's report was that people's careers were also ruined, adding that he was also not blaming Mr Justice Goldstone because he had to carry out the procedure. Mr Kriel said he was also not blaming President de Klerk who had to make a decision. "I am sorry for the victims of such a system. I think it should be the responsibility of a government of national unity to see that a better commission system is introduced, where evidence is tested according to legal practice." Mr Kriel said he would not resign because of the report. "Any cabinet is appointed or fired by the state president. I will not resign if the ANC demands it, or over a report not yet tested in a court of law."
