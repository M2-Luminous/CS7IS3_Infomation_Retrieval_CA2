Hirs said the situation showed the need for coordination in the Czech Republic's foreign policy. The LSNS completely disagrees and fundamentally rejects the idea of Baudys' plan, whereby a committee of countries connected to the warring sides in Bosnia by shared religious and cultural values would be created to oversee the peace process. Hirs said the problem of Bosnia could not be internationalized, for in this way Russia would very easily get into this space and would once again dominate southern and central Europe. The plan divided spheres of interest, which was always dangerous, Hirs said, because it would lead to the internationalization of the whole problem. In democratic systems ministers leave their seats for relatively small sins, Hirs said. I would not like to comment myself on the decision of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS) Executive Council. I believe that decisions concerning whether to dismiss or not to dismiss a coalition minister should be made by the government, not by the executive council of a party, although it is a coalition one, Hirs said, asked by CTK what he thought of the ODS Executive Council's recommendation that Premier Vaclav Klaus consider Baudys' dismissal. LSNS believes that no minister, not even the premier, should be allowed to carry out foreign policy activity without informing their own government and the foreign ministry. If they did so, it was inexcusable and creates a very bad impression abroad. Foreign policy is the business of the whole government, and foreign activity should be coordinated, consulted and approved by the government, Hirs said.
