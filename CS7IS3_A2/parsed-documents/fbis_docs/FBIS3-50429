The report, which is subtitled "The Facts Speak for Themselves," claims the Honduran state, the Armed Forces, and the Nicaraguan contras are responsible for the forced disappearance of people in the country. The much awaited report contains a provisional list of 184 disappearances. This figure is higher than the 143 forced disappearances registered in the files of the Committee of Relatives of Missing Detainees in Honduras (Cofadeh). Although names of people directly involved in these horrible crimes were not revealed, the ombudsman pointed out the importance of the state's acknowledgment of the existence of forced disappearances. So far, the Armed Forces and other institutions have refused to grant access to their 1980-93 files. Valladares said: "The ombudsman did not want to find what he did as he reviewed the sad pages of our recent history. We would have preferred to tell the country that there were no disappearances. We would have preferred to report that officials of state institutions were never involved in disappearances." In a melancholy tone, he added: "We would have preferred to say that torture was never practiced in Honduras. Nevertheless, the reality we discovered was terrible. Regrettably, there were indeed disappearances, and, unfortunately, civilian and military authorities were responsible or remained silent." This is an important moment in my life, Valladares said, after presenting the historic document that had been handed over on the evening of 28 December to President Rafael Leonardo Callejas and on the morning of 29 December to President-elect Carlos Roberto Reina. The most revealing part of the document contains the ombudsman's recommendations. The report states that in the country there were disappearances because there were people willing to carry them out. It demands that justice officials start an investigation to clarify the specific responsibility of all those mentioned in the report as masterminds and perpetrators of the disappearances. Based on this, commanders or officers in charge of staff intelligence units, known as the G-2, must be investigated. Special attention must be given to those units in charge of fighting subversion between 1980 and the present. The commanders and officers of Intelligence Battalion 3-16 also must be investigated. Others who must be investigated include the directors of the National Investigations Directorate (DNI), formerly known as Department of National Investigation (DIN). Officers and people in charge of interrogation operations, such as the Special Operations Team of Intelligence Battalion 3-16 and the so-called Special Investigations Detachment of the Public Security Force (Fusep), must also be investigated. As for Armed Forces Commander Luis Alonso Discua Elvir, who was not in the country on 29 December and is accused by popular organizations of having been the head of the fearsome Battalion 3-16 during the time of the disappearances, the ombudsman pointed out that Discua, as a soldier, is obliged to publicly explain his actions before the Honduran people. Valladares said: "The facts speak for themselves. Nevertheless, even though Colonel Discua Elvir was chief of Battalion 3-16 and Mayor Juan Blas Salazar was DNI chief, we should not presume they are responsible, because we are not judges. The ombudsman conducted an investigation that he has presented to the authorities, and they are the ones who should implement the proper measures." The ombudsman said he will place the report in the hands of the state prosecutor, adding that the Public Prosecutor's Office will be urged to act within a year of receiving the document. Valladares added: "Forced disappearances were at least tolerated, whether through action or silent neglect, by the country's political and judicial authorities. There is evidence of responsibility of members of the Honduran Armed Forces and the Nicaraguan contras in the disappearances, especially in cases involving foreigners." The ombudsman praised the work done by Honduran media, because they were the only media in Central America that denounced the disappearances in Honduras. As for the Judicial Branch, Valladares said it was characterized by its failure to fulfill its duty of protecting Honduran citizens. "The impunity of the authorities, in the absence of an investigation, was a factor that fostered these crimes," he added. In his report, the ombudsman also makes a number of recommendations to the Honduran state, including its duty to recognize damages done to the victims and their families and the need to grant reparations via a special commission. It also recommends the creation of a central registry of arrested people that would be under the Public Prosecutor's Office and would be open to everyone. The report also calls for the approval of a special law on those arrested, specifying their rights and responsibilities. Valladares pointed out that the Honduran state must ask the governments of the United States and Argentina to provide information on the identity of people who were working in the country at the time of the disappearances, and, if need be, locate and extradite members of the Nicaraguan contras. It also recommends the establishment of a commission to locate clandestine cemeteries and the construction of a monument bearing the names of all those who disappeared as a symbol of Honduras' vindication before the international community. When asked whether he felt any pressure or fear, Valladares said absolutely not. He added: "I actually met with silence and have felt lonely. I have no fear. This is the truth. If not being afraid is a crime, there is no hope for our country."
