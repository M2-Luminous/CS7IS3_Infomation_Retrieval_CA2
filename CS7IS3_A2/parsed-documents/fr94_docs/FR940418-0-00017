Demonstration of Maintenance_Projected Inventories Total VOC, NO X , and CO emissions were projected from the 1990 base year out to 2004. These projected inventories were prepared in accordance with EPA guidance. Refer to EPA's TSD prepared for this notice for more in-depth details regarding the projected inventory for the Raleigh/Durham area. On January 12, 1994, the State of North Carolina submitted supplemental projection inventories. The State recalculated growth rates to include 1992 Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) data received in late 1993 from the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The projections indicate that VOC, NO x , and CO emissions remain under the 1990 baseline emission inventory from 1990 through 2004. EPA believes that the emissions projections demonstrate that the area will continue to maintain the O 3 NAAQS because this area achieved attainment through VOC controls and reductions. The projected emission inventories were submitted in the SAMS format. C. Verification of Continued Attainment Continued attainment of the O 3 NAAQS in the Raleigh/Durham area depends, in part, on the State of North Carolina's efforts toward tracking indicators of continued attainment during the maintenance period. The State of North Carolina's contingency plan is triggered by two indicators, an air quality violation or the periodic emissions inventory exceeding the baseline emission inventory by more than 10%. As stated in the maintenance plan, the NCDEHNR will be developing these periodic emissions inventories every three years beginning in 1996. These periodic inventories will help to verify continued attainment. Refer to the TSD prepared for this notice for a more complete discussion of the indicators the State is tracking and the contingency measures. D. Contingency Plan The level of VOC and NO x emissions in the Raleigh/Durham area will largely determine its ability to stay in compliance with the O 3 NAAQS in the future. Despite the State's best efforts to demonstrate continued compliance with the NAAQS, the ambient air pollutant concentrations may exceed or violate the NAAQS. Therefore, the State of North Carolina has provided contingency measures with a schedule for implementation in the event of a future O 3 air quality problem. The plan contains a contingency to implement pre-adopted additional control measures such as Reasonable Available Control Technology (RACT) level control for not previously controlled VOC sources, Stage II vapor control for gasoline dispensing facilities, and new source permit requirements for VOC and NO x emissions to include emission offsets, Lowest Achievable Emission Rate (LAER) level control, and permit applicability. These pre-adopted additional measures will be implemented within 45 days of the date the State certifies to EPA that the air quality data which demonstrates a violation of the O 3 NAAQS is quality assured. The plan also contains a secondary trigger that will apply where no actual violation of the NAAQS has occurred. The secondary trigger is an exceedance of the baseline emissions inventory by more than 10%. On the occurrence of the secondary trigger, the State will commence, within 60 days of the trigger, regulation development and adoption of measures amending the State vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program, extending coverage of the I/M program, extending and/or lowering vapor pressure limits for gasoline, extending geographic coverage of RACT controls, transportation control measures, and RACT level control for NO x . A complete description of these contingency measures and their triggers can be found in the TSD prepared for this notice. EPA finds that the contingency measures provided in the State of North Carolina submittal meet the requirements of section 175A(d) of the CAA.
