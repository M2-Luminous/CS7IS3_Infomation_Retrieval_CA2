According to available data, U.S. fighter bombers carried out selective strikes against Serbian positions using modern laser guided bombs. Their activity, accompanied by casualties, was this time carried out under almost test conditions, like on a test range since the army of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina air defense did not respond. It did not try to prevent the two NATO air strikes. Two Sorts of Markers As long as the military strategists of the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina do not assess that an open conflict with the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] and NATO is inevitable, no other Serbian reaction can be expected. If it comes to an open conflict, the destruction would be far more extensive, but NATO and UNPROFOR would have to count on casualties and technical damage, too. One of the air strikes, in which the laser marking of targets was used, can be seen on the diagram. Before an aircraft with laser- guided bombs reaches the target area, it is necessary to mark the target (an armored vehicle) with a laser from another aircraft flying at a very high altitude. Another possibility is to mark the target using a ground marker, provided, however, that there is good visibility. In this case this could have been done by UNPROFOR military observers if they had the equipment necessary for laser marking. After the target has been marked, either from the air or from the ground, it can easily be hit by a laser bomb or missile. As far as the present generation of markers is concerned, there are certain reservations in the world about their operational efficiency. Aircraft which carry target markers have to fly at dangerously high altitudes until the strike aircraft have dropped the bombs and left the target area. On the other hand, a marker on the ground can be very easily detected. In case of Gorazde, the action by the F-16 and F-18 aircraft was not at all interrupted. If conflicts between the peacekeeping forces and Serbian soldiers continue, it will be necessary to activate the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina air defense. Western intelligence circles certainly know what equipment the Serbian air defense has, just as they know that this system has not been employed so far to attack NATO aviation. It can be claimed without exaggerated self-confidence that the aircraft that marked the Serbian targets on the ground with lasers (if this option was used) could have been destroyed by the ground- to-ground missile systems "Volhol," "Neva," or "Drina." It is known that aircraft flying at high altitudes can very easily be shot down. The aircraft that carried out the strike could probably have been hit, too. The United States knows that the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina Army possesses portable antiaircraft missiles (Stinger, Arrow, and Needle), which have proved to be very successful in shooting down low-flying targets. Once Activated -- No Return Soldiers fire these missiles, which have a range of approximately 3,000 meters, from the shoulder. They have an automatic infra-red guidance system, which enables them to hit their target with a 90-percent certainty. It must also be considered that it is never the case that only one missile is used. "The Needle" is the modified version of the Russian "Arrow" rocket with built-in sensors for avoiding the infra-red flares that the aircraft releases behind itself in order to "deceive" the missile. The Serbian army of Bosnia-Herzegovina has large quantities of portable antiaircraft missiles, and according to some information the missile system of the air defense troops has been enhanced lately. The United States knows where the active missile and radar centers in the Srpska republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina are situated. They also know that there are "passive" systems at unknown locations that can be discovered only when they are activated. Therefore it would be good if they were never activated because in such a case there would be no return.
