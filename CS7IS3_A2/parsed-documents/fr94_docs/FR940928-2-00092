FR940928-2-00092 FR940928-2-00067 Duke Power Company, Docket Nos. 50&hyph;369 and 50&hyph;370, McGuire Nuclear Station, Units 1 and 2, Mecklenburg County, North Carolina Date of amendment request: August 25, 1994. Description of amendment request: The requested amendments allow the testing interval for auxiliary feedwater (AFW) system pumps to be increased from monthly to quarterly on a staggered test basis. The proposed amendments are consistent with NRC staff recommendations and guidance contained in NUREG&hyph;1366, ``Improvements to Technical Specifications Surveillance Requirements'' and Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, ``Line-Item Technical Specifications Improvements to Reduce Surveillance Requirements for Testing During Power Operation.'' In addition, the requested amendments incorporate a note from Surveillance Requirement 3.7.5.2 of NUREG&hyph;1431, ``Revised Standard Technical Specifications, Westinghouse Plants'' into the existing McGuire Technical Specifications governing AFW system pump testing. This note clarifies that the turbine-driven AFW pump cannot be tested until the required pressure exists in the secondary side of the steam generator. Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: As required by 10 CFR 50.91, this analysis is provided concerning whether the requested amendments involve significant hazards considerations, as defined by 10 CFR 50.92. Standards for determination that an amendment request involves no significant hazards considerations are if operation of the facility in accordance with the requested amendment would not: 1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or 2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or 3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The requested amendments decrease from monthly to quarterly the frequency at which the motor-driven and turbine-driven AFW pumps must be demonstrated operable as specified in TS... 4.7.1.2 (McGuire). They also incorporate a note of clarification from the new Westinghouse STS [Standard Technical Specifications] into the existing... McGuire specification concerning when the pump head or discharge pressure versus flow verification for the turbine-driven pump is required to be performed. In 48 FR 14870, the Commission has set forth examples of amendments that are considered not likely to involve significant hazards considerations. Example vii describes a change to make a license conform to changes in regulations, where the license change results in very minor changes to facility operations clearly in keeping with the regulations. The requested amendments are similar to example vii in that they result in minor changes to plant surveillance requirements and are consistent with the existing NRC position and guidance contained in NUREG&hyph;1366 and Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, as well as NUREG&hyph;1431. While the issuance of NUREG&hyph;1366 and Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, as well as NUREG&hyph;1341 does not constitute a change in existing regulations, it nevertheless establishes the NRC staff's position concerning the acceptability of decreasing the surveillance frequency of AFW pumps from monthly to quarterly and concerning the acceptability of adopting all or part of the new STS. The requested amendments are consistent with the position of NUREG&hyph;1366 and with the guidance of Generic Letter 93&hyph;05, as well as with NUREG&hyph;1431. Criterion 1 The requested amendment will not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. Decreasing the frequency of AFW pump testing as specified in TS from monthly to quarterly will have no impact upon the probability of any accident, since the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. Also, since... McGuire's AFW pump performance histories support making the proposed change, system response following an accident will not be adversely affected. Therefore, the requested amendments will not result in increased accident consequences. ***Incorporating the new STS note will only serve to clarify when the turbine-driven pump is required to be tested and will not have any impact upon either the probability or consequences of any accident. The pump will still be tested as before and its acceptance criteria will be unaffected. Criterion 2 The requested amendments will not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. As stated above, the AFW pumps are not accident initiating equipment. No new failure modes can be created from an accident standpoint. The plant will not be operated in different manner. ***Incorporating the clarifying note from the new STS will not result in any new accident sequences, since plant operation will be unaffected. Criterion 3 The requested amendments will not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Plant safety margins will be unaffected by the proposed changes. The AFW pumps will still be capable of fulfilling their required safety function, since plant operating experience supports the proposed change. The availability of the AFW pumps will be increased as a result of the proposed amendments because they will not have to be made unavailable for testing as frequently. Finally, the proposed amendments are consistent with the NRC position and guidance set forth in NUREG&hyph;1366 and Generic Letter 93&hyph;05. ***Incorporating the note from the new STS will not impact any safety margins.
