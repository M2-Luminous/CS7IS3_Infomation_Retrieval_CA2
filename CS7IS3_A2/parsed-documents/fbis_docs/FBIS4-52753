Isao Nakauchi, vice chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), paid a visit to Hata's residence for the first time since the premier formed his cabinet in late April. Hata told Nakauchi, who is also chairman and president of Daiei Inc., the supermarket chain, that he hopes to promote deregulation through the initiatives of his cabinet rather than the bureaucracy. Earlier in the day, executive members of Keidanren took part in an administration reform promotion meeting, chaired by Nakauchi. The meeting was attended by Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai. In the meeting, Keidanren submitted to Kumagai a letter urging the government to promote deregulation. Kumagai said Hata's administration will make efforts to carry out deregulation from the viewpoint of improving consumers' daily life. Hata's cabinet held its first meeting on government deregulation plans on the day, government sources said. The meeting was held to promote easing regulations, which have been cited by the United States as trade barriers, they said. The cabinet wants to take the initiative on easing regulations as ministries and agencies concerned have been dragging their feet on the issue, the sources said.
