FR941202-1-00018 FR941202-1-00002 (9) Assumption for discretionary cash advances. If the consumer controls the timing of advances made after consummation (such as in a credit line arrangement), creditors must use the general formula in paragraph (b)(7) of this appendix. The total annual loan cost rate shall be based on the assumption that 50 percent of the principal loan amount is advanced at closing, or in the case of an open-end transaction, at the time the consumer becomes obligated under the plan. Creditors shall assume the advances are made at the interest rate then in effect and that no further advances are made to, or repayments made by, the consumer during the term of the transaction or plan. (10) Assumption for variable-rate reverse mortgage transactions. If the interest rate for a reverse mortgage transaction may increase during the loan term and the amount or timing is not known at consummation, creditors shall base the disclosures on the initial interest rate in effect at the time the disclosures are provided. (11) Assumption for closing costs. In calculating the total annual loan cost rate, creditors shall assume all closing and other consumer costs are financed by the creditor. (c) Examples of total annual loan cost rate computations. (1) Lump-sum advance at consummation.
