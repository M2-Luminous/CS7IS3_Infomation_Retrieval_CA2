This return is strongly demanded by local residents, particularly the residents of Yomitan village, where the YAA is located. This issue was taken up for discussion at a meeting between the visiting Frank Wisner, U.S. under secretary of defense [for policy], and Shigeru Hatakeyama, Japanese Defense Agency vice minister. During the meeting, Wisner reportedly indicated the United States' intention to return the YAA as early as this year, saying: "In the near future, certain progress is expected to be made in talks (on the return)." Ichiro Yoneyama, Defense Facilities Administration Agency [DFAA] director general, visited the United States in late February in a bid to settle issues concerning the U.S. military bases in Okinawa. As for the return of the YAA, a U.S. Government official told Yoneyama that "we will study the possibility of returning it." Thus, the United States appears to be studying details of the plan for its return. Yomitan villagers are pleased wholeheartedly by the report that the YAA may be returned as early as this year, and all the more so because they have earnestly called for its return. Yomitan village Mayor Tokushin Yamaguchi said: "I have waited for this day. I have a lump in my throat all the more so because the struggle for the return has been hard." The feelings of the local people are completely understandable. However, it does not seem that a "return within this year" has become definite. Japanese Foreign Ministry and DFAA officials have denied the possibility of the return within this year, explaining that the United States merely said that among the three plans presently under consideration (the return of the Naha naval port, the transfer of functions and the return of the YAA, and the cancellation of live-fire exercises across Prefectural Highway 104), "the return of the YAA may be possible." On the contrary, a senior DFAA official said that the possibility of its being returned within this year is "very low." It appears premature to be pleased by the report. However, judging from Wisner's remarks after the U.S. Government indicated its views to Yoneyama, it is certain that the United States is studying in an in-depth manner the details of the plan to return the YAA. Prior to the Wisner-Hatakeyama talks, a ministerial-level meeting of the Japanese-U.S. Security Consultative Committee was held and was attended by Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata, Defense Agency Director General Kazuo Aichi, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Under Secretary of Defense Frank Wisner, and other officials. A statement saying that the retrenchment and consolidation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa will continue to be discussed was included in the joint communique released after the meeting. The meeting was aimed at confirming that the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty is still playing an important role. It is believed that Japan and the United States are currently discussing intensively the retrenchment and consolidation of U.S. military bases on Okinawa because Aichi during the meeting touched on the return of the Naha naval port and the two other plans. U.S. military bases on Okinawa were built during the cold war era as frontline strongholds of the West. However, the global situation has changed greatly in these 50 years after the last war. The cold war between the East and West has ended, and the Japanese-U.S. relationship has also changed. Above all, Japan's international status has improved. In spite of this, extensive bases of foreign military forces are located on Okinawa, which is part of Japan, thus obstructing economic development and becoming great a impediment to the people's livelihood. We cannot ignore such a situation any longer. That is why the DFAA director general himself visited the United States to settle the return of the Naha naval port and the two other issues. Efforts must be made so that Yomitan villagers' and Okinawan residents' elation will not be in vain. The government should strongly urge the U.S. Government to return its bases, including the YAA, at an early date to meet the demands of Okinawa's residents.
