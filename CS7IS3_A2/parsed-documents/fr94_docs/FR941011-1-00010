FR941011-1-00010 FR941011-1-00003 To prevent undampened vibration of the elevators in normal cruise conditions which, when combined with hydraulic system failures, could result in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following: (a) Within 30 days after January 26, 1994 (the effective date of AD 94&hyph;01&hyph;09, amendment 39&hyph;8791), revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following restrictions of altitude and airspeed operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic system failure; and advise the flight crew of these revised limits. Revision of the AFM may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM. Note 1: The restrictions described in the AFM Temporary Revision (TR) RJ/30 meet the requirements of this paragraph. Therefore, inserting a copy of TR RJ/30 in lieu of this AD in the AFM is considered an acceptable means of compliance with this paragraph.
