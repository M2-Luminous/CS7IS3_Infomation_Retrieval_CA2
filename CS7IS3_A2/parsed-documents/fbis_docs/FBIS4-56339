If Congress approves the draft bill, habeas data cases will be heard only by civil courts and not by criminal courts. The draft law was submitted by Carlos Torres y Torres Lara, chairman of the Constitution Committee, who announced that the bill will be debated by the Congress plenum today. Although government and opposition blocs in Congress agree on the need to define this subject as soon as possible to eliminate any possible threat to the freedom of press in Peru, the diverse positions on the subject prompted a heated debate. In the end the majority approved the proposal to regulate the habeas data right through a specific law, while the minority demanded that the habeas data be eliminated from the text of the Constitution. The proposal to regulate habeas data was finally approved by a 7-6 vote. The draft bill is divided into seven articles and one transitory measure. The first article states that, until a specific law is approved, habeas data cases will be heard by a civil court near where the alleged offense took place. The second article states that media organizations are required to correct earlier reports without delay -- within three days -- and proportionally to the original report. In case of disagreement, a judge will decide when the correction must be published. Procedures set forth for the constitutional right of Amparo (with the exception of the provisions of Article 11 of Law No.23506, as outlined in Article 3 of the bill) will be applicable to habeas data petitions in case of procedural loopholes. The only transitory article of the bill states that if a habeas data petition is filed before a criminal court, it should be turned over to a civil court. The great majority approved the draft bill which Torres y Torres initially submitted to Congress in October, but which he submitted again yesterday after revising it and updating it. Torres y Torres feels that because this tool is new to Peruvian law, it should be regulated by a transitory law to give the nation time to gain experience before drafting a specific law. Torres y Torres asserted that the Constitution states that habeas data cases must be heard by civil courts in accordance with the procedures set forth in a writ of amparo and this is why criminal courts have turned down every habeas data petition filed before them. Torres y Torres voiced confidence that this bill will dispel every doubt about procedural matters concerning habeas data petitions. He said he believes the subject has been misinterpreted by some citizens and used for political purposes by the opposition. The opposition believes a law of implementation alone will not suffice. Roger Caceres (Frenatraca) [National Front of Workers and Peasants] and Lourdes Flores Nano (PPC) [Popular Christian Party] argued the need to eliminate the habeas data right. The PPC legislators say it is unnecessary because the writ of amparo guarantees the right of rectification. Henry Pease (MDI) [Democratic Left Movement], however, is not so radical. He proposes derogating just Paragraph 7 of the constitutional article on habeas data which refers to the media organizations. Torres y Torres Lara conveyed his satisfaction over the outcome of the committee hearing.
