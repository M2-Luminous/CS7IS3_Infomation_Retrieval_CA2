Padori: "The Alternatives `Covered' the South"] [Text] Three weeks after the Greek blockade of the border, our state not only leads a normal life, at least regarding the oil supply, but the established cooperation with, and the understanding of, our eastern and western neighbors [Bulgaria and Albania] inspired the eastern-western corridor. What is even more important, compared to the August embargo in 1992, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia--FYROM] met this blockade with solid reserves of oil derivatives, therefore there is time enough to make new agreements and activate new alternative traffic directions without feeling the lack of oil derivatives on the market. The government appeal that panic was superfluous and that the "occupation" of the gas stations was unnecessary was fruitful, at least during the past three weeks, because we saw that it was possible to buy fuel with or without the concessions of the Greek side! Reserves for Tranquility According to yesterday's reserves of oil in the country, consumers can remain calm. As Assistant Minister Tome Cemerski stated for our newspaper, and as the government statement made clear, the government is doing everything it can to ease the situation after the blockade. Soon, a meeting will be organized with Bulgarian representatives to sign an agreement on a faster flow of petrol-carrying vehicles across the border. On the other hand, the gas reserves are enough for a 70 days' normal supply, diesel fuel for 82, crude oil for 60, and technical gas for industry and kerosene for about 30 days. Alternative Warehouses In the meantime, "Makpetrol" is working continuously on the supply of new quantities of derivatives for its itself, and for the Skopje Refinery. Thus, Ljubomir Janev, the general manager, told us that an agreement has been already signed, and has already been put in action, with the Bulgarian partners for the supply of 10,000 metric tons of gas and diesel fuel, and for 3,000 tons of kerosene and technical gas. Between 50 and 70 petrol-carrying vehicles cross the Novo Selo border daily. In order to facilitate the increased number of crossings of vehicles carrying derivatives, it was agreed with the Interior Ministry and the Customs Service to only use the Novo Selo crossing. After the blockade, some 52,000 tons of crude oil remained in the warehouses of "Jet Oil" and "Mamiddakis" in Thessaloniki, 31,000 tons of which are the property of "Makpetrol" and 21,000 tons belonging to the refinery. The value of the "plunder" is about 7 million dollars, therefore the owners of the oil ("Makpetrol" and the Skopje Refinery) insisted on the release of the oil in a letter to the owners of the warehouses. According to their agreement, when the crude oil has been accepted and paid for, its loading and shipment to the users is guaranteed. However, as we found out, the "answer" was that the owners of the warehouses "are sorry, but we have to respect the government decision." As far as alternative warehouses are concerned, as we found out, efforts are underway to activate two tanks of 5,000 tons located in Vlora--Albania. There is not enough space in Drac to store oil derivatives for Macedonia, and there have been discussions with "Albatrans" about the two tanks in Vlora as an alternative, which should now be emptied! If agreement is reached, the tanks will be lent to the Macedonian distributors. This alternative is quite favorable, because it could provide derivatives from the Rijeka Refinery, which is very eager to cooperate with "Makpetrol" and the Skopje refinery. In that way it would be possible to have lower transport costs, and even better, this alternative route for derivatives could be reopened. Anyway, trouble caused by the blockage on the southern oil route has contributed to the reopening of the eastern and western transport corridors, which were looked on in the past as a reserve that few wanted to become the main distributing routes. However, now that it has become an imperative, it did not turn out to be very difficult; it was just another confirmation that life goes on, even without the southern crossing.
