Midlands spokesman Blade Nzimande says the decision is the most direct warning that the IFP's [Inkatha Freedom Party] way forward in the transition process is going to be waging war in Natal. Nzimande says the IFP decision, made at its Central Committee meeting yesterday, is the most serious threat to the transition process. The Midlands spokesperson says what is even more serious is the fact that the IFP is placing the fate of the oppressed majority in the hands of the right wing. Nzimande also says all those in Inkatha who are for national liberation and democracy should abandon the IFP and join forces with democracy.
