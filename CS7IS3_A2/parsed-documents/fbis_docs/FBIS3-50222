Speaking at a discussion-meeting organized by the Forum Foundation, Zemko was reacting to the current tense situation among the Hungarian ethnic minority which is 560,000-strong and which constitutes 11 percent of Slovakia's population. The Hungarians criticize the Slovak authorities of not observing minority rights, and they have called for autonomy in southern Slovakia, where most of them live. Jan Carnogursky, chairman of the opposition Christian Democratic Movement (KDH), said that as early as 1987 cooperation between the Hungarian and Slovak dissidents had been subdued due to the Hungarians' unwillingness to recognize the inviolability of the existing Slovak-Hungarian border.
