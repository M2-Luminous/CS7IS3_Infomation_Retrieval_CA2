"This is a political problem," he said. "This is the responsibility of governments, they are international responsibilities.... We soldiers just do our job and carry out orders given to us by governments." According to well-informed sources close to UN headquarters in New York, a top-secret document drawn up last November criticised the conduct of United States and Italian troops in the peace-making operation in Somalia, saying that they both acted on their own initiative, failing to take orders from the UN command. The report is also said to demand that the United States pay reparations for loss of life during a campaign to capture warlord Mohamed Farah Aidid.
