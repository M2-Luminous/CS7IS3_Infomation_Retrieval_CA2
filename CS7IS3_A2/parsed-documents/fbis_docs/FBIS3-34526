Nearly 10,000 pro-democracy Nepal Students Union (NSU) members gathered at the eastern corner of the city hall, where the by- elections' vote counting was in progress. The students shouted slogans against Nepalese Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala, such as "Down with disruptionist Koirala," and "Down with pro-India Koirala." The students bitterly criticized Koirala for his "unhelpful attitude" towards the Nepali Congress party president and candidate, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, in Kathmandu during his campaign for the by-elections on Monday. The by-elections, held in Kathmandu and Jhapa districts under heavy security, were to fill two seats in the lower house of parliament left vacant last year by the deaths of two communist parliamentarians. After raising anti-Koirala slogans for several hours at a street corner in Kathmandu, several hundred of them headed towards the prime minister's official residence in a procession. Riot police followed the angry students' procession but did not stop them, the witnesses added. The students said the prime minister's bitter remarks last week, broadcast over radio and television, against Bhattarai for his anti-government remarks during his campaign had badly affected the NC contender. They said Koirala's criticism had played a negative role that led people to vote for Bhattarai's opposition. Meanwhile, the country's main opposition party candidate in Kathmandu is leading in the vote counts, the state radio announced. The announcement said the Nepal Communist Party-United Marxist and Leninist (NCP-UML) candidate Bidhya Bhandari was leading in Kathmandu late Tuesday by over 6,000 votes against her ruling Nepali Congress party rival, Krishna Prasad Bhattarai. But in Jhapa, 390 kilometres (243 miles) southeast of here, the Nepali Congress candidate, Krishna Prasad Shitaula, was leading over his NCP-UML contender, Lila Udashi Khanal, by over 1,000 votes. Final results are expected to be announced Wednesday noon. Election Commission officials said that in Kathmandu elections, a total 95,978 ballots were cast out of the 136,655 registered voters. While in Jhapa some 44,981 voters exercised their franchise out of the 67,896 registered. Altogether, 24 candidates are in the election fray in Kathmandu, and in Jhapa nine candidates had filed their nomination papers. The winners in the by-elections will remain in the lower house for two and a half years.
