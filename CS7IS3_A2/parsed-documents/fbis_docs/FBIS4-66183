The General Political Department requires that every PLA officer and enlisted man be politically qualified, militarily superb, have a fine work style, provide vigorous support, and be strong in battle. From the first day that a serviceman puts on a military uniform, he is subject to strict military training and receives proper instruction in political ideology, the law, and discipline. For many years, servicemen have been the pride of the age and models in upholding the law. Faced with the onslaught of the upsurge in the commodity economy, and faced with the technicolor world in the wake of deregulation, servicemen have been put to all sorts of tests. Military camps are like small boats beset from all sides in resisting the various enticements of this deregulated world. Since the income of those in military camps is rather meager, since the environment is pretty much closed, and since some servicemen exceed their means, pursue a life of luxury, have a poor sense of marriage ethics, and conceal firearms and ammunition, serviceman crimes sometimes occur. According to expert study, serviceman crimes have certain inherent characteristics that merit deep thought on the part of servicemen and troop unit grassroots cadres. How is it that servicemen who have received military unit indoctrination and training for many years take a road of crime? What enlightenment can we gain from their actions? The writer visited one military camp and one family after another in a quest for the answer. Because of security considerations and the request of military units themselves, the writer has concealed servicemen's true names and units. A. Upon entering the military camp everybody performs his duty and contribute his youth. Poverty becomes a demon that lands servicemen in court. Seeing the wonderful opportunities that deregulation presented, he forgot the uniform he was wearing and his not so superb swimming ability. Throwing caution to the winds, he dived in. He drowned, of course. Back then when he hoodwinked everybody and served as plant manager with pride and elation, I interviewed "A." Today, when he is in jail, I have made him the living subject of an article. "A" was a 26-year old career noncommissioned officer. Like other charming entrepreneurs, "A" exploited his youth and his vigor. When he saw that a regiment-operated enterprise -- a beer bottle factory -- was verging on bankruptcy, he volunteered to sit with dignity in the armchair of the plant manager. "A" signed a contract with the regiment requiring that he turn over 20,000 yuan to the regiment each year. From then on, "A" pulled out all stops, working feverishly with the workers in the plant from morning till night. To his surprise, the beer bottle plant did not work out as he had expected. Despite their sweat, because of competition from local concerns, lack of managerial personnel, inept administration, high product costs, and poor sales, not only did the plant not make money, but losses continued year after year. The plant was on the verge of paralysis once again. "A" was an intelligent man. When he saw that all his efforts were to no avail, he began to ponder new approaches. With the plant's official seal and bank account number in hand, "A" traveled about in the name of sales promotion, sometimes being gone for one or two months on end. Although they felt the situation was a little strange, the regimental leaders felt that inasmuch as the plant had been contracted to "A," too many inquiries would be wrong. Furthermore, "A" always handled matters rather well. The contract he signed was in the regiment, so if he did not make money, they need not worry that he would renege on his obligations. So they did not pay close attention. Before long, it was the end of the year, but when the regiment joyfully sought out "A" to have him honor the contract, they received a subpoena that a civilian court has issued because the beer bottle factory violated national law by engaging in speculation. In order to earn some money, and eager for a quick return and instant benefit, "A" had used the beer bottle factory's official seal and bank account number to sign contracts everywhere. He ran a speculation scam. His own wallet was full, but the other parties to the contracts appealed to the court one after another. "A" was taken into custody by the local public security organization and punished according to law. Since childhood, he had had a special feeling about money. When he left an out-of-the-way mountain village and came to a large metropolis with a thicket of towering buildings, his hands itched.... Wei Xiaoling was a brash young cadre who might have been a comer but for this case. Wei Xiaoling had been born on a barren tract of land in the Taihang Mountains of Shanxi. After coming to the capital with a military unit, he was very happy, and worked very hard. He wanted to accomplish something in order to escape from the poverty of a peasant's life. His personnel file was filled with "excellents." He was one of the outstanding squad leaders in the entire army, and he was to be sent to a college to study. His illustrious record, and his striking appearance won him women's affection. In the fourth year after becoming a soldier, Wei Xiaoliang found favor with the daughter of a county magistrate to whom he became engaged. With such a gorgeously attired young woman on his hands, Wei Xiaoliang became preoccupied with his own lack of money. Naturally, his family did not have a cent they could give him to spend, so he looked longingly at all the fine things in the city. The unit in which Wei Xiaoliang served was a luxury military hostel where fine cigarettes and good liquor were in plentiful supply and not strictly controlled. On the first occasion, he stole half a case of Maotai whiskey and a carton of Red Pagoda cigarettes with no trouble at all. He sold them to a privately owned shop. Unscathed, several days later Wei Xiaoliang took two cartons of Shilin cigarettes. His appetite was becoming bigger and bigger. By taking the opportunity that being on duty every night afforded, within a month he managed to steal 5,600 yuan worth of cigarettes and liquor. But people who frequent mountains are bound to encounter a tiger sooner or later. When the shiny handcuffs snapped shut, clasping together hands that reeked of money, tears streamed down Wei Xiaoliang's face, and he was filled with agony. He said to the correspondent who interviewed him: "Nowadays it takes money to do anything. It is expensive to go out with friends, and I did not want to be too shabby. I come from a poor family. If I did not entertain and buy clothes for my girl friends, they would look down on me. But the little I got in allowances was not enough to buy a pair of socks. Vanity did me in!" When thievery occurs in a military unit, it is mostly because of problems in the indoctrination that the unit gives. Quite a few cadres at the grassroots level are not very capable, and are not honest themselves. They take advantages of enlisted men. They do not dare take charge of their unit boldly. Consequently, petty theft constantly occurs in some units at the grassroots level. The holder of a lot of authority over motor vehicles, he felt he should use it well today when a commodity economy was enveloping China. His philosophy was that one should exploit whatever resources one has, whether motor vehicles or something else, never thinking that he himself might be exploited by motor vehicles. "W" and I were from the same village. He was not a high ranking officer, just a first lieutenant commanding a car company. But "W" had very great authority. He controlled more than 40 large trucks and 23 other motor vehicles. For the previous two years, W had done everything by the book. He was not prone to act rashly. But one day a second rate peddler sought him out to ask that he make a vehicle available to go to a place to bring back cigarettes. "W" refused at first. He said, " I am a member of the Communist Party and I am also a military cadre. I cannot do such an illegal thing." Then, the peddlar, who watched his every word and expression, took out a stack of "e pluribus unum" and stuffed it into the company commander's depleted pocket. "We'll divide up the money we make 30 to 70. Don't worry. I will certainly not treat you unfairly. You don't have to do anything. Just depend on the insurance that a military license plate provides. Stay at home and take a cut." At the sight of the money, "W" finally wavered. He selected a good vehicle and, under cover of darkness, he personally drove it to the city's outskirts. Inevitably, military units have strict disciple, and for "W" inevitably was the first time he did this. "W" was very apprehensive. No sooner had the vehicle left the point where the cigarettes had been sold than public security enforcement personnel searched it. As soon as "W" saw that matters had taken a bad turn, he fled in the vehicle, the ear-splitting sound of police whistles rending the night air behind him. "W" drove the vehicle faster and faster, finally taking into a one-way street. Just then, a Huang He automobile came racing like lighting from the opposite direction. "Bang," the two vehicles collided head on and quickly exploded into a roaring fire. The correspondent went to the hospital to see W who had escaped death only by the skin of his teeth. Tears streaming down his cheeks, he told me repeatedly not to let his family know, and not to use his real name if I wrote a report. I understood his feelings, and I respected his request. B. A relatively insulated environment, a monotonous cultural life, and strict military camp discipline cause a substantial number of servicemen to commit crimes for women. He was a young military doctor who had been assigned to a unit hospital in a remote area. When a pretty patient appeared, his desires were aroused, and he exchanged the penicillin in the syringe for a powerful narcotic. Medical Doctor Ding's hospital was tiny, and it was also located in a god-forsaken place. He had always attended male military patients from his own outfit and family members who came to the unit (most of whom were also middle aged), but he had never taken care of any young female patients. One day, the fiancee of a soldier in Third Company came to the hospital with a severe case of influenza. Doctor Ding was very much taken with this young and beautiful young woman, so he diagnosed her illness and arranged for her stay in the hospital. The young woman's illness was not serious, but the military doctor insisted on freeing a bed for her use. The soldier was very relieved and said to his fiancee, "Since Dr. Ding says so, a hospital stay is certainly necessary. Stay for a while." Once the young woman was in the hospital, Dr. Ding busied himself even more in looking after her, thinking to win the young woman's love through his actions. Dr. Ding was nearly 30, and still a bachelor, so naturally this weighed on his mind. For several days in a row, the principle the young woman followed was "you may be hot, but I am not." Dr. Ding was very discomfited. One day, Dr. Ding came to give the young woman a shot. When the young woman's tender white behind was exposed to Dr. Ding's eyes, his hands could not be restrained from stroking it. When the young woman angrily rebuked him, instead of repenting his error, Dr. Ding replaced the penicillin in the syringe with a highly sedative narcotic. Very quickly the young woman lapsed into a lethargic sleep, and Dr. Ding threw himself on her anxiously.... When Dr. Ding was sent before the court, he murmured: "When I was studying to be a doctor, I learned better, but life in the armed forces is too confining. I indulged in fantasies all day long, and made a mistake without thinking." C. Military personnel frequently have rifles and cartridges in their possession, and they also often know military secrets. Officers and men who are unable to resist blandishments frequently shed tears on this sacred land. Military regulations explicitly provide that military personnel may not keep ammunition in their possession. However, young and happy-go-lucky soldiers do not pay sufficient attention to this regulation. On an incomparably soft and gentle morning, with a single crisp rifle shot, a young and blameless trainee platoon leader crumpled in a pool of blood. The freshly flowing blood was as bright as the shoulder patch on the shoulder that the shot just went through calling people's attention to his youth. He was only 21. Little Beans, a soldier in his platoon, was responsible. The very first time, he did live firing, Little Beans, who had liked to play with guns ever since he was a child, held back two cartridges and hid them in his pocket when no one was looking. Three months passed, but aside from taking them out secretly and feeling them from time to time, Little Beans never did anything with them. Every day, he watched the chirping little birds circling above the guard post. He felt utterly bored. Finally one early morning when he was on guard duty, he put the two rounds into his rifle magazine. Little Beans drew a bead on a little bird hopping on top of the guard post. As the little bird hopped around, Young Beans' rifle tracked it left and right, up and down. Just then, the trainee platoon leader came along quietly to check on the sentry. When Little Beans saw that familiar stern face in the sight of his rifle, in a moment of panic, he involuntarily pulled the trigger. Instantly, the bullet struck the young trainee platoon leader. Thus, the trainee platoon leader, who was just doing his job, fell beneath the muzzle of his own comrade in arms. Little Beans was also disciplined and punished according to law for this. Many officers and soldiers keep ammunition without thinking that it might fall into the hands of criminal elements, endanger the safety of the country and society, or even cause some irrecoverable loss. It was for this reason that the three general staff departments specially issued "Regulations Prohibiting Individuals From Concealing Firearms and Ammunition." Article 163 of the criminal code also contains explicit provisions. Nevertheless, there are always individual military personnel, particularly young soldiers, who pay no attention to the law of the land. They use various means to conceal ammunition. They may use it to make jewelry, or to show off, or to commit some act in violation of the law whose purpose they can tell no one. In the end, everyone of them ends up either hurting others or hurting himself. What began simply in order to show off erudition unexpectedly ended up with the disclosure of military secrets to an enemy agent. The writer met Yang Qun at a reform-through-labor farm in the capital. A pair of gold wire-rimmed glasses propped on his nose, his face thin and pallid, his body reedy, he looked as though the wind could blow him away. Yang Qun had been the secretary in charge of news at a certain combined arms army. He began talking about the crime he committed, which it was too late to repent. He was a person who liked to promote himself, particularly to strangers. He was fond of showing his erudition. Since he worked in a military organization, Yang Qun naturally new numerous military secrets. In addition, Yang Qun was a news secretary, who had extensive contact with all sorts of people in civilian life. Yang Qun said, "On a summer's day, I went into the city to give an article to the daily newspaper. When the editor saw me in uniform, he had me sit down to chat. When I saw how friendly this big editor was, I started to chat with him. In the course of the conversation, he casually inquired how many men were in our unit, and he asked about the tanks, guns, and even new model weapons. At first I did not think much about it. I just babbled on. We became good friends. Later on, he frequently came to the unit to spend time with me, and he had me show him the base and the unit's equipment. As a good friend, I went through the units concerned to satisfy his wishes. He observed very closely, and he was anxious to have me take his picture in front of some new model weapons as a souvenir. For comrades in civilian life to have some feeling of mystery about a military camp is understandable, so I did not realize at all that he had a criminal motivation." Yang Qun looked very resentful talking about this. He went on to tell the writer, "At that time, I too became somewhat aware. I felt that he was sly. He particularly wanted me to write articles about the army, and every time he also wanted materials to read. Many materials that had nothing to do with the articles I wrote, he also insisted on having, returning them to me after several days. I never imagined that he was stealing military secrets through me and giving them to a foreign spy organization." When this spy was arrested by our public security personnel, Yang Qun was also taken away in a police car. At that time, Yang Qun still did not know all the details of the matter. In talking about it, Yang Qun had a sorrowful expression. D. Servicemen come from all over the country. Fellow villagers are particularly close to each other in a strange place. Who could every imagine that so many stories that should not occur do occur between two fellow villagers? When the one villager met the other, both shed tears. What better way to express themselves than to drink together. While drinking, they became bombastic, and when they finished drinking, they committed a monstrous crime. In the military court, he lowered his noble head. In recalling this bloody lesson, the 28 year old first lieutenant named Chen said from his innermost being, "It was my fellow villager who did me in; it was drink that did me in!" Chen and Zhao had grown up together on the same street, and they had gone to the same kindergarten, primary school, and middle school. Still later, they entered military service together and came to the same city to serve in the same unit. Even later, they happened to go to the same academy. Friendship between the two became stronger and stronger. But good things never last long. After graduating from military school, the two went their separate ways, one being posted to Wuhan and the other to Jiangsu. Even though they kept in touch by telephone, the former feelings of closeness were hard to sustain. Finally, Zhao had a sudden opportunity to go on a temporary duty assignment to the small city where Chen was located. The two met, tears streamed down their cheeks, and they poured out the events in their lives to each other. Finally, Chen invited Zhao to drink in a hotel. They drank from noon until sunset, and when the two left the hotel, they were staggering and casting surly looks at everyone. Then a woman comrade riding a bicycle bumped Zhao. Ordinarily, both would have said they were sorry and that would have been that. But on this occasion, how could Chen "see a fellow villager be put upon!" He hit the young woman in the nose with his fist, blood splattering in all directions. Feeling he still had not slaked his hatred, Chen drunkenly beat the young woman with his fists and feet till she was almost dead. Passersby sent the young woman to a hospital where she died from injuries to her internal organs. Once he was sober, Chen realized how great a crime he had committed, but it was too late to repent. E. As indoctrination in the "two-five" common law intensifies, servicemen come to understand the weapon of law, but a substantial number of officers and men are still law illiterates. When sent to military court, they are still unknowing. After opening one letter, he felt exhilarated. After opening 300 letters, he became a prisoner. Because of his outstanding work record, Young Fan was selected battalion mail clerk. Every day several hundred letters passed through his hands with never a mistake. Two years passed, but Young Fang's desire to go to school remained unfulfilled. He was still doing the same old job. Young Fang felt life was stultifying, so he sought a little stimulation. One day, he received a thick letter addressed to another soldier. Looking at the graceful handwriting on the envelope and the hospital return address, Young Fang felt that the letter had certainly been written by a young woman. Then the idea of seeing what was inside the envelope occurred to him. He locked the door and closed the windows, and secretly opened the envelope. Sure enough, it was a love letter from a young woman, and a pretty color photograph was enclosed. The emotion that the young woman expressed between the lines filled Young Fang's empty heart with a feeling he had never known. He quietly concealed the photograph and, after reading the letter several times, he burned it. When other letters came later on, Young Fang read them in the same way without inhibition, and if they contained photographs or money, he took them. After he had read more than 300 letters, the families of many cadres and the fiancees of many soldiers who had been the victims demanded "an explanation" from the military unit. After receiving one after another such "law suits," the unit CPC committee began to watch Young Fang's behavior. The next time that Young Fang opened a young woman's love letter, he was seized on the spot by the regimental security section. Young Fang was sentenced to one year in prison. Servicemen carry out special missions. Serviceman crime is bound to weaken their fighting strength. Therefore, serviceman crime is a matter than cannot be ignored. As a result of investigation and research, the writer believes that greater education in the legal system, improving serviceman morale, providing servicemen with greater information, increasing cadre and soldier ability to follow a correct social orientation, fostering lofty ideals in them, intensifying moral concepts and disciplinary regulations are matters of far-reaching importance. I believe that servicemen who have gone through great tribulations will once again become models in upholding discipline and abiding by the law.
