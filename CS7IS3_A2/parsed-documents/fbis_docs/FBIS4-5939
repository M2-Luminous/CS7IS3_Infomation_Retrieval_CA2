FBIS4-5939 "dreas073_c_94021" FBIS-EAS-94-073 Daily Report 15 Apr 1994 North Korea Senior Officials at Film Showing Senior Officials at Film Showing SK1504051194 Pyongyang KCNA in English 0453 GMT 15 Apr 94 SK1504051194 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN [Text] Pyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- Senior party and government officials Thursday appreciated the 17th part of the multi-part feature film "The Nation and Destiny" which has been released on the occasion of the April fete. Appreciating the film were Kang Song-san, Pak Song-chol, Kim Yong-chu and other senior party and government officials, Yi Chin- kyu, first vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon) who is heading a congratulatory group of Korean residents from Japan participating in the April 15 celebrations, and members of congratulatory groups, delegations and visiting groups of Koreans overseas from various regions. The 17th part of "The Nation and Destiny" which has been completed as another masterpiece under the energetic guidance of the party is based on the life of Ho Chong-suk who was intensely loyal to the party and the leader till her last moments. Through the chequered destiny and mental development of the heroine who joined in the communist movement in the 1920s when she was still a girl, the film shows in a profound artistic depiction the truth that one can not fight a worthy struggle to save the destiny of the motherland and the nation when one is not guided by a sagacious leader.
