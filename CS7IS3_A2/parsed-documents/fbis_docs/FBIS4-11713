FBIS4-11713 "drnes062dd_94009" FBIS-NES-94-062 Daily Report 30 Mar 1994 Palestinian Affairs PLO Issues Statement on Land Day PLO Issues Statement on Land Day LD3003214094 Algiers Voice of Palestine in Arabic 1702 GMT 30 Mar 94 LD3003214094 Algiers Voice of Palestine Arabic BFN [Text] Our great Palestinian people inside the homeland and abroad celebrate the glorious Land Day, as they continue relentless struggle to protect their national rights and to materialize them over the soil of the homeland to establish their independent state, with the capital Jerusalem, to ensure the return of every Palestinian to his homeland and to achieve a durable and just peace for the coming Palestinian generations over the land of Palestine, the land of peace, justice, and freedom. On this occasion, Palestinian people confirm their indivisible unity, be it on the soil of the homeland or in the diaspora and continue the confrontation in all its forms, defending every grain of their homeland's soil, giving martyr after martyr, proving that any solution that undermines part of its rights will never pass nor will it be constant or durable. Our people have affirmed that peace will be achieved effectively when these hotbeds are removed from the territory of their homeland in Hebron, Gaza, Nablus, Jericho, and Holy Jerusalem, the capital of the independent State of Palestine, the heart of the Palestinian homeland, and the epitome of its independence as well as the conscience of every Palestinian wherever his place is in the homeland or outside it. [Passage omitted] Despite all the forms of suffering, oppression, and pain, the dawn of freedom is approaching. The day of the revival of Palestine with its land, people, and entity has become a reality confirmed by the world, which is waiting for the moment when it will be undoubtedly achieved on the political and geographic map in the Middle East. Our land, which has been irrigated by generous and pure blood, is living the dawn of the forthcoming independence. The PLO reiterates its determination to continue the path consecrated by the sacrifices of Palestinian generations; this is the path of struggle and steadfastness as well as work for the just peace, which is based on international legality and its resolutions, the latest of which is resolution 904 of the UN Security Council. This provides for international protection for our people and puts a decisive end to the crimes of the Israeli army units, their settlers, and enmity and massacres against our steadfast people on the land of their homeland. [Passage omitted] We express our salutation to our devoted martyrs on the glorious Land Day and we promise our people who are prisoners that the certain day of freedom is approaching. The great people with its whole population promises that every day is a holiday of the sacred land, that freedom and independence will be achieved, and that there will be a return to the sacred land of Palestine and holy Jerusalem to all our devoted sons who made sacrifices for it. In the name of God the merciful and compassionate; that even the apostle and those of faith who were with him cried: When will come the help of God? Ah verily, the help of God is always near. God Almighty has said the truth. [previous paragraph Koranic verse]
