FR940525-2-00087 FR940525-2-00061 6. The cross-trade transaction does not involve assets of any employee benefit plan established or maintained by BFM or any of its Affiliates (Batterymarch Plan). 7. Each employee benefit plan comprising a Plan Account that participates in the cross-trading program must have total assets equal to at least $25 million. In the case of multiple employee benefit plans maintained by a single employer or controlled group of employers, the $25 million requirement may be met by aggregating the assets of such plans if the assets are commingled for investment purposes in a single master trust. 8. BFM receives no fee or other compensation (other than its agreed investment management fee) with respect to any cross-trade transaction. 9. BFM is a discretionary investment manager with respect to Plan Accounts participating in the cross-trade program and does not cause any Plan Account to purchase or sell equity securities with another Account in order to merely track or replicate the portfolio of an independently maintained third party index. 10. For purposes of this proposed exemption: (a) ``Account'' means a Plan Account or a Non-Plan Account; (b) ``Affiliate'' means any person directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controlling, controlled by, or under common control with Batterymarch; (c) ``Buying Account'' means the Account which seeks to purchase equity securities in a cross-trade transaction; (d) ``Cross-trade transaction'' means a purchase and sale of equity securities between Accounts for which BFM or an Affiliate is acting as a trustee or investment manager; (e) ``Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of one or more employee benefit plans which are subject to the Act; (f) ``Independent Account Representative'' means the authorized representative of the Account. In the case of a Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative must be an Independent Fiduciary authorized to act for the Plan Account; (g) ``Non-Plan Account'' means an Account managed by BFM consisting of assets of clients which are not employee benefit plans subject to the Act; (h) ``Selling Account'' means the Account which seeks to sell its equity securities in a cross-trade transaction; and (i) The ``Optimization Program'' means a computer program developed by a third party, independent of BFM and its Affiliates, which BFM uses pursuant to a license agreement and which utilizes objective mathematical formulas to construct ``optimal'' portfolios for each Account. Summary of Facts and Representations 1. BFM is a business trust organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and registered as an investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. BFM currently manages on a discretionary basis approximately $7 billion in assets, of which approximately $4 billion consists of assets of Plan Accounts. 2. BFM represents that there are certain circumstances when it is required to liquidate all or a portion of the equity securities in an Account for which it acts as an investment manager. BFM proposes to cross-trade equity securities between the Accounts in situations where the decision to sell equity securities from the Selling Account is made either directly by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of a pre-established contractual obligation established by the Independent Account Representative. In the case of a Plan Account, the Independent Account Representative must be an authorized Independent Fiduciary. In all cross-trade situations, the decision as to the particular equity securities to be sold at the time of the transaction will be made either by the Independent Account Representative or by operation of the Optimization Program utilized by BFM. In the case of all Accounts, the Independent Account Representative will be a person which is unrelated to BFM and its Affiliates. Cross-trade transactions will not involve assets of any Batterymarch Plan. 3. BFM states that a cross-trade opportunity, pursuant to the requested exemption, will arise only if the need to sell equity securities from a Selling Account occurs as a result of one of the following ``trigger events''.
