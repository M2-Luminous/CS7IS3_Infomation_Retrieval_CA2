Speaking about the possibility of a free trade agreement with the United States, Seles said: [Begin Seles recording, in progress] ...whether through NAFTA or a bilateral agreement. This depends on Chilean national interests. Overall we held a cordial meeting, during which we discussed the progress that our bilateral ties have experienced. [end recording] Commenting on persistent oppostion to NAFTA in Mexico, Seles said that any U.S.-Chilean free trade agreement would be based on very different terms than those of the U.S.-Mexican agreement, because 70 percent of Mexican trade is targeted at the United States. [Begin Seles Recording] I do not believe we will experience the great impact that people are talking about, because if labor costs were the determinant factor for companies establishing themselves, then they would be establishing themselves in Haiti or in countries that pay lower salaries than ours. I believe the NAFTA agreement will inevitably lead to new investments in Mexico. However, we Mexicans believe we will be luring greater investment from countries oustide NAFTA, that is, outside the United States and Canada. We believe we will be luring greater investment from Asian and Pacific Rim countries, mainly from Japan, and from Europe, which together with Mexicans will be able to exploit Mexican resources to reach the huge American market.
