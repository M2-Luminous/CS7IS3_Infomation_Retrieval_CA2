Inmarsat is a cooperative with 71 member countries which operates a system of satellites to provide mobile voice and data communications to land-based users, ships and aircraft. At present, more than 30,000 Inmarsat mobile terminals are in use in more than 165 countries. The Ministry of Communications is Inmarsat's Chinese contracting party, while the Beijing Marine Communications and Navigation Company (BMCNC) joined the organization on behalf of China. Olof Lundberg, Inmarsat's director general, said at a press conference in Beijing today that the aim of the resident office is to promote exchanges between Inmarsat and China, trying to introduce advanced telecommunication technologies to more Chinese departments. At the primary stage the office will mainly develop its business in China, while in the future it will expand its business to the whole Asia-Pacific area. Building of Beijing Inmarsat earth stations, constructed and managed by the BMCNC, was finished in June 1991 and July 1993, respectively, and Beijing Inmarsat-A and Inmarsat-C earth stations have already been operational to cover the Indian Ocean and Pacific Ocean areas. By the end of 1993 Inmarsat had more than 550 various terminal users in China.
