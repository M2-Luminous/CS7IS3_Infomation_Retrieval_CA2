At a press conference in Vilnius Thursday [7 April], Slezevicius said he intends to sign a bilateral agreement on investment protection and to hold talks on credits for Lithuania. Slezevicius said a Kuwaiti foundation supporting economic development in some countries has already offered a preferential 50-million-dollar loan to Lithuania. The premier said the money would be used for various energy projects, including construction of new gas pipelines and renewal of gas networks in several Lithuanian towns. Slezevicius said part of the loan may be used to finance the Lithuanian oil terminal project. The Lithuanian premier said Kuwait is one of the biggest financial donors of the World Bank. Hence, he said, if the first credit is used properly, further financial support can be expected.
