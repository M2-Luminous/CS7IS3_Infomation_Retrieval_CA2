The delegation, led by Commander Ba as its chief and Deputy Commanders Wang Wenli and An Jiaoju as its deputy chiefs, began its visits to armed police forces stationed in Qinghai and Ningxia on 25 January. The members of the delegation, ignoring fatigue, trying to overcome altitude sickness, and braving piercing cold, made their way to offices and basic units to call on officers and men. They also went down to squads and platoons to inspect internal management, equipment, and warehouses and to ask soldiers about their work, study, and daily life in detail. The delegation fully affirmed the outstanding achievements made by the large numbers of officers and men in maintaining social stability, promoting the unity of various nationalities, and revitalizing the economy. The delegation also encouraged the officers and men to be ready to "stand at the front" in the fight to safeguard national security and maintain social stability, to conscientiously carry out the party's nationality and religious policies, to cherish every tree and every blade of grass in the places where they are stationed, to launch the drive to support the government and cherish the people, and to make new contributions to preserving public security and promoting economic development in Qinghai and Ningxia in the new year.
