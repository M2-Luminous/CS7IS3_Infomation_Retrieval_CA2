One could hear in the North the sound of hammering by People's Army soldiers participating in socialist construction, while in the South gun roar and rifle shots of the puppet Army mobilized in war exercises assail the ear. Though a grave situation has been created on the Korean peninsula owing to the United States' perfidious act of reversing the agreed conclusions reached at the New York contact between the DPRK and the United States, soldiers of the Korean People's Army [KPA] are performing feats in socialist construction, while fulfilling their duty for defence of the country. Now soldiers are engaged in building an express highway connecting capital Pyongyang to Hyangsan situated in mid-North area of Korea. They have laid a roadbed stretching far more than one hundred kilometres and completed difficult and complex construction of a good many structures such as bridges and tunnels. Besides this project, they have taken upon themselves several major projects of the country. Ever since the early 1980s, they have built the large- scale West Sea barrage costing 4 billion dollars, the Pyongyang-Kaesong express highway stretching several hundred kilometres, the 800 km-long waterways on the west coast, the streetcar rails in Pyongyang, the Thaechon power station, the Changgwang health complex, the ice-rink, Kwangbok and Thongil Streets, and other architectures of eternal value in all parts of the country. And, with the Army-people relations getting closer, "Army-people fields," "Army-people reservoirs", "Army-people bridges", etc. have been brought into being by the soldiers across the country. The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army mobilized soldiers in socialist construction on several occasions. More than 150,000 soldiers were mobilized in it in 1986 and the Armed Forces were cut by 100,000 men in 1987 to be sent to various domains of the national economy. But, the puppet Army in the area South of the Military Demarcation Line is a tool mercilessly cracking down upon the people's struggle calling for independence, democracy and reunification. This was proved by the atrocious massacre committed by the puppet Army in May, 1980 in suppressing the Kwangju popular uprising. At that time, over 14,000 people were crippled and more than 5,000 people were killed in cold blood. The puppet Army, together with the U.S. Forces, stage war exercises of various codenames such as "Team Spirit", "Ssangryong", "Ulchi", "Hwarang" and "Foul Eagle", inflicting damages upon the people. This year, too, the South Korean puppet Army are staging almost everyday powder-reeking war exercises in the sky, on the land and in the sea on the orders of the master. These two quite different realities clearly show who wants peace and who seeks a war. The KPA is the defender of the motherland, builder of a prosperous country and creator of happiness, while the South Korean puppet Army is cannon fodder and a suppressive tool against the people.
