Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi returned from Tunis Thursday after talks with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership. He headed a seven-member team representing 120 Palestinian officials and personalities who demanded democratic reforms within the PLO structure and an end to PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat's "autocratric" decision-making style. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said that during talks with the PLO leadership and the Executive Committee, there has been a positive response to the reformists' demands and he felt satisfied with Mr. 'Arafat's support for the democratisation of the PLO. "I would say, in principle, in terms of matters of the depth of awareness of our leadership, and of the people in general, that the importance of democratising the structure of the PLO and of adopting democracy in our political life as a whole have been supported very much by the leadership," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi told reporters. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi held a meeting with around 60 reformists at the Palestine National Council (PNC) headquarters Saturday to brief them on the outcome of the team's trip to Tunis. He said the results of the team's talks with the PLO leadership were "positive" and said: "Any talk about the failure of our mission or any impression given that it was negative would be inaccurate." He said he felt there was response to the demands for reform but not all demands as stated in a statement that was signed by 120 figures and sent to the leadership last month. "I don't see any reason why reforms would not be implemented. However, reform is a long process," he said. He alluded to the fact that Mr. 'Arafat remains to be the only decision-maker in the PLO at this point and that the PLO's democratic institutions and collective leadership bodies remain inactive or dormant at this stage. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the reformists submitted the statement again to the PLO leadership in Tunis and they provided it with suggestions to implement reforms and democratisation. "There was response to our demands, and the statement was endorsed by the Executive Committee, but not all demands were accepted," he added. "Expanding the decision-making body and collective leadership cannot be done at this stage," Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said. "It is unacceptable that Abu-'Ammar ('Arafat) alone makes the decisions." Other members of the team felt satisfied with the fact that the leadership had taken their movement seriously and accepted to open a democratic deialogue with them in order to implement changes. They are not under the illusion that reforms would immediately take place, but they hope to remain a strong force, working as an internal pressure group that would monitor the leadership's actions and continue to call for democratisation through popular pressure. Popular insistence on carrying out elections in the occupied territories was one way of achieving change, Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said. "We will reject any delay to carrying out elections as stated in the PLO-Israel accord." "The democratic issue is not the decision of Abu-'Ammar alone. It is a matter in which all the people should participate." he said. Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi said the prospective popular dialogue that will take place on a wide scale among Palestinians inside and outside the occupied territories will also have an impact on the leadership and allow for reforms. He was referring to a decision by the PLO leadership approving a dialogue between all Palestinian factions, inside and outside the framework of the PLO, to work towards uniting the Palestinian people. Mr. 'Arafat designated Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi to initiate this dialogue and Dr. 'Abd-al-Shafi accepted. Dr. 'Abd-al-shafi said that he found the spirit of the Executive Committee "not rejectionist to our calls for democratic reforms but not actively supportive. But I can say our mission was successful."
