FBIS4-31404 "dreeu111_i_94009" FBIS-EEU-94-111 Daily Report 7 Jun 1994 BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA Army Alleges UN `Deceptions' of Public Army Alleges UN `Deceptions' of Public AU0706120094 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network in Serbo-Croatian 1000 GMT 7 Jun 94 AU0706120094 Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina Network Serbo-Croatian BFN [Text] The reputation of the UN forces engaged in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which has plummeted to its lowest level due to their incompetence, [word indistinct], and powerlessness to stop the aggressor, will be increasingly more difficult to mend, among other things, also because of the presenting of numerous unsubstantiated justifications for the United Nations' passivity on the ground in their addresses to the public, a statement by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says. The 1st Corps points at, conditionally speaking, two deceptions of the international public committed by UN spokesman Major Rob Annink at a press conference. He tried to justify the aggressor's attacks on the defense lines of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army in the region of Breza, Vares, and Ilijas by the fact that neither the Bosnian nor the Serbian side would allow them access to the critical areas and thus their observers could only register explosions but could determine the place from which projectiles had been fired. At the news conference, Major Annink did not present the true reasons for the lack of engagement by the UN forces. The true reason is that the Chetniks do not allow the UN members to move along the Temizovac-(?Trebnje) route, precisely because of the constant offensives that they have been undertaking in this region. The members of the Canadian Battalion justify their not going into the field with the fact that the zone that they are supposed to supervise is the responsibility of the French Battalion, which has its headquarters in Sarajevo. Because of such misinformation of the international public and the open siding with the aggressor, the soldiers and the officers of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army from the territories of Breza, Ilijas, and Vares favor Major Annink being proclaimed persona non grata and being denied hospitality in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the statement by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Army says.
