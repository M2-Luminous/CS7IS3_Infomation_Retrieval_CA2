Kruglikov, First Deputy Chairman of the Russian Federation State Customs Committee Statute on Customs Procedure for Re-Imports 1. General Provisions 1.1. The re-import of goods is a customs procedure in which Russian goods which are taken out of the customs territory of the Russian Federation in accordance with the export customs procedure are then brought back into this territory within the deadline set by this statute without the collection of customs duties, value-added tax, or excise taxes, and without the application of economic policy restrictions (quotas, licenses, etc.). 1.2. Foreign goods may not qualify for re-import status, and neither may Russian goods exported from the customs territory of the Russian Federation in line with other customs procedures (requisitions for temporary use, requisitions for agencies representing the Russian Federation abroad, processing outside the customs territory, and transit shipments in the event of transferal through the territory of a foreign state). The customs procedure for re-imports will not apply to goods prohibited for import to the Russian Federation and export from the Russian Federation. 2. Conditions of Qualification for Re-Import Status 2.1. To meet the requirements of the customs procedure for re-imports, the goods must satisfy the following conditions: a) they must be goods which were taken out of the territory of the former USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or out of the territory of the Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992) in accordance with the export procedure; b) they must have been Russian goods until they were exported--i.e., goods of Russian origin (or originating in the former USSR prior to 31 December 1991) or goods of foreign origin which were freely circulated within the territory of the Russian Federation (or within the territory of the former USSR prior to 31 December 1991) after the full payment of all customs fees; c) they must have been brought back into the customs territory of the Russian Federation within 10 years after the date of export. The date of importation is the date of the acceptance of the last document required for customs purposes. The time of export is the date of the acceptance of the customs export declaration or, in its absence, the date the goods crossed the border of the former USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or the border of the Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992); d) they must be in the same state as at the time of export, with the exception of changes resulting from natural wear or shrinkage under normal conditions of shipping and storage and other cases stipulated in subsections 2.5 and 2.6 of this statute. Natural wear or shrinkage and normal conditions of shipping and storage will be defined by standards and other legislative instruments in effect in the Russian Federation and pertaining to this category of goods. 2.2. The fact that the goods qualifying as re-imports are identical to the goods taken out of the country in line with the export procedure, the fact that they did leave the country, the date of export, and the fact that the goods are Russian are to be established (or confirmed) by a method deemed credible and legitimate by customs officials. Proving these facts will be the responsibility of the concerned party. In the absence of a customs declaration, or if the date the goods crossed the border cannot be confirmed by a satisfactory method, the date of export of the goods of Russian origin (or of former USSR origin prior to 31 December 1991) will be the date of their manufacture (if only the month of manufacture is known, the date will be the first of that month, and if only the year is known, the date will be 1 January of that year). In the absence of documents listing the date of manufacture, an expert appraisal may be conducted. 2.3. The use of the goods for production or other commercial purposes outside the Russian Federation will not preclude the qualification of these goods as re-imports. 2.4. The application for re-import status may be submitted by any person, irrespective of the exporting party. 2.5. If the goods have been damaged or depreciated in some other sense as a result of an accident or circumstances beyond human control, these goods may be qualified as re-imports on the condition that the occurrence of the accident or circumstances can be confirmed by a method deemed credible and legitimate by customs officials. 2.6. The goods may have undergone maintenance operations, minor repairs, including adjustments, and other such operations while they were outside the Russian Federation on the condition that the declared value of these goods at the time of export was not increased as a result of these operations. The relationship between value at the time of export and value at the time of importation will be calculated on the basis of the U.S. dollar. If prices in contracts or other documents are listed in other currencies, the calculations will be based on the exchange rate of these currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar at the time of export or import. 3. Collection of Customs Duties, Taxes, and Other Fees and Payments 3.1. If the goods are re-imported within three years of the time of export, the customs agency will refund the export duties and export taxes paid. 3.2. They will be refunded on the following conditions: --if the goods were exported and imported by the same person who paid the export duties or export taxes or on whose behalf the payments were made; --if the customs agency is presented with a copy of the customs declaration used as the basis for the calculation and payment of export duties or export taxes and written confirmation from the customs agency to which the payments were made or from its successor in interest on the actual deposit of the fees in the account of the customs agency or directly in the budget. The written confirmation must meet the requirements of financial documents; --if the export tax was paid to customs agencies located within the territory of the Russian Federation; --if the person mentioned in the second paragraph of this subsection submits a written request for a refund of the sums paid to the customs agency. This request may be written in any format. The request for a refund must be submitted to the customs agency within one year after the date of acceptance of the customs declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports. If even one of these conditions is not met, the paid sums of export duties and export taxes will not be refunded. 3.3. Only the paid sum of customs duties and export taxes will be refundable. Penalties, overdue fines, and other such payments will not be refundable. The refunded sums will not be adjusted for inflation, and no interest will be paid on these sums. The refund will be made in the currency of the Russian Federation, irrespective of the currency in which the customs duties and export taxes were paid. If the payment was made in a foreign currency with an exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, conversion into the currency of the Russian Federation will be based on the Russian Federation Central Bank exchange rate on the date of acceptance of the customs declaration claiming re-import status. If the payment was made in another foreign currency, its conversion to rubles will be based on the rate of exchange on the payment date. 3.4. Refunds will be the responsibility of the customs agency registering the goods qualifying as re-imports. 3.5. When part of a shipment of exported goods is to be qualified as re-imports, the refund amount will be based on the quantitative relationship of this part to the whole shipment of exported goods. 3.6. The customs official making the refund will note the return of the paid sums, including partial refunds, on the copy of the export declaration submitted by the person, and on the confirmation mentioned in Subsection 3.2. of this statute, by filling in the amount of the refund (in numbers and words) and the date of the refund. The notation will be endorsed by the official's signature and personal number stamp. A copy of the confirmation noting the refund will be sent to the customs agency issuing the confirmation. This copy will be kept with the customs agency's copy of the customs declaration qualifying the goods as exports. 3.7. Import duties will not be collected on re-imported goods when they enter the customs territory of the Russian Federation. 3.8. In the case of re-imports which were exported from the territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the person making the declaration will pay the customs agency the value-added tax which was refunded at the time of export or from which the goods were exempt at the time of export. The amount subject to payment will be calculated according to the rates in effect at the time the goods entered the country. The basis for calculating the payment amount will depend on the date of acceptance of the customs declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports. The value-added tax privileges granted solely for goods brought into the customs territory of the Russian Federation will not apply. 3.9. At the time of the re-import of goods exported from the territory of the Russian Federation after 1 January 1992, the person making the declaration will pay excise taxes at the rates that were in effect at the time of export for goods produced in the Russian Federation. The customs value used in the calculation of payment amounts will be determined on the date of acceptance of the customs declaration qualifying the goods as re-imports. 4. Customs Registration of Goods Qualifying as Re-Imports 4.1. The customs registration of re-imported goods will be conducted in the customs agency whose zone of operations includes the location of the consignee or a structural subdivision of the consignee. 4.2. When the goods are to be qualified as re-imports, the person making the declaration will submit the following documents to the customs agency: --a customs freight declaration filled out in accordance with the addendum to this statute; --authorization from other state agencies if the re-imported goods are subject to control by these agencies; --a copy of the customs freight declaration qualifying the re-imported goods as exports, or other documents confirming the fact and time of the export of these goods from the territory of the USSR (prior to 31 December 1991) or the territory of the Russian Federation (starting on 1 January 1992)--bills of lading, and so forth; --other documents stipulated or implied by this statute as necessary for customs registration. 4.3. The decision to qualify the goods as re-imports will be made by the head of the structural subdivision of the customs agency or the person authorized to perform his duties in his absence. 4.4. In the absence of reliable information, confirmed by the appropriate documents, on the satisfaction of the requirements of this statute, the goods may not be qualified as re-imports. 4.5. The customs fees for the customs registration of re-imported goods will be 0.1 percent of the declared value of the goods in the currency of the Russian Federation and 0.05 percent of the declared value in a foreign currency with an exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
