Almost one year to the day later, and using the same tactics used at Boughzoul, the Tazoult prison, formerly Lambese, supposedly an impregnable fortress, was attacked by an armed group made up of about 100 individuals. The toll: the escape of close to 1,000 prisoners, 64 of them from the high security ward set aside for those sentenced to death, and 400 prisoners serving life sentences. Of the 1,000 escapees, 200 are ordinary prisoners if you believe that the Islamic fundamentalists sentenced by the special courts are not. Beyond the fact that this will mean that the armed groups' capacity to do harm, which is already great, will be increased by 1,000, it seems that the sophisticated operation, from the organizational and timing points of view, had three objectives. The first aimed at freeing "mujahadeen" brothers locked up in government prisons to prove that that government was incapable of operating on the road of God's will controlled by the armed groups. The second aimed at swelling the armed groups' numbers so as to prepare a new stage in the military action in order to attack strategic, generally "well-guarded" targets. And last, the choice of Tazoult was heavy with symbolism, in which the megalomania of the emirs takes such delight. They could have operated in Berrouaghia, where the number of Islamic fundamentalist prisoners is the same. They could have chosen El Harrach so the escapees could blend in more easily with city crowds. They opted for Tazoult because it is the best protected prison and has a reportedly infallible alarm system, has 200 guards, and that in 10 years has recorded just one escape. But above and beyond all these obstacles, which will feed the armed groups' invincibility myth and maintain the feeling of terror that is paralyzing people, the choice of Lambese might be explained by its proximity to Batna, the home town of Zeroual, who, in their eyes, wants to stab the emirs in the back by carrying on discussions with politicians who have never left the sweet comforts of their living room or their cell, depending. Everyone had noticed this desertion by the state from the scene. Some spoke of a tactical withdrawal, others of a Machiavellian strategy to draw all of society into the antiterrorist struggle. But for some as well as for others, the Tazoult breakout is a slap in the face that will long echo in the corridors of the presidency, the corridors of government headquarters, or even those of the Ali Khodja barracks. In the wake of the economic collapse, political improvisation, and the suspicion weighing on its judiciary faced with its stubbornness about not opening its corruption files, now this state is seeing its institutions demonstrate their inability to manage the detention of 3,000 law breakers. The Lambese breakout challenges us in many ways. Even if we granted that the few hundred attackers possessed some military genius, the prison is supposed to be guarded by 200 security guards. Furthermore, if we remember the account given in the Justice Ministry's communique, there were reported to have been one guard killed, four others wounded, and seven carried off by the attackers; if we add the two supposed accomplices, this would produce a total of 14; so where were the 186 others? Revolt at the Constantine Prison In addition, a trustworthy source has told us that the operation's main instigator, whose identity has not been revealed to us, is a prison guard who was supposedly thrown out of the army because of assumptions that he belonged to the Said Mekhloufi group, even if the proof was not there. The security forces were reported to have informed the central prison authorities on several occasions, in vain. Here is another disturbing fact: the same authorities did not take seriously the warning that the revolt at the civilian prison in Constantine gave them 15 days ago, to improve the security forces around prison facilities, especially those housing Islamic fundamentalists reputed to be dangerous. Furthermore, it has been learned that instructions had been issued at the Justice Ministry to avoid any concentration of Islamic fundamentalists. Apparently these instructions were not carried out. In a normal country, a breakout on this scale, where there would be no similar case, would have led to the resignation of the minister of justice, but Algeria long ago ceased being a normal country. What is left is the war of the communiques. Nearly 72 hours had to pass before a communique from the Justice Ministry would make public information previously reported by AFP and picked up by the national press. The contents of the communique gave no precise figure for the number of attackers or the number of escapees, and even less regarding their identities. AFP's source spoke of 900 escapees and 150 attackers. From Bonn, an Islamic Salvation Front [FIS] spokesman for his part spoke of the escape of 1,684 "political prisoners from FIS's base." Officially the manhunt that began right after the end of the armed operation led to the arrest of 114 escapees and attackers whereas 26 others were reported to have been shot. The figures given by the FIS are not very credible, since they refer to there being some 350 prisoners sentenced to death among the escapees. Now the total of capital punishment sentences handed down by the special courts amounts to 402, close to 300 of whom were sentences in absentia. So the figure of 64 prisoners sentenced to death seems the more credible one. The search operations are being carried out mainly in the Aures Mountains even if the FIS's spokesman has said that the escapees have already spread throughout all of algeria. There is talk of a large group that has reportedly been located in the Jijel area and of another in the Laghouat area. That is to say, the logistics required to make a success of the operation.
