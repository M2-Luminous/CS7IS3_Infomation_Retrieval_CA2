It Appears That the Fate of the State Will Be Decided in These Elections by East Ukrainian Pragmatism," the editorial office considers it necessary to comment on the articles published. Having read the article of our Donetsk correspondent Olha Burda on the electoral prospects of the Donbass, which is published below, we did not notice any particular differences between the views of journalists from Lvov and Donetsk on the situation in the Donbass. Incidentally, Mariya Kara wrote her article after a lengthy assignment to Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts. Apparently the debate was brought on by the title of Mariya Kara's article, which maintains that in these elections the fate of the state will be decided by East Ukrainian pragmatism. In putting this judgment at the beginning of the article, the editorial office has deliberately proceeded to switch that which is desirable for that which is real because it still firmly insists that pro-Russian separatism in that region may only be overcome by East Ukrainian pragmatism. It may be too weak yet, but for now no alternative to it is apparent. It might be that from the beautiful "far-away" Halychyna it is indeed easier to see the colors with which the steppes of Donetsk shine and play. It might also be that precisely due to its geographic remoteness it is not quite visible that the Donbass is primarily a much more politically aggressive Donetsk area over which a new dawn, most likely that of a red color yet again, will break at any minute. It appears very much as if this region--whose votes brought in Kravchuk for Ukraine and which has helped to form the "group of 239"--has not learned anything anyway, even from its own mistakes. This means that the Donetsk area has a great many prerequisites for arriving at the new parliament on the old Red wagon. So, about the prerequisites. During the blissful time of stagnation, the Communist Party organization of Donetsk Oblast was inferior only to those of Moscow and Leningrad in terms of numerical strength. Even without joining the imeni Comrade Symonenko Communist Party of Ukraine, the faithful "Leninists" have not disappeared. At present they live here and win victories here--by numerical strength, involvement, discipline, and communist solidarity. Reared by the totalitarian system in the spirit of boundless obedience, they will certainly come to the elections and give their votes in favor of a system under which they had a life and plenty of food and even drink. Likewise, we should not ignore the fact that the Donetsk area is the "richest" in retirees. While for the most part utterly apolitical, they will, after standing in overnight lines for their retirement benefits, turn out for the elections, after all, in order to pragmatically vote...certainly, not for an idea but for the past with the 12 ruble retirement benefits, degrading but stable and delivered to their homes by the state. Unlike the young people of Halychyna, who are patriotically aware, those in the Donetsk area will simply ignore the next election. It is precisely to the apolitical stance and the "I-don't-give-a-damn" attitudes of old and young people that an oblast referendum which nobody needs apart from Boldyrevs and Gurevychs and a handful of state officials is geared--the referendum on the need to introduce in the territory of Donetsk Oblast and the entire Ukraine the state Russian language along with Ukrainian and to have Ukraine sign the CIS Statute as a full-fledged rather than associate member, as well as on the feasibility of the federal-land arrangement in Ukraine. Now about the candidates. If we turn to preelection statistics, it is hard not to notice that out of 562 candidates for deputies, 52 are members of the Communist Party of Ukraine and 30 are members of the Socialist Party of Ukraine. However, this is not yet all, because one can have communist views without carrying a party membership card in one's pocket. An analysis of the composition of deputies in just one district by Valentyna Protsenko, chairman of the regional organization of the People's Rukh of Ukraine, testifies to this quite convincingly. In addition to two documented communists and one socialist, the following are running among 14 of her opponents: the former first secretary of the Krasnoarmeysk City Committee of the Communist Party, Vasyl Sapunov, a former employee of the city committee and rayon committee of the party, Oleksandr Denisov, attorney Volodymyr Loban and Prosecutor Leonid Zakharov, who defended and improved the socialist system, and the former leader of the Youth Communist League of the highest rank, Volodymyr Butko, who have been nominated by voters and labor collectives. The independent Yuriy Kotov comes out with an openly communist program, whereas leaders of the Independent Trade Union of Miners engage in propaganda for the former party organizer from the imeni Stakhanov Mine, Volodymyr Ivanov, whom they themselves not so long ago evicted from his party suites. So, the communists are not sitting idly by. Petro Symonenko himself, having moved for the preelection period to the rural Krasnoarmeyskiy District, is confidently forging the future victory. He has a good team of kolkhoz and rural council chairmen who intimidate people conditioned in the spirit of boundless trust and respect for the bosses with the horrors the Rukh people will commit on coming to power. The prospect of a sausage shortage and a lack of opportunity to steal even a liter of milk from a kolkhoz cow is the most effective. Thus, in the future elections the principle that brought Kravchuk to power will work (especially in rural areas): "The lower strata follow the top echelons," that is, the people will vote for the bosses' candidate. Readers of POST-POSTUP know enough about the activities of the current and (which is quite possible) future pragmatists from the Donbass--acting Prime Minister Yukhym Zvyahilskyy, Deputy Prime Minister V. Landik, and Chairman of the State Coal Industry Association M. Surhay--in order not to attach to these activities particular hopes for the revival of Ukraine. Seventy-four candidates representing local councils and executive structures and 14 former people's deputies who are running yet again and whose chances are good inspire little optimism on this score. After all, yet another principle can work on which a different segment of the Donbass electorate has already elected Kravchuk at one point--"They already have work experience" (for now, it is not important what kind of experience). The pragmatism of the Donbass rises to its heights in the position of the candidate from the Labor Party, Mykola Azarov, who, not concealing his sympathy for Zhirinovskiy, stated somewhat simply on television that "the LDPR [Liberal Democratic Party of Russia] should be judged by its actions rather than its words." It would be good if after such "actions" someone is still around to judge. There also are pragmatists of a new type, a small group of entrepreneurs, on the candidate lists. The proletariat of Donetsk is burning with class hatred for some of them, who have gone into business for a short time in order to flee "after reigning for their own 100 rubles-worth." Another segment, those who have gone in whole hog and for a long time to come and can see well beyond their own noses, provokes hatred from another social stratum and risks being shot, as very recently did Valeriy Slyusarev, an entrepreneur from Artem who has invested a fortune in his unfortunate countrymen. In Torez, a person was shot who was supposed to be the campaign agent of entrepreneur Valeriy Nazarov, a candidate for deputy. Although the future indeed belongs to new honest pragmatists, such as Oleksandr Opryshenko (president of the public joint-stock company Medita-Ukrayina), Petro Tsekhmister (director of the Kamyanka Shakhtarska private mine), and Stanislav Melnyk (director of the RDK Helso), for now they are too few to influence the overall picture of elections in the Donbass, even if they are elected. As we try to see the color of the future dawn over the steppes of Donetsk, we should know the colors of candidates from the GKU [Civic Congress of Ukraine], the Slavic Unity Party, the Peasant Party of Ukraine, and the Labor Congress of Ukraine, to say nothing about the socialists-communists. The main point is not to overestimate, after all, the ability of the Donbass electorate to learn from its mistakes, because regular polling of the residents of Khartsyzsk by a sociological group (over several weeks) has not given grounds for optimism: One-third of the voters will give their votes to communists. Consequently, "although the people of the Donbass are not Korean, they are intimidated by the Rukh people, democrats, and nationalists to such a degree that for another 30 years they will not want to live like people and will firmly stay on the path of Lenin."
