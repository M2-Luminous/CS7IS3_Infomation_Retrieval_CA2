[Soos] The SZDSZ wishes to conduct an economic policy based on tax reductions. We would abolish the source tax [forrasado] from next year which is now 10 percent and Parliament actually reduced it from 20 percent to this level on our suggestion. The abolition of this tax would reduce the difference between the interest rate on deposits and loans, which would have a positive effect on the population's will to save. The abolition of minimum tax rates is another SZDSZ proposal. We consider taxation on income [bevetel] totally unjustified from an economic point of view, and constitutional problems also arise here. Third, in the case of enterprises that have less than a 50-million-forint turnover, we would introduce a flat rate tax. This would make it possible for a large amount of sums paid by small enterprises to tax advisers to come into the treasury. Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, would pay less tax and have less administration. Another of our proposals is to expand investment preferences. Unlike the current rules, the preferences could be used by anyone, regardless of government permits. [Varga] For capital-rich enterprises, the abolition of the profits tax would be important because they are still paying a flat rate tax. [Soos] The government would remit part of the profit tax if the enterprises use their profits for reinvestment. This benefit would generally encourage the capital-rich enterprises and would at the same time help boost the economy. [Varga] It seems that the SZDSZ is leaving too much to private initiatives; however, large investment with state support cannot be given up. [Soos] Rather than state investment, we should be talking about infrastructural developments. In certain sectors, private capital cannot be mobilized. Highways or telephone systems can easily be created on a concession basis but hospitals or schools can only be built from the state's finances. State resources can also be used for the development of the regional infrastructure. [Varga] In connection with investment, we have to talk about the World Expo. If it came to power, would the SZDSZ, in accordance with its previous view, withdraw from organizing Expo? [Soos] At the time, the country resounded with calls for the world exposition to be organized on an entrepreneurial basis. Now we know that this is not at all the case. It is almost entirely a state investment and this is precisely the reason that the SZDSZ was against organizing it. However, preparations have reached a level where it would cost more to halt the investment than to organize the Expo. In addition to this, canceling the World Expo would also mean a loss of prestige because many countries have now applied to participate in it. [Varga] An enterprise-friendly policy definitely has to take steps to put the banking sector in order. [Soos] It is impossible to boost the economy in any way without developing the banking sector. The SZDSZ would stabilize the banking system and then it would begin to privatize it. We would sell off two banks even in 1994. It is important to implement cashless banking techniques as soon as possible. It is absurd that entrepreneurs are walking about with millions of forints in their pockets. [Varga] Where would you find the financial resources for investment stimulation and tax reductions? How much revenue loss can the current position of the budget accept? [Soos] Our proposal on tax reductions represents a small part of the whole budget, so there is no point in talking about the reserves for it. The loss of the source tax means 11 billion forints; however, parallel to this, the profits and the profit tax from enterprises would increase. The abolition of the minimum tax would mean the loss of 6 billion forints, which would be regained through the payments of flat rate tax. I expect that many people would choose this form of taxation and this would increase budget revenue. We wish to find funds for reducing the personal income and profit taxes, which is to be implemented later, through a stricter collection of taxes. [Varga] Entrepreneurs are complaining about high wage costs, rather than high taxes. [Soos] It is a fact that Hungarian wage costs are very high in international comparison. However, it also has to be known that the proportion of pensioners is very high in Hungary. Stricter collection is again one way of reducing health and pension contributions. However, in the more distant future, only the introduction of private insurance can be the solution. [Varga] The stock market could be one of the most significant investment possibilities for citizens but, at the moment, it is playing a modest role in the economy. [Soos] It is vitally important to change the system of investment support if we want to boost the turnover of the stock exchange. If someone sells his shares then he automatically loses his preferential treatment. The opposite of this should be the case because the stock exchange is intensified when people implement changes in their share portfolios. [Varga] By now, some 200 billion forints of compensation notes have entered the market and maintaining the current price of these is awkward and costs very much. Would you accept the costs of maintaining the prices of these at a certain level? [Soos] Recently, demand through privatization has not kept pace with the amount of compensation notes. The SZDSZ would certainly ensure a demand for the necessary quality and amount of shares. [Varga] At the moment, the price of compensation notes is at around 70 percent. Would you set the price higher or lower than this? [Soos] It certainly would not be lower than the current price.
