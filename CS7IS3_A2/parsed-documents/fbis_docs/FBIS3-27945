A government source said on 1 February that U.S. President Bill Clinton strongly pressed for the setting of numerical targets in the framework talks during his telephone conversation with Hosokawa on 31 January and that U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) Mickey Kantor was sent to Tokyo as a special envoy to make Japan implement such a demand. High-ranking government officials, however, stated on 1 February that it would be difficult to set numerical targets for automobiles and auto parts as the United States demands. If the United States sticks to its principles, it is not likely that an agreement can be reached at the summit talks. In his briefing to the prime minister, Kuriyama said that while Japanese-U.S. relations are basically taking a favorable turn and that "the United States shows a sympathetic disposition toward the Hosokawa administration, it is taking a tough approach to the framework talks. I hope that the prime minister exercises leadership to conclude the talks." He stated that the prime minister will exercise his leadership to bring about progress in the framework talks. After the briefing, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura and Yukio Sato, director general of the North American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, joined the discussion on how to handle the talks. In the economic framework talks, the United States is demanding that numerical targets be set in the priority sectors: automobiles and auto parts and insurance. Negotiations with Japan, which rejects setting such targets, have been going nowhere. The prime minister recently discussed with Toyota Motor Corporation Chairman Shoichiro Toyoda ways to break this deadlock, but it seems that the domestic situation is not conducive at all to accepting numerical targets. As for automobiles and auto parts, senior government officials say that "Automobiles are one sector where laws and the administration are not deeply involved; it will be difficult to have numerical targets. It is a private sector." They reiterate their belief that it would not be possible to agree to the U.S. demand to set numerical targets.
