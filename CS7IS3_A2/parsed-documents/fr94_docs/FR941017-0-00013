FR941017-0-00013 FR941017-0-00005 14 CFR Part 71 [Airspace Docket No. 93&hyph;AEA&hyph;1] Alteration of Jet Route J&hyph;223 and Establishment of Jet Route J&hyph;132; NY AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This action alters Jet Route J&hyph;223 and establishes Jet Route J&hyph;132 located in New Jersey and New York. This action deletes a section of Jet Route J&hyph;223 from the intersection of LaGuardia (LGA) Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Distance Measuring Equipment (VOR/DME) 310 ○ True (T) 322 ○ Magnetic (M) radial and the Elmira (ELM) VOR/DME 110 ○(T) 119 ○(M) radial to the Elmira VOR/DME. In addition, a new jet route, J&hyph;132, will be established from the Elmira VOR/DME to the Huguenot Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC). Altering J&hyph;223 and establishing J&hyph;132 will enhance the flow of air traffic and simplify routing in the vicinity of Elmira, NY. EFFECTIVE DATE: 0901 UTC, December 8, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Patricia P. Crawford, Airspace and Obstruction Evaluation Branch (ATP&hyph;240), Airspace-Rules and Aeronautical Information Division, Air Traffic Rules and Procedures Service, Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (202) 267&hyph;9255. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: History On October 26, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to delete a segment of Jet Route J&hyph;223 and to establish Jet Route J&hyph;132 from Elmira VOR/DME to Huguenot VORTAC (58 FR 57571). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice. Jet routes are published in paragraph 2004 of FAA Order 7400.9B dated July 18, 1994, and effective September 16, 1994, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1. The jet routes listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order. The Rule This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters Jet Route J&hyph;223 by deleting a section of that jet route from the intersection of LaGuardia VOR/DME 310 ○ radial and the Elmira VOR/DME 110 ○ radial to the Elmira VOR/DME. In addition, this rule establishes a new jet route, J&hyph;132, from the intersection of Elmira VOR/DME 110 ○ radial and the Huguenot VORTAC 291 ○ radial to the Huguenot VORTAC. This action is necessary to simplify routing and expedite the flow of air traffic. The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71 Airspace, Incorporation by reference, Navigation (air). Adoption of the Amendment In consideration of the foregoing, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 71, as follows: PART 71_[AMENDED] 1.
