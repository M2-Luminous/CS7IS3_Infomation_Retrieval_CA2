The reporter reminded the prime minister of his statement made in February to foreign journalists -- that Hungary would not like NATO's aircraft to use its airspace when bombing military targets in Bosnia. The prime minister was also quoted as saying that during an air attack the AWACS aircraft should leave the country. "Hungary's airspace has not been used for military actions against Bosnian targets. And this is the key issue," the prime minister said in his answer. The February statement expressed Hungary's determination not to allow its airspace to be used for concrete military actions or controlling attacks on Serbia, he continued. "We have received clear-cut guarantees that the function of the AWACS aircraft will be only to monitor Bosnian airspace," the prime minister added.
