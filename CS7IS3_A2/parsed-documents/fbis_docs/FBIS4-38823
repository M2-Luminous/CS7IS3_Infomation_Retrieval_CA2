This is stated in a Joint Russo-Korean declaration, which the leaders of the two countries signed at the end of today's summit talks in the Kremlin. Boris Yeltsin, the declaration says, "confirms that Russia, alongside other states, will in future also take an active part in the efforts of the international community to ensure the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." President Kim Yong-sam, the document points out, "highly appraises Russia's proposal on convening a multilateral conference on security and the nuclear-free status of the Korean Peninsula." The two leaders agree that "any attempt to manufacture nuclear weaponry on the Korean Peninsula poses a serious threat to peace and security, not only in Korea, but also in Northeast Asia and throughout the world."
