However, it is particularly hard on northerners. If it were not enough that they live under the most severe climatic conditions, they fail to get their wages for months at a time. The hopes attached to the enactment of the Law on State Guarantees and Compensation for Individuals Working and Residing in the Regions of the Far North and Areas Equated With Them on 1 June 1993 were dashed. A number of statesmen have come to wish for the northerners to be deprived of even the relief envisioned in the document. As we have learned, this was discussed on 13 December 1993 at a conference with First Deputy Prime Minister Ye. Gaydar (by now, the former first deputy prime minister). On instructions from the conference, the Ministry of Finance prepared for the government proposals of precisely this nature to be subsequently submitted to the Federal Assembly. The FITUR [Federation of Independent Trade Unions of Russia] considers such a decision impermissible. Social tension in a number of northern regions has reached the limit; the labor collectives of many industries are on a pre-strike status. Because of this, the FITUR was forced to approach the head of the government, V. Chernomyrdin, as well as the chairman of the State Duma, I. Rybkin, with the request to provide for reinforcement of rather than reduction in socioeconomic protections for the residents of the North. What caused this? The law proposed by the Ministry of Finance omits the highly significant words "state guarantees and compensation." The reference is simply to "guarantees and compensation". That is to say, it is proposed that the issues of survival be resolved on the principle "to rescue the drowning is up to the drowning themselves." This begs a reasonable question: Why does a state need rulers who do not guarantee anything to their subjects? How does the Ministry of Finance justify the intention to omit the guarantees of the payment of regional coefficients and percentage bonuses in addition to the wages of the northerners? By the fact that the list of areas classified as regions of the Far North and localities equated with them has been changing continuously. (What if the North Caucasus lays a claim to preferences tomorrow?) However, the northerners will get a great "benefit" from a proposal in Article 12: "The combined volume of the payment of regional coefficients and percentage bonuses in addition to the wage of one worker per month shall be restricted to six times the minimum monthly volume of remuneration for labor." One gets the impression that the people in the Ministry of Finance are simply unaware of the fact that regional coefficients and bonuses were introduced in the North in conjunction with sharp differences between local prices for consumer goods, foodstuffs, and services from prices "on the mainland." They were introduced in conjunction with special geographic, natural, and climatic conditions of the North. As residents of these regions state, the cancellation of coefficients and bonuses will reduce their wages by 60 percent. Between 70 and 75 percent of employees will end up below the physiological subsistence minimum. The losses that northerners will suffer, if the proposals of the Ministry of Finance are accepted, are not restricted to those enumerated. Preferences for women and a block of articles concerning retirement benefits will also be abolished. Extra leave and the right to free passage to the site of vacation, the right to tax relief for enterprises manufacturing consumer goods and agricultural products, and so on will be restricted. Of course, we cannot say that the developers of proposals that infringe on the rights of Northerners have acted on their own whim. They were prompted to do so by the most acute crisis in the economy. At the same time, they cannot slice through living flesh in this way, dooming millions of our fellow citizens to the status of Siberian hostages. [Signed] Trade Union Information Center.
