Chiang said Monday [17 January] that Taiwan may unilaterally lower import tariffs prior to holding tariff consultations with the United States Jan. 19-20. The move will help Taiwan avoid additional tariff cuts during later negotiations about Taiwan's entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Chiang said after meeting with visiting British Deputy Secretary of Trade and Industry Christopher Roberts. The United States has asked Taiwan to cut tariffs on 699 farm and industrial products by as much as 50 percent. U.S. negotiators have also been opposed to a Taiwan suggestion that the tariff cuts be included as part of expected GATT-related tariff cuts. If Taiwan gives in to both U.S. and GATT demands, Chiang said, Taiwan would have to cut import tariffs twice. However, a unilateral tariff reduction prior to negotiations with the U.S. would effectively help minimize any undesirable impact, Chiang added. Meanwhile, Director-General Huang Yen-chao of the Board of Foreign Trade left Taiwan Monday for Washington, D.C., where he will take part in tariff negotiations with U.S. Trade Representative Office officials. Huang said prior to his departure that government agencies have concluded that Taiwan can allow tariff cuts for only 10 percent of the industrial products requested by the United States, and tariffs will not be reduced on any agricultural items.
