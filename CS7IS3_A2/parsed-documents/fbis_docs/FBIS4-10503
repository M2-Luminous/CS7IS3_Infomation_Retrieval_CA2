Banco Latino was taken over by the Venezuelan state in mid-January for a lack of liquidity, thus giving rise to the worst financial crisis in the country's history. The bank reopened its doors last week. A homemade explosive device exploded at the Banco Latino branch in Quinta Crespo (southwestern part of the Venezuelan capital) at 0520, causing only slight property damage. Police found and defused another device placed inside a gasoline container at another nearby Banco Latino branch. Banco Latino's main office has received several phone calls throughout the day warning of possible explosions. Banco Latino press department spokesmen reported about an attack on one of the bank's branches in Altamira (eastern Caracas), the windows of which were all shattered. So far only one person has been arrested. Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom said he will wait to see the police reports before issuing his position on the incidents.
