The committee announced the number of shares to be sold -- 28.7 per cent from the authorised capital totalling 236.7 billion roubles. The state seeks not to release Gazprom from its hold at the first stage of privatisation and retains 40 per cent of shares for three years. The society has already sold 15 per cent of stocks to gas industry workers according to a closed subscription: they were purchased by nearly 270,000 people. It is necessary now to sell the largest block of shares which will be sold at 60 regional auctions. Each auction will sell blocks of shares, the size of which will be proportionate to the value of the industry's fixed assets on a given territory. There is another distinguishing feature of auctions. Their participants will consist of physical persons having permanent residence registration on a given territory. Tyumen region residents will buy the greatest number of Gazprom stocks: 17 million shares worth 1,000 roubles each. This is 7.15 per cent from the authorised capital. Another 5.7 per cent of stocks will be floated in the Yamal-Nenets national area. The labour and shares floating division of the Gazprom society compiled a map of a kind: a list of regions indicating the value of Gazprom fixed assets on their territories. The Orenburg region with its gas fields and gas-processing amalgamations trails the Sverdlovsk and Perm regions as to the value of fixed assets. This is despite the fact that gas is not produced there. The last cities on the list are Moscow and St. Petersburg consuming the greatest quantities of gas but having no production facilities of the society on their territories.
