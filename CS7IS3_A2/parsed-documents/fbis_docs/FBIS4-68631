Back in 1991. Citizens of the country, however, received their first vouchers designated "Property" only in April of this year. This was the peculiar feature of Belarusian privatization: First, some state property--almost free, in the form of a lease--was made available to some citizens of the country (as a rule, employees of small enterprises who had the opportunity and connections to formalize buy-sell papers); then, in 1994, the Ministry of State Property [MSP] counted the remaining property and is now distributing vouchers to everyone. The value of a voucher is 25,000 Belarusian rubles [R]. According to the terms of the "Council of Ministers lease," Belarusian state property could be sold to foreigners and persons without citizenship. Now the vouchers are issued only to those who were living in Belarus at the time they became citizens (November 1991). There are no lines in savings banks where certificates on the quantity of vouchers are issued. People are in no hurry to take the vouchers, because they do not know what to do with them. At this point there are no investment funds in the country; the first 30 enterprises will put their stock on the market only in June. Property in Belarus is divided into republic and municipal ownership. Well, in Minsk the list of municipal property (which until now belonged to local bodies of authority) subject to privatization includes only 400 entities. The choice is not extensive: several public restrooms, as-yet-unprofitable shops, stores on the outskirts. This is not much for the private sector in the capital of an independent state, but quite enough to serve as a cover for an illegal sellout of state property. Nobody in Belarus would undertake today to count how many prestigious entities have been sold "under the table": The process of privatization has been stretched out too long, and there has been confusion in processing and reprocessing of documents, caused by legislative chaos. This works for those who know how to turn on the green light giving the right of way to structures implementing privatization: Supreme Soviet commissions, the Council of Ministers, and the MSP. The best state property bringing dividends has already been bought up. A new scandal is in the making. The parliament commission on economic reform proposes to make an amendment to the Law "On Leasing" which will enable the state to take property back at any time "in the interests of the state." If this "reform" is implemented, bureaucrats will get a substantial windfall both from those who will try to keep the lease and those who will want to acquire new property. My neighbor, pensioner Maria Nikitichna, does not plan to take her vouchers at all. She has calculated that getting a chit confirming her labor record (officially) will cost her R14,000; the document on the status of her account in the Savings Bank as of 1 January 1991 (which also is required in order to have "Property" issued to you) will cost between R7,000 and R24,000; add the 15-percent tax for processing the certificate on the quantity of vouchers owned, and it will pretty much equal the value of these same vouchers. Privatization vouchers in Belarus are nominal. This makes them different from the Russian ones. One can only use them through a personal account in the Savings Bank, keeping only the certificate of the quantity. There are rumors that this document has eight degrees of protection, but an acquaintance of mine--a specialist with the MSP--confessed to me that it is useless to steal vouchers: There will be nowhere to invest them in small quantities anyway. One can give vouchers as a gift or sell them. The transfer procedure is simple: Vouchers are transferred from one personal bank account to another. The quantity of vouchers issued is predicated on labor record and age. Persons over 35 years of age will get 50 vouchers; between 30 and 35--40; between 25 and 30--30, and between 16 and 25--20; and parents of youngsters will receive 10 vouchers. For those who have died waiting for their vouchers, "Property" will be issued to relatives--provided, of course, that the "dead soul" was on the lists put together in August. One voucher is issued for each year in the labor record. It has been calculated that those who will be entitled to the greatest number of vouchers are disabled veterans of the World War II (up to 30 extra vouchers) with up to 30 years' labor record. The state has reserved R260 billion worth of property to be sold for vouchers. There are 1,800 enterprises that will not be privatized. Nobody has yet seen, however, the list of entities that will be for sale.
