The third draft report had only called for the imposition of stringent penalties in general. The phrase "including suspension of their licences" was added as part of the Chairman, Mr. Ram Niwas Mirdha's amendments. "It is necessary that stringent penalties are imposed on these banks keeping in view the extent of irregularities indulged in by each of them. Legal action should be pursued both in India and the foreign country concerned," the unanimous draft said. "The Committee desire that special scrutiny may be carried out by the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) in all the foreign banks involved in the recent irregularities and the question of disallowing repatriation of profits through irregular securities transactions and other malpractices be considered," the report said. Managements blamed: The JPC is quite severe on the managements of the foreign banks as far as the question of accountability is concerned. "A common refrain of the top management of these banks has been their unawareness of what was happening in their banks. Evidence before the Committee points to the fact that the top managements of the foreign banks examined by the Committee were aware of the goings on in their banks." Referring to the steps taken by individual banks to fix responsibility, the JPC found these "bordered on two extremes." "While BOA (Bank of America) and ANZ Grindlays Bank accepted some of the irregularities committed by them and also expressed regrets, in the case of Citibank it started with outright denials of existence of any irregularity and gradually veered around to acceptance of most of them," the draft report said. "During the first evidence, the witness of the bank categorically stated, `there is no evidence of employees fraud'. Even during the subsequent hearing the witness initially stuck to the same viewpoint and stated, 'there is also no reason to suspect employee fraud'." "However, in the same breath he added, `swift action has been initiated. The three seniormost officers and the seniormost dealer in the securities and PMS [Portfolio Management Scheme] areas are no longer in the employ of Citicorp/Citibank. The RBI has been kept informed," the draft said. Giving details of the operations of foreign banks, the draft said that with an insignificant numerical presence (45 banks with 140 branches) they had made record profits. Indian banks, on the other hand, had about 65,000 branches. "The net profit of these banks has grown by more than six times during less than five years from a mere Rs.[rupees] 66.59 crores in December, 1987 to a hefty Rs. 433.09 crores in March 1992." "The profits in March 1992 are to be viewed in the context of the fact that their total presence in the banking system is hardly 0.4 per cent and the profits made by the entire banking industry during the period were Rs. 1,299 crores." Simultaneously, the Committee came down heavily on the foreign banks for not being able to meet priority sector lending targets. "Their lending to the priority sector...has during the last four years been 7.67, 9.84, 9.45 and 7.86 percent against the targets of 10, 12, 12 and 15 percent." Though governed by the laws of the land, foreign banks, following the foreign exchange crunch, came to "enjoy more indulgence of the regulatory/monetary authorities, even though theoretically they continued to be governed by the same control measures as applicable to their Indian counterparts." "The examination by the Committee of securities transactions in banks has revealed that the foreign banks particularly have been deeply involved in the irregularities in securities transactions, they have acted in an unbecoming manner, indulged in large-scale security deals, highly disproportionate to their normal requirements and in the process not only violated RBI guidelines but also their own set procedures and prime facie the laws of the countries of their origin," the JPC said. Judicial probe demanded: Thirteen members of three major opposition parties in the 30-member JPC investigating the securities scam submitted a combined note to the JPC seeking a judicial inquiry into stockbroker Mr. Harshad Mehta's allegation of a Rs. 1-crore pay-off to Prime Minister, Mr. P.V. Narasimha Rao, JPC sources said.
