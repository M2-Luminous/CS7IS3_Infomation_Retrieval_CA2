FBIS4-37032 "drnes116_a_94002" FBIS-NES-94-116 Daily Report 15 Jun 1994 ARAB AFRICA Algeria FIS Leader's Prison Message to Zeroual Published FIS Leader's Prison Message to Zeroual Published PM1506112694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT in Arabic 15 Jun 94 pp 1, 4 PM1506112694 London AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT Arabic BFN [Report by Qasiyy Salih al-Darwish: "In Message From His Prison to Zeroual, Belhadj Says: Salvation Front Willing To Engage in Dialogue Openly, Not Behind Scenes"] [Excerpt] Paris -- Cheikh Ali Belhadj has denied that the Algerian [Islamic] Salvation Front [FIS] pledged to stop the violence following the release of its leadership members Ali Djeddi and Abdelkader Boukhamkham. He stressed that he told Algerian President Liamine Zeroual when Zeroual was defense minister that what is happening is not terrorism, but the people's right to fight the usurpers of power in accordance with the Shari'ah and the law. This came in a message Belhadj sent to President Zeroual from prison on 7 April, which was distributed yesterday evening by the FIS Executive Committee abroad. In the message Belhadj replies to a recent statement by the presidency, which says that FIS leaders pledged to stop violence and on that basis Djeddi and Boukhamkham were released, but they have not fulfilled their pledge. In his statement Belhadj criticized the presidency's statement, describing it as "a lie and a slander." He said: "That false statement weakens the president's chances of solving the political problem, thus complicating, rather than solving it. What makes things even worse is that there have been several observations since his appointment as president which deserve to be announced. They include the duality in the rhetoric and the positions, and the hesitation, as though the real field solution is the security solution." Belhadj attributes the duality in the regime's rhetoric to three points: 1. The predominance and influence of the clique of evil. 2. Fear of the influence of the ideological minorities. 3. Enjoyment of power, on the basis that the president's seat changes the mentality of those who sit there. Belhadj urged President Zeroual to allow the FIS to reply to the presidency's statement through television and radio. He added: "We said that we are willing to discuss the problem afflicting Algeria not behind the scenes, but openly on television." The message reflects the impasse the political dialogue has reached in Algeria. The delay in distributing the message reflects the strict control imposed on imprisoned FIS leaders and the difficulty of contacting them. [passage omitted]
