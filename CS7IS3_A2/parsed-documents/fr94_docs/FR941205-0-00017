FR941205-0-00017 FR941205-0-00002 Comment: One comment stated that the proposed rule is unclear on whether witnesses could testify at the interview because section 208.9(b) of the rule states that the applicant ``may . . . submit affidavits of witnesses'' while section 208.9(g) refers to live witnesses. Response and Disposition: An asylum applicant may present live witness testimony at the time of his or her interview. In the final rule, section 208.9(b) is amended to clarify this point. Comment: Several comments criticized the requirement in the proposed rule that the applicant be informed that he or she must appear in person to acknowledge receipt of the written decision of the asylum officer. The comments stated that this requirement would be inefficient and would result in applicants having to make an unnecessary return trip to the Asylum Office, where they may have to wait for a long period of time. A comment also questioned whether those who are interviewed in ``circuit ride'' locations would be able to go to those locations, or would be required to travel to the more distant Asylum Office with jurisdiction over their cases. Several comments suggested that written decisions be served by certified mail or that mail service be used in cases where the applicant has an attorney or registered representative. Response and Disposition: In order to streamline asylum adjudications, there must be a reliable system to accomplish and verify service of the decision to grant, refer, or deny the claim and, if applicable, service of the charging document. The INS experience with certified mail under the current rule demonstrates that this may not be the most effective method to meet this goal. If the applicant has provided an invalid address or has moved without notifying the INS, delivery most often will not be accomplished. In addition, postal delays and difficulties in processing return receipt cards detract from the INS's ability to confirm timely delivery. It may be somewhat inconvenient to make a return trip to the Asylum Office; however, under this system, the applicant will receive his or her decision promptly. If the decision is to grant the claim, the applicant will be able to apply more quickly for employment authorization and other benefits. If the decision is to refer the claim, the applicant will receive a charging document that will state the date and time of required appearance in immigration court, and will be able to plan for that proceeding. Finally, both the asylum adjudications and removal proceedings systems will benefit if there are fewer disputes regarding the service of decisions and charging documents. In cases where the applicant has failed to appear at the appointed time to receive his or her decision, certified mail will be used in lieu of personal service to deliver the decision. The INS has carefully considered whether the rule should be amended to permit the use of mail service in the case of applicants who have an attorney or registered representative. The Department has declined to adopt that proposal at this time, chiefly because of concerns that an attorney retained for the asylum application process may not remain as the applicant's attorney in exclusion or deportation proceedings. However, as this final rule is implemented, the INS will work with attorneys and advocacy organizations to consider this and other proposals relating to service of decisions. These provisions of the proposed rule have been adopted with an amendment to clarify that an applicant's failure to appear to receive and acknowledge receipt of the decision of the asylum officer shall be treated as delay caused by the applicant for purposes of 8 CFR 208.7(a)(3) and shall extend the period within which the applicant may not apply for employment authorization by the number of days until the applicant does appear to receive the decision or until the applicant appears before an immigration judge in response to the issuance of a charging document under 8 CFR 208.14(b). Comment: Several comments addressed the proposed rule's provisions governing the use of interpreters (8 CFR 208.9(g)). Some comments criticized the requirement, also contained in current regulations, that the applicant who does not wish to proceed in English provide an interpreter for the asylum interview. These comments stated that this will impose a financial burden on applicants and that it may be difficult for applicants to find competent interpreters, particularly for certain languages. Other comments recommended that the rule be amended to specifically permit immediate family members to serve as interpreters. Some comments suggested that the rule be more lenient in cases where the applicant has failed to provide an interpreter. One comment stated that the proposed rule should be amended to prohibit representatives, as well as attorneys and immediate family members, from serving as interpreters.
