Sabine Pipe Line Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;64&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 9, 1994, Sabine Pipe Line Company (Sabine), Post Office Box 4781, Houston, Texas 77210&hyph;4781, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP95&hyph;64&hyph;000 pursuant to §§157.205 and 157.216 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to abandon three sales taps under the blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP83&hyph;199&hyph;000, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. Sabine proposes to abandon three sales taps, all located in Jefferson County, Texas.

All of the sales taps, the NGDC/Port Neches, NGDC/Port Arthur and Star/Port Neches are no longer needed to provide gas service due to the Winnie/Jefferson interconnection, which was completed by Sabine and Winnie.

Transwestern Pipeline Company [Docket No. CP95&hyph;70&hyph;000] Take notice that on November 14, 1994, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern), Post Office Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251&hyph;1188 filed an application pursuant to Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon (i) certain certificated compression, plants metering dehydration, and pipeline facilities with appurtenances, located in various counties in Kansas Oklahoma, Texas and New Mexico (referred to as the ``Facilities'') by transfer to Transwestern Gathering Company (TGC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transwestern, 1 and (ii) certain certificated agreements and services rendered by Transwestern using such facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. 1 Transwestern states that the facilities which are proposed to be transferred to TGC mirror the facilities which are identified in the data response filed on September 6, 1994, in Docket No. CP94&hyph;254&hyph;000 (Refunctionalization Proceeding). Transwestern states that, because it is also conveying to TGC other facilities that are nonjurisdictional, it requests any permissions and approvals which the Commission deems necessary to permit their transfer to TGC. Transwestern states that TGC intends to file with the Commission a Petition for a Declaratory Order seeking a determination that the subject facilities, upon the conveyance thereof, are gathering facilities exempt from the Commission's jurisdiction under NGA Section 7(b). Transwestern requests that its application be consolidated with TGC's petition to be filed in the near future.
