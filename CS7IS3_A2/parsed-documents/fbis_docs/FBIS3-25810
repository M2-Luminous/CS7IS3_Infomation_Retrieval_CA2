How to implement the system in which state-owned enterprises go bankrupt? How to make arrangements for the placement of unemployed workers following enterprise bankruptcy? How to control the current situation of heavy losses of state-owned assets? At the news conference held by the State Council Press Office today, domestic and foreign reporters repeatedly asked officials of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System of China questions on the structural reform of state-owned enterprises, which is the key to China's economic reform this year. As introduced by Hong Hu, vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System, the objective and orientation of state-owned enterprise reform in China is to set up a modern enterprise system. This year, the State Council will select 100 large and medium state-owned enterprises in China as experimental units to implement the new system and gradually transform the mechanism of state-owned enterprises in various forms according to different categories. At present the name list has not been fixed and is being discussed by the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System and the State Economic and Trade Commission. Small state-owned enterprises will be transformed in such forms as leasing, contracting, selling, and leasing as well as renting out. Enterprises which are always in the red, which are unable to pay their debts, and which can never be reinvigorated will declare bankruptcy according to law. According to statistics, from the end of 1988 to the first half of 1993, law courts at all levels in China accepted and heard 948 cases of all kinds of enterprise bankruptcy, of which 480 have been wound up. Hong Hu pointed out: To set up a modern enterprise system, touching on the reorganization of property rights is inevitable. The act of declaring enterprise bankruptcy according to law is an effective way to readjust the industrial structure and achieve the reorganization of property rights, but it is not the only way. He said: Since we cannot issue planned targets of bankruptcy to organs at lower levels, we cannot estimate how many enterprises will go bankrupt in the reform of state-owned enterprises. Speaking on the placement of unemployed workers from state-owned enterprises in China, Hong Hu said: At present, the proportion of redundant personnel in the total number of employees in China's state-owned enterprises is from 15 to 20 percent, and this proportion is subject to constant change due to changes in the situation of operation and production in these enterprises. Last year, the State Council worked out the method of making arrangements for the placement of redundant personnel in state-owned enterprises, and now the work has been started. As stipulated in the method of unemployment insurance of state-owned enterprise staff and workers, which was formulated by the State Council last year, enterprises must withdraw 0.6 to 1 percent of total wages earned by their staff and workers to set up unemployment insurance funds; and staff and workers employed by enterprises which go bankrupt, which are on the verge of bankruptcy, or which have stopped production for reorganization are covered by the unemployment insurance scheme so that the living of unemployed workers can be basically guaranteed. The current situation of heavy loss of state-owned assets in China has also aroused much concern. Hong Hu said: The "Regulations on the Supervision of China's State-Owned Enterprise Assets" will be introduced soon, and we are now tackling such technical problems as how to make the regulations converge with the Company Law. Hong Hu said: The introduction of the regulations has an important bearing on stopping the loss of state-owned assets during the current process of setting up a modern enterprise system, transferring property rights, and reorganizing enterprises.
