FBIS4-5689 "dreas071_c_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-071 Daily Report 13 Apr 1994 North Korea Japan's `Criminal Past' Reiterated Japan's `Criminal Past' Reiterated SK1304113994 Pyongyang KCNA in English 1122 GMT 13 Apr 94 SK1304113994 Pyongyang KCNA English BFN ["Japan Cannot Shake Off `Enemy State' Brand" -- KCNA headline] [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Shunji Maruyama, deputy permanent representative of Japan to the United Nations, reportedly told a recent meeting of a working group that the provision of the U.N. charter specifying Japan as an "enemy state" was outdated and it must be deleted. His unreasonable assertion is an insult to the U.N. Charter and a mockery of unbiased public opinion critical of the past crimes of Japan. However angrily Japan may grumble, pointing its finger at the United Nations as now, in an attempt to cleanse itself of the disgraceful brand of "enemy state" specified in the U.N. charter, it is no wise way of solving the problem. If the problem is to be solved, Japan must liquidate its shameful past, first of all. Japan's past is spoiled with never-to-be-condoned crimes; it is a war criminal state in World War II and imposed all sorts of misfortunes and sufferings on the Korean and other Asian peoples. It is the height of effrontery for Japan to attempt to delete the brand of "enemy state" while keeping mum about its criminal past. Striking out the brand of "enemy state" is out of question today when Japan, forgetful of the lesson on the past, is hastening its nuclear armament and its conversion into a military power in real earnest to realise its old dream of "the greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" and thus hindering the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and the establishment of a nuclear weapon-free world and posing a great threat to the Korean and other Asian peoples.
