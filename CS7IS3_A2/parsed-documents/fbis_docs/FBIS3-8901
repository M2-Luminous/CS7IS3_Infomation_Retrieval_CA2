We have least confidence in private banks; nearly half of the respondents (47 percent) do not trust them. The CBOS poll was conducted between 11 and 15 February of this year on a nationwide, random representative sample of 1,198 adult members of Poland's population. Number-two in the table is the ombudsman, who is trusted by 71 percent of the public and distrusted by 11 percent. At number three comes public television, for which approval was expressed by 69 percent of the respondents and disapproval by 20 percent. The next place went to the state police, in which 66 percent of the respondents expressed confidence, while 27 percent expressed a lack of it. The authorities of the respondents' towns (parishes) and the church each enjoyed 54 percent of public confidence. Disapproval was expressed by 32 and 37 percent, respectively. More than half of the respondents (51 percent) expressed confidence in the government, the Sejm, the courts, and the Supreme Chamber of Control. The greatest disapproval among these was expressed for the Sejm (35 percent) and the government (33 percent). Among the central institutions, the poorest appraisal is given to the work of the president, who is trusted by 35 percent of the respondents but disapproved of by more than half (55 percent). In February, confidence in the activities of trade unions went up. Approval for Solidarity (40 percent) went up 15 points, while, for the National Trade Union Alliance, it rose by 10 percentage points. The improved position of the trade unions probably resulted from the Warsaw demonstration by Solidarity, as well as from the recently more frequent appearances by representatives of these organizations in the mass media.
