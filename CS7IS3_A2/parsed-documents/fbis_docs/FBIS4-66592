FBIS4-66592 "jpnea021___94023" JPRS-NEA-94-021 JPRS Near East & South Asia 20 February 1994 SOUTH ASIA INDIA Papers Report, Comment on Relations With U.S. Papers Report, Comment on Relations With U.S. Clark on Clinton Remarks 94AS0241B Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE in English 20 Feb 94 p 9 94AS0241B Hyderabad DECCAN CHRONICLE English CSO [Text] President Bill Clinton's recent remarks on human rights in Kashmir violate all diplomatic norms and India is perfectly justified in reacting angrily, a former American Ambassador to India, Mr William Clark, has said. The Clinton Administration has indeed changed the neutral policies on Kashmir pursued by both Democratic and Republican Administrations for several years, he said at a briefing on the India chair and his upcoming Indian visit at the Foreign Press Centre of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in Washington. Mr Clark is leaving for India on Sunday and hopes to be able to meet the Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, the Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, and leaders of industry to mobilize moral and material support for the Japan chair at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies where he holds the Japan chair and is a senior adviser on Asia. Mr Clark who improved Indo-American relations, sees his work being undone by the Clinton Administration, conceded that U.S. "interest in India has over time in Washington not been proportionate to its size." "It has been very hard to keep India on the scope and it is very hard to do that today. The majority of articles that appear in the American press deal with Kashmir, Punjab--though that has fallen out--or the less positive aspects of society," he said. On Mr Clinton's mistakes over Kashmir, Mr Clark said that during his confirmation hearings, he had emphasised the Shimla agreement. "I still think that it is the right way to do it. I won't talk about this Administration's handling of it but it has a slightly different approach." Mr Clark, the U.S. Envoy to New Delhi from 1989 to 1992, thought that part of the reason for the deterioration in Indo-U.S. relations was the long delay in nominating an Ambassador to India. Analysing why the Clinton Administration's India policy appears to have taken a turn for the worse, Mr Clark said: "This President clearly wants to be a domestic President, who tries to limit his foreign policy time as much as he can. He is driven by Bosnia and Somalia and other things. It is not surprising that India does not necessarily get up that high in (Mr Clinton's) thought." Referring to the new Pakistani Envoy to the United States, Ms Maleeha Lodhi's speech raking up Kashmir while presenting her credentials, he said it was ""unprofessional," although he added, "but then Lodhi is not a professional and so I cannot blame her." President Clinton had backed Ms Lodhi, saying, "We share Pakistan's concerns about human rights abuses in Kashmir." Mr Clark has no clue as to what might have prompted Mr Clinton's remark. "I cannot explain that one. You should ask the White House," he replied to a query.
