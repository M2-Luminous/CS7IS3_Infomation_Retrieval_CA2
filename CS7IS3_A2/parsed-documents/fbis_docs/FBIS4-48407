The militiamen and Mademo workers have been on strike since yesterday, demanding the payment of salary arrears. The clash occurred when the police tried to disperse the demonstrators that have been gathering outside the Provincial Agriculture Directorate building since yesterday. A child and his mother were seriously wounded during the clash. Two policemen, including the commander of the city's police headquarters, were hit by bullets fired by their colleagues. Reports say the demonstrators had seized three firearms from policemen, but decided to return them following talks with mediators from the Provincial Agriculture Directorate. Meanwhile, the mediators and workers' representatives have begun reviewing salary arrears dating back to 1991. The Ministry of Agriculture was today scheduled to send a check corresponding to the amount demanded by the workers. Many of the city's shops remained closed today and road traffic suspended due to the demonstration involving some 90 Mademo workers as well as former militiamen.
