Meanwhile, we must safeguard political stability in Tibet, safeguard the unification of the motherland, and fight splittist forces in and outside of national borders. Leaders of the regional CPC Committee who attended the regional Conference on Propaganda and Ideological Work on 18 April were Guo Jinlong, Basang, Danzim, Yang Chuantang, Lieque, and Puqung. Gyaincain Norbu, deputy secretary of the regional CPC Committee, presided over the conference. He said that the guiding ideology and main tasks of this session are as follows: With Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics as the guide, implement in an all-around manner guidelines of the national conference on propaganda and ideology; analyze the current situation on the propaganda and ideological front in Tibet; and, in line with the one fundamental principle and four tasks as well as the actual conditions in Tibet, study and work out the main tasks regarding propaganda and ideological work in 1994 and thereafter. Gyaincain Norbu said: It is hoped that this meeting will enable party leadership at all levels and comrades on the propaganda and ideological front to have a better understanding of the overall situation, unify their thinking, pluck up their spirits, and do solid work to open up a new situation in propaganda and ideological work in Tibet. It is essential to heighten our awareness of the importance of giving equal emphasis to both spiritual civilization and material progress, and the importance of ideological and propaganda work in guaranteeing the success of our cause; and to do a better job in mobilizing and inspiring the vast number of party members and the masses to constantly advance reform, opening up, and the modernization drive. Chen Kuiyuan, secretary of the regional CPC committee, delivered an important speech at the meeting on the region's propaganda and ideological work in the days to come. His speech focused on four points: 1. Gain a clear understanding of the situation and make persistent efforts in successfully executing propaganda and ideological work in Tibet with a clear head; 2. The basic tasks on the propaganda and ideological front; 3. Strengthen the ranks of propaganda and ideological cadres; and 4. Party and government leading organs must display greater interest in propaganda and ideological work, and show greater care and support for cadres of propaganda and ideological departments. First of all, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan analyzed the situation in China and in Tibet. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics, China's economy has been growing and its political situation has become more and more stable since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee. As reform and opening up deepen, the political situation in Tibet, as elsewhere in China, has become increasingly stable and its economy is undergoing heartening changes. In economic terms, 1993 was the best year ever in Tibet. With the generous support of the central government and other provinces and municipalities, Tibet's economic prospects have never been brighter or broader. Tibet's economy will undergo more profound and dynamic changes by the turn of the century. Speaking of the basic tasks on the propaganda and ideological front in Tibet, Comrade Chen Kuiyuan said: As an important front in administering state affairs and ensuring national security, and as the mouthpiece of the party and state, propaganda work must adhere to the party's theory, line, and policies; in doing propaganda and ideological work, we must adherence to principle and address specific issues. We should dare to address -- not evade or get round to -- the principal contradictions. Propaganda and ideological work must also be oriented toward the broad masses of people in and outside the party, be effective in arousing the people's consciousness, reflect the fundamental interests of the people, and guide the masses to advance along the correct path. Propaganda and ideological departments must provide correct guidance through the media and remove all sorts of erroneous guidance for public opinion so the broad masses of people will have a common understanding and work enthusiastically toward our common goal. Comrade Chen Kuiyuan pointed out: In implementing socialist modernization in Tibet, it is essential that -- in addition to the party and government who are leading the masses to concentrate on implementing the policy of reform and opening up and invigorating the economy -- propaganda and ideological departments vigorously promote Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics so people inside and outside the party and throughout the region will be able to better arm themselves with his theory. Propaganda and ideological departments must also conscientiously publicize Comrade Deng Xiaoping's noted writings and statements on correctly handling issues related to nationalities. Only by acquiring a fuller understanding of the dissertations by Deng Xiaoping on this subject will we be able to correctly differentiate right from wrong on many issues concerning Tibet and to find the correct path to speed up development. Chen Kuiyuan said: A major obstacle to socialist economic construction and the implementation of profound reforms in Tibet is leftist ideas and outmoded ways of thinking. By leftist ideas we mean sticking to an economic mode that is outdated, runs counter to the conditions in China, and stands in the way of the development of productive forces. After living and working for many years under this mode, we have got used to it and find it quite hard to free ourselves from its influence. Emancipation of the mind requires hard work over a long period of time. This is particularly true of Tibet, which is economically backward, has a closed market, and where contacts and exchanges with the outside world are few and far between. Emancipation of the mind therefore requires even greater efforts in Tibet. Only by studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics will we be able to solve this problem, conscientiously adhere to the policy of reform, open wider to the outside world, and promote economic development. Chen Kuiyuan said: One salient feature of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics is the idea of paying attention to fostering both material progress and cultural and ideological progress, and maintaining social and political stability. In other words, political stability, economic development, material progress, and cultural and ideological progress are all essential requirements for building socialism. Only by attaching equal importance to both and being careful not to emphasize one and neglect the other can we live up to the requirements of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line. Our primary task is to build a modern socialist Tibet. Propaganda and ideological work must serve this main theme today and for quite some time to come. After having fully affirmed the achievements scored by the propaganda and ideological front in the whole region, Chen Kuiyuan stressed: The contingent of propaganda and ideological personnel must further improve themselves. The contingent of propaganda personnel must be one that has indisputable political qualifications, perfect mastery of ideology, and very high combat effectiveness. Only when this contingent of ours is very steadfast can we successfully accomplish the historical mission we have undertaken. The contingent of propaganda personnel must pay close attention to its problems, must be good at giving full play to its strong points and at overcoming its shortcomings, must continuously enhance its level so as to enable the army of our propaganda personnel to stand in the forefront of the times, and must be good at guiding the masses to triumphantly advance along the course charted by the party. If we want to make this contingent of ours truly become the mouthpiece of the party and state as well as an important front army for the party to maintain contact with and educate the masses, we must be good at using the theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics to eliminate leftist influence over us and leftist patterns of thought. Meanwhile, we must be good at using patriotism to refute splittism, and must continuously strengthen the building of the contingent of propaganda and ideological personnel ideologically and organizationally to make the contingent more steadfast in ideology, purer in organization, and more combat effective. We must improve the level of propaganda to meet the needs of the new situation; we must justly and forcefully propagandize unity among nationalities, the need for all fraternal nationalities to stick together and to depend on each other for survival, and the goodwill of mutual support; and we absolutely must not allow the speeches and activities aimed at sowing discord among nationalities, splitting the motherland, and disrupting its unification to spread unchecked. Disrupting unity among nationalities is equivalent to disrupting the unification of the motherland, and runs counter to the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people in Tibet. We must resolutely crack down on the speeches and activities that disrupt unity among nationalities and the unification of the motherland; there is no room whatsoever for us to be vague on this matter. Chen Kuiyuan called on party committees and governments in the whole region to show more concern for and give more support to the work of the propaganda and ideological front as well as the cadres, staff, and workers on the front, and to eliminate the phenomenon of taking a tough stand on one link while being softhearted on the other. He called on the principal leading cadres at all levels, in particular, to personally guide and constantly concern themselves with the propaganda work and to help propaganda departments solve difficulties actually confronted. He said: The propaganda work is a task that has a bearing on the overall situation. It constitutes an important, integral part of the party's strategic objective. Therefore, leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to and directly support the propaganda work. Only thus can we guarantee that we can do a better job in carrying out the propaganda work. At the conference, Deputy Secretary Danzim of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Party Committee relayed the guidelines of the national work conference on propaganda and ideology.
