Gulmanis highly assessed the results of his visit, saying that the Present Russian leadership conducts a favorable policy towards Latvia. On Saturday, Russian president Boris Yeltsin said in the Kremlin after signing Russo-Latvian documents that a package of bilateral agreements is expected to be signed during Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to Latvia. During the talks between Russian and Latvian officials held at the top level, the sides signed an agreement on the order of withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian territory, an agreement on legal status of the Russian radar station in Scrunda, an agreement on social welfare for Russian servicemen and their families and retired servicemen on the Latvian territory. Participants in the news conference held today and attended by Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs pointed out that the talks in the Kremlin were held an a cordial and frank atmosphere. "When the dialogue began, we dropped all apprehensions about possible pressure from Russia. The dialogue was held in a free, easy and democratic form," Ulmanis said. Dwelling on the main subject of the Moscow talks, Ulmanis pointed out that "after Grachev said that Russia intends to withdraw its troops much earlier than August 31, I became sure that the Russian army would go soon." " We shall be able to step up the process rather than merely monitor it as it was before" Ulmanis said. "If we manage to lay a foundation to mutual confidence on the basis of the signed documents, the relations between the two countries will soon enter a new historic stage," the Latvian president said. A similar opinion was expressed by Valdis Birkavs, who emphasised that Latvia needs " long-term, advantageous economic ties with Russia." Therefore, Birkavs said that an agreement on granting Latvia a most-favoured nation status in trade with Russia is one of the most important achievements of the visit. Before the visit to Moscow began, Ulmanis, in an interview with ITAR-TASS, welcomed the development of mutually advantageous ties with Russia. He pointed out that not only "a window to Europe", but "doors" must be left open through Baltic ports. The sincerity of the Latvian president arises no doubt, since thanks to his energetic efforts a Russo-Latvian conflict over the arrest of two Russian generals was prevented. According to the Latvian president, this incident "made the Latvian leadership look at itself from a critical point of view." During the Moscow meeting the Russian and Latvian presidents showed tact and respect for each other. The Russian side took into account the Latvian president's request to return to Latvia the remains of the former Latvian President Karlis Ulmanis who was interned by the Stalinist regime in the 1940s and buried in former Soviet Turkmenistan. The now Latvian president is a grand nephew of Karlis Ulmanis and he believes that his destiny is to establish peace and accord in society. Ulmanis is the fifth consecutive Latvian president and the first president after Latvia regained its independence. He is married and has two children. He enjoys great popularity as a politician and invariably ranks first in popularity in public opinion polls.
