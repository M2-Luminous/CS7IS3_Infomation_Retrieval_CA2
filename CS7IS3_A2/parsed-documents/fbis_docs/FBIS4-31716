The Yugoslav Information Ministry said in a statement that Markovic briefed Simic about the Croatian Bureau's activities and handed him a letter from Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and foreign minister. The two sides agreed that Simic's visit to Zagreb on February 12, was a step towards resuming negotiations aimed at normalizing mutual relations and stabilizing the overall political situation in the region. They also said they hoped that Simic and Granic would meet soon and that outstanding problems would be resolved on an equal footing and in the spirit of tolerance which had so far prevailed in the talks between Yugoslavia and Croatia. Croatia violently seceded from the former Yugoslav federation in mid-1991.
