The shots were heard from the western corner of the shrine while President Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani was delivering a speech. The ceremonies, attended by tens of thousands of participants, including foreign guests, were held at the beginning of the ten-day dawn ceremonies, marking the arrival to the country of the late Imam Khomeyni after a 15-year exile in 1979. An unidentified person, standing 150 meters away from the western gate of the shrine, shot a few bullets into the air and was later seized by the crowd and handed over to the Law Enforcement Forces. Major Reza Mohammad-Doust, a law enforcement officer, told IRNA that interrogation started immediately after the arrest and in the body search that ensued a number of forged student, police and press cards were found on the assailant. The incident took place on the first day of the ten-day dawn ceremonies, marking the 15th anniversary of the 1979 victory of the Islamic revolution. The shots did not disturb the ceremonies and the large crowd of people, after chanting "death to munafiq" (munafiq, means "hypocrite" a reference to the members of the Iraqi-sponsored terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq outfit) and "Hashemi, Hashemi you are the apple of our eyes", calmed down and continued listening to the rest of President Rafsanjani's speech.
