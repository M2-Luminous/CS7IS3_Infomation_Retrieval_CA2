FBIS4-4938 "dreas066_m_94006" FBIS-EAS-94-066 Daily Report 5 Apr 1994 Thailand Commander Provides View on Amendment Debate Commander Provides View on Amendment Debate BK0504054094 Bangkok BANGKOK POST in English 5 Apr 94 p 2 BK0504054094 Bangkok BANGKOK POST English BFN [Text] Army Commander-in-Chief Gen Wimon Wongwanit yesterday said he voted in support of the Opposition's constitution amendment bill last week because the Government-proposed bills were based on the 1992 Constitution criticised as being undemocratic and dictatorial. The 1992 Constitution was drafted at the order of the now-defunct National Peace-keeping Council [NPKC] which overthrew the Chatchai Chunhawan Government on February 23, 1991. Gen Wimon said he thought it proper to support the Opposition bill based on the 1978 Constitution which had no connection with the NPKC in any way. If we truly want to discard the dictatorial image of the NPKC, the proposed amendments should be based on the 1978 Constitution, he said. The Army chief said any amendment of the 1992 Constitution was likely to come in for criticism from some groups. He said he wanted to see the nation united but thought this would be difficult while criticisms persisted. A number of issues might yet be amended in the Opposition draft. He said the reduction in the eligible voting age to 18 had divided senators and he hoped the committee appointed to scrutinise the bill would look carefully into the matter. Gen Wimon said senators supporting the Opposition last Thursday had acted independently. This contradicts another senator who claimed Upper House members had been lobbied to vote in favour of the Opposition. The Army commander yesterday said he was worried some people might exploit the present situation. He also thought it improper to say the situation would be tense during the scrutiny of the Constitution. Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm Prachet Siridet said senators voted for the Opposition bill because they found it acceptable. He also came to the defence of Defence Minister Gen Wichit Sukmak who is under attack from Government MPs for voting for the Opposition draft. Adm Prachet said Gen Wichit was acting in his capacity as a senator, not a Cabinet member, when he voted on the issue. He said any move such as replacing Gen Wichit should be based on reason. Adm Prachet said the Government had made it clear from the beginning that the attempt to amend the Constitution had nothing to do with the Government and senators were free to exercise their own judgement. House Military Committee chairman Gen Athit Kamlang-ek yesterday also backed Gen Wichit by saying he did not think the minister had committed any grave mistakes. "I know Prime Minister Chuan Likphai quite well and don't think he will replace Gen Wichit. He is polite and has respect for other people," said the former army commander. Mr Chuan, meanwhile last night vouched his support for Gen Wichit. The premier said he fully understood the general whom he met for talks yesterday. He said Gen Wichit did not vote for the change in the agenda to place the Opposition draft ahead of the eight amendments bills proposed by the coalition parties because he did not support the move. The defence minister voted in favour of the Opposition draft because he felt the eight amendment bills were not sponsored by the Government, but the coalition parties. The prime minister praised Gen Wichit as an honest and responsible man citing his cooperation in amending the capital peacekeeper's law. Earlier, Mr Chuan said there was no misunderstanding on Gen Wichit's part since he knew from the beginning the amendments were not government drafts. He was not asked to vote for them as everyone had the right to exercise their own judgement. The Premier also said there was no law prohibiting Gen Wichit from being both a senator and cabinet minister. He would not say what was discussed with Gen Wichit yesterday but said: "Gen Wichit is a soldier and a gentleman and he is not afraid of anything." Gen Wichit yesterday refused comment on reports that Democrat Party MPs were pressing him to resign after he supported the Opposition-sponsored constitution amendment bill. Gen Wichit, a senator appointed to the defence portfolio under the Democrat quota, insisted he had the right under the Constitution to a free vote. The Defence Minister last week joined the majority of senators and the entire Opposition in an unprecedented move to beat the government-sponsored constitution amendment bills during the special session of Parliament. Democrat MPs are reportedly angry with Gen Wichit and want him expelled from the Chuan Likphai Cabinet. Gen Wichit denied discussing any political issues with the Premier yesterday. He said the meeting was about the opening of the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge scheduled for Friday. He also denied he was told to choose between being a senator and a minister or that there had been any political pressure put on him. It had earlier been reported that Gen Wichit told Mr Chuan he had voted with the Senate because he was afraid his lack of cooperation with the military might affect his work at the Defence Ministry. Mr Chuan said there was no need for the Defence Minister to explain his vote to the Cabinet.
