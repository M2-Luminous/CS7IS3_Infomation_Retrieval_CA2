Razakov, director of the State Committee for National Security press service; place and date not given: "Military Counterintelligence in Kyrgyzstan. What Does It Do?"] [Text] The Directorate of Military Counterintelligence was organized for the first time in the State Committee for National Security [GKNB] of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan a little more than a year ago. Considering that one frequently hears talk of late regarding an alleged increase in the staff of employees of the security organs, we decided to meet with Colonel Madalbek Moldashev, chief of the GKNB Directorate of Military Counterintelligence. [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, as we know, there was a counterintelligence subunit in the system of the USSR KGB for a long time, and now there is one in the republic GKNB. What prompted the creation of yet another structure: the Directorate of Military Counterintelligence. [Moldashev] The disintegration of the former USSR forced a reexamination of the problems of guaranteeing the national security of each of the republics. In addition, the military-political situation, the operational situation, the condition of the economy, and strategic tasks for strengthening the territorial integrity and independence of the state were taken into account. Previously in the USSR Armed Forces, work was conducted in a centralized way by special departments that were directly subordinate to the USSR KGB. There were no military counterintelligence organs in the KGB structures of the former Union republics. The formation by each of the republics of their own Armed Forces made it necessary for all national intelligence services to revise the concept of guaranteeing state security as a whole and to establish their own structures of military counterintelligence organs. By a decision of the government, the Directorate of Military Counterintelligence of the GKNB was organized in August last year. [Razakov] Is this a concession to fashion and a copying of the activity of near and distant neighbors, or is it a search for new positions in the structure of the GKNB? [Moldashev] In the period of the division of the USSR Armed Forces into national forces and the disintegration of the USSR KGB (1990-1992), for a number of subjective and objective reasons the activity of counterintelligence organs on the territory of the former Union republics practically stopped, and in individual cases their work was of a formal nature. Military counterintelligence personnel, like many army servicemen, were engaged only in arranging personal matters, and began to leave Kyrgyzstan in a massive way. A situation of lack of control developed in military units and subunits, and even permissiveness in some places. In such a situation, our "talented" compatriots quickly devised (with the active participation of high-ranking military chiefs and representatives of the shadow economy) a clever mechanism for the sale of military equipment, theft and appropriation of weapons and ammunition, sale of military property at cheap prices, and the transport of material valuables outside the republic's boundaries. Abuse of service position became a daily occurrence. Military discipline fell sharply. The situation in the army environment heated up because of failure to resolve social and everyday problems. The danger of the emergence of groups of lawbreakers among servicemen and their getting together with organized crime increased. Moreover, the newly created armed forces of a sovereign republic should be reliably guarded against the subversive activity of foreign intelligence services, criminal encroachments, and also from the involvement of servicemen in antistate and antisocial activity. [Razakov] Could you briefly disclose the mechanism of thefts and abuses in the army? [Moldashev] The arsenal of methods used is very broad. In particular, in the period indicated above about 200 units of various kinds of army motor vehicles were sold to private persons and cooperative enterprises. Fake documents, invalid stamps, and figurehead persons were employed, new vehicles were written off as obsolete ahead of time, there was registration only of documents--given the absence of the motor vehicles themselves, accounting data was artificially muddled up, record and accounting documents were destroyed ahead of schedule, etc. Semiautomatic combat weapons with ammunition were sold at a symbolic price to military and civilian persons who quickly became members of a hunting society. Servicemen were sent on so-called official business outside the republic on service motor vehicles and transported stolen military property on the way using the pretext that it was household goods, and the vehicle was lost without a trace in the vast expanse of a previously united fatherland. [Razakov] But will military counterintelligence not replace organs of the MVD or the military procurator? [Moldashev] In no way. On the whole, counterintelligence is intended to give warning of and prevent state crimes in military units and formations placed by legislation of the republic within the purview of organs of national security, and it does not duplicate the functions of either command elements, the procuracy, or the militia. We cooperate closely with the aforementioned organs in the course of preliminary inquiry as well as in investigations. For example, in December last year in Bishkek a motor vehicle was blown up with the participation of a serviceman; one person was killed and a second incurred serious injuries. Organs of military counterintelligence, the MVD, GKNB subunits, and the military procuracy joined in the operational investigation and the legal procedure measures, which produced positive results. This kind of "tandem" in activity, in which each side worked out its own questions, is a frequent practice in the investigation of stolen or seized weapons, in the prevention of illegal exports of material valuables, etc. [Razakov] Could you shed light on the "main thrust" of the directorate that you manage? [Moldashev] It is obvious that all the negative processes that occur in society are reflected in the armed forces as if in a mirror. Among servicemen (considering the self-discipline, access to armaments, combat qualifications, low material level, domestic disorder, and other factors), social problems take on a special acuteness, which representatives of the crime-conducive environment attempt to exploit. In comparison with the "so-called stagnation period," interest on the part of individual persons in combat arms, ammunition, and equipment has constantly increased inasmuch as they are becoming not only a weapon of violence but also a subject of profit. In contrast to past years of armed conflict in Tajikistan, the Caucasus has increased the demand for army equipment, and "hunter-gatherers" from these regions have become frequent. Therefore, we are undertaking all measures to erect barriers on the probable routes of thefts, seizures, losses, sales, and illegal exports of weapons, munitions, and equipment. The ever-increasing flow of incoming drugs represents a great danger for the army in connection with a weakening of the regime of protection of the Afghan-Tajik border. The timely blocking of drug entry and distribution channels is one of our urgent tasks. On behalf of stability in society we are obligated to guard servicemen from the spreading influence of Islamic fundamentalism and not to permit them to become drawn into extremist groups--given a respectful attitude toward everyone's religious convictions. The presence in the army of various armaments, combat equipment, and explosives does not exclude attempts on the part of individual persons to employ them for sabotage and terrorist purposes. In the whole world extremist groups see the resolution of political, social, and personal problems in terror, or in sabotage. Therefore, the fight against terrorist and sabotage phenomena among troops and their surroundings has not lost its urgency for us. I have talked only about some aspects of our work, inasmuch as, despite the atmosphere of glasnost, there are still spheres of our work that should not be divulged. [Razakov] What are the results of the activity of your employees? [Moldashev] Together with the organs of the MVD and the military procuracy it has been possible to expose and stop a number of criminal acts. On the basis of information sent by the Directorate of the VKR [military counterintelligence] to MVD organs, more than a dozen criminal cases have been initiated. Employees of the republic military counterintelligence have uncovered more than a dozen units of firearms and more than 15,000 munitions of various calibers, which were unaccounted for and could have been stolen, at depots of military units. In the course of operational-search measures conducted jointly with organs of the MVD, the procuracy, and GKNB subunits, stolen assault rifles, pistols, cartridges, combat grenades, and bayonet-knives for assault rifles have been confiscated from criminals and returned to the troops. The VKR branch of the Osh garrison has uncovered cases of plundering of the motor pool, with the subsequent sale of assemblies and parts removed from motor vehicles. The loss caused by the culprits has been restored. Attempts by a number of officers, who were leaving for a new place of service, to transport outside the republic's boundaries stolen military equipment in the sum of more than 2 million rubles [R] in 1991 prices have been suppressed. In the investigative stage a number of other materials in similar kinds of crimes are being found. In August 1993, owing to joint measures adopted in a timely way, the illegal transport beyond the borders of the republic of military equipment, armaments, and ammunition of an Air Defense subunit deployed in the south was prevented. Employees of this same branch in cooperation with organs of the procuracy arrested an officers of the military commissariat during the acquisition of bribes by means of extortion. In July 1993 information was received concerning imminent conflict between a group of sergeants and newly called-up soldiers on the grounds of nonregulation treatment. To take revenge, the latter were preparing a physical reprisal against the offenders, and as a sign of protest against the commanders for failure to take steps to stop the tyranny were planning to set fire to the barracks. The timely measures that were taken made it possible to prevent an emergency situation and neutralize the conflict. The military procuracy is conducting an investigation into this case. Work conducted by us to guard about 800 kilograms of precious metals in used up parts and assemblies in troop units made it possible to prevent their theft or illegal acquisition by questionable commercial structures. It is too early to talk about a number of materials that are in production and are undergoing a double-check. [Razakov] At present all law enforcement organs are experiencing a shortage of qualified personnel, including the GKNB, due to the departure of experienced employees. Apparently, your directorate is not an exception? How is the personnel problem being resolved? [Moldashev] Selection of candidates is being conducted among officers of the active military service or the reserve. We are enlisting graduates of civilian VUZ's [higher educational institution]. Despite a not very high salary, the absence of apartments, and the need to move from a long-occupied place, there are quite a few who want to become military counterintelligence personnel, which indicates that many people are not indifferent to the fate of our young state and the future of our society. However, not everyone is able to pass our "exams" successfully and become enlisted. Our collective is interethnic. In personnel selection we distance ourselves from tribalism, protectionism, and regionalism. In processing for service and assessment of the work of each employee, the primary criteria are devotion to duty, readiness to serve the fatherland, personal and work characteristics, and also objective indicators of effective service activity. There are undoubtedly also officers among the military counterintelligence personnel who desire to serve in other regions. We are not dramatizing such attempts, understanding the vital interests of those who are departing. Our directorate is also experiencing an acute shortage of qualified personnel. At the present time two-thirds of our employees do not have operational work experience. Their professional formation is being delayed because of absence of special knowledge, which was previously acquired in academic training institutions of the USSR KGB. Due to economic difficulties we are still unable to send our personnel for training in other CIS republics. Therefore, under the pressure of circumstances short courses have started to function in the GKNB, in which the students go through initial counterintelligence training. We are confident that life will force us to have our own full-fledged training base. Thus, military counterintelligence, the GKNB, as well as society on the whole, are living through difficult times, in which the resolution of small questions is transformed into problems that are difficult to overcome. [Razakov] Madalbek Moldashevich, we cannot avoid the traditional question: How did you end up being the chief of the directorate? [Moldashev] After receiving a special higher education in Novosibirsk and Moscow, I served for a long time in military counterintelligence. I took part in combat operations in Afghanistan for more than three years. I devoted many of my 45 years of life to intelligence work and pedagogical activity. Thus, I am a relatively new person in Kyrgyzstan, inasmuch as all my previous service was spent within the borders of the former state. In April 1992 I decided to return to the motherland and render as much assistance as possible to the formation of our own sovereign state. Taking into account my knowledge, professional and vital experience, and the practice of my previous service, the leadership of the GKNB entrusted me with the creation of a military counterintelligence structure, on whose formation I am working to this day.
