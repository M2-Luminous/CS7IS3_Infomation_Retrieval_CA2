Watch out -- you will also fall into that hole. This is the implication of a serious warning delivered by Police Commissioner General Johan van der Merwe this week to the ANC-controlled government over the planned Commission of Truth and Reconciliation. The commission's task is to hear confessions from "criminals" of the apartheid era. This could lead to top members of the ANC's National Executive Committee [NEC], as well as members of cabinet, being scorched as a result of terrorist activities during this period. This could be a big embarrassment for the ANC. RAPPORT is in possession of a harshly worded document in which General van der Merwe issues a stern warning to the government over the establishment of the planned commission. The general also deals sharp blows to the Goldstone Commission. According to him the Goldstone Commission has come forward with wild allegations against the security forces which still cannot be proven in a court of law. General van der Merwe also points out to government that the Skweyiya Commission of Inquiry warned back in August 1992 that "no one guilty of crimes should ever again be allowed to occupy an official post. If the ANC is not willing to take definite steps in this regard then the risk of repetition will always be present." Names The document, handed to Minister of Safety and Security Sydney Mufamadi on Wednesday, names among others Defense Minister Joe Modise, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale, Ministers Joe Slovo and Mac Maharaj, and Mr. Jacob Zuma, Mr. Siphiwe Nyanda, and Ronnie Kasrils as "the prominent members of the ANC implicated in certain acts of terror." The commissioner's document mentions a firm commitment to see to his men in the police service. The sharp words of warning to the government is regarded as an urgent attempt to defuse the explosive situation behind the scenes and to prevent any irresponsible actions. Certain former members of the disbanded security branch and serving members of the Criminal Investigation Department were involved in the struggle against the ANC under the old dispensation. All parties who participated in the struggle may be involved in the scuffle, to the embarrassment of all concerned, especially the current government of national unity. According to General van der Merwe, police investigations, evidence heard in court cases, as well as other available information, indicated that members of the ANC and Umkhonto we Sizwe [Spear of the Nation -- ANC military wing], involved in the gruesome violation of human rights, did this under the orders of the National Executive Committee of the ANC. Acts of Terrorism "During the 1976-1990 period at least 623 acts of sabotage, terrorism, murder, car bomb explosions, and landmine explosions can be directly linked to the ANC. In these acts of terrorism 153 people have died, 1,158 people were injured, and more than 20 million rands of damage caused." Some of the attackers were caught and charged but others hid outside the country's borders. In some cases there was overwhelming proof that certain acts of terrorism were carried out by senior members of the ANC's NEC abroad, or approved by them. "Today these individuals occupy senior positions in government," according to the document by General van der Merwe. (The implication is that they are occupying these positions in contradiction with the above mentioned quote by the Skweyiya Commission: "No person guilty of crimes ... should ever again be allowed to occupy an official post.") The commissioner mentions individual examples of the most gruesome cases: - 25 January 1980 -- Silverton bank siege; - 20 May 1983 -- Church Street bomb in Pretoria; - 3 April 1984 -- Durban car bomb; - 23 December 1985 -- Amanzimtoti bomb; - 9 January 1986 -- landmine explosion in Durban; - 14 June 1986 -- Durban car bomb; - Several landmine explosions in the rural areas of Transvaal during 1986; - 20 May 1987 -- landmine explosion at the Johannesburg Court; and - Several attacks in restaurants and shopping centers. Temporary Indemnity Members of the ANC's NEC are enjoying temporary indemnity until 17 May next year. If no amnesty is granted by 17 May then civil or criminal charges could be laid against alleged criminals. "The members of the NEC have never publicly apologized for the crimes they were responsible for. These people are, therefore, legally responsible for these acts even if it is just as accomplices, and in many cases as co-accused," says Gen. van der Merwe. He adds that it should be emphasized that not a single member of the ANC's NEC has thus far applied for indemnity, but have only been granted temporary indemnity from prosecution. "The Commission (of Truth and Reconciliation) will lead to further mistrust in the South African Police Services and an increase in acts of violence against its members. An atmosphere of mistrust will prevail, affecting prominent individuals occupying senior positions in government. Steps will have to be taken to ensure that the amnesty process is not politicized and does not result in renewed racial conflict and acts of terrorism." General Amnesty RAPPORT was told that before the elections, police officers, who insisted behind the scenes that government grant general amnesty, are waiting to see how the government reacts to the commissioner's report before further action is decided upon concerning the establishment of the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation. General van der Merwe's document also refers to the Douglas Commission and the Motsuenyane Commission, who both heard evidence on terrible violations of human rights committed by ANC members while they were outside the country's borders. "These violations of human rights include murder, serious attacks, and torture," according to the document. The names of Minister of Foreign Affairs Alfred Nzo, Mr. Joe Slovo, Mr. Modise, Mr. Kasrils, and Mr. Nhlanhla, implicated in the reports of the above-mentioned commissions, are mentioned.
