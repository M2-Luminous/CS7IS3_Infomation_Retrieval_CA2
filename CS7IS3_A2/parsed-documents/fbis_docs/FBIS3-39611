The Government move is a response to the United Nations request to help strengthen the peacekeeping operation in the Bosnian capital. But Britain backed away from intense pressure to send a mechanised battalion of at least 700 men with armoured personnel carriers. And in a thinly-veiled attack on the United States Administration, Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said it was time that other countries made "helpful contributions." He said that Britain, which has 2,400 troops on the ground, and France were the largest contributors to the UN operation in Bosnia. "It would not be appropriate to think that the UK should shoulder the burden by itself," he said. "It would not be thought fair and reasonable by the British public." Asked whether he would like to see the United States provide ground troops, he said: "It is important that all countries that can make an important contribution should seriously consider doing so. "All of those countries interested in a successful resolution of this operation should realise it is not reasonable to expect the burden to fall only on a small number of countries. "We hope that all countries that are able to assist will look positively at ways in which this can be done." Two companies of the Coldstream Guards will be moved from their base in Vitez to Sarajevo to help monitor Serb heavy weapons. A mortar-locating troop equipped with Cymbeline radar will be sent to Sarajevo along with an additional number of military liaison officers and observers. The 60-strong troop will be able to pinpoint precisely the source of any mortars that are fired during the ceasefire. However, Britain's response falls far short of the United Nations request for up to 3,000 troops, including two mechanised infantry battalions, six helicopters as well as specialised units. The initiative came from Lieutenant General Sir Michael Rose, the UN commander in Bosnia, who needed the extra forces to monitor the Sarajevo ceasefire and control Serb heavy weapons. He did not get all he wanted but Mr Rifkind today praised him on a "magnificent job" in achieving the longest ceasefire in Sarajevo since the conflict started two years ago. "The action we are now taking will help to establish the ceasefire more firmly and, as we all hope, achieve the demilitarisation of Sarajevo," he said. NATO has threatened air strikes against any artillery or heavy weapons around the Bosnian capital unless they are withdrawn at least 12 miles from the city or surrendered to the United Nations by midnight on Sunday [20 February]. Mr Rifkind will meet his American, French, Spanish, Italian and Dutch counterparts for urgent last-minute talks in Italy on Sunday -- just hours before the deadline expires. It is expected that U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry's aircraft will stop in Britain to pick up Mr Rifkind en route to the meeting, which will probably take place at NATO's southern region command headquarters in Naples. The government was under intense pressure to provide more forces but their decision was made easier when the other allies -- France, Holland and Spain -- all said they had already sent the maximum possible. Mr Rifkind said it was "encouraging" that some good progress had already been made with a number of Serb heavy weapons handed over to UN control. "At the moment it is looking quite encouraging but there is still a long way to go," he said. He was confident that Sir Michael would have the necessary number of troops in Sarajevo to monitor the heavy weapons. Large numbers of French troops have already been pulled in from elsewhere in the region and the extra British troops will make a significant impact on the operation. Sir Michael has made plain that Serb or Muslim troops attempting to win back control of their heavy weapons would have to "fight" for them. Mr Rifkind said that in such a situation British troops would be fully entitled to defend themselves under the UN mandate. The decision to send up to 300 Coldstream Guards to Sarajevo will inevitably limit the number of aid convoys that can be escorted through central Bosnia. But Mr Rifkind stressed that other nations should be able to provide forces to help that operation.
