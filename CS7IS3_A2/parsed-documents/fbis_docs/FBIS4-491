It said it had come to the attention of the IEC's Investigation Department, via reports from specialist monitors in the Western Cape, that temporary voter cards were in some instances being retained by farmers on behalf of their workers. This also appeared to be the practice among some employers in the Western Cape. According to Advocate [Lawyer] Nicholas Tee, national co-ordinator of the IEC's Investigation Department, the IEC would investigate any complaints lodged by any workers who alleged their cards had been retained by their employers against their will. "The practice of retaining temporary voter cards and id documents for employees is injudicious. If it is found to have occurred without the consent of the worker, prosecution in terms of the Electoral Act and prescribed regulations will follow immediately," the IEC said.
