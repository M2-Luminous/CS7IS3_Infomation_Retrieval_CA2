During these meetings, they discussed support for the council, which so far does not have a budget. Brussels recently hosted a seminar about the future of democracy and growth in the post-peace age in the Middle East in which a number of Palestinian figures participated, including the Palestinian intellectual, Professor Edward Sa'id. During the seminar, our correspondent in Brussels Nur-al-Din al-Faridi met with Antoine Zahlan, Palestinian economic expert specializing in development affairs, and asked him how prepared the Palestinian side is to develop the economy of the occupied territories. [Begin recording] [Zahlan] Many studies have been conducted inside the occupied territories on numerous projects for villages and towns in Palestine. All these studies were prepared on different aspects. However, there were no funds to implement the projects. Now many of these studies are being looked at again, and the World Bank and EU have gathered this information and are reviewing it. They are now making proposals on financing the implementation of these projects. However, our council so far does not have the appropriate bodies to study these projects. [Al-Faridi] What is the budget of the Council for Construction and Development? [Zahlan] Currently nothing, since we have not had any assistance to start implementing it. Therefore, most of our work comes from the contributions of individuals. [Al-Faridi] Is it right for you to start discussing issues of regional cooperation with Jordan and Egypt and some transportation links with Israel, for example, while the political agreement has not yet been implemented and the promised international contributions have not arrived yet? [Zahlan] With regard to the council, it is not holding any negotiations with Israel for cooperation on its work. Its speciality is to transfer international, Arab, and Palestinian aid for specific goals that might serve Palestinian society and help it integrate once again with its neighbors, the Arab countries. Our duty is to reunite the Palestinian economy with its neighbors. [end recording]
