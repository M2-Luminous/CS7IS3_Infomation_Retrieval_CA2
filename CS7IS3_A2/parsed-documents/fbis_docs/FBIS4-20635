Muranaka, H. Yamashsita, and H. Miyadera of Hitachi Research Laboratory, Hitachi Ltd., 7-1-1 Oomika-cho, Hitachi-shi, Ibaraki-ken, 319-12, Japan] [Text] Abstract Recent trends in low temperature growth of diamond films (LTGD) were reviewed. LTGD can be classified into non substrate-heating processes and substrate heating processes. In non substrate-heating processes, room temperature growth of diamond has been demonstrated by sputtering, rf plasma, and laser excitation methods. However, film quality has still not been quantitatively analyzed. In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline diamond growth has been confirmed at substrate temperature between 80 and 135�C by microwave plasma of both CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] systems, electron cyclotron resonance plasma of C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], Ar, He] systems, and tantalum filament decomposition of the CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system. Source gases providing oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase were found to be suitable for LTGD because these species suppress the inclusion of amorphous components and the degradation of crystallinity which are likely to occur at low substrate temperature. The lowest substrate temperature for synthesis of diamond films with the same crystallinity as natural diamond is about 400�C. Film quality deteriorated below 400�C, which may be due to the incorporations of H, O, and OH from the gas phase into the diamond films. Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.1 �m/h near 400�C, and 0.035 and 0.3 �m/h at 130�C. Growth rates can be accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas inert gases have a possibility of deteriorating film quality. Introduction Low temperature growth of diamond films (LTGD) is a critical point if diamond applications are to be extended to semiconductors, optical emitting materials, optical and mechanical coating materials, and heat sinks. Diamond chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has been conventionally realized at substrate temperatures (Ts) between 800 and 1,000�C. Diamond growth at Ts lower than 800�C has recently been realized by a variety of processes and gas systems.[.sup]1-46[/] Microwave plasma,[.sup]1-2,7,12,15,21-24,28,30,38-41,43[/] ECR plasma,[.sup]3-4,11,18,20,26-27,42,44-45[/] direct current (DC) plasma,[.sup]6,14,34[/] radio frequency (RF) plasma,[.sup]13,16,19,36[/] hot filament,[.sup]5,8,17,25,29,31-32,35,37-38[/] laser decomposition,[.sup]9,46[/] and graphite sputtering[.sup]10[/] methods have been applied to synthesis of polycrystalline diamond films. In this paper, development trends in LTGD are discussed from the viewpoints of both processes and source gas systems with specific reference to the roles of atomic hydrogen and oxygen for high quality diamond synthesis. Conditions for a suitable environment for LTGD are clarified. Additionally, limitations to high quality diamond film synthesis are investigated by comparing both the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of diamond Raman lines and growth rates of previously reported samples. Difficulties in LTGD Figure 1 [not reproduced] shows macro Raman spectra and SEM images of samples (1)-(3) prepared on a silicon substrate using the microwave plasma of the conventional CO[7%]-H[.sub]2[/] system at Ts between 130 and 750�C. FWHM of these samples were obtained from high resolution macro Raman analyses. Details of the experimental procedure are shown in reference 40. Surface morphology with a columnar polycrystalline structure was seen for sample (1). Crystallite size dropped on lowering Ts; it dropped from 0.54-1.5 �m [sample (1)] to 0.15-0.46 �m [sample (2)]. By contrast, sample (3) had a totally different crystalline phase, consisting of amorphous-like particles with diameters of 0.1-0.26 �m. These white-looking particles did not adhere to the silicon substrate; they were easily scratched off, even by a thin paper. A sharp diamond Raman line was seen for sample (1) (grown at 750�C) with a broad peak near 1450 cm[.sup]-1[/] originating from amorphous hydrogenated carbon in a polyacetylene structure.[.sup]47[/] The diamond Raman line decreased in intensity on lowering Ts, and it was hidden in the polyacetylene peak at 130�C [sample (3)]. This indicated that diamond growth was suppressed at low Ts, while amorphous component deposition was enhanced, which is in agreement with findings from SEM observations. FWHM broadened on reducing Ts (6.4 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 750�C, 8.3 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 403�C, 19.5 cm[.sup]-1[/] at 130�C) suggesting that low temperature growth caused a deterioration of crystallinity, specifically at 130�C. Difficulties with low temperature growth have been clarified as enhancement of amorphous component production and degradation of crystallinity. These points must be overcome to realize synthesis of high quality diamond films at low Ts. In spite of these difficulties, high quality films have been recently obtained at Ts below 800�C. Trends of LTGD Figures 2 and 3 [figures not reproduced] show thermocouple measurements of Ts against reported years in terms of processes and gas systems employed for LTGD, respectively. Ts is defined as the temperature required for the synthesis of polycrystallites or polycrystalline films in a cubic diamond structure, and the plotted Ts is the lowest temperature attempted in each reference. According to Figures 2 and 3, LTGD methods can be classified into [A] non substrate-heating processes and [B] substrate-heating processes (RTG: Room Temperature Growth). The first RTG was demonstrated by graphite sputtering using either an ion beam of Ar or hydrogen in 1985.[.sup]10[/] Subsequently, RTG was confirmed using ArF excimer laser decomposition of C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]2[/] diluted with H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]9[/] and rf plasma of a CH[.sub]4[/]-Ar system.[.sup]13[/] Rebello and Subramaniam have reported RTG at high growth rates [5-10 �m/h] using ArF excimer laser reactions in a CO-H[.sub]2[/] system;[.sup]46[/] they confirmed the growth of well-defined diamond crystallites by SEM and Raman spectra. LTGD by the substrate-heating processes has been attempted since 1982 when high quality films were prepared by the filament assisted decomposition of a CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system at 610�C.[.sup]5[/] LTGD at 430�C was reported by the microwave plasma (MP) of the same CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]24[/] in 1989. Recently, high quality films were synthesized at 130�C using MP of a CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]40[/] and at 140�C by dc plasma of the CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]6[/] The tungsten filament decomposition of the CH[.sub]4[/](1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system[.sup]17[/] has also been verified as a primary method for LTGD (Ts = 130�C). And 80-100�C growth of diamond has been presented by ECR plasma, suggesting the possibility of RTG.[.sup]45[/] According to Figure 3, the above LTGD, for [B] substrate-heating processes, was achieved using a number of oxygen-containing gas systems and the CH[.sub]4[/](<5%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. These particular gas systems have a little oxygen or a large amount of atomic hydrogen present in their gas phases; both of which contribute to suppression of the decay of film quality occurring at low Ts mentioned before. The Roles of Atomic Hydrogen and Oxygen in LTGD Reported Ts is plotted against CH[.sub]4[/] concentration ([CH[.sub]4[/]]) in Figure 4 [not reproduced] using data from a number of references.[.sup]2,4,5-8,10-11,14-17,20,23,34,37,38[/] Only 600�C growth was reported when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was 10 percent. At low [CH[.sub]4[/]], diamond synthesis is possible in a much more extensive Ts region; 300-980�C ([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 5 percent), and 135-1040�C ([CH[.sub]4[/]] = 1 percent). This implies that an atmosphere with low CH[.sub]4[/] concentration is suitable for LTGD. The necessity of low [CH[.sub]4[/]] for LTGD has also been pointed out by Ihara et al.[.sup]17[/] They carried out 135�C growth with tantalum filament CVD using CH[.sub]4[/][0.4-5%]-H[.sub]2[/] systems. The diamond grew at Ts between 300 and 700�C when [CH[.sub]4[/]] was 3 percent, and well-defined polycrystallites could be synthesized at Ts between 135 and 700�C at [CH[.sub]4[/]] ranging from 0.4 to 1 percent. One reason for this success of LTGD was suggested to be due to high filament temperature (2300�C) providing excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase. Through two-photon excited LIF studies, atomic hydrogen concentration [H] was found to decrease by a factor of 0.5 when [CH[.sub]4[/]] increased from 0 to 5 percent in a filament-assisted CVD system.[.sup]48[/] This was also confirmed by others.[.sup]49[/] On the other hand, to know the effect of [CH[.sub]4[/]] on [H] in the plasma-assisted CVD system, we adopted plasma emission actinometry[.sup]50-51[/] using Ar as an actinometer. Figure 5 [not reproduced] shows IH/IAr against [CH[.sub]4[/]] in a low output microwave plasma CVD system,[.sup]39-41[/] where IH and IAr are optical emission intensities of H_a_ (6563 Angstroms) and Ar (7504 Angstroms), respectively. IH/IAr was suggested to be in proportion to [H].[.sup]51[/] Figure 5 clearly shows a steep increase of IH/IAr with lowering [CH[.sub]4[/]], implying that low [CH[.sub]4[/]] provides an excess atomic hydrogen environment. The above convincing results showing the increase of [H] with [CH[.sub]4[/]] reduction in both filament-assisted and plasma-assisted CVD systems have led to the conclusion that recent success with LTGD at low [CH[.sub]4[/]] in Figure 4 may relate to a large amount of atomic hydrogen in the gas phase. According to Figure 3, oxygen-containing gas systems have been frequently employed for LTGD. Focusing on the roles of oxygen, Ts was plotted as a function of O/C in Figure 6 [not reproduced] using data in previous references[.sup]1-4,7,11,16,18-22,24-27,38-45[/] where various plasmas of oxygen-containing gas systems were adopted. It can be said that lower temperature growth is possible in such gas systems with higher values of O/C. Specifically, LTGD at Ts lower than 400�C was confirmed in CO-H[.sub]2[/], CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/], CH[.sub]4[/]-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/], CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/], and C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/] systems. Among these, LTGD at Ts between 100 and 130�C (presently the lowest level) was demonstrated in CO-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/] CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/],[.sup]40[/] and CH[.sub]3[/]OH-H[.sub]2[/][.sup]45[/] systems. Figure 7 [not reproduced] indicates IH/IAr as a function of O/C atomic ratio in a low output microwave plasma CVD system[.sup]39-41[/] for a number of conventionally employed gas combinations. An increase of IH/IAr occurred on multiplying the O/C atomic ratio, which was also observed by others.[.sup]52[/] This may be because oxygen inhibits surface recombinations of atomic hydrogen occurring on the cold quartz wall.[.sup]51[/] These facts in Figures 6-7 indicate that oxygen-containing gas systems providing an excess atomic hydrogen atmosphere are also suitable for LTGD. As mentioned in the previous section, LTG caused an enhancement of amorphous component deposition, resulting in both the suppression of diamond growth and degradation of crystallinity. The key roles of atomic hydrogen in diamond growth have been frequently discussed, including etching of amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon,[.sup]15[/] suppression of amorphous hydrogenated carbon formation in a polyacetylene structure,[.sup]47[/] etc. All these functions may contribute to prevention of non-crystalline phase deposition which is likely to occur at low Ts, resulting in selective growth of diamond. Other than the currently observed increase of C[H], the roles of oxygen have also been suggested as follows: etching of amorphous components,[.sup]40[/] inhibition of carbon � bonding at the surface,[.sup]53[/] improvement of crystallinity,[.sup]40,43[/] suppression of impurity incorporation.[.sup]54-55[/] These functions are considered to be effective for the prevention of both amorphous component production in diamond films and the deterioration of crystallinity, resulting in synthesis of high quality films even at low Ts. From the above discussion on the roles of atomic hydrogen and oxygen, we can draw the conclusion that an atmosphere containing excess atomic hydrogen and a small amount of oxygen is suitable for LTGD. Limitation of Substrate Temperature for High Quality Diamond Films FWHM values of diamond Raman lines for previously reported samples[.sup]5,18,20,27-38,40-42[/] are plotted against Ts in Figure 8 [not reproduced]. Since only a few data are presented at low Ts (<500�C),[.sup]40[/], it is difficult to determine a limit of Ts. For the time being, it can be said that the limit of Ts for synthesis of diamond films with almost the same crystallinity as natural diamond (FWHM = 3.0 cm[.sup]-1[/]) is near 400�C.[.sup]40[/] We employed a low output microwave (80W) plasma of the CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] system. FWHM of synthesized films at 411�C was 4.0 cm[.sup]-1[/].[.sup]40[/] FWHM of the films synthesized below 400�C broadened to 10-20 cm[.sup]-1[/],[.sup]40[/] indicating that 400�C is a critical temperature to determine the quality of diamond films. The reason for the degradation of crystallinity at 130�C[.sup]40[/] (Figure 8) may relate to the gas systems employed (we employed both CO[8%]-O[.sub]2[/](2.2%)-H[.sub]2[/] and CO(7%)-H[.sub]2[/] systems in reference 40). It has been recently clarified by XPS studies that oxygen inclusion in diamond films occurred at low Ts.[.sup]45[/] Atomic hydrogen, atomic oxygen, and OH radicals produced in the gas phase of oxygen-based gas systems (alcohol, acetone, alcohol and water) are incorporated in diamond films.[.sup]56[/] Additionally, cathodoluminescence (noted as CL) studies have indicated the possibility of oxygen incorporation in diamond films synthesized in the microwave plasma of the CH[.sub]4[/](0.5%)-O[.sub]2[/](0.1%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]57[/] All these findings suggest that one reason for crystallinity deterioration seen at low Ts (<400�C) in Figure 8 may be oxygen incorporation in diamond films. Growth Rates Growth rates (Vg) are plotted against Ts in Figure 9 [not reproduced]. Vg necessarily depends on processes, gas systems, carbon source gas concentration, etc. Roughly speaking, Vg ranges from 0.01 to 0.2 �m/h near 400�C, and 0.035 to 0.3 �m/h near 130�C. The enhancement of diamond growth at low Ts is an attractive topic. We have reported that Vg was accelerated by a factor of 2-5 with the addition of 4 percent Ar to a CO-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]39[/] The metastable Ar atoms were suggested to collide with gas phase species and promote their excitation and decomposition, resulting in the enhancement of diamond growth.[.sup]39[/] The increase of growth rate by argon has also been recently reported by comparison of Vg for C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-H[.sub]2[/], C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-Ar, and C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH(25%)-He systems.[.sup]45[/] However, we have found that a large amount of Ar addition causes silicon incorporation or vacancy formation in diamond films due to collisions of high energy Ar atoms with the quartz wall, silicon substrate, and growth surface, consequently deteriorating film quality. According to our recent studies, cauliflower-like microcrystallites were seen by SEM, and the intensity of the GR1 band (CL) increased for the film grown in a CO(4%)-Ar(9.7%)-H[.sub]2[/] system.[.sup]58[/] Remarkably, much higher growth rates have been obtained by multiphoton excitation of CO (X[.sup]1[/] _s_[.sup]+[/] a[.sup]3[/] �) diluted with H[.sub]2[/] by ArF (193 nm) laser.[.sup]46[/] Well-defined diamond crystallites with diameters of 5-10 �m were synthesized per hour at room temperature, which means a significantly high growth rate of 5-10 �m/h. This is an exceptional and promising result deviating from conventional data shown in the hatched region of Figure 9. Conclusion Recent trends in LTGD were reviewed and the following results were obtained. (1) LTGD could be classified into non substrate-heating (room temperature growth) and substrate-heating processes. (2) In non substrate-heating processes, room temperature growth was confirmed by graphite sputtering with a hydrogen ion beam, radio frequency plasma of the CH[.sub]4[/]/Ar system, and ArF excimer laser excitation of the CO-H[.sub]2[/] system. (3) In non substrate-heating processes, diamond film quality has not been quantitatively estimated yet, as by FWHM analyses of diamond Raman lines. However, well-defined crystallites with a sharp diamond Raman line were found to be synthesized at room temperature by ArF excimer laser CVD using the CO-H[.sub]2[/] system. (4) In substrate-heating processes, polycrystalline diamond film growth was confirmed at 130�C by microwave plasma of both CO-H[.sub]2[/] and CO-O[.sub]2[/]-H[.sub]2[/] systems, 80-100�C by ECR plasmas of C[.sub]2[/]H[.sub]5[/]OH-[H[.sub]2[/], He, Ar] systems, and 135�C by filament decomposition of the CH[.sub]4[/]-H[.sub]2[/] system. (5) Gas systems providing oxygen and excess atomic hydrogen in the gas phase are suitable for LTGD in substrate-heating processes. (6) In substrate-heating processes, the lowest Ts for the growth of films with almost the same crystallinity as natural diamond is about 400�C. The crystallinity deteriorates below 400�C, which may be due to defect production caused by incorporations of gaseous species such as H, O, and OH into diamond films. (7) Growth rates are between 0.01 and 0.2 �m/h near 400�C, and 0.035 and 0.3 �m/h at 130�C. Growth rates can be accelerated by Ar or He additions to source gas, whereas inert gases have the possibility of deteriorating film quality. Finally, there are few data regarding physical, chemical, and semiconducting properties of low temperature growth films. Analyses of these properties are necessary to extend applications to practical use. References 1. C. P. Chang, D. L. Flamm, D. E. Ibbotson, and J. A. Mucha, J. Appl. Phys., 63 (1988) 1744. 2. Y.
