[passage omitted] Among other things, he stressed that extensive diplomatic activities were under way to simultaneously resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and reintegrate the UN protected areas into the Croatian legal system and to ensure that the sanctions against Serbia are linked to the progress in the talks on the UN pretected areas. He described the Vienna talks on the implementation of the Washington agreement as extremely important. He also mentioned, as he put it, good relations between Croatia and its neighboring European countries, and in particular with the United States, and went on to stress that the international political and financial support to Croatia depended to a considerable extent on the implementation of the Washington agreement. He said that the attempt to destabilize the Croatian parliament had somewhat affected Croatia's international position. [Begin Granic recording] Foreign countries would certainly welcome a negotiated solution. The deepening of the crisis will certainly not benefit anyone and will be to the detriment of the Republic of Croatia. [end recording] During the question time, Mate Granic said Croatia would definitely not extend the UN Protection Force's mandate unless it deployed its forces on Croatian borders with Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina to prevent armed provocations and ethnic cleansing.
