FR941202-0-00047 FR941202-0-00005 14 CFR Part 39 [Docket No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;26&hyph;AD; Amendment 39&hyph;9076; AD 94&hyph;24&hyph;03] Airworthiness Directives; McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 Series Airplanes, KC&hyph;10A (Military) Airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;11 Series Airplanes AGENCY: Federal Aviation Administration, DOT. ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This amendment adopts a new airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10&hyph;10, &hyph;15, &hyph;30, and &hyph;40 series airplanes, KC&hyph;10A (military) airplanes, and Model MD&hyph;11 series airplanes, that requires the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. This amendment is prompted by an analysis conducted by the manufacturer, which revealed that failure of a lateral control mixer bracket could result in uncommanded deployment of the spoiler. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent inadvertent asymmetric deployment of the spoiler, which may lead to reduced controllability of the airplane. DATES: Effective January 3, 1995. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of January 3, 1995. ADDRESSES: The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from McDonnell Douglas Corporation, P.O. Box 1771, Long Beach, California 90801&hyph;1771, Attention: Business Unit Manager, Technical Administrative Support, Department L51, M.C. 2&hyph;98.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 39) to include an airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;10 and MD&hyph;11 series airplanes series airplanes was published in the Federal Register on June 7, 1994 (59 FR 29391). That action proposed to require the installation of retainers and supports at the lateral control mixer bracket on the center of the wing rear spar of the airplane. Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comments received. Two commenters support the proposal. Several commenters request that the compliance time for installing the spoiler mixer bracket retainers be extended from the proposed 12 months to 18 or 24 months. These commenters state that such an extension will allow operators to accomplish the installations during a regularly scheduled heavy maintenance visit. This will reduce the impact of non&hyph;scheduled maintenance and removal of aircraft from service, and prevent the consequent inconvenience to the traveling public. The commenters point out that safety will not be compromised by extending the compliance time, since the repetitive inspections of the mixer bracket assembly at intervals of 1,500 cycles, as are currently required by AD 92&hyph;16&hyph;03, will maintain the structural integrity of the mixer bracket assembly in the interim.
