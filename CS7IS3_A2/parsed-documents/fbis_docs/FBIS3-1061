He was commenting on a report in the latest issue of the WEEKLY MAIL & GUARDIAN that Deputy Police Commissioner Lt-Gen Basie Smit was at the heart of an investigation by the Goldstone Commission into a major gun-running operation by senior SAP officers. According to the newspaper, the commission's report could contain the hardest evidence to date of an organised third force within the security forces. Gen van der Merwe said in a statement: "I am aware that Judge Goldstone is conducting an investigation into allegations that senior members of the SAP are involved in acts of violence and gun-running. However, according to my knowledge, these allegations are not in any way related to drug-trafficking. "Personally I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any senior member of the SAP is involved in such illegal activities." He said although he was aware of certain allegations being investigated by the Goldstone Commission against Gen Smit, he was convinced any proper investigation would clear him and that his honour and professional reputation would "emerge unblemished from this episode". "I have already urgently requested the Goldstone Commission in writing to hold a comprehensive public inquiry into this matter. It is a matter of the greatest possible importance to both the SA Police and the future of the judicial system that this matter be dealt with in such a manner that justice is seen to be done and that the basic principles of justice are strictly adhered to," Gen van der Merwe said.
