Over the past 14 years, Shenzhen's transport and telecom industry has kept up with the pace of its fast-increasing economy. In 1993, the city planned 224 major projects for transportation and telecommunications, with a total investment of 2.43 billion yuan plus 72.8 million U.S. dollars. The gross volume for freight transportation handled in 1993 topped 7.4 billion tons/km, and over 4.7 billion persons/km for passenger transport, sturdy rises of 36.3 percent and 16.6 percent from the previous year, respectively. The transit of passengers by air hit 2.55 million people, an increase of 53.5 percent. The total output value of the posts and telecommunications sector jumped by 47.5 percent to 1.74 billion yuan. Shenzhen also gained ground in infrastructural construction, including the building of an airport, seaports, highways and railways. Port construction such as that on Yantian Port also gained momentum last year. The first phase of the Yantian Port construction, an overseas-funded project with a total investment of nearly four billion yuan, is now in its final stage. And the contract for the second phase also has been signed. So far, the roadbed for the Meilin-Guanlan Expressway has been completed, and the northern section of the district's fast ring road has been opened to traffic. The construction of another expressway from Shenzhen airport to Heao is expected to be started soon, while that of the Guangzhou-Shenzhen Expressway is in its final stage. The city also set up five new district telephone exchange branches and about 10 post offices in 1993. It also built and expanded 31 wireless telephone stations last year. Now in Shenzhen, there are 38 bus-lines, over one thousand buses and some 20,000 taxi cabs. The city airport has opened 47 air routes to 46 big cities. According to a city transportation official, the city government is planning to build Shenzhen into an international passenger and freight transportation hub. He says the focus will be on establishment of some trans- professional, trans-regional and transnational transport and telecommunications group companies to boost the booming industry. The official predicts that the passenger and freight transportation this year will rise to 112.3 million people and 23 million tons respectively. The port throughput in 1994 will double the figure of 25.4 million tons last year. The total output value in the posts and telecommunications sector is expected to hit over two billion yuan this year, says the official.
