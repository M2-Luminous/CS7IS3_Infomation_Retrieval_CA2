Ignoring China's vehement objections, he published the bill in the government gazette, less than 24 hours after the Legislative Council approved the first phase of his reform plans. Publication immediately sent the local stock exchange plunging, with the Hang Seng index down nearly five percent at the opening, pushing it below the 10,000 point level for the first time in three months. It had already fallen 3.1 percent Thursday following the Legislative Council's approval of the first phase with investors worried by the worsening Sino-British relations. China told Britain Thursday that the door was now firmly closed on negotiations and said it would scrap whatever political system Britain put in place when it resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. The latest reform bill, which must be adopted by July, will dramatically extend the voting franchise so that all 2.7 million Hong Kong workers can elect people to 30 seats in the legislature reserved for special interest groups. "This will broaden the franchise for the commercial, industrial, finance and financial services, real estate and construction, tourism, social services, and labour functional constituencies," a government spokesman said. He said the bill would be introduced in the Legislative Council on March 9. China has also expressed its anger over Britain 's publication of a 36-page White Paper on why seven months of negotiatons with China on Hong Kong's poltical future collapsed in November. Beijing has promised "due action" in return, but has not specified what this will be. In the White Paper -- of which 200,000 copies are being distributed in Hong Kong -- Britain alleged that China had refused to clarify whether it would retroactively apply a ban on legislators it considered were involved in "undermining the socialist system in the mainland."
