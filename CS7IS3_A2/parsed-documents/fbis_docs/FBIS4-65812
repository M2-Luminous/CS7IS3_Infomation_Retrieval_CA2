The government needs you. However, it cannot do everything. You must make your contribution to building this new society to which we all aspire." In his first visit to the Antilles, Edouard Balladur launched an appeal to all the inhabitants of overseas departments to take direct control of their future by developing their economies. [passage omitted] Under the dome of the Regional Council, Lucette Michaux-Chevry [president of the Guadeloupe Regional Council] (she has been away from Paris for three weeks and some observers said she was on bad terms with the government) argued in favor of a greater solidarity effort from the state to help the overseas departments and, like all the deputies present, expressed the desire for better cooperation between the state and Guadeloupe, a "frank and active partnership based on mutual respect." Large Amounts of Aid This is the message the prime minister echoed. "The state will support you by encouraging you to exercise your local responsibilities. Moreover, the state is at your side every time Guadeloupe experiences problems. I am anxious that the state should honor the pledges made in 1989 following Hurricane Hugo. To this end, a sum of 30 million francs [Fr] has been allocated for economic recovery. The remaining Fr75 million for rebuilding public buildings will be allocated very shortly." These are not the only measures that he was to announce. For instance, state funds for Guadeloupe will increase from Fr589 million to Fr824 million in the 11th Plan. The state will devote Fr285 million to the funding of major port, airport, and road facilities. Guadeloupe's social policy will be strengthened with an allocation of FR122 million; FR326 million will go to agriculture. Finally, a package of Fr89 million will be allocated for environmental protection. "The state," Mr. Balladur stressed, "is ready to cooperate out with you on economic development and a more united society." Explaining the bill drawn up by Dominique Perben [the minister for overseas departments and territories] to combat unemployment more effectively in the DOM [overseas departements], he continued: "We want to encourage the DOM to develop their economies. We want to compensate for the financial handicaps of remoteness, insularity, and the small market size. If we are able to use its potential, this bill should make it possible to increase the activities available to those in job creation programs by two-thirds in two or three years. This ambitious project is costly. National solidarity will pay for the reform of the job creation program. Employment aid measures will have an annual cost of over Fr1 billion." This cost will be funded partly by the increase in overseas departments of VAT on products which are not essential. This is a measure which has not been well received here but which the prime minister regards as necessary. This plan, he argued, "is an opportunity for the overseas departements. It is an opportunity which Guadeloupe must not waste." Before continuing his visit to Les Saintes and relaxing on the beach, Mr. Balladur stressed the need to achieve unity to jointly take up the "challenge of the new society."
