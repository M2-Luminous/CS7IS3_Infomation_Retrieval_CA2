Individuals who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TDD) may call the Federal Information Relay Service (FIRS) at 1&hyph;800&hyph;877&hyph;8339 between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m., Eastern time, Monday through Friday. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Part 403 The regulations amending part 403 affect the State Vocational and Applied Technology Education Program, which assists States in conducting directly, or through awards to local recipients, vocational education programs. The amendments implement provisions that make consortia of eligible institutions, as defined in 34 CFR 403.117(a), eligible to receive funds under the Postsecondary and Adult Vocational Education Programs (§§403.116 (b) and (c) and 403.118 (a), (b), (c)(1), (4) and (5)), describe the conditions that must be met by consortia operating joint projects (§403.116(d)), and make conforming changes (§§403.32(b)(4), 403.120, and 403.193). Parts 405 and 406 The regulations amending parts 405 and 406 affect the National Tech-Prep Education Program and the State-Administered Tech-Prep Education Program that provide for sequences of study leading to a two-year associate degree or a two-year certificate and that provide strong comprehensive links between secondary schools and postsecondary educational institutions. The amendments to parts 405 and 406 implement provisions that allow for tech-prep programs to begin in either the ninth or eleventh grades (§§405.1, 405.3(a), 406.1(a), and 406.3(b)(2)), and require that special consideration be given to applications that, among other things, are developed in consultation with business, industry, labor unions, and institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees (§§405.20(e)(2) and 406.10(b)(2)(ii)). Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking In accordance with section 431(b)(2)(A) of the General Education Provisions Act (20 U.S.C. 1232(b)(2)(A)), and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), it is the practice of the Secretary to offer interested parties the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations. However, these amendments merely incorporate congressionally mandated statutory changes into the regulations and do not establish substantive policy. Therefore, the Secretary has determined, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B), that public comment on the regulations is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest. Intergovernmental Review This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive order is to foster an intergovernmental partnership and strengthened federalism by relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordination and review of proposed Federal financial assistance. In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide early notification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.
