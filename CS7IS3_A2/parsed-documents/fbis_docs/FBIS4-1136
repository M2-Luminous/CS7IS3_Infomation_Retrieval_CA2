IEC Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler told a press briefing in Johannesburg the commission would set up voting stations at hostels on April 27 and 28. IEC Monitoring Director Peter Harris said an additional 1.2 million temporary voter cards had been sent to the Transkei for voters in outlying areas. About 1.3 million cards had been issued so far, he said. Mr Harris said the IEC had held "a successful election dummy run" to see if it was ready for the real event. About 11,000 monitors had been deployed at voting stations countrywide between 4AM and 9AM. The aim had been to see if the commission could get its monitors in the field, he said. The trial had been successful, although there were some transport and telecommunication problems in a few regions. The reaction time in Natal had been slow, but would improve. Some retraining of monitors was necessary, he added. The IEC has received an additional R1.4 million [rand] from the Norwegian Government for voter education programmes in Natal, in conjunction with the United States-based South Africa Free Election Fund, which has deployed 25,000 [figure as received] monitors in the field, at Home Affairs offices and at magistrate's courts. Mr Justice Kriegler said it was doubtful if voter education in Natal would reach the same level as elsewhere in the country.
