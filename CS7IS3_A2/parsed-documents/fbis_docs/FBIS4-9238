At the beginning Mr. Selami read a message for the press which says that: "Practically, Albania has embarked on one of the most significant stages of the economic reform, that of profound privatization, full liberalization of prices, as well as preparation of vouchers. [passage omitted] The very tense situation in former Yugoslavia is also being doubled with the provocative acts of Greece, practically current leader in turn of the European Union. The April 10 incident, the gravest of the latest ones, is part of the policy pursued by certain circles of influence in the Greek Government. There are circles in Greece which base their policy with Albania on Hellenism, and this is dangerous. The military provocations, the antihuman stand against the Albanian emigrants, the stance towards Cameria, the anti-Albanian propaganda, the policy of preventing Albania's integration into the international community, a policy which has been applied for several times by Greece, testify to that Hellenizing policy of likely consequences for all the Balkans," Selami's message for the press says. Asked about the effectiveness of coalition and remarks in its regard, Mr. Selami said that the DP [Democratic Party] stands loyal to coalition because it has yielded positive results both in the victory of March 22 elections and later. Coalition, Mr. Selami said, is dynamic therefore the demands of the SDP [Social Democratic Party] and RP [Republican Party] have been reasonable. We have discussed them and have been successful in resolving our problems. But, naturally, there are things in the coalition we do not agree upon, something quite normal. But I want to stress once again that we favour coalition and this is also in favour of democracy, Mr. Selami confirmed. In response to a question on outlawing the CPA [Communist Party of Albania], the DP secretary general, Tritan Shehu, said that in Albania not only the CP but also the fascist party is illegal, as there is likeness between each other as regards crimes at the expense of the people. Asked about the Greek Government's responsibility for the April 10 incident, Mr. Selami said that "the stand maintained by the Greek Government does not release it from responsibility because the band has come from the Greek territory and has fled in the same direction. We uphold that it has been a terrorist act, and under international standards, it bears responsibility for not pronouncing itself about the incident." Asked about statements on the Albanians as a destabilizing factor in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], Mr. Selami answered that such statements are uttered by circles really interested in Macedonia's destabilization, as a very sensitive region in the Balkan crisis. "We consider the Albanian factor in Macedonia as a factor of stability and believe that the resolution of the Albanians' question in Macedonia is a matter of concern not only for the region but also for Macedonia itself." Regarding DP's relations with the right front of the Albanian political parties, whose idea is being propagated in the press of this parties, the DP chairman said that creation of new parties and alliances in pluralism is quite normal. "We maintain a clear cut stand towards the extreme right, which we disassociated from the party in our latest assembly." Regarding the possibility of cooperation of the DP with the Italian right which has come to power in Italy, Mr. Selami said that "we have always been in favour of close relations with Italy. We have hailed the victory of the right of center in Italy because we consider it as a facility to cooperate with parties of the same political spectre. We have asked contact with Berlusconi and demanded close relations not only at party level but at governmental one."
