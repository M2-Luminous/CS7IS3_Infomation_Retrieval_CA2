The project, which has cost the government NT [new Taiwan] $6 billion (US$222.22 million) since it started four years ago, has successfully developed the technology used in the manufacture of 16- megabyte dynamic random-access memory chips and four-megabyte static random-access memory chips. "Transferring the hard-won technology to a private company would be the best approach to get back the research funds," an official with the Industrial Development Bureau (IDB) said. According to the proposal presented by the IDB, the state-of-the-art technology, together with an experimental integrated-circuit factory in the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park, will be transferred to a new privately run company, in which the government will have a 49 percent stake. Local enterprises are welcome to bid to take the remaining 51 percent stake in the company, the IDB official said, adding that prospective investors are required to submit their bids before June 30. All the bidders will be judged by not only bidding prices but their management and marketing plans, as well as their financial status, according to the official. The evaluation will be completed in early September. A joint-venture agreement will be signed within a month after the winning bid is made public on Sept. 8.
