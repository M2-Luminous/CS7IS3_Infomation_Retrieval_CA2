Momcilo Krajisnik on Monday said the renewed air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions on Monday were a disastrous move on the part of the United Nations, which he said had greatly exceeded its authority and assigned NATO the task out of a wish to aid the Bosnian Muslims in their offensive in the area of Gorazde. "We had proposed that the war stop on all of Bosnia-Herzegovina territory, but the proposal was not upheld by either the Muslims or the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), but, quite the contrary, the Muslim offensive was tolerated and (Bosnian) Serb positions were air raided," Krajisnik said on Belgrade's Politika TV. The Muslim side in late March launched a strong offensive on Bosnian Serb positions from Gorazde, a Muslim enclave which should have been demilitarized last spring as a U.N.-proclaimed "safe area." around 10,000 Muslim troops were massed for the offensive. Krajisnik said that the Serb side countered the Muslim offensive because it was provoked and because the Muslims used the "safe area," which has not territorially been defined, "as a source of war" in eastern Bosnia. The R.S. assembly president said that UNPROFOR had for no reason at all violated the U.N. charter and its mandate in Bosnia- Herzegovina, and instead of censuring the Muslims had "completely sided with the Serb enemies." Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership was following the situation and that it had requested of the United Nations to say who had ordered the air strikes. Krajisnik said that the R.S. leadership would decide on its further action and contacts with UNPROFOR, which he said had been frozen for the time being, only upon receiving an answer from the United Nations.
