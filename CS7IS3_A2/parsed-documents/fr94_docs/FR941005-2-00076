FR941005-2-00076 FR941005-2-00047 FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training AGENCY: Federal Emergency Management Agency. ACTION: Notice. SUMMARY: FEMA gives notice that the extension period for the Missouri regular crisis counseling program for disaster survivors of the 1993 floods is extended from 90 to 180 days. The severity of the emotional trauma resulting from the floods in Missouri warrants an extension of 180 days. EFFECTIVE DATE: November 16, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Diana Paschke, Human Services Division, Office of Disaster Assistance Programs, Federal Emergency Management Agency, 500 C Street SW., Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646&hyph;4026. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is charged with coordinating Federal disaster assistance under the provisions of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (the Act) when the President has declared a major disaster. FEMA provided funding for a regular crisis counseling program to help those suffering the trauma resulting from the 1993 floods in Missouri. FEMA received a request from the State of Missouri to extend the otherwise applicable time limitations authorized by section 416 of the Act, so that the State can provide additional mental health services that are critically needed for citizens during the recovery operation. The extent of the damages wrought by the floods were of such magnitude that the residents of Missouri suffered significant emotional trauma that warrants continuation of disaster mental health counseling beyond the normal crisis counseling time periods. The Director, Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), as the delegate to FEMA for the Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, helps FEMA implement crisis counseling training and assistance, FEMA believes there was a well-established need for continuation of the regular crisis counseling program beyond a 90-day extension. Based upon the sound CMHS recommendation, FEMA has approved a 180-day extension to the time period for the Missouri regular crisis counseling program.
