On board an anti-submarine ship anchored alongside the fleet's pier No. 33, Kim toured the warship's decks, torpedo launchers and command post, guided by the fleet commander. After the tour, he said it had taken nearly half a century for a South Korean president to overcome the cold war and visit Vladivostok, even though the city is within hailing distance of the Tumen River. "Standing here today, I've come to believe that the half-century tragedy of the Korean peninsula has come to an end," he remarked. Noting that the ship he visited had fought on the allied side in the Persian Gulf war, Kim said South Korea had also joined the allied effort in the war, adding that South Korea and Russia will cooperate closely to ensure world peace and the security of Northeast Asia. "I'd like to share the impression I've got from Russia's efforts at reform and openness with all peace-loving peoples, and I sincerely hope that the day will soon come when the last legacy of the cold war will disappear from the Korean peninsula so that the way to this city will become much shorter and easier for South Koreans," he said. Kim's visit to the Russian fleet bore significance in that it has raised the possibility of South Korean-Russian military cooperation, a ranking official accompanying Kim said. Earlier in Khabarovsk, Kim met with the Khabarovsk provincial governor on the issues of South Korean corporations operating in the Province and the interests and rights of ethnic Koreans. In Vladivostok, he met the maritime province governor. Kim is to leave for Seoul on Tuesday evening.
