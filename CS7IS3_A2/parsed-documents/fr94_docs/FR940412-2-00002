The Asian gypsy moth, which is present in the State of North Carolina, is a destructive pest of plants, especially trees. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), in cooperation with the North Carolina Department of Agriculture (NCDA), has initiated a project to eradicate the Asian gypsy moth in North Carolina. NCDA, with substantial assistance from USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), has prepared an environmental assessment (EA) to evaluate the effects of this eradication project on the environment. Based on the EA and APHIS' own analysis, the Agency has determined that the eradication project in the State of North Carolina will not have a significant impact on the environment. APHIS has reviewed and adopted the EA that was prepared by NCDA with substantial assistance from APHIS. The EA for this cooperative Asian gypsy moth eradication project is supported by and tiered to the Gypsy Moth Suppression and Eradication Projects, Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) as Supplemented, 1985. The environmental assessment, finding of no significant impact, and record of decision have been prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq. ), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality for Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500&hyph;1508), (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381&hyph;50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272&hyph;51274, August 31, 1979).
