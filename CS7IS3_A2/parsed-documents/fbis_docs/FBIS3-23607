Addressing journalists, he said his "prolonged meetings with Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and First Vice Premier Oleg Soskovets," which took place on Wednesday, gave him hope that the military budget would be increased. Let us remind you, on the eve of his visit to Kaliningrad, Pavel Grachev sharply criticized the military budget proposed by the Finance Ministry and regards the allocated funds as insufficient. The defense minister also laid great hopes on the State Duma which, in his opinion, "is not indifferent to the fate of the defense capacity of our state."
