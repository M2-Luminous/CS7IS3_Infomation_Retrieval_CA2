FR940719-0-00018 FR940719-0-00005 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 17 CFR Parts 211, 231, and 241 [Release Nos. 33&hyph;7060; 34&hyph;34061; FR 28A] Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral AGENCY: Securites and Exchange Commission. ACTION: Interpretive release. SUMMARY: This interpretive release amends the interpretive guidance contained in Financial Reporting Release No. 28 (FR 28) that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral. This release conforms the interpretive guidance in FR 28 to the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, ``Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan'' (SFAS 114), which was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in May 1993. EFFECTIVE DATE: May 19, 1994. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: John Riley, Stephen M. Swad, or Jeffery A. Swormstedt (202&hyph;942&hyph;4400), Office of the Chief Accountant, or Teresa E. Iannaconi (202&hyph;272&hyph;2553), Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 5th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral In 1977, The FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 15, ``Accounting by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings'' (SFAS 15), which addressed, among other things, the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral for restructured loans. Paragraph 34 of SFAS 15 required a troubled debt restructuring that is in substance a repossession or foreclosure by the creditor to be accounted for by the creditor by recognizing the fair value of the collateral as an asset, even if that collateral is not formally repossessed. However, SFAS 15 did not identify any criteria to determine when a loan restructuring was considered a substantive repossession of collateral. The Commission found that, under SFAS 15, there was inconsistency in practice concerning the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral. So, in 1986, to ensure more consistent application of substantive repossession accounting, the Commission issued FR 28, which concludes, among other things, that a loan should be accounted for as being an in-substance repossession of collateral if certain criteria are met. 1 These criteria focus on whether the primary risks and rewards of collateral ownership have passed from the debtor to the creditor. 1 The portion of Financial Reporting Release No. 28 that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral is referred to in the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies as ยง401.09.c. In 1993, the FASB issued SFAS 114, which addresses, among other things, the accounting for substantive repossession of collateral. SFAS 114 amends SFAS 15 to clarify that substantive repossession accounting applies in the circumstances in which the debtor surrenders the collateral to the creditor and the creditor receives physical possession of the debtor's assets (the collateral). 2 Consequently, the accounting guidance relating to the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral in FR 28 is not consistent with the account requirements for substantive repossession accounting in SFAS 114. 2 See SFAS 114, paragraphs 22d, 70, and 71. Because SFAS 114 clarifies the accounting literature that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral, the portion of FR 28 that addresses substantive repossession accounting no longer is necessary once a registrant adopts SFAS 114. 3 Accordingly, registrants that have adopted SFAS 114 should not apply the portion of FR 28 that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral. Registrants that have not adopted SFAS 114 should continue to apply all portions of FR 28, including the portion that addresses the accounting for substantive repossessions of collateral. 3 SFAS 114 applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. Earlier application is encouraged. II. Codification Update The ``Codification of Financial Reporting Policies'' announced in Financial Reporting Release No. 1 (April 15, 1982 (47 FR 21028) is updated to: 1. Add a new ยง401.09.c.1, entitled ``Amendment of Interpretation Regarding Substantive Repossession of Collateral,'' consisting of the last two paragraphs of section I of this release. The Codification is a separate publication of the Commission. It will not be published in the Federal Register Code of Federal Regulations System.
