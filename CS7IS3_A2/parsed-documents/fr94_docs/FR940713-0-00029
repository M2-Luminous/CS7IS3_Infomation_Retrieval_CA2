FR940713-0-00029 FR940713-0-00012 ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY 40 CFR Part 180 [PP 8F3607/R2071; FRL&hyph;4900&hyph;3] RIN 2070&hyph;AB78 Pesticide Tolerances for Glufosinate Ammonium AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This document establishes time-limited tolerances for residues of the herbicide glufosinate ammonium [ammonium DL-homoalanine-4-yl-(methyl phosphinate)] and its metabolite, 3-methylphosphinico-propionic acid, in or on raw agricultural commodities (RAC's) apples and grapes at 0.05 part per million (ppm) and tree nuts group (except almonds) at 0.1 ppm. Hoechst Celanese Corp. (now AgrEvo) requested these tolerances in petitions submitted to EPA. EFFECTIVE DATES: This regulation becomes effective July 13, 1994. The tolerances will expire July 13, 1999. ADDRESSES: Written objections, identified by the document control number, [PP 8F3607/R2071], may be submitted to: Hearing Clerk (1900), Environmental Protection Agency, Rm. M3708, 401 M St., SW., Washington, DC 20460. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Joanne I. Miller, Product Manager (PM) 23, (7505C), Registration Division, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M St., Washington, DC 20460.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: In the Federal Register of May 25, 1988 (53 FR 18897), EPA issued a notice announcing that Hoechst Celanese Corp., Route 202-208 North, Sommerville, NJ 08878, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 8F3607) proposing to amend 40 CFR part 180 by establishing a regulation pursuant to section 408 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, to permit the residues of the herbicide monoammonium 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoate (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic acid) and 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid (expressed as 2-amino-4-(hydroxymethylphosphinyl)-butanoic acid), in or on soybean seed, apples, grapes, field corn (grain, forage, silage, and fodder), and nuts at 0.05 ppm and almond hulls at 0.50 ppm. This petition was assigned the number 8F3607. The proposed analytical method for determining residues was high-pressure liquid chromatography. There were no comments of request for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the notice of filing. The petitioner subsequently amended the petition by withdrawing the tolerance proposal for residues of the active ingredient and its metabolite in or on soybean seed, field corn grain, field corn forage, field corn silage, and field corn fodder. Since this revision decreases the pesticide burden on the environment, it was not published for comment. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. The toxicology data listed below were considered in support of these tolerances. 1. A battery of acute toxicity studies placing technical glufosinate-ammonium in Toxicity Categories II and III. 2. A 90-day feeding study in rats at dietary intakes of 0, 0.52, 4.1, 32, or 263 mg/kg/day with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 4.1 mg/kg/day. The lowest-observed-effect level (LOEL) was established at 32 mg/kg/day based on increased absolute and relative kidney weights. 3. A 90-day feeding study in mice at dietary intakes of 0, 16.6, 67.1, or 278 mg/kg/day with a NOEL of 16.6 mg/kg/day and a LOEL of 67.1 mg/kg/day based on increased absolute and relative liver weights (both sexes) and an increase in serum potassium levels (males). 4. Three teratology studies in rats at doses from 0.5 to 250 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and including 250 mg/kg/day. A NOEL for developmental toxicity was 2.24 mg/kg/day, based upon an increase in the incidence of dilated renal pelvis with hydroureter in the fetuses at 10 mg/kg/day. The maternal NOEL was also 2.24 mg/kg/day. 5. A teratology study in rabbits at doses of 0, 2, 6.3, or 20 mg/kg/day with no teratogenic effects occurring up to and including 20 mg/kg/day, and a maternal NOEL of 6.3 mg/kg/day and a developmental NOEL of 20 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. 6. A two-generation reproduction study in rats at dietary concentrations of 0, 40, 120, or 360 ppm with a NOEL for reproductive effects at 120 ppm (equivalent to 12 mg/kg/day) based upon reduced number of pups in the high dose group. The NOEL for parental toxicity was also 120 ppm based upon increased kidney weights in the high-dose group. 7. A 12-month feeding study in dogs at doses of 0, 2, 5, or 8.5 mg/kg/day. The NOEL was 5.0 mg/kg/day based upon the death of one male and one female dog at 8.5 mg/kg/day with no other treatment-related toxicity. 8. A mouse carcinogenicity study at doses of 0, 2.8, 10.8, or 22.7 mg/kg/day in males and 0, 4.2, 16.2, or 64.0 mg/kg/day in females for 104 weeks with no carcinogenic effects observed under the conditions of the study up to and including 64 mg/kg/day and a systemic NOEL of 10.8 and 16.2 for males and females, respectively, based on the dose-related increase in mortality. 9. A chronic feeding/carcinogenicity study in rats at dietary doses of 0, 2.5, 8.8, or 31.5 mg/kg/day (males) and 0, 2.4, 8.2, or 28.7 mg/kg/day (females) with a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day for systemic effects based on an increase in mortality rate in females at the two higher doses. There were no treatment-related carcinogenic effects at any dose level. 10. Acceptable studies on gene mutation (Salmonella, E. coli, and mouse lymphoma assays), structural chromosomal aberration ( in vivo micronucleus assay in mice), and other genotoxic effects (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay with rat hepatocytes) yielded negative results. 11. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies which indicated that approximately 80 to 90 percent of the orally administered dose of glufosinate ammonium remained unabsorbed and was eliminated in the feces. Approximately 10 to 15 percent was eliminated in the urine. The major metabolic pathway is oxidative deamination yielding the metabolite, 3-methyl-phospinico propionic acid. The chronic analysis used a Reference Dose (RfD) of 0.02 mg/kg body weight/day, based on a NOEL of 2.1 mg/kg/day and an uncertainty factor of 100. The NOEL is based on a 2-year rat feeding study that demonstrated increased absolute and relative kidney weight in males as an endpoint effect. Using tolerance-level residues and assumptions that 100 percent of every crop for which glufosinate-ammonium has a proposed use is treated, the total Theoretical Maximum Residue Contribution (TMRC) for the general population and the highest exposed subgroup in DRES are as follows (as percents of RFD): General population, 0.3 percent; nonnursing infants less than 1 year old, 2.1 percent. A data gap currently exists for a rat carcinogenicity study. The tolerances will be time-limited because of this gap. The time limitation allows for development and review of the data. The analysis for glufosinate-ammonium using tolerance level residues suggests that the proposed uses on apples, grapes, and nuts (excluding almonds) will not cause exposure to exceed the levels at which the Agency believes there is an appreciable risk. All DRES subgroups are below 100 of the RfD for chronic effects. The pesticide is useful for the purposes for which these tolerances are sought. The nature of the residue is adequately understood for the purpose of establishing these tolerances. Adequate analytical methodology (gas chromatography with flame photometric detection of phosphorus) is available for enforcement purposes. Because of the long lead time from establishing these tolerances to publication, the enforcement methodology is being made available in the interim to anyone interested in pesticide enforcement when requested by mail from: Calvin Furlow, Public Response Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of Pesticide Programs.

There are currently no actions pending against the registration of this chemical. There is no reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in meat, fat, and meat byproducts of cattle, goats, hogs, horses, sheep, or poultry, nor is there any reasonable expectation that secondary residues will occur in eggs or milk. Based on the information cited above, the Agency has determined that the establishment of the tolerances by amending 40 CFR part 180 will protect the public health; therefore, the tolerances are established as set forth below. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the Federal Register , file written objections with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above. 40 CFR 178.20. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections. 40 CFR 178.25. Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on each such issue, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector. 40 CFR 178.27. A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue (s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested. 40 CFR 1798.32 The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerance or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the Federal Register of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).
