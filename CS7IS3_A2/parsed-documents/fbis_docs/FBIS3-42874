The president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan are at one in their understanding that the democratic transformations and economic reform being undertaken in Russia are of extraordinary importance not only for the peoples of this country but also for the world as a whole and that the success of Russia's transition to a genuinely market economy and the smooth integration of the Russian Federation in the world democratic community are, what is more, in the sides' opinion, an inalienable factor of a strengthening of international stability and the irreversibility of the process of the formation of a new world order. In this connection the prime minister of Japan conveyed to the president of the Russian Federation the following message of the leaders of the Seven. "We regret that as a result of the armed clashes in Moscow provoked by supporters of the former parliament, there were numerous human casualties, but at the same time we welcome the fact that the situation is returning to normal and that legality and order, including respect for human rights, are being restored. "We confirm once again that support for the policy of democratic and economic reforms pursued by President B.N. Yeltsin remains invariable and express great hope that as a result of elections to a new parliament, free and fair and with broad public participation, a genuinely democratic society which reflects the will of the people will be born and that the reforms will be continued." 2. Of a common opinion on the need to surmount in bilateral relations the grim legacy of the past, the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan conducted serious negotiations on the question of the ownership of the islands of Iturup, Kunashir, Shikotan, and Habomai. The parties agree that it is necessary to continue the negotiations for the speediest conclusion of a peace treaty by way of a solution of the said question, proceeding from historical and legal facts and on the basis of documents formulated in accordance with an agreement between the two countries and also the principles of legality and justice, and in this way to fully normalize bilateral relations. In this connection the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Japan confirm that the Russian Federation is the state-continuer of the USSR and that all treaties and other international accords between the Soviet Union and Japan continue to apply in relations between the Russian Federation and Japan. The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Japan note also that there has thus far been a constructive dialogue within the framework of the working group on a peace treaty between the two countries and that a result thereof was the joint publication by the Russian and Japanese sides in September 1992 of the "Joint Digest of Documents on the History of the Territorial Demarcation Between Russia and Japan." The Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Japan agree to take a number of steps for a deepening of mutual understanding, primarily in the plane of a further improvement in reciprocal trips of the permanent residents of the above-mentioned islands and inhabitants of Japan made within the framework of the procedure established on the basis of an agreement between the two parties. 3. Certain that a broadening of the political dialogue is a useful and efficient means of the development of Russian-Japanese relations, the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan agree to continue, intensify, and develop political dialogue by way of regular reciprocal visits at top leader and foreign minister and also deputy foreign minister level. 4. Welcoming the results achieved thus far in the sphere of arms control and disarmament, and confirming the need for their conscientious fulfillment, the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan are united in their understanding of the importance of the further advancement of this process and of its being made irreversible. Having a common understanding of the importance for security throughout the world of the question of the dismantling of nuclear weapons and of the problem of the storage of the nuclear materials and control over them and their processing which arises in this connection, the parties confirm their desire to cooperate in the said fields. Confirming also that the discharge of radioactive waste into the sea is causing serious concern globally, particularly from the viewpoint of its effect on the environment in adjacent states, the parties agree for further consideration of this problem to hold close consultations along the lines of the joint Russian-Japanese working group. The parties welcome the signing in January 1993 in Paris of the Convention Banning Chemical Weapons and express the hope that as many states as possible will subscribe to this convention and that it will contribute to peace and stability worldwide. The parties agree also to cooperate closely with each other for the effective nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems and also the material, equipment, technology, and knowhow associated with them and to enhance the transparency of conventional arms supplies. 5. The president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan are of a common opinion concerning possibilities for dynamic development that could be demonstrated by the Asia-Pacific region in the world of the 21st century on the basis of the common principles of freedom and openness. The parties confirm the significance of the fact that the Russian Federation will by way of the implementation of the principles of legality and justice become an active and constructive partner in this region and will make a further contribution to the development of political and economic relations between the states located therein and are also agreed that considerable importance for the accomplishment of this task is attached to the full normalization of relations between the Russian Federation and Japan, which perform an important role in this region, in the sense that it would make it possible to make this region a zone of peace and stability and also an area of the development of economic cooperation based on a system of free trade open to all countries and regions, the Russian Federation included. Proceeding from a common understanding of the need for a strengthening of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, the president of the Russian Federation and the prime minister of Japan confirm the importance of dialogue between government bodies of two countries on a wide range of issues, including aspects of security, and agree to continue to stimulate such exchanges of opinion. 6. Taking account of the debate under way at the United Nations, including that on the issue of what the organization's functions and structure should be in order that it might, adapting to the changing international situation, perform a central role in maintaining and creating peace throughout the world, the president of the Russian Federation and prime minister of Japan agree to step up the contribution of both countries to the efforts of the United Nations aimed at a settlement of global and regional problems and thereby to make joint efforts for the further enhancement of the authority of the organization. 13 October 1993, Tokyo [Signed] The president of the Russian Federation [Signed] The prime minister of Japan.
