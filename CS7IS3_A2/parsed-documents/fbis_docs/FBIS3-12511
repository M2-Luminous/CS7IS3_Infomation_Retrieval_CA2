In an article published today noting the commission's refutation, in a recent statement, of allegations regarding Iraq's alleged use of chemical weapons in the marshlands, the paper adds: The statement issued by the UN Special Commission has shown the enormous misrepresentation of facts and malice that characterizes Van der Stoehl's statements and reports, which are full of falsehoods. This statement by the UN Special Commission has also revealed Stoehl's unjustifiable zeal. The paper underscores the soundness of the clear and frank Iraqi position, which is designed to promote the welfare of the Iraqi people, protect them, and boost their quest for development, which is a fact acknowledged by friends and enemies alike. The paper notes the lies promoted by Tehran and other covetous, hostile, and rancorous parties, which are unhappy with the steadfastness of the Iraqi people, saying: This is not the first lie, nor will it be the last. The UN Special Commission must examine the flood of previous lies, the truth and objectives of which have been exposed, and pronounce them as lies too. AL-THAWRAH says: The allegations and fabrications made from time to time by some regional powers and some aggression states is a big unresolved hurdle that has been instrumental in preventing the UN Security Council from honoring its commitments. Meanwhile, Iraq has underlined its commitment by implementing UN Security Council Resolution 687. The paper concludes by saying that to do Iraq justice, the impartial statements made must be translated into positive acts and deeds to remove the injustice and wrong done to it.
