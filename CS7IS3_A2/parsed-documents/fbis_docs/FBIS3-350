France "requested us to send observers and the Nigerian Armed Forces decided to send them at the weekend", defence spokesman General Fred Chijuka told AFP. The military authorities expect a report from the Nigerian observer team sent to witness to military manoeuvres, he added. Nigeria, he said, must have been requested to send observers to clear any lingering doubts about the aim of the military exercise, especially since France has been accused by Abuja of allying with Yaounde over a current border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon. The tension between the two countries generated as a result of a dispute over the ownership of Bakassi peninsula has abated and Nigerian military authorities believe that the military manoeuvres might have been planned before now, said Chijuka. [passage omitted] The fact that the military manoeuvres were to start at this moment of conflict between Yaounde and Abuja might be a "coincidence", he said. Sunday, press reports here quoted Nigerian officials as being suspicious of the military exercise, describing it as "a show of might" at the moment of crisis. "When they return, our people should be able to tell us" the exact situation of things, Chijuka said. In another development, the military administrator of one of the states bordering the disputed territory has said Nigeria was making plans to solve refugee problems that may crop up as a result of the conflict. The military administrator of Akwa Ibom state, Colonel Yakubu Bako, said that necessary logistics have been put in place in the state to tackle refugee problem, the official NAN reported late Sunday. "We are expecting that problem, we have worked out the logistics and submitted it to the Nigeria federal government", Bako told journalists. Although the state was not having refugee problems at the moment, Bako said he has initiated moves to hold talks with his colleagues in Abia and Cross River, two states neighbouring on Akwa Ibom over the matter. The independent CONCORD newspaper reported Sunday that an average of 300 displaced Nigerians fleeing Cameroon arrive daily in Ikang, a border village in Cross River State. The newspaper report has not been officially confirmed.
