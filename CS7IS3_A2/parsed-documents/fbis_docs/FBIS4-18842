The air strikes had been ordered after the Serbs resumed shelling of the town, hitting the hospital and a building where UN military observers were housed, the UN staffer in the operations room said, asking not to be named. UN Protection Force spokesman Captain Eric Chaperon dismissed the report as untrue, but sources close to NATO said planes had taken off and were flying low over Gorazde.
